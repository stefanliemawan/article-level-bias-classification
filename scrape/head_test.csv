It has already been detected in every state, and government officials believe it will become the main source of American infections within weeks.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.Although cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where a significant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can put specific, hard-to-reach populations at risk.The impact could be particularly severe for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged, since they have generally been more likely to develop complications, sometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smith said that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregate sex and gender or account for nonbinary people.The only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per aseparate CDC analysis.You have been subscribed!Please complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected].White people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC data shows. That has been a concern for months, especially since Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital.The introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smith said.“There’s more work to do,” she said. “The dynamics of COVID-19 are local. And so it really comes down to the dynamics of one’s community. How many people in one’s community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localized surges.”Efforts to vaccinate more Americans have lagged since spring. Though President Joe Biden initially set a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably — touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced — but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities.Nunez-Smith would not say whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, but she did suggest that more local areas  — especially places with low vaccination rates or new surges of COVID-19 — could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That’s in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Currently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County’s health department put out a strong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.“It’s really up to locals and states around mask requirements,” Nunez-Smith said. “But I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.”All evidence suggests that people with two shots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not develop severe illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant.But if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated — in the United States or abroad — the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed byBloomberg News.ShareDonate TodayThe 19thThe 19th is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

Researchers analyzed the data to track cases of suicidality — suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm — within a year either before or after giving birth.From 2006 to 2017, suicidality diagnoses increased from .2 percent per 100 people to .6 percentper 100. In the same period, cases of deliberate self-harm went up from .1 percent per 100 in 2006 to .2 percent per 100 in 2017. When applied to the approximately 4 million births that take place each year, that means an increase in tens of thousands of suicidal cases and intentional self-harm.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.“Suicidality is something we don’t think about or talk about as much, and it’s a lot more common than I had realized,” said Kara Zivin, a professor at the University of Michigan and the paper’s senior author.Zivin pursued the research based on her own experience — 10 years ago, after giving birth to her son, her postpartum depression made her suicidal. Now, she said, she wants to shine light on an under-discussed topic in public health that has profound consequences.Already, the United States’ rate of pregnancy-related deaths is higher than any other wealthy nation. And suicide is a major concern. According to a 2017 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it accounted for about 6.5 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths.“I was certainly aware of the risks of things like postpartum depression. I never expected the level of illness I had,” Zivin said. “I don’t fully understand it, still.”It’s not clear what is behind the trend, though the researchers argued that it’s likely a combination of doctors more often catching cases of suicidality — which is typically under-diagnosed — and the problem itself growing more common. But it’s hard to know what is driving the increase.Zivin said the study makes a strong case for policy interventions that ensure people can access mental health care during and after pregnancy. For instance, people who have Medicaid as their insurance when pregnant will lose that eligibility after 60 days post-birth in most states — even though suicide a year after giving birth is still considered pregnancy-related. That’s something states or the federal government could address, she said, by extending Medicaid to guarantee insurance for a year postpartum, and making sure people can see mental health specialists.The study found that Black people experienced the largest increase in perinatal suicidality of any single racial group — increasing from .2 percent per 100 in 2006 to .9 percent in 2017. In some ways, that reflects a bigger reality: The nation’s pregnancy-related death rate is far higher for Black people than for White people.That’s still likely an undercount of the gap, said Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and director of its rural health research center. Black women are disproportionately covered through Medicaid, not private insurance. (Kozhimannil was not involved in the study.)The study authors said it’s not clear why Black people experienced such a dramatic increase in diagnoses. But experiences of racism have been linked to physical stress and mental illness symptoms, Kozhimannil noted. And big picture, she added, the data emphasizes why health policy-makers need to emphasize the impact of systemic racism when crafting pregnancy-related health interventions.“It’s not about race, it’s about racism,” she said. “Thinking about it in that way would point to the common root, and might get us in policy discussions further toward valuing the health of Black people in pregnancy.”The authors believe that the paper is even more pressing now. If pregnancy-related suicide was already a problem, experts say it’s one that is likely to only grow, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added new strains to perinatal mental health.As the pandemic worsens this winter, experts are sounding the alarm about a potential spike in suicides. That’s especially a concern for people who have access to firearms, Kozhimannil said; the vast majority of gun deaths each year are suicides, and people who attempt suicide with a gun are more likely to suicide. And right now, more women arebuying firearmsfor the first time.“This is more important than ever in the COVID-19 era,” said Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan and the study’s lead author. “The postpartum isolation people feel will have been compounded by this epidemic.”It’s likely that the study data underestimates the extent of the problem.The study looks only at people with private insurance, who tend to be wealthier. It does not include the almost half of all American births that are insured through Medicaid, which covers lower-income people. People on Medicaid are already more likely to experience the kinds of external stressors that can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety, and more likely not to have a doctor diagnose or help them access treatment.The study also only tracked official diagnoses, even though self-harm and suicidal thought are typically underreported and under-diagnosed.“It shows a big problem and probably undercounts the magnitude of the problem, and the magnitude of the potential disparity,” Kozhimannil said.If you or a loved one are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 74174.ShareDonate TodayThe 19thThe 19th is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

But it’s still unclear if or when that relief would extend to pregnant people, who have been excluded from those vaccine trials.Pfizer and Moderna, which are developing two high-profile vaccine candidates, have posted initial data from their large late-stage trials that suggests their products could be close to 90 or 95 percent effective in reducing risk of COVID-19 infection. Moderna’s data also suggests its vaccine would reduce the risk of severe illness caused by the coronavirus.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.Both companies have indicated they will seek a federal emergency-use authorization, in which the government makes the drug available before having approved it, based on the strength of early results. That means vaccines could be available to the general public by next spring.But since the vaccine trials have thus far excluded people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, it’s unclear when the immunizations would be safely available for them.The exclusion has sparked concern from health experts, especially since research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasmade it clearthat pregnancy significantly increases COVID-19’s mortality risk. Pregnant people are also more likely to develop complications and require intensive medical care, including requiring a ventilator.You have been subscribed!Please complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

It is also currently doing early research — not yet conducting trials in humans — to see how the vaccine works in pregnancy, Pitts said.Moderna has not specified its plans to research the vaccine in pregnant people. The company did not respond to The 19th’s requests for comment.The federal Food & Drug Administration, which will determine whether either vaccine candidate gets an emergency authorization, could approve the vaccine for all healthy adults — which would then allow health authorities like the CDC to determine whether pregnant people should be eligible to get the immunization or if they will have to wait until one is specifically tested for them. The FDA could also approve a vaccine for healthy adults but specifically advise against giving it to pregnant people, at least temporarily.Experts arestill debatingwhen vaccines should in general be tested on those who are pregnant. Historically, major vaccines have not been tested during pregnancy, because of concerns that both the pregnant person and fetus would be at risk for complications. But that thinking has shifted in recent years — particularly in light of the Ebola crisis, when, similarly to COVID-19, vaccines were not initially tested for pregnant people even though they were at severely heightened risk of mortality.Some researchers, following conventional wisdom, say later is better, when vaccines have been proven to be safe in pregnancy. But many others note that delaying when to include pregnant people in trials, as Moderna and Pfizer have done, will put them at risk.“We need data collected in a systematic way to guide pregnant women and their health care providers regarding whether they should get a COVID-19 vaccine,” said Sonja Rasmussen, a 20-year CDC veteran and professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Florida.Excluding those who are pregnant, she added, means much of the vaccines’ risks and benefits are still a question mark.“Many questions need to be answered,” she said. “Is the vaccine effective during pregnancy? Is a different dose needed during pregnancy? Is the vaccine safe for the pregnant woman and her fetus? Will the vaccine provide some degree of protection to the newborn infant?”The FDA typically recommends pregnant people be included in late-stage trials. In itsCOVID-19recommendations, the FDA advised companies to at least consider including those who are pregnant in vaccine trials, and in July, National Institutes of Health Director Frances Collins said inclusion of pregnant people in vaccine trials was “a top priority.”Some Democratic lawmakers have also called on major vaccine companies to include pregnant people in their trials or otherwise ensure immunizations are available to them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Lauren Underwoodintroduced legislationto this effect in August.Women of childbearing age are also disproportionately represented amongst frontline worker groups, including health care professionals and teachers — the very people who experts say need to receive the vaccine first.“A significant number of health workers are women. Within that there are always, at any given time, a substantial number who are pregnant,” said Ruth Faden, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on immunizations for pregnant people. “What’s the right ethics stance towards a pregnant health worker?”Without good data, it’s difficult to know what the implications are for giving pregnant people either vaccine. But the mechanism underlying both vaccines — a new messenger RNA technology that helps the body develop antibodies to fight the coronavirus — has not been shown to cause harm during pregnancy, Lyerly said.This gives her “reason for optimism” that even without being tested on pregnant people, the vaccine could be used to protect them, she said.“The heightened awareness of the needs to protect pregnant women is a relatively recent phenomenon,” she said. “A focus on the needs to protect them through vaccination — not just from the risks of an intervention like a vaccine — that’s an important shift.”ShareDonate TodayThe 19thThe 19th is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

Barbara Lee talks about Kamala Harris’ Senate seat and House leadership in 2021.Errin HainesEditor-at-largePublishedShareWe’re the only newsroom dedicated to writing about gender, politics and policy.Subscribe to our newsletter today.California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee is among the names being considered to replace Sen. Kamala Harris as she heads to the White House to serve as the first woman vice president of the United States.Lee, currently in her 12th term in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the highest-ranking Black woman in Congress as co-chair of the steering and policy committee — a position she was appointed to by Speaker Nancy Pelosi after narrowly losing her bid for Democratic Caucus Chair. Lee got her start in politics as a college student who volunteered to work on Shirley Chisholm’s pioneering campaign for president in 1972.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will fill Harris’ vacancy. The 19th’s editor-at-large, Errin Haines, spoke to Lee on Saturday about her future and what’s next for Black women in political leadership after a year that saw record turnout, organizing and candidacies for public office for the vanguard constituency of the Democratic Party.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.You are somebody who is certainly in the conversation right now, so I want to talk to you about that and the future of Black women’s political power now, and people coming around to the reality that they should be following Black women’s leadership.I got involved in politics through the presidential campaign of the first African American woman … We have thought, we’ve dreamed about this moment, but we’ve also worked for it.I know this is a year in which we’ve seen the importance of representation in our politics. Kamala Harris launched her own campaign last year in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm. Talk a little bit about the importance of more women — and Black women, in particular — running for elected office, something I know Chisholm talked about. What do you think about where we are in this moment and where we should be going from here?I was there when [Harris] kicked off her campaign, and I was so honored to co-chair her California presidential campaign. So for me personally, this is just a remarkable moment. And what it says, I think, is, finally! Black women have been smart, we’ve been strategic, we’ve helped elect so many candidates to public office, and we’ve always brought other Black women and other women of color with us. And so this is such a historic occasion for Black women and women of color. But it also says that more women will be able to break through and it will be a heck of a lot easier [to do so].You have been subscribed!Please complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

Please email[email protected]to subscribe.This email address might not be capable of receiving emails (according toBouncer). You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected].Sticking with the theme of representation matters: Kamala Harris breaking that barrier in California, to become the state’s first Black senator, first Black woman senator, and now she’s the only Black woman currently serving in the U.S. Senate. What has that representation meant?With Sen. Harris in the Senate — I’ve worked with her on a variety of issues such as, for instance, the Hyde Amendment — it’s about racial justice for Black women of color, low-income women as it relates to reproductive justice. She understands why this policy has been so destructive and discriminatory against women of color and low-income women.[Like] when you look at marijuana justice, when you look at the numbers of Black and brown people who have been incarcerated and have these drug charges, which have just stopped them, and been a barrier to moving forward with their lives.So representation, it really does matter, because the lens by which you look at policies are lenses that others don’t have. And that’s because of who we are, our experiences and the pathways that we have had to walk and run to get to where we are. And so, you know, there’s a void when there are not the perspectives and the input and the leadership of Black women.Yeah, absolutely. And so obviously, when [Harris] vacates that seat, there will be a void. I know you have a relationship with her. Have you spoken to the vice president-elect about when she might be vacating that seat?Oh, no, no, no. It’s probably still too early. I don’t know, I have no idea. And I haven’t even seen any press reports. I mean, I’ve heard from her, but not about that.Has she even given you any indication of who she might like to see as her successor?No.Other people have already told me they want to see you as her successor. So, I have to ask you, is a job that you are interested in?Well, there’s several African American women who would meet the test and who would be phenomenal in the Senate. I would be honored. Because you know, public service for Black women is not just about being elected; that’s another platform and framework for public service. The governor will make his decision. We will respect his decision, because he has to determine who he thinks best will serve California, he has to take into all of his considerations, and come up with his conclusion as to who he thinks would best fill that void and who would be able to work with him as we move forward on our California agenda. So it’s up to him, quite frankly, but I know that there are several African American women on the list who are fully prepared and could serve.If it’s not you, do you still think that whoever the next senator of California is should be a Black woman? I know, there’s been some conversation about making history with say, the first Latino to represent California…The void that Senator Harris would leave as an African American woman is a huge void. Not speaking to any other issue or making this about beating up anyone else. It’s about the void and the fact that since the first Senate session, I believe, African American women have had a total of about 10 years with Sen. Carol Moseley Braun. So 10 years out of hundreds of years. And so this void and this gap would be tremendous. I believe that the governor will take that into consideration.I know that you have a relationship with President Elect Biden. And so I’m just wondering what you’ve also if you’ve had a chance to speak with him, and what you’ve told him about the Black women that you’d like to see help him govern.In the House and throughout the country, in the state legislatures, there are some brilliant and phenomenal African American women who could serve as cabinet officials. How many women do we have in the Congressional Black Caucus? All of us could serve in the cabinet. I know one consideration, of course, is making sure that the seats do not go, if they were vacated, to Republicans, but for the most part, most of the seats are strong Democratic seats. And so I think this provides a real opportunity for African American women in the House of Representatives to serve in a variety of positions.My good friend of many years, [Ohio Democratic] Congresswoman Marcia Fudge for secretary of agriculture. I work with her — I’m on the appropriations committee, and I’m on the subcommittee on agriculture — and so I’ve had the privilege to not only work with Marcia as a colleague, but she’s a good friend. There’s nobody who knows ag issues like Congresswoman Fudge and I think she would be phenomenal as a secretary of ag, and I’m certain that her district would elect another Democrat to that seat.Sticking with the House for a minute: Who are the other Black women that you would like to see in elected House leadership?I think that it’s time. I think that those of us who run in the past, we’ve shattered some of those glass ceilings. And we’ve broken some of those barriers, even though we may not have won the election. I think that now, more members see that the capacity, capabilities, the value and the strategic positioning and how Black women really do have the ability to help unite the caucus and bring [it] together. And so, yes, several are running. And, you know, I’m hoping that they win and I’m going to help.If you are not headed to the Senate or headed to the cabinet, you were discussed for Speaker of the House after the historic 2018 midterms. I know how much respect you have, among your colleagues, and especially some of the younger women of color that you have mentored. Are you considering running this time? And is it time for a Black woman to hold that gavel?I don’t think anyone could do what Speaker Pelosi has done in keeping this caucus together and winning elections. And I fully support her. When you look at Speaker Pelosi’s history and record, she’s probably been the greatest speaker ever because she’s had the most diverse caucus. And she has had the ability to raise money to make sure we elect more Democrats. She has supported women of color to assume committee chairs and vice chairs of committees. And so I think that, you know, I mean, I know she’s gonna be reelected, and I’m working to make sure that she is reelected as our speaker.On her historic speakership: What do you think that has done to help this country’s political imagination around women in power?It has shown that women lead and women lead on each and every issue, not only issues perceived as women’s issues, but every issue. And I think it’s also shown that especially with Speaker Pelosi, that racial equity matters. And that racial inclusion in the House of Representatives is an asset. And that we are able, and she has seen, especially with African American women and women of color in the House, how we work and how our legislative efforts really move forward, because we work with everyone, because we know that what’s good for women, and for our communities, as women of color for low-income communities.I mean, she appointed me to chair the majority leader’s task force on poverty and opportunity, for example. She always talks about how she came to Congress—because one in five children live below the poverty line. Her keen understanding of those issues, that poverty not only affects women, it affects families, it affects children, it affects everyone across the board. African Americans have the highest percentage, but this is low-income, working families, poor, White families.Speaker Pelosi has been able to see the issues that I want to champion, such as lifting people out of poverty … On COVID, I negotiated this in the HEROES bill targeting resources for Black and brown communities to deal with contact tracing and testing and follow up isolation and health care. She understood this, and we worked together to negotiate that. Her impact is broad and deep. And as a Black woman, I’ve been able to really help, not only my community, but all across the country on so many issues, because she understood it, and she got it.And now we’re going to have one of us as vice president in the White House. This has taken a lot of blood, sweat and tears, a lot of work. And a lot of hope that we never lost sight of what we were working for and toward and, you know, this is just a major milestone for everybody.ShareDonate TodayThe 19thThe 19th is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.

She spent time with the Chicago White Sox, the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the MLB commissioner’s office. She has also been part of eight postseason appearances and six League Championship Series and three World Series Championship wins.“My goal is now to bring championship baseball to Miami,” Ng said. “I am both humbled and eager to continue building the winning culture our fans expect and deserve.”The move also means that two of the most powerful officials for the Marlins are women (Caroline O’Connorbecame the team’s chief operating officer last year).In 1998, when Ng was an assistant GM with the Yankees,she told the Chicago Tribunethat she was treated with “kid gloves.”“People used to apologize for swearing in front of me — until they realized I probably swear more than them,” she said at the time.You have been subscribed!Please complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed.

This year, MLB earned a C for gender hiring, though the percentage of women hired rose about 3 percent when compared with last year, according to theannual report cardissued by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports (TIDES).Facing gender discrimination, a group of women who work full time in the fieldstarted a private group chatlast year to build a community, celebrate promotions and provide support.There does, however, appear to be progress as the MLBworks to hire more womenand people of color at all levels of the sport.In 2016, the MLB hired Renée Tirado to be chief diversity and inclusion officer. Tirado, who left the post in 2019, was the league’s first female chief officer andadvocated for womenin the industry.At the start of the 2020 season, there were 21 women who had on-field coaching or player development roles, a significant increase from only seven in 2018 and three in 2017, according to the TIDES report card. Alyssa Nakken of the San Francisco Giants was hired early this year as thefirst on-field female coachwith a major league team.Justine Siegal, the first woman to coach for an MLB team, said it was wonderful to see a woman finally make it to the highest position of a team.“It shouldn’t have taken this long, but sometimes you just have to keep fighting longer for change to come,” Siegal said.Siegal said that baseball is a traditional sport and has discriminated against women, but the tide seems to be changing. After being repeatedly told that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball, Siegal foundedBaseball for All, a nonprofit organization that works to build gender equity in baseball.It shouldn’t have taken this long, but sometimes you just have to keep fighting longer for change to come.“I think the first challenge is that girls are not given opportunities to play baseball,” Siegal said. “The more girls who play baseball, the more girls will want to work and be qualified to take on these baseball operation jobs.”In the MLB central office, women make up more than 40 percent of all professional staff. This is about a 10 percent increase from 2018 and the highest percentage recorded since 2007, according to the institute.Leslie Heaphy, an associate history professor at Kent State University and the co-chair of theWomen in Baseball Research Committee, said that this recent move shows current and future generations that women can be found in every position within baseball, which has lagged behind other sports when it comes to gender equity, she added.Baseball became known as “America’s favorite pastime,” which in the 19th century implied White and male, Heaphy said.“Baseball has a longer history than basketball and football and has been attached to that image of masculinity,” Heaphy said. “I think that long tradition symbolizes what a lot of people’s vision of America has been.”It’s been hard for women to break that streak, but Heaphy said Ng’s rise in the industry gives her hope that MLB will continue to move forward.ShareDonate TodayThe 19thThe 19th is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.
