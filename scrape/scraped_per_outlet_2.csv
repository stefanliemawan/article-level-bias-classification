"COVID Delta variant puts men, people of color at risk, Biden official warns",-1.0,48.0,https://19thnews.org/2021/07/the-covid-delta-variant-puts-men-and-people-of-color-at-risk-biden-official-warns/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"The highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 — on track to become the dominant strain in the United States — could exacerbate stark race and gender-based coronavirus disparities, undercutting the possibility of a nationwide return to normal, a top adviser to the president told The 19th.“I’m worried about Delta, and I’m worried about Delta especially for people who aren’t vaccinated, and for communities where the uptake of vaccination has been low,” said Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who chairs the White House’s COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force.The Delta variant, which was first seen in India and is already the dominant coronavirus strain in many other countries, is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and can potentially result in more serious infections. It has already been detected in every state, and government officials believe it will become the main source of American infections within weeks.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.Although cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where a significant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can put specific, hard-to-reach populations at risk.The impact could be particularly severe for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged, since they have generally been more likely to develop complications, sometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smith said that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregate sex and gender or account for nonbinary people.The only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per aseparate CDC analysis.Please complete the following CAPTCHA to be confirmed. If you have any difficulty, contact[email protected]for help.White people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC data shows. That has been a concern for months, especially since Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital.The introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smith said.“There’s more work to do,” she said. “The dynamics of COVID-19 are local. And so it really comes down to the dynamics of one’s community. How many people in one’s community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localized surges.”Efforts to vaccinate more Americans have lagged since spring. Though President Joe Biden initially set a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably — touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced — but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities.Nunez-Smith would not say whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, but she did suggest that more local areas  — especially places with low vaccination rates or new surges of COVID-19 — could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That’s in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Currently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County’s health department put out a strong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.“It’s really up to locals and states around mask requirements,” Nunez-Smith said. “But I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.”All evidence suggests that people with two shots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not develop severe illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant.But if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated — in the United States or abroad — the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed byBloomberg News."
The Lies Tearing America Apart,13.33,30.67,https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2021/01/13/the-lies-tearing-america-apart-n2583038,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-13,25,"Last week, the Capitol was breached by a group of fringe Trump supporters who had bought into a series of lies: the lie that President Donald Trump lost the election due to proven voter fraud and irregularity; the lie that the Electoral College results, legally certified state by state, could be overturned by Congress or the vice president; the lie that Trump would remain in office if only some sort of armed rebellion were to prevent the election certification by Congress. Those were lies. And those lies had deadly consequences.Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans don't believe those lies. Which means we should be able to unify around certain basic truths: that Joe Biden is legally president-elect of the United States; that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and those who participate in it should be punished to the full extent of the law; that broad claims regarding invasion of rights ought to be backed by compelling evidence.But we won't.That's because while the Democratic Party and the political left agree that Joe Biden is president-elect, they absolutely disagree with both the fundamental precept that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and the even more fundamental precept that claims require evidence. We saw that this summer when Democratic Party officials made light of riots spreading across the nation in the name of yet another lie -- the lie that America is systemically racist, rooted in slavery and Jim Crow, and replete with bigoted police dedicated to endangering black lives. Democrats demanded no evidence to support those claims; in knee-jerk fashion, they simply repeated ad nauseam untruths about the existential threat to black Americans in the United States. Which means that for the Democrats and the political left, violence is fine so long as it supports their narrative, and un-evidenced claims are fine so long as they support an agenda.In order to defend such violence, the political left has mobilized behind another convenient and advantageous lie: the lie that the Capitol riots represent all conservatives and Republicans. Paul Krugman of The New York Times suggested that the ""putsch was decades in the making,"" chalking up the rioting to ""Republican elites"" since before Ronald Reagan. The Washington Post amplified a nutty post from the chairman of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada into a referendum on a ""long-festering struggle within the Republican Party over conspiracy theories, purity tests and fealty to the rule of law."" Members of the media gleefully hunted for Republicans to blame for the Capitol riots, calling for the deplatforming of brand-name conservatives and cheering on social media crackdowns.Lies are dangerous. And double standards are perhaps the most dangerous form of lying: They grant the bravery of purity to those most willing to defy decency, prompting similar spasms of cruelty and malice from the other side. The solution to our national crisis of conscience isn't bad-faith political purges or repetition of tiresome falsehoods about the nature of the United States. It's truth.But truth is more a shield than a sword. And we are now in the age of swords, wielded aggressively by those with little principle but an unending sense of their own moral superiority.Ben Shapiro, 36, is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, host of ""The Ben Shapiro Show"" and editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com.

Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki shuts down ANOTHER Fox News reporter,7.67,32.67,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9242545/Bidens-press-secretary-Jen-Psaki-shuts-Fox-News-reporter.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-09,25,
Don’t Blame Trump for Afghanistan’s Collapse. Blame Barack Obama.,10.67,32.33,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/08/13/dont-blame-trump-for-afghanistans-collapse-blame-barack-obama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden’s decision towithdraw abruptly from Afghanistan, without any discernible exit strategy, has plunged that nation into a bloody, ruinous chaos. After pleading with theTalibanto spare our embassy in Kabul, he has nowredeployed 3,000 troopstoconduct a hasty air evacuationof embassy staff.At this stage, the only good that can come from this debacle is that our leaders might wake up and recognize that theObama Doctrineof foreign policy is an abysmal failure and must be abandoned once and for all. Tragically, this lesson comes, yet again, at tremendous cost: widescale human misery and heightened threats to U.S. interests.As we study what’s happened, let’s first dispense with the canards: that this fiasco was inevitable and that it’s all former PresidentDonald Trump’s fault.The reality is that, during Trump’s tenure and despite the Afghan government’s many imperfections, Afghanistan had made great strides. The government controlled most of the country’s territory. There was real economic growth. Women could work. Children could go to school.Further, the cost of fostering regional stability by maintaining a stable Afghanistan was well within reason. The U.S. was spending less in Afghanistan in a year than we used to spend in a week. American forces were training and advising Afghan forces. Our troops were not fighting wars and taking causalities. This was clearly sustainable.And how, in heaven’s name, is Trump to blame for Biden’s disastrous decision to cut and run? Trump was negotiating with the Taliban, but there was nothing wrong with that. The negotiations were conditions-based, and Trump made clear the Taliban would be held accountable for its actions.Moreover, Trump’s team made sure that if, in the end, the Taliban proved untrustworthy, the remaining U.S. force had been sized and scoped to present a serious deterrent to the Taliban and be sufficient to protect U.S. interests.Trump, in fact, handed Biden a problem mostly solved. All Biden had to do was negotiate a lasting settlement from a position of strength or maintain an economy of force presence in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to deliver. Instead, Biden just decided to call it a day and call the troops home regardless of what the Taliban did on the ground.The Taliban’s offensive should surprise no one, given the conditions handed to it. Why would it not take advantage ofBiden’s abandonment of Afghanistan? It knew full well the odds that this president would try to stop its orgy of murder, rape, forced marriages, and mayhem was near zero.Of course, Biden will blame Trump. He will blame theTaliban. He can make all the excuses and spin all the narratives he wants, but a narrative can’t stop a bullet. This is a disaster. The situation did not collapse until he withdrew troops—and it is impossible not to conclude this happened because of what he decided.Here is the bigger problem. This was not a one-off decision. This is part of a pattern of Obama-Biden foreign policy. And that should surprise no one since the current policies are being managed by much the same people.In Iraq, after spending much time and effort stabilizing the country, former President Barack Obama precipitously withdrew U.S. troops. It was like ordering firefighters who had extinguished a wildfire to notstick around after the wildfire in case the blaze rekindles. ISIS mushroomed overnight, creating the largest and most powerful terrorist state in modern history.In Libya, Obama insisted on leading from behind. And once Muammar Gaddafi was gone from the picture, he ignored the spiraling decline in the security situation until our diplomatic facilities in Benghazi were smoking ruins.This is the Obama-Biden playbook. Disengage in dangerous situations, and hope everything doesn’t go to hell in a handbasket. And when those fond hopes don’t pan out? Time to make excuses; shift blame; do anything but deal with the problem—unless there is absolutely no alternative.In the face of America’s enemies, the default position of Obama-Biden foreign policy default is accommodation and appeasement. Unfortunately, the bad guys are not stupid. They had eight years to study the Obama playbook, and they know what to do with it: exploit the deliberate self-weakening.Biden iscarrying onexactly the same foreign policy. Caving to Russia onNord Stream 2. Refusing to confront China on theorigins of COVID-19. Pleading with Tehran to let the U.S. back in theIran nuclear deal.No good will come of this.This article was first published on19fortyfive.com.Have an opinion about this article?

COVID-19 vaccine inequity: Inside the cutthroat race to secure doses,-5.0,46.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/covid-19-vaccine-inequity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"PARIS — No one disputes that the world is unfair. But no one expected a vaccine gap between the global rich and poor that was this bad, this far into the pandemic.Inequity is everywhere: Inoculations go begging in the United States while Haiti, a short plane ride away, received its first delivery July 15 after months of promises — 500,000 doses for a population over 11 million. Canada has procured more than 10 doses for every resident; Sierra Leone’s vaccination rate just cracked 1% on June 20.It’s like a famine in which “the richest guys grab the baker,” said Strive Masiyiwa, the African Union’s envoy for vaccine acquisition.In fact, European and American officials deeply involved in bankrolling and distributing the vaccines against coronavirus have told The Associated Press there was no thought of how to handle the situation globally. Instead, they jostled for their own domestic use.But there are more specific reasons why vaccines have and have not reached the haves and have-nots.COVID-19 unexpectedly devastated wealthy countries first — and some of them were among the few places that make the vaccines. Export restrictions kept the doses within their borders.There was a global purchase plan to provide vaccines for poorer countries, but it was so flawed and underfunded that it couldn’t compete in the cutthroat competition to buy. Intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority. Rich countries expanded vaccinations to younger and younger people, ignored the repeated pleas of health officials to donate their doses instead and debated booster shots – – even as poor countries couldn’t vaccinate the most susceptible.The disparity was in some ways inevitable; wealthy nations expected a return on their investment of taxpayer money. But the scale of the inequity, the stockpiling of unused vaccines, the lack of a viable global plan to solve a global problem has shocked health officials, though it wasn’t the first time.“This was a deliberate global architecture of unfairness,” Masiyiwa told a Milkin Institute conference.“We have no access to vaccines either as donations or available for us to purchase. Am I surprised? No, because this is where we were with the HIV pandemic. Eight years after therapeutics were available in the West, we did not receive them and we lost 10 million people.”“It’s simple math,” he said. “We have no access. We have no vaccine miracle.”___The World Health Organization has duly updated its epidemic playbook after every outbreak, most recently with Ebola in mind. Then, as often in the decades before, an emerging illness was largely contained to countries lacking robust public health services, with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions and limited travel connections.For years, the WHO assessed countries’ readiness for a flu pandemic: The United States, European countries and even India ranked near the top. The U.S. readiness was 96%, and Britain at 93%.On Jan. 30, 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak in China to be a global emergency. It would be months before the word “pandemic” became official.But that same day, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, or CEPI, was planning for the worst. CEPI announced “a call for proven vaccine technologies applicable for large scale manufacturing,” according to minutes from its scientific advisory group. CEPI said it would be critical “to support the strategy for global access” early in the game.CEPI quickly invested in two promising coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna and CureVac.“We said very early on that it would be important to have a platform where all countries could draw vaccines from, where there’s accountability and transparency,” said Christian Happi, a professor at Nigeria’s Redeemer’s University and a member of CEPI’s scientific advisory committee. “But the whole idea was that we thought rich countries would fund it for the developing world.”Happi said officials never expected the pandemic would strike first and hardest in Europe and the U.S. Or that their assessment of preparedness in the world’s most advanced economies would prove horrifically optimistic.Global health experts would soon come to realize that rich countries “could sign a piece of paper saying they believe in equity, but as soon as the chips are down, they will do whatever they want,” he said.On March 16, five days after WHO first described COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” the novel mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna was injected into a trial participant for the first time.By then, the disease was tearing through the elderly populations of Europe and the United States.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were the first companies to come out with an mRNA vaccine, devising methods of mass production almost on the fly. Scientists at Britain’s Oxford University also came up with a vaccine with a more traditional platform, and Bill Gates brokered a deal for them to partner with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company with global reach but no experience in vaccine production.On April 30, the deal was confirmed: AstraZeneca took sole responsibility for the global production and distribution of the Oxford vaccine and pledged to sell it for “a few dollars a dose.” Over the next few weeks, the U.S. and Britain secured agreements totaling 400 million doses from AstraZeneca.The race to make and secure vaccines was on, and the United States and Britain were leagues in front of the rest of the world — a lead they wouldn’t lose. Still, both countries would see life expectancy decline by at least a year in 2020, the biggest drop since World War II. In the European Union, 22 countries saw their average lifespans cut short, with Italy leading the list.___But as grim as the situation was, all those countries had a major advantage: They were home to the pharmaceutical companies with the most promising vaccine candidates, the world’s most advanced production facilities, and the money to fund both.On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed and promised to deliver vaccines against coronavirus by New Year’s. With unparalleled money and ambition behind the project, Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui was more confident than his counterparts in Europe that a vaccine was in the offing. He signed contracts almost without regard to price or conditions.“We were frankly focused on getting this as fast as humanly possible. If I had to redo it, I probably should have voiced more of a global dimension,” said Slaoui. “The operation had focused, which was frankly also part of its success, on staying out of the politics and making the vaccines.”The idea of including clauses to ensure that vaccines would go to anyone besides Americans wasn’t even considered.At the same time, the U.S. repeatedly invoked the Defense Production Act — 18 times under the Trump Administration and at least once under Biden. The moves barred exports of crucial raw materials as factories were ramping up production of the as-yet-unapproved vaccines — and eventually, of the vaccines themselves.But it also meant those materials would run low in much of the rest of the world. The U.S. stranglehold would lift only in spring 2021, and only partially.Operation Warp Speed supercharged the global race to secure vaccines, but it would still take another two weeks until COVAX — the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility — was formally announced as the entity to ensure equity, with the Serum Institute of India as the core supplier for the developing world.COVAX had the backing of the World Health Organization, CEPI, vaccines alliance Gavi and the powerful Gates Foundation. What it did not have was cash, and without cash it could secure no contracts.“Operation Warp Speed signed the first public deals and that started a chain reaction,” said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator for supply. “It was a like a rush on the banks, but to buy up the expected supply.”Some involved in the COVAX project flagged India as a potential problem early on, according to minutes of meetings in late spring and early summer of 2020.India’s government had blocked exports of protective gear, but many global health authorities who hadn’t fully grasped the extent of pandemic nationalism found it unimaginable that the country would block vaccines when the world was counting on them. Also, India had so far been spared the waves of death that were sweeping across Europe and the Americas.A separate plan put forward by the government of Costa Rica and the World Health Organization to create a technology-sharing platform to expand vaccine production foundered. Not a single company agreed to share its blueprints, even for a fee — and no government pushed them behind the scenes, according to multiple people involved in the project.On the global scale, the one organization that could have pushed for more technology sharing was the Gates Foundation, whose money to WHO nearly matches that of the U.S. government.Instead, Bill Gates defended stringent intellectual property rights as the best way to speed innovation. His foundation poured money and influence into the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which also failed to generate the money or influence needed to ramp up production outside already existing hubs.In the United States, meanwhile, manufacturing and the trials went on in parallel, which is where taxpayers and the companies took enormous risks that paid off for both.But in retrospect, Slaoui said, given the sheer amount of taxpayer money involved, each time they signed new contracts the U.S. and other countries could have pushed companies harder to share their knowledge, if only for the duration of the pandemic.“From a geopolitical standpoint, it’s critical that they do that,” he said.Nowhere was the situation more dire than Africa. In February, WHO’s African expert in vaccine development, Richard Mihigo, was among many who said the continent’s experience with other pandemics had uniquely prepared it for a complex vaccine deployment.Five months later, contemplating the plight of a continent that gets 99% of its vaccines from abroad, Mihigo adds a rueful footnote: “One of the lessons we learned from this pandemic is how badly prepared we were in vaccine production in the region and how dependent we were on imports.”Those imports have only barely begun to materialize — and they are insufficient to meet even the limited goals of the COVAX initiative to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.___From the start, the coalition of organizations that created COVAX found themselves fighting the last war.The plan was designed as an international pool to spur demand for vaccines and treatment of diseases with a relatively small global footprint, said Winnie Byanyima, head of UNAIDS.Something like Ebola. But the coronavirus pandemic looked nothing like an Ebola outbreak.“That itself was a structural weakness,” she said.Although the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had between them set aside billions for vaccinating the developing world, that money was intended to go to countries and was out of bounds for a global vaccine sharing plan like COVAX, said Mike Muldoon, managing director for innovative finance at the Rockefeller Foundation.Meanwhile, governments competed to secure contracts for vaccines by the hundreds of millions.On Dec. 8, Britain became the first country to formally authorize a start to widespread vaccinations, injecting 90-year-old Margaret Keenan with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Six days later, the United States started its own vaccinations. And on Dec. 26, the EU followed suit. China and Russia had been vaccinating even before releasing data from their homegrown inoculations.The Western companies with the most promising doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, had by then been churning out vials for months before formal approval, based on pledges from the wealthy countries that an enormous market awaited. Those doses were stockpiled in Europe and North America and a small number of countries, like Israel, that paid a premium.COVAX pleaded for cash to do the same. Instead, it got pledges.“As time passed and it became clear which vaccine candidates were going to be the leading contenders and which were most likely to succeed, the governments that had resources went and bought the supplies,” CEPI chief executive Dr. Richard Hatchett told the AP. “COVAX was not in a position to do that.”Months later, when COVAX finally had the money to sign deals for global supplies, Hatchett acknowledged they were at the end of the line.The lack of capital available to vaccine makers to boost their capacity outside the small number of existing manufacturing hubs was also “a lost opportunity,” Hatchett said.“We approached the international financing institutions, including the World Bank and the (International Finance Corporation) about making those investments and they were not willing to do that,” he said. CEPI ended up investing about $1.5 billion, far less than what a major financial institution might have been able to commit.COVAX missed its own goal of beginning vaccinations in poor countries at the same time as rich ones. It finally delivered vaccines on Feb. 24, to Ghana, a load of 600,000 AstraZeneca doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and transported by UNICEF planes.By that date, 27% of the population in Britain had been vaccinated, 13% in the U.S., 5% in Europe — and 0.23% in Africa, in countries that had secured their own bilateral deals after growing impatient with COVAX delays. The rift was growing by millions of doses every day.And pharmaceutical plants were beginning to crumble under the promises they’d made.AstraZeneca announced repeated delivery cuts to Europe. Pfizer’s production briefly slowed. A fire at a Serum Institute construction site prompted a letter to Brazil warning that “supply to you cannot be guaranteed in the foreseeable months.” Moderna supply cuts soon followed to Britain and Canada.In the United States, officials tossed millions of corrupted doses of vaccine from the Emergent Biosolutions plant in Baltimore after discovering that workers had inadvertently blended ingredients from the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. An untold number of doses were never produced because of new restrictions meant to prevent errors. Many of those vaccines were intended for export.So COVAX had to hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine being produced in India would come through, because it had secured few of the innovative mRNA doses that are now considered the most effective against the coronavirus variants. The initial refrigeration requirements were daunting, and the price was higher than the traditional vaccine candidates.The mRNA vaccines are widely considered a scientific and manufacturing triumph — and a risky bet. Never before approved for use against any disease, they are now considered a hugely promising medical innovation and a potential gamechanger against infection.But by the time it was clear the mRNA doses were a viable alternative, even in poor countries with limited cold chain, the available supply had been snapped up in Europe, the United States and Canada. And India, in the throes of its own COVID-19 surge, diverted its vaccines for its own use.According to the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a grouping of human rights organizations advocating for broader sharing of vaccines and their underlying technology, the coronavirus has created nine new billionaires. The top six are linked to the successful mRNA vaccines.For Byanyima, of UNAIDS, this is a travesty and a sign that the world has learned little in the decades since the AIDS pandemic was brought under control in the United States, only to kill millions in Africa because treatments were unaffordable: “Medicines should be a global public good, not just like a luxury handbag you buy on the market.”COVAX has delivered only 107 million doses, and now is forced to rely upon uncertain donations from countries that may prefer to donate directly to the needy, so they can receive the credit.A readout from its June board meeting slipped in an acknowledgement that it needed to better interpret and respond to market conditions and “the reality that a higher risk appetite is needed in a pandemic setting.”___For the pharmaceutical industry, mRNA is the ultimate confirmation that hard work and risk-taking is rewarded. And those companies keep tight hold on the keys to their successful vaccines.When Moderna and Pfizer created new production lines, it was in the insular European and American manufacturing networks that had as much stake as anyone in both ensuring that the injections meet the highest standards and keeping promises not to abuse intellectual property.Many public health officials have pushed for technology transfer during the pandemic. Initially resistant, the Gates Foundation has changed its position in favor of sharing.Dr. Clemence Auer, the EU’s lead negotiator for vaccine contracts last summer, said the question of compelling pharmaceutical companies to suspend their vaccine intellectual property rights to increase the worldwide supply of coronavirus vaccines never even came up.“We had a mandate to buy vaccines, not to talk about intellectual property, ” Auer said.“The global community should have had this discussion back in 2020 but that didn’t happen,” he said. “Maybe we should have done it last year, but now it’s too late. It is spilled milk.”CEPI includes equity clauses in the vaccines that it invests in, among them the successful Moderna candidate, but has yet to invoke them during the pandemic. Some include requirements to make a vaccine available to populations in need at affordable prices, as is the case in CEPI’s Moderna contract. But Moderna was first available exclusively in wealthy countries and even now only limited amounts are going outside Europe and the United States.A separate push to lift intellectual property restrictions on vaccines and medicines has also gone nowhere in the World Trade Organization.And WHO is reticent to criticize donor nations or the pharmaceutical companies. The U.N. health agency works by consensus and needs them for other aspects of global health — and for its own continued existence. The Biden administration has reversed Trump’s decision to defund and leave WHO, but the damage has been done.“A lot of these multinational organizations, these plans, these coalitions, they don’t have teeth to enforce what they think is a fair and equitable way to distribute resources,” said Dr. Ingrid Katz, an infectious disease researcher at the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. She said the key question is whether vaccines and essential medications are a commodity or a right.“If it’s going to be a commodity, we’re going to keep walking down this road every time we have something like this,” she said.And if it is all going to rely on the generosity of rich countries, a lot of people are going to die. Four million have died already.In all, at the recent Group of Seven meeting of wealthy nations pledged to donate 850 million doses, compared with the 11 billion that WHO says will be needed to end the pandemic.A close look at the G-7 promises of donations shows that most aren’t expected to be delivered until well into 2022. The Biden administration fell short on its pledge to send 80 million doses abroad by the end of June: By mid-July, at least 44 million doses had been sent, including 2.5 million to Canada, which has already given at least one vaccine dose to more of its population than any other country. Africa has yet to receive its doses from the United States.___Oceans away from the deprivation of the developing world, 7-year-old Russell Bright and his 5-year-old brother went to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans to get their shots — part of a trial for young children. Maybe they got the vaccine; maybe they got the placebo.Wearing a Spider-Man mask, Russell said he longs for a vacation trip to the water park and then a return to school without having to wear masks and stay at arms’ length from his friends.“Both me and my wife are already vaccinated,” said his father, Adam, “and so the sooner I can get them vaccinated and to feel comfortable being outside, not having to wear a mask, I thought the easiest way to get it is to go through the trial.”Scientists agree that children are at low risk from COVID-19. But that hasn’t stopped richer countries from stockpiling precious vaccine supplies to inoculate the young, even as poor countries have few or no shots to give.A recent meeting of WHO’s vaccine allocation group disbanded with nothing accomplished, because there was no vaccine to allocate. “Zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of J&J vaccine,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor at the organization.“Every single one of our suppliers is unable to supply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk,” Aylward said.Both Trump and Biden administration officials reject the notion that the U.S. or any country would share vaccines until they’d protected their own. And they both note that the U.S. bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, topping the world in confirmed cases and deaths.“We had a responsibility to what I say, ‘put on our own oxygen masks before helping others,’” CDC Director Rachelle Walensky said in May.But a plummeting jet takes all passengers with it, whether or not they are wearing masks. And the failure to provide vaccines across the globe ensures that COVID-19 will continue to spread, and mutate, and sicken, and kill.“It speaks volumes about where we are as a globe when you have the source of decision-making sitting with very few people who have a lot of wealth and are essentially making life and death decisions for the rest of the globe,” Mass General’s Katz said. “Every month that we lost put us further and further behind.”___Maria Cheng reported from London, and Aniruddha Ghosal from New Delhi.

Washtenaw County prosecutor will no longer prosecute 'consensual' sex work,-1.33,49.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/01/14/michigan-prosecutor-no-longer-prosecute-consensual-sex-work/4157744001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,25,"Washtenaw County's new prosecutor is decriminalizing ""consensual sex work,"" his office announced Thursday.Prosecutor Eli Savit announced in a press release that his office is ending the practice of prosecuting sex workers who engage in consensual sex.""The Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s Office is well aware that sex work carries an increased risk for violence, human trafficking, and coercion. Data and experience, however, have shown that criminalizing sex work does little to alleviate those harms,"" Savit said in the statement. ""Indeed the criminalization of sex work actually increases the risk of sex work adjacent harm. Accordingly, the Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s Office will henceforth decline to bring charges related to consensual sex work per se. The Prosecutor’s Office, however, will continue to charge sex work-adjacent crime — including human trafficking, violence, and offenses involving children — that directly harm county residents.""Efforts to reach Savit for further comment Thursday were not successful.Elected in November, Savit said with the exception of Nevada, sex work is generally criminalized in the United States but that ""America’s prohibitionist stance on sex work is increasingly out of step with international norms. Consensual sex work is legal — at least in some form — in nearly 100 countries across the globe.""Savit added the laws against ""consensual"" sex work conflict with the U.S. constitution as adults have a right to ""engage in private conduct"" such as sex.In Oakland County, Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams told The News Thursday that while his office's main focus is human trafficking, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald will be ""rolling out"" policy changes in prosecutions.""I applaud what (Savit) is doing and he certainly is headed in the right direction,"" said Williams. ""There's no question. There absolutely will be changes (in Oakland County).""Last week, Savit made headlines when he announced his office would end cash bail for defendants, saying the practice punishes the poor.""America’s system of cash bail is unfair, inequitable, and imposes severe harm on communities,"" Savit said last week. ""Cash bail is a system under which a defendant who has been accused of a crime is required to post money in order to secure release from jail pending trial. Importantly, cash bail forces defendants to pay for their release before they have been convicted. In function, then, cash bail imposes pre-conviction punishment on criminal defendants who cannot afford to pay.""Savit is a faculty member at the University of Michigan Law School. A former school teacher, he also is a former law clerk to the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.In Michigan, the criminal penalty for prostitution ranges from a misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine, to a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a $2,000 fine."

Lawsuit Challenges Admissions Changes Meant to Boost Diversity at Acclaimed High School,0.33,46.67,https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/lawsuit-challenges-admissions-changes-meant-to-boost-diversity-at-acclaimed-high-school/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,25,"A group representing Asian-American parents on Wednesday sued a Virginia school district over a new admissions plan designed to boost racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a highly selective magnet program that is considered one of the top academic high schools in the nation.The group, called the Coalition for TJ, contends that a new “holistic review” admissions program will significantly reduce the proportion of Asian-American students at the high school in Alexandria, Va.“Plaintiff’s data analysts project that Asian-American student enrollment at TJ will drop from 73 percent under the merit-based race-blind admissions system to 31 percent under the new racial-balancing admissions system for the Class of 2025,”says the lawsuitfiled in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. “No other racial group is projected to lose seats. The greatest beneficiary of the new admissions system in terms of increased population will be white students.”The Fairfax County school district did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.According to the 187,000-student district, in suburban Washington, D.C., Thomas Jefferson had a 2019-20 student enrollment that was 71.5 percent Asian, 19.48 percent non-Hispanic White, 2.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, 1.72 percent Black, and 4.70 percent other.The school system, whose overall student enrollment is 38 percent White, 27 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, and 10 percent Black, has made efforts to boost diversity at Thomas Jefferson in recent years, to little avail. The 2020 racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd in police custody and related events prompted renewed efforts to increase diversity at the selective school, which was founded in 1985.“Over the past 10 years, the [Thomas Jefferson] admissions process has undergone a series of changes that were intended to impact issues of diversity and inclusion,” the school systemsaid in a white paper last year. “Nonetheless, … these changes have not made a significant impact on the diversity of the applicants or admitted students.”Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand last year proposed eliminating Thomas Jefferson’s admissions test in favor of five “regional pathways” based on middle schools, with each being allocated a set number of seats in the incoming first-year class to be determined by lottery. Under that plan, Black student enrollment would have increased to 7 percent, while Asian student enrollment would drop to 54 percent, and White student enrollment would increase to 25 percent.The Fairfax County School Board voted to eliminate the entrance exam in October. In December, the board adopted an alternative new plan. Under that plan, the top 1.5 percent of each of the district’s middle schools who meet certain minimum academic standards will be eligible for admission to Thomas Jefferson. The district will then conduct a holistic review that examines factors including each student’s grade-point average, a problem-solving essay, and “experience factors” that include whether they are economically disadvantaged, English-language learners, or from underrepresented middle schools.“Experience factors will allow consideration of contexts that require a student to demonstrate grit and persevere through challenges to meet the [Thomas Jefferson] applicant requirements,” the school system’s white paper said.The district did not offer specific projections for changes in racial and ethnic balance under the holistic review plan. The new system is taking effect this spring for the class of 2025 that enters the high school this fall.The lawsuit by Coalition for TJ argues that the new admissions system violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause because “although facially race-neutral, it was enacted with discriminatory intent.”The lawsuit cites a 2020 email from Thomas Jefferson Principal Ann Bonitatibus to the school community saying that the racial composition of the high school does not reflect that of the school system overall.“If our demographics actually represented [Fairfax County Public Schools], we would enroll 180 Black and 460 Hispanic students, filling nearly 22 classrooms,” the principal’s email said.“This email put the focus squarely on race and the racial balance at TJ, foreshadowing changes to come,” says the suit, which cites other comments by officials in the district about the need to make Thomas Jefferson more representative.“Defendants have been forthright that the changes to the TJ admissions policy are intended to reduce the proportion of Asian-American students enrolled at TJ because they are ‘overrepresented’ compared to the rest of [Fairfax County Public Schools],” the suit says.“They want to match the racial makeup of the county as a whole,” Glenn E. Roper, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Coalition for TJ, said in an interview. “That was the motivating purpose. School districts can change an admissions program, but they can’t do it with a racially discriminatory purpose.”The lawsuit comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the holistic consideration of race in college admissions but has achallenge to Harvard’s race-conscious admissions programawaiting a decision from the justices on whether they will review that case.In 2007, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down two school districts’ voluntary race-conscious plans for assigning students to schools, inParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a concurrence that suggested there were permissible ways for districts to boost racial diversity through race-conscious means.One of those was “drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods,” Kennedy wrote in his concurrence, which some legal experts consider the controlling opinion inParents Involvedbecause much of the main opinion in that case was a mere plurality.The Fairfax County plan for Thomas Jefferson High aims to be a race-neutral plan for increasing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, the very kind of plan that many advocates have urged schools and colleges to adopt instead of race-conscious policies.It will be up to a federal district court, for starters, to decide whether the plan was adopted with the impermissible racial motivation alleged in the lawsuit."
Lego Pledges To Remove Gender Bias And Harmful Stereotypes From Its Toys,-2.25,48.0,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/10/11/lego-pledges-to-remove-gender-bias-and-harmful-stereotypes-from-its-toys/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forbes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-11,25,"Following a study that found children remain “held back” by “embedded gender stereotypes,” Lego, the world’s largest toymaker,announcedMonday that its future products and marketing would be free of gender bias and harmful stereotypes.A reportcommissioned by Lego surveyed nearly 7,000 parents and children in China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. and found the “need for society to rebuild perceptions, actions and words to support the creative empowerment of all children.”The research found that71%of boys worried they would be made fun of if they played with a toy typically associated with the opposite gender, compared to only 42% of girls.While 76% of the parents surveyed said they would encourage their son to play with Legos, only 24% of parents would recommend it to a daughter.Lego stated it is committed to making more inclusive toys and ensuring that children’s creative ambitions are not restricted.The companyno longer labelsits products “for girls” or “for boys,” and its website does not allow searches by gender.The announcement, and the launch of Lego’s “Ready for Girls” campaign, was made on Monday to coincide with the United Nations’ International Day of The Girl.Despite disruptions to worldwide supply chains, Lego reported a 46% increase in first-half sales in 2021, strengthening its position as the world’s largest toymaker,according totheWall Street Journal.“Parents are more worried that their sons will be teased than their daughters for playing with toys associated with the other gender,”Madeline Di Nonno, chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, told theGuardian. “But it’s also that behaviors associated with men are valued more highly in society. Until societies recognize that behaviors and activities typically associated with women are as valuable or important, parents and children will be tentative to embrace them.”Several toymakers have recently made efforts to remove gender bias from their products. In February, Hasbro, the company that makes Potato Head,made the brand gender-neutralby dropping the “Mr.” from its name. Hasbro’s announcement came the same week the U.S. House of Representativespassed sweeping legislationprohibiting discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. TheEquality Act, which still needs to be approved in the Senate, would amend federal law, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Fair Housing Act, to explicitly include anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans. ​​Previously, Mattel, best known for their Barbie dolls, launched a line ofgender-inclusive dolls. “The toys we give to children and the traits they are assigned can have lasting impacts on their lives,”according toMelissa Hogenboom, editor of BBC Reel and author ofThe Motherhood Complex.Don't Blame Mr. Potato Head: What You Didn't Know About The Gender Of Your Spud(Forbes)Girls are ready to overcome gender norms, but society continues to enforce biases that hamper their creative potential(Lego.com)"

Senate GOP report finds Biden administration spending $2B to suspend border wall construction,13.33,35.33,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-gop-report-biden-administration-2b-suspend-wall-construction,https://adfontesmedia.com/fox-news-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Dek: Fox News’ Mark Eiglarsh discusses the legal fallout from Texas' plans on ‘Your World’""These interim findings show that the Biden administration’s efforts to stop border wall construction constitute significant waste of taxpayer resources,""the reportsays. ""As of the drafting of this report the Biden administration has paid border wall contractors at least $2 billion and counting to not build the border wall.""""This $2 billion comes directly from DOD’s budget, and the Biden administration’s continued waste of these funds poses risks to national security and border security,"" it says.Biden ended the Trump-era wall project, which saw 450 miles built during the Trump administration, on his first day in office with hundreds of miles still funded and contracts already underway. Biden ordered a review of the federal government’s obligations.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has since announced a plan on what to do with money assigned to the wall, while the administration redirected transferred funds from Pentagon accounts to the original projects for which they had been appropriated. The Defense Department (DOD) had $10 billion transferred from border wall construction and related projects.After the order to suspend construction, the committee found that the Defense Department was initially occurring $6 million a day in ""suspension costs,"" but that was reduced to $3 million after layoffs. The money is being spent on ""make safe and site security"" projects.""This means that the federal government is paying contractors on these seven projects $3 million per day to drive out to project sites and guard the unused pallets of steel and other construction materials,"" the report said.To get to the $2 billion figure, the report uses DOD’s estimates laid out in court documents. Those estimates include ""suspension costs"" for the project, which the subcommittee staff says either ""significantly undercounted"" the daily accrual of $3 million a day or was not fully included.""If the daily accrual of $3 million represents a separate cost not accounted in the broader DOD estimate of termination costs, then the total suspension costs will still be significantly higher than the estimate DOD provided to the Biden administration and to the courts,"" it says.According to the report, the total amount spent could be higher than $2 billion due to uncertainties about plans for contracts acquired by DHS, questions about the Pentagon’s estimation of suspension costs, and the 12- to 18-month timeline it will take to exit the contracts.Pentagon spokesman Chris Mitchell told Fox News that the Defense Department ""will not comment publicly on matters that are in active litigation or settlement discussions.""Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., the lead Republican on the subcommittee, slammed the Biden administration over the findings.""It is absolutely absurd that Americans are paying contractors to guard metal gates that President Biden refuses to install because he wants to ‘study’ the wall,"" he said in a statement. ""Stubbornly refusing to spend money approved for the wall is not ‘executing’ the law. It’s ignoring the law and ignoring the very real national security concerns posed by illegal entry across our very open southern border. For years I have called out federal waste, but the Biden Administration is literally ‘going for broke’ with this nonsense.""The report says that the estimation on exactly how much is being wasted could be higher, as it does not factor in Department of Homeland Security accounts, as well as other costs related to some of the DOD projects.""These estimates do not include an analysis of DHS accounts and therefore do not represent the full extent of waste by the Biden administration, nor do they include the ongoing daily costs related to DOD’s suspension of projects funded by its 284 accounts,"" the report says. ""Given these caveats, President Biden is likely wasting significantly more taxpayer resources than estimated in this report on his efforts to stop building the border wall.""The Republican report also cast its findings in light of the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which has seen more than a million migrant encounters in Fiscal Year 2021 andmore than 188,000 in June alone.""Our border patrol agents are doing their best to secure our border, but they need additional barriers, roads, and technology to help keep us safe,"" Lankford said. ""Instead, President Biden is paying professional construction contractors to babysit metal to the tune of $2 billion and counting, while at the same time we’ve seen a 20-year high number of migrants crossing our open border.""The report comes just as the Department of Homeland Securityannounced that it has canceledcontracts for more than 30 miles of border wall construction in the Laredo Sector in Texas.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.He can be reached atadam.shaw2@fox.comor onTwitter."
Whitmer calls on Michigan legislature to pass law requiring masks,-3.0,50.67,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/11/05/whitmer-covid-michigan-mask-legislature/6175062002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,25,"The day before Michigan expects to record the 200,000th case of the coronavirus in the state, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called on legislators to pass a law requiring residents towear masks in indoorplaces and crowded outdoor areas.The governor said she sent a letter to Republican lawmakers this week asking them to pass a bill. Lawmakers, especially Republicans leading the House and Senate, have asked to have more of a role in the process of tackling the pandemic, Whitmer noted. Now is their time to act.""This is the law under epidemic orders. But we do think it would be helpful to our health, our safety and our economy if it was codified in a bipartisan (manner at) the Legislature, and that's what we've asked for, "" Whitmer said.""We've known for a long time that the single most important weapon that we have against this virus is the simple task of wearing a mask.""State health orders issued in October already require mask wearing in public. Yet case rates continue to rise. While Whitmer said she thinks putting the requirement in law would likely encourage Michiganders to take the precaution more seriously, she knows people are tired and frustrated.""We are all tired of dealing with COVID. And yet ignoring the problem is making it worse,"" Whitmer said.""I think fatigue is a part of it, I think the political rhetoric has created a lot of confusion and unnecessary suspicion around the efficacy of masks. However, studies have shown this remains the best tool that we have.""Whitmer said state health and labor officials are also ""increasing scrutiny"" of remote work policies, especially for employers requiring staff to work on-site. The state may cite employers, require changes and issue fines of up to $7,000, Whitmer said.The comments came the same day Michigan recorded its highest number of cases in any day since the start of the pandemic: 5,710. That brings the state's total case count to more than 197,800.The seven-day average daily case rate is above 3,500, much higher than at any point in the pandemic. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, state medical executive, said the percentage of positive tests is averaging 7.5%, though it exceeded 10% on Monday and Tuesday.Hospitalizations are four times higher now than they were at the end of August, and 60% are outside of southeast Michigan. More than 7,400 people have died from the coronavirus. There were more deaths in Michigan in October from the disease than in any month since May.About 2,300 people are now hospitalized in Michigan with COVID-19 symptoms, said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, Henry Ford Health System's executive vice president and chief clinical officer.""It is definitely taxing all health care systems and hospitals across the state,"" he said.The Detroit-based health system has re-activated its incident command center to allow it to ""make rapid changes as needed to accommodate the increasing number of patients"" who have COVID-19, Munkarah said.About 18% to 20% of the COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized at Henry Ford need to be admitted to intensive care units, he said, but fewer are in need of ventilator support.""Part of this is because we've learned much more about the disease over the past few months and how to manage it differently where we do not feel that we need to put people on respirators or ventilators so early,"" Munkarah said.For the time being, no elective procedures or medical services are limited at Henry Ford because of the rising coronavirus hospitalizations, but Munkarah said: ""We are going to continue to monitor things very, very closely.""But one of the biggest concerns he has is whether Henry Ford and other hospitals statewide will have enough staff to get through this surge.With so much community spread of the virus, hospital workers are at higher risk of contracting the virus just as everyone else. And if they get sick, Munkarah asked: ""Are we going to have enough staff to take care of patients in the hospital?""“If we don’t do anything else, if we don’t change our behaviors, we could be seeing 100 deaths per day by the end of December,"" Khaldun said.“We are really at a tipping point right now when it comes to COVID-19. … Our rates are rising exponentially. “In late October, state health officials announced it would be continuing regulations and restrictions intended to mandate mask wearing while in public, limit crowd sizes at private gatherings and in business, and generally promote actions that will stop the spread of the disease.That included requiring restaurants to keep contact information for patrons, in order to ease any potential contact tracing efforts. The state also limited the number of people who may eat at an establishment together at six, and reduced the number of people allowed at a gathering like a wedding venue that does not have fixed seating.Health officials hurriedly issued a similar order in early October in response to Michigan Supreme Court rulings. The court, in a split decision, essentially invalidated executive orders put in place by Whitmer. The court determined one law Whitmer had relied upon was unconstitutional, and a second law required Whitmer to obtain approval from the Legislature if she wanted to extend a state of emergency.State health officials issued the restrictions under a completely separate law that was not in any way affected by the court's ruling.""We have to get the politics out of the public health crisis. It is killing us. It is jeopardizing our economy ... today, the most important tool that we have is a mask. And every one of us has an interest in masking up,"" Whitmer said Thursday.While state Republican legislative leaders have groused about Whitmer's decision to issue executive orders, the Legislature has not passed any comprehensive legislation aimed at stopping the spread of the disease.The GOP-led House and Senate have collaborated with the governor on legislation that helped schools open, extend unemployment benefits, give clarity to nursing home operators and new legal protections to some businesses.""Michiganders are tough. We have grit. Take care of each other. We can't stop now,"" Whitmer said.Contact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com or 313-938-4591. Follow him on Twitter @Dave_Boucher1."

Gavin Newsom.Faulconer served as mayor from 2006 to 2014 and officially launched his campaign to run in either the 2022 race for governor, or sooner if a recall election takes place.“He’s failed us, year after year,” Faulconer said in his firstcampaign video. “I’m running to make a difference, not to make promises.”While past petitions to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom have failed, there is a current petition that has gained 1.3 million of the 1.8 million of the necessary signatures, according to the “Recall Gavin” campaign.The recall campaign’s senior adviser Randy Economy told L.A. Weekly back in December that he believed enough signatures would be garnered by the end of January and while that did not happen, the campaign has until March 17 to reach the necessary threshold.While leaders in the state, including L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, praised Newsom for aggressive action early on in the pandemic, of late, small businesses and Republican voices such as Faulconer have been vocal about their displeasure with the governor’s orders to shut down.Those voices grew louder after Newsom was photographed dining at the French Laundry restaurant in Yountville on Nov. 6, 2020. The dinner appeared to be indoors, although the restaurant said it was their outdoor area, and Newsom was seen packed in tightly with several others and no visible masks worn by the patrons.Newsom later apologized for the dinner, saying he felt “uncomfortable” and should have left the moment he noticed there were so many people in attendance.“To him there’s rules for everybody else and then there’s rules for him,” Economy said about the governor’s November dinner. “It’s the arrogance of power and he doesn’t care for the average person in California. He cares about living in his own political bubble.”On Tuesday, a survey conducted by theUniversity of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studiessaid that among the 10,000 registered voters who were polled, 48% approved of Gov. Newsom’s performance, while 46% disapproved.About 69% of those polled were displeased with Newsom’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is up from 51% in a September poll.A countering poll was released by thePublic Policy Institute of California, Tuesday,and the results were more favorable toward Newsom, showing that 54% of adult Californians were satisfied with satisfied with his performance as governor.“A majority approve of the job that Gavin Newsom is doing as governor, while opinions about him remain deeply divided between Democratic and Republican voters,” Mark Baldassare, PPIC president and CEO said in a media release. “More than four in ten say that COVID is the most important issue for the governor and legislature in 2021, and a majority of Californians approve of the governor’s handling of COVID.

That is because so many investors still have lots of cash to put to work, the head of the world’s largest asset managertold CNBCin a Tuesday interview.“Despite where the markets are in equities, we have not seen money being put to work,” Fink said. “We have record amounts of money in cash.”A meltup is often defined as a sharp and unexpected rise in the price of an asset class, driven largely by a stampede of investors who are more concerned about missing out on a big up move than by improving market fundamentals. Melt-ups are often followed by sharp market setbacks.After a steep fourth-quarter selloff that pushed the S&P 500SPX,+1.07%and the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA,+0.35%into corrections but stopped just short of a bear market — defined as a 20% drop from a recent peak — stocks have roared back. For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 15.9% and stands less than 1% below its all-time closing high of 2,930.75 set Sept. 20.Data from Lipper last week showed that U.S. equity funds saw $4.3 billion in inflows through the week ended April 10, but that followed a $19.7 billion outflow from the end of last year through April 3.The stock-market rally so far this year has been partly attributed to a dovish shift by the Federal Reserve, which abruptly paused its policy tightening effort in January to adopt a wait-and-see approach after delivering four rate increases in 2018. Fed policy makers have signaled they expect no rate rises this year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank, which ended its bond-buying program at the end of last year, introduced a new round of bank stimulus in March in the face of renewed economic sluggishness.Fink said the dovishness of central bankers creates a shortage of “good assets,” which could serve as a trigger for a global melt-up in equity prices.BlackRock on Tuesday reporteda fall in first-quarter profitdue to a price-war that continues to ripple across the asset-management industry. Total assets under management rebounded to more than $6 trillion after slipping at the end of 2018."
When is it time to cut off a toxic family member?,-2.67,37.33,https://www.mic.com/p/when-is-it-time-to-cut-off-a-toxic-family-member-43101998,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,25,"We are living in divisive times. This is both a cliche and massive understatement. Most people have family members who that they disagree with about politics, social justice, or coronavirus safety, and the pressure cooker of the pandemic has really brought tensions to a boil for a lot of us. As a vocally radical queer person who grew up in a conservative home, I have had some interactions with family that left me feeling so wounded that I wondered if it’s psychologically healthy for me to continue to talk to them. As the holiday season approaches, I’m confident that others have this issue on their minds as well, so I asked experts how to figure out when it’s time tocut a toxic family member of your life.It’s worth noting that any relationship comes with some inherent discomfort. “Some might say that the more closely connected you are with someone, the greater the risk of conflict,” says Sara Stanizai, a California-based psychotherapist who works with queer, transgender, and bicultural communities. However, Stanizai explains, discomfort is different from abuse, and discerning the difference is critical for your own emotional wellbeing. But it may be hard to tell the difference when tempers are high or feelings are hurt.Know that when you argue with a family member, about politics especially, there is a spectrum of how ""healthy"" the discourse is. You can be respectfully heated, but when it borderlines on toxic comments and behavior, it's problem worth addressing. “The hallmark for defining abuse is there is a noticeable, pervasive pattern,” Satnizai says. “This doesn't mean it happens all the time, but it begins to be predictable.” For example, she says, there’s a pattern if you can expect the same type of criticism about multiple areas of your life from someone or if they are continually hyper focusing on one subject and constantly finding many things wrong with it.I, for instance, have a family member who is always talking about “the gays.” One minute it may be, “the gays want to make us all gay,” and five minutes later she might make a comment like, “gay people spread disease.” It’s like she’s always trying to finding away to talk about how terrible gay people are, even though I am one of them. This is not a debate. It's abusive behavior.Another hallmark of abusive relationships is a lack of accountability. If you tell someone that something they said or did hurt you, and they don’t care, that’s a problem that could be another sign of abuse, says Stanizai. And it might be time to assert your needs more directly. She recommends, however, giving someone a chance to apologize and make amends before you assume that they won’t. It's tempting to just ignore the behavior, but that will likely just dig you into a deeper, more painful hole in the long run.When you’re feeling hurt, it can be really hard to speak up for yourself. You may need to set some boundaries between yourself and the person who’s hurt you before you can do that. That’s okay. But eventually, if you want to try to heal the relationship, you are going to have to have a difficult conversation, says Stanizai. If the other person avoids the conversation or taking responsibility for their own words or actions, then it may be time to set new limits.If you aren't making leeway with this person who has a pattern of hurting you, you can choose a level of ""cutting them off."" Discarding them completely is not the only option. There are degrees of separation you can create that may allow you to feel safer. “This can mean limiting time to them only in groups, or only for certain occasions, or for 1-2 hours at a time,” she says. If it feels safe, try to give someone more than one chance to apologize. Being confronted often makes people feel defensive, and continually offering olive branches is a disarming maneuver that can benefit everyone. “When someone feels that you are giving them an honest chance, they are more likely to listen to your side too,” Stanizai adds.Now, if there is no circumstance in which you may feel emotionally safe with someone, explore that, discuss it with a trusted person in your life, and then own it. It might not last forever, but this is your current reality. You do not have to spend time with abusive people. If you find yourself truly activated by someone — meaning that contact with them induces a panic attack or a mental health episode, Stanizai explains — then it may be time to really cut ties. ""It's perfectly fine to skip the family BBQ or keep your distance from someone altogether,” she says.Ultimately, managing a conflicted relationship with a family member is not a black and white problem and there are no black or white solutions. If you decide to stop talking to someone, you can change your mind later if it feels safe for you. The most important thing is that you continue to bolster your own sense of agency.Having a sense of control in your relationships is not about controlling other people, it’s about feeling like you get to have control over yourself. Speaking up for yourself when someone hurts you may feel hard, Stanizai says, but it can help you take control of the narrative."
Top Facebook Exec Refuses to Say Whether Company Amplified Insurrectionists Ahead of January 6,-11.67,35.33,https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2021/10/top-facebook-exec-refuses-to-say-whether-company-amplified-insurrectionists-ahead-of-january-6/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-10,25,"After a long, very bad week for Facebook, the company sent one of its top executives, Nick Clegg, to make the rounds on the Sunday shows. Though, he didn’t make things better for the company. Notably, he couldn’t—or wouldn’t—even answer a simple but crucial question: Did Facebook amplify violent rhetoric ahead of the January 6th insurrection?CNN's Dana Bash: ""Did the algorithms that are in place amplify pro-insurrection voices ahead of Jan. 6? Yes or no?""Facebook's Nick Clegg: ""I can't give you a yes or no answer to the individual, personalized feeds that each person uses.""pic.twitter.com/MwLUwiYkLI— Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona)October 10, 2021Former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen recently revealed how the social media giant knew its algorithms could spread hate and misinformation, warning that Facebook chose “profit over safety.” She claimed that the company’s decision to dissolve its civic integrity unit and roll back protections prematurelycontributedto the spread of hate and misinformation that undergirded the insurrection at the US Capitol.But when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Clegg, who is Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, about Haugen’s claims, specifically about how the company’s algorithms boosted content ahead of January 6, he gave a roundabout non-answer. He said that if the company removed Facebook’s current algorithm, which amplifies posts with more “meaningful social interactions,” that would perpetuate “more, not less, hate speech, more, not less, misinformation.”Bash then put him on the spot: “My question is specifically about January 6. Did the algorithms that are in place amplify pro-insurrection voices ahead of January 6th? Yes or no.” “I can’t give you a yes or no answer,” he finally conceded, before pivoting to argue that the responsibility for the insurrection was on “the people who broke the law.”Haugen, who has already testified before Congress, is set to go this Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. She has filed numerous complaints to the Securities and Exchanges Commission alleging that Facebook “misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6th insurrection.” She has also called for more oversight of the social media giant, though, as my colleague Ali Breland recentlyargued, even her proposals fall short on the sort of structural overhaul Facebook needs."
Trump Organization indictments for Allen Weisselberg a small but important step,-15.33,31.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-organization-indictments-allen-weisselberg-small-important-step-n1272896,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"One need only recallAl Capone’s tax fraud convictionto recognize that many tax cheats historically flout other laws, too.As of Wednesday, we've added another character to the books with news that the Manhattan district attorney officially filed criminal tax charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer,Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg plans toplead not guiltyto the charges, his attorney said.)A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political.It is no surprise that the corporate defendant in the New York criminal case is owned by former President Donald Trump. This is the same Trump whorepeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt”and verbally abused special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions.This is the same Trump who showed contempt for elections in November 2020 when he asked the Georgia secretary of state to “find 11,780 votes,” and when that didn’t work met with top advisers toconsider declaring martial lawto redo the election — and finallyincited an insurrectionat the Capitol on Jan. 6.Trump’s four-year presidency can be summed up in the words of the New York State Bar Association statement condemning his 2020 pardon of convicted felonRoger Stone, a key witness in the Mueller investigation: “This is a perversion of justice, plain and simple.”The former president may soon fade from the political scene as his legal troubles worsen. But even without Trump, we must confront the perversion of justice that typifies the modus operandi of so many others like him in business, the entertainment industry and politics. Bernie Madoff, Harvey Weinstein and countless others in positions of power and prestige showed contempt for the law. They pervert justice because they think the law is an obstacle to be overcome.First, the powerful claim they are immune from the law. Often, they prove this to be true. Some likeBill Cosbyclaim immunity from prosecution because their lawyers negotiated a strategically advantageous deal with prosecutors. Others claim immunity from prosecution because they are U.S. presidents.They hide behind a constitutionally dubious presidential immunity theory blessed by the Department of Justice in three separate memoranda written during the presidencies of Nixon, Clinton and Trump. Donald Trump’s own lawyers, appearing before the 2nd Circuit in their effort to prevent the Manhattan DA from subpoenaing Trump Organization tax records, claimed the president was immune from subpoena and evencould shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and still be immune from prosecution.Trump’s defenders would have us believe that it’s the law, not his actions, that are wrong.Others in positions of power — many child molesters, for example — claim immunity because they avoided getting caught until after the statute of limitations expired. Still others think their immunity stems from their social class. As New York real estate mogulLeona Helmsleyfamously told her maid, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Unfortunately for Helmsley, she was not immune from prosecution and was carted off to prison.A second approach is to attack those who enforce the law, whether it be Mueller and his band of “angry Democrats,” the four agency inspectors generalfired by Trumpin the middle of investigations, the United States attorney in Manhattan also fired by Trump in 2020, or now the verbal assaults launched at the Manhattan DA from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s strategy appears to be: When caught violating the law, deflect one’s own narcissism onto law enforcement and hope that sticks in the court of public opinion.A third related strategy is to denigrate the rule of law itself. Claim that the law is perverse, either because the law is just political or because the law is irrational in making some things illegal and others not. A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political.In the far-right media, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden did it, it’s per se criminal. If Trump did it, it’s perfectly legal and any prosecutor, inspector general or member of Congress who suggests to the contrary is just on awitch hunt. Many on the left have a similar narcissistic attitude, even if not the media platform to express it, often insisting that law is defined by politics and has no moral integrity on its own.The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either.For over a century, nihilistic legal commentators have re-enforced this view. The German theologian andlegal philosopher Carl Schmittin the 1920s published “The Concept of the Political,” in which he argued that law is not based on neutral principles but is simply a byproduct of politics.Academic commentators on the far right and far left today quote Schmitt, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933, frequently for the same proposition: Law is all about politics. There is no objective truth, no just concept of right and wrong underlying the law. This nihilism, like bad wine, is poured into the fancy bottles of academic theory, but it is peddled to a far larger audience under the more plebeian labels of right-wing radio, TV and internet.Finally, there are the many clever ways to get around the law. In the 1970s, before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan reduced taxes on the rich, some academic economists sympathized with those who did not want to pay whatever taxes the legislature deemed to be their fair share. Arthur Seldon of the London School of Economics and a group of co-authorscoined the term “avoision”to describe manipulative tax strategies that combined ethically problematic but legal tax avoidance (for example, moving from one jurisdiction to another to pay lower tax) with illegal tax evasion (for example, pretending to have moved from one jurisdiction to another in order to pay lower tax).Another common avoision strategy is paying an employee’s rent, private school tuition or other benefits rather than paying reportable income. This, of course, is what the Manhattan DA now alleges the Trump Organization and its CFO did to avoid paying taxes.By the 1990s Seldon’s phrase “avoision” was so widely used that it appeared on “The Simpsons” as Bart Simpson explained why Krusty the Clown was in prison for tax fraud: “I don’t say 'evasion.' I say 'avoision.'”According to a 2019 New York Times article, several generations of the Trump family have been doing just that to “avoid” taxes since the 1970s. And on Wednesday, the Manhattan DA, after a lengthy fight just to get the Trump Organization's financial records, and a 2020 victory in the Supreme Court, finally had enough evidence to hand down an indictment.Trump is the epitome of the avoision man. And the law may be catching up with him.But we cannot just focus on Trump without looking at the underlying problem ­— the narcissistic view of the law that gave rise to Trump and caused so many to celebrate him first as a real estate tycoon, then as a media star and finally as a president.The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either; it is grounded in a collective sense of right and wrong. One of the law’s imperfections is that those who flout the law, who think they are too powerful ever to get caught or prosecuted for violating it, are far too often right.That’s about to change with the small but important step taken by the Manhattan DA on Wednesday. Respect for the law, and enforcement of the law, are crucial to maintaining the rule of law. And that goes for everyone — even a business empire run by a man who once was president of the United States.Richard W. Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W. Bush. He is the S. Walter Richey Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Minnesota and is a graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School."

Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher.All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon.The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area.The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sundayrequired a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Firefor increased firefighting efforts.On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat.Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger.The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest.This will lead to another week with a high risk of wildfires due to the already desiccated landscape void of much precipitation whether falling from the sky or locked in the mostly-melted snowpack.Withground fuels already sitting at highly flammable and record-dry levels, all experts can do is warn people of the impending danger and hope for the best in what has already proven to be an early and destructive start to the Western wildfire season.With climate change making heat waves three times more likely compared to 100 years ago and contributing to the current 22-yearmegadrought, wildfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer into the year. As the gap closes, experts say there isn't so much a defined wildfire season in the West anymore, but instead it lasts year round.Kathryn Prociv is a senior meteorologist and producer for NBC News."

The Tax Day Outrage You Don’t Know About,-4.71,40.71,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/04/16/the-tax-day-outrage-you-dont-know-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"If you like to leave things until the last minute, you probably know April 15 as the day to squint at a 1040 tax form or rush through TurboTax. In the past, conservatives have also used this occasion torally againstBig Government, or to writelisticleschronicling “six of the more infuriating ways that [tax] money has gone to waste.”But the lesser known fact about Tax Day is all the money thatdoesn’tcome in. ProPublicaestimatesthat every year, the public misses out on $18 billion in revenue thanks to a whittled down workforce of government tax auditors. Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service has shed staff dramatically. As of 2017, the organization had 9,510 auditors—a third less than it had in 2010. That means fewer bookkeepers to investigate shady claims or to go after people who don’t bother to file taxes. No wonder the department’s inspector general estimates that the amount of lost revenue has gone up by at least $3 billion each year.It’s just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often don’t pan out to be the straight-forward, belt-tightening measures they’re pitched to be.“It’s been two years since we’ve hired anyone,” one Department of Labor bureaucrattoldRachel Cohen, writing forWashingtonian. “We’ve lost 25 percent of our staff, and our employees know nobody is being hired—but we’re not allowed to admit it.”That Trump’s bureaucracy is riddled with vacancies is intentional. Soon after taking office in 2017, the president announced a freeze on hiring federal workers. He reversed that decision 79 days later, but Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney (now doubling as his acting Chief of Staff) solicited recommendations on how to rebuild the executive branch “from scratch.” Mulvaney said that Trump wanted to start with “a literal blank piece of paper.”He’s hardly the first president to push for an overhaul of the executive branch. Bill Clinton’s ‘Reinventing Government’ initiative called for eliminatinghundreds of thousandsof government positions, and he followed through. Regan and George W. Bush pressed for cutstoo. Sometimes the rationale is belt-tightening; sometimes it’s making government more competent. Often, it’s both. But simply cutting the government work force, both in executive agencies and in Congress, often achieves neither aim.“Hiring freezes—not only in terms of explicit policy but also the struggle to hire when the budget is so uncertain—these have huge and dramatic implications for the federal government” said Donald Kettl, a political scientist at University of Texas at Austin. When staff are cut in government, agencies still have to find a way to complete their legally required duties. The Social Security Administration can’t not send out checks. The IRS can’t not collect taxes.Enter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelmanshowedthat while the U.S. population has ballooned since the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about the same size as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to bemore costlythan civil servants, sometimes dramatically so, which is why just cutting federal workers doesn’t always save taxpayer money.It’s also vital that the government have enough staff to oversee those contractors. But often, they don’t. When the U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, itdramatically increasedthe cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A governmentreportfound that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increased seven-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weapons systems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009.Sometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they’re overseeing for extra manpower—in effect asking private companies to help regulate themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing’s assistance in inspecting and approving the company’s own planes. That policy of delegation has come under scrutiny after two crashes involving Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets. “It seems pretty clear that the FAA didn’t have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,” says Kettl.But this problem isn’t just limited to the executive branch. It’s an issue for Congress, too. As Iwrotefor the most recent issue of theMonthly, legislators’ struggles with technology can be traced back to staffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and their staff on science and technology. They cut a third of staffers in the House who work on committees—where much of the policymaking happens. And they cut support agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter.Those numbers haven’t rebounded, and current staffers feel it. A recentsurveyof senior aides found that 84 percent thought “high-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch” was “very important,” while just 24 percent were “very satisfied” with the status quo.With fewer policy and research staff available, and without in-house science and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue to struggle to understand some of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its own staff. While they’re at it, they could increase funding for the IRS—and help recoup billions in the process.Grace Gedye is reporter for CalMatters.

What Are Debris Flows and Why Are They Dangerous?,0.0,47.33,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-22-debris-flow-threat-california-rain,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"A​ newer version of this article appearshere.California is bracing for dangerous and potentially deadly landslides in the coming days, as much-needed rain moves in amid historic drought conditions.Terrain left barren by wildfires is most vulnerable to an especially dangerous and fast-moving type of landslide that scientists call ""debris flows."" Known less formally as mudslides, these flows are typically triggered by short, intense rainstorms and can send a wall of water, soil, ash, vegetation, rocks and other debris careening downhill, sweeping away or burying everything in its path.""A debris flow is kind of a flood on steroids,"" Jason Kean, a debris flow expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, told weather.com in an interview. ""It’s all bulked up with rocks, mud, even boulders – and boulders can be the size of cars.""The threat of landslides usually increases in the fall as wetter weather typically starts to move across the West Coast. A parade of storms forecast into next week has parts of both California and Oregon on alert for debris flows.The USGS and other agencies work together to assess the debris flow threat in burn scars each year. So far they've completed assessments for about 60 fires in nine western states. The public can read themhere.Among the areas of highest concern in California this year are the Dixie, Monument and Alisal fire burn footprints, Jaime Kostelnik, also a geologist on the assessment team, told weather.com in a recent interview.In Oregon, areas with high risk include parts of the Devils Knob, Jack and Bootleg burn areas.But any burn scar can potentially be at risk, and conditions can change over time depending on the weather and other factors.The cumulative effects of extreme wildfires in recent years make the situation even more hazardous, especially in California. Many of the areas impacted by wildfires have burned more than once in recent years.Besides destroying vegetation that would normally hold soil and debris in place, wildfires change certain characteristics of the soil itself. It becomes less likely to absorb water, which creates conditions ripe for flash flooding and debris flows, according to Kean and Kostelnik.""As (the water) runs off, it picks up all these loose soil particles that no longer have vegetation to hold them in place and then it bulks up into that debris flow that can move really fast and start actually within minutes of intense rainfall,"" said Kean.Debris can rush down a hillside at a rate over 35 mph and then flatten out and spread even farther when it reaches the bottom of a slope.At least 20 people were killed when mudslides with walls of debris as tall as 30 feetstruck the Santa Barbara County community of Montecitoin 2018. On average, 25 to 50 people arekilled by landslidesevery year in the United States, according to the USGS.This week, emergency crews worked to prepare areas scarred by the Alisal Fire before the wet weather moved in. That includedinstalling barriersto keep mud and debris from washing over roadways, the Santa Barbara News-Press reported.Storm prep was also underway along the Caldor Fire burn scar in Sacramento, where work included placing fallen trees across bulldozer lines to hold soil in place.“The heavy predicted rains this week has us concerned, but we're going tokeep working as long as we can,” Paul Naman, a service repair supervisor at the site, told KOVR-TV.The elevated risk of debris flows in a burn scar can last up to five years after a fire. Officials in Santa Cruz County, for example, are warning people who live in the area of the 2018 CZU Complex Fire to be on alert for debris flow danger.The threat for California as a whole will increase as the rainy season moves in, usually at its peak from November through February.""California has a distinct wet season that lasts from late fall into early spring, and a dry season with little to no rainfall from late spring to early fall,"" said weather.com meteorologistChris Dolce. ""That extreme variance is related to an area of high pressure that sets up off the West Coast in summer and prevents any significant moisture from reaching the state. Conversely, in winter, that high weakens and shifts farther south, which opens the door for Pacific storms to affect California with heavy rain and mountain snow.""The state is in the clutches of a historic two-year drought. While the rain in the coming days will bring some relief, it remains to be seen how wet this year's winter will be. And experts say it could take years to catch up from the precipitation deficit.Wildfire danger, meanwhile, peaks in the fall because that's when vegetation is completely dried out prior to the arrival of the first significant Pacific storms of the season, Dolce said.Research has linked California's progressively more extreme fire seasons to climate change, and a study published last year by the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies found that the risk of post-wildfire debris flowsis also likely to go up.Experts say people in areas under threat should be alert if any rain develops, and don't wait for an evacuation order to leave if heavy rains develop.""They should take it seriously,"" Kostelnik said.The Weather Company’s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Gay Ohio 14-Year-Old Attacked While Coming Out By Wearing Pride Flag,-0.67,45.67,https://www.advocate.com/news/2021/6/02/gay-ohio-14-year-old-attacked-while-coming-out-wearing-pride-flag,https://adfontesmedia.com/advocate-magazine-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-06-02,25,"A gay 14-year-old from Defiance, Ohio, was viciously attacked at school last week when draped in a Pride flag. The flag was eighth-grader Tristen Torrez's way of coming out, according toThe Crescent News.""I was wearing it to state a message, and state just because one person is who they are, proud of who they are, doesn't mean others shouldn't be proud of who they are,"" Torrez told TV stationWTOL. ""This was my official way of saying I was gay and not trying to hide it.""In the incident, which was captured on video, a boy grabbed the flag that was around Torrez's neck, making Torrez fall hard on the bleachers where he was sitting. The boy continued attacking Torrez, who sustained a bruised collarbone and a scraped ankle, and was having headaches afterward.""We had gone outside to the stadium around 11:45 or so yesterday morning, and some friends and I were just sitting in the bleachers for a while when I started hearing that someone might come up to me and dump some water on me or push me,"" Torrez said.""He came up behind me, dumped water on me, pulled me down the bleachers, grabbed the flag off my neck, beat me with it, and choked and hit me a few times. He also used a slur once or twice,"" he said. ""When I went to school with the flag, I thought I might hear a slur or two, but I didn't think I would get beat up for bringing as something as innocent as a flag to school.""Torrez's mother, Brianne Torrez, called the school upon hearing what had happened to her son.""[School officials] said the police were involved, I was told there was a video, and then I saw exactly what happened. I was pretty upset that not only wasn't I contacted but that he had to ride the bus home from school,"" Brianne Torrez said. ""What if something else had happened on the bus? It's definitely a very unfortunate situation.""An investigation of the incident is ongoing, according to Defiance County Prosecuting Attorney Morris Murray, who said that ""a lot of additional information needs to be gathered.""Defiance City Schools Superintendent Bob Morton released a statement regarding the incident:""Some of you are aware of an incident that took place at a middle school event yesterday. This incident has received social media attention. We wish to let everyone know this incident was dealt with swiftly by the middle school administration and local law enforcement.

"At UN, Biden urges ‘global action on shared challenges’",-1.33,46.33,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/21/at-un-biden-urges-global-action-on-shared-challenges,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-21,25,"US President Joe Biden has criticised over-reliance on military power and promised to pursue global diplomacy to tackle international issues, including theCOVID-19 pandemic,climate change and cyber threats.In his first speech as US president at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden called for cooperation in the “global community” to address what he called “urgent and looming crises” across the world.In calling for multilateralism, Biden drew a contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump – who withdrew the US from several UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation and UN Human Rights Council – without naming him.“We’re back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and to spur global action on shared challenges,” Biden said.With the end of Washington’smilitary involvementin Afghanistan, Biden said the US will focus its energy and commitment to the future.“I stand here today for the first time in 20 years with the United States not at war,” he said.While stressing that the US will defend itself by force if needed, Biden said the military power should be a tool of “last resort”, adding that some of the biggest problems facing the world cannot be solved with weapons.“Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants,” the US president told the General Assembly. “To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world.”Biden called for creating a “new mechanism” to fund global health security. He also pledged to work with Congress to double Washington’s contributions to an international fund to tackle climate crises in developing nations.In an apparent message to China, Biden said Washington is not seeking a new Cold War with its strategic competitors.“The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement in other areas,” He said.“We’ll all suffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19, climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation,” Biden added.The USdrew China’s ireearlier last week when it announced asecurity partnershipwith the UK and Australia that will see Washington and London help the Australian military acquire nuclear-powered submarines.Chinese officials called the pact “extremely irresponsible”, accusing the US and its allies of undermining international non-proliferation efforts.US, UK and Australian leaders have stressed that the submarines will be powered by nuclear power, not carrying nuclear weapons. Australia is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).On Tuesday, Biden said the US “remains committed” to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, calling for reviving the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran.The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions against its economy.Trump nixed the deal in 2018. Six rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna earlier this year failed to restore the pact.Negotiations have been on ice since June with the election of conservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.“We’re working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically and seek a return to the JCPOA,” Biden said, referring to the original signatories of the agreement – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. “We’re prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does the same.”Raisi, in a recorded message to the UN, said he supported a resumption of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, if it would lead to the US removing sanctions it has imposed on the Iranian economy since 2018.Biden urged using diplomacy, not violence, to resolve tensions in the Middle East, reasserting his administration’s support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“The commitment of the United States to Israel’s security is without question, and our support for an independent, Jewish state is unequivocal,” Biden said.“But I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democratic state living in peace alongside a viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian state.”Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ruled out allowing the establishment of a Palestinian state under his government before ameeting with Bidenat the White House."
Republicans are privately expressing a ‘growing sense of doom’ as polls look grim: report,-10.33,33.0,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/republicans-are-privately-expressing-a-growing-sense-of-doom-as-polls-look-grim-report/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"In a worst-case scenario for Republicans — and a best-case scenario for Democrats — the GOP would not only lose the White House in November, but also, would lose the U.S. Senate and watch Democrats expand their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Journalists Olivia Beavers and Juliegrace Brufke, in anarticle for The Hill, discuss the possibility of a major blue wave in November and the fears that Republican activists are expressing behind closed doors.Some Republicans are privately expressing what Beavers and Brufke describe as a “growing sense of doom.” A GOP source, presumably interviewed on condition of anonymity, told The Hill, “If the election were today, we would lose the House, the Senate and the White House.”Republicans already lost the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, when Democrats achieved a House majority. That source probably meant to say that Democrats would keep their House majority if the election were held today, and Beavers and Brufke note that in order to retake the House in November, Republicans would need a “net 17 seats.”A House Republican, quoted anonymously, told The Hill, “This is the problem: (Trump) continues to allow it to be a referendum on himself. You can’t do that in a competitive race.”Another Republican in the House told The Hill that the GOP’s 2016 playbook isn’t going to work in 2020, when the U.S. is facing the coronavirus pandemic. According to that lawmaker, “People are looking for reassurance.... Chaos worked great in 2016, (but) they don’t want it in 2020. They want to know that we’re trusting science and doctors on the questions here, and they want to know we’re going to get through it. There needs to be more FDR fireside chats and less Jerry Springer knockdowns.”Some polling released byQuinnipiac Universitythis week shows why some of the Republicans that spoke to The Hill are so pessimistic.According to Quinnipiac, Democrats are highly competitive in some high-profile Senate races. In deep red South Carolina, Quinnipiac found that incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham — who has been a fixture in the Senate since the early 2000s — is tied with Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison at 44%. And in Maine, Quinnipiac found that Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, is trailing Democratic challenger Sara Gideon by 4%. Collins, in the past, was reelected by double digits; now, according to Quinnipiac, she is in danger of being voted out of office.Quinnipiac found that in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leading Democrat Amy McGrath by 5%. That poll was much better news for McGrath than aMorning Consult pollreleased earlier this week; Morning Consult found McConnell ahead of McGrath by 17%. But in South Carolina, Morning Consult found Graham leading Harrison byonly 1%.Of course, poll numbers can change. In 1988’s presidential election, there were summer polls that showed Democrat Mike Dukakis defeating then-Vice President George H.W. Bush — whose poll numbers improved considerably in the fall. And Bush 41 enjoyed a decisive victory over Dukakis that year. But the U.S. was not facing a deadly pandemic in 1988.Interviewed by The Hill, Rep. Liz Cheney expressed confidence that Trump will defeat Biden in November. But what Republicans say publicly and what they say behind closed doors can vary considerably. And another Republican source, quoted anonymously, told The Hill that Trump isn’t going to win over conservative women by expressing “meanness” or attacking a member of his coronavirus task force like Dr. Deborah Birx.“Conservative women want to see empathy and compassion and don’t like meanness,” that GOP source argued. “We are doing really poorly with married, white women. I do not at all understand the Deborah Birx attack at all — not politically and not morally.”"
1933 Film Shows Left’s Ageless Fondness for Fascism,29.33,29.0,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/04/1933_film_shows_lefts_ageless_fondness_for_fascism.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-thinker-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-28,25,"Like many Americans, I have watched too many movies during this seemingly unending stretch of glorified house arrest.Many of these films I have found on Turner Classic Movies. Even back in the good old days, when I was a free citizen of the United States -- remember that place? -- TCM was my default channel.Yes, I know, leftist TCM maven Ben Mankiewicz co-founded the proudly stupid “The Young Turks,” but he and the other hosts keep their politics out of it. Better still, TCM shows uncut movies others do not dare,Blazing Saddlesincluded.By now, I have seen most of TCM’s movies, but one aired this past week I had not even heard of. On a whim, I DVR’ed it. Good move. CalledGabriel Over the White House, this 1933 liberal wet dream proved to be the most unapologetic celebration of fascism ever put on film.I watched it wide-eyed. The movie opens with the inauguration of Jud Hammond. A laissez-faire back-slapper, Hammond sees the White House as a way to enrich himself and reward his cronies, Depression be damned. The audience assumes Hammond is a Republican.Out joyriding one day, Hammond crashes his car and lapses into coma. While still comatose, the Angel Gabriel visits Hammond and turns him into a committed and caring progressive. Is there another kind?Upon waking, Hammond convenes his cabinet of corrupt self-servers and rejects their plea that the party must come first. Instead, Hammond insists their first priority be the American people. He refuses to use the U.S. Army against a marching mass of the unemployed and fires the secretary of state when he objects.“I suggest you read the Constitution of the United States. You’ll find the President has some power,” Hammond warns his cabinet members. Some power? Fully indifferent to the Constitution, Hammond grabs all the power that can possibly be grabbed.When the cabinet objects to his usurpation of power, Hammond fires the cabinet. When Congress threatens to impeachHammond, he declares martial law and dispenses with Congress. When accused of being a dictator, Hammond argues that his is a dictatorship based on some imagined Jeffersonian principle of Democracy, namely the greatest good for the greatest number of people.Now with total power, Hammond enacts a national banking law, stops foreclosures, provides direct aid to some 55 million farmers, circumvents private industry and launches his own “Army of Construction.”A young aide, Hartley Beekman, and his female counterpart, Pendie Molloy, serve as something of a progressive chorus. “The way he thinks is so simple and honest that it sounds a little crazy,” says Beekman of Hammond.“He’s doing the things you wanted,” Molloy answers. “And If he’s mad, it’s a divine madness. Look at the chaos and catastrophe sane men have brought about.”The divine madness includes the creation of a Federal Police force, a subset of the Army, with young Beekman at its head. When the nation’s chief racketeer refuses to go back to his unnamed home country, Hammond warns him that the government is about to “muscle in on his racket” and federalize the sale of alcohol.The racketeer fights back, and Beekman employs a legion of tanks Waco-style against the racketeers. When captured, the racketeers are all hauled before a three-man court martial headed by Beekman, promptly declared guilty, and executed en masse by a firing squad.Watching this story unfold, I kept thinking that Hammond or Beekman or Molloy or someone would have a moment of reckoning and say, gosh, maybe we’ve gone too far, but that never happens.After coercing the world’s nations into disarmament by none too subtly threatening their leaders with aerial mass destruction, President Hammond collapses. As he lies on his deathbed, his face morphs into that of Abraham Lincoln.While strains of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” waft in the background, Molloy, played by real life Communist Karen Morley, declares, “He’s proved himself one of the greatest men who ever lived.”William Randolph Hearst, then a Franklin Roosevelt fan, financed the movie and helped shape its message. Louis B. Mayer, a Republican, did not read the script prior to production and hated the end product. He released it nonetheless, and it did well at the box office. FDR, who took office soon after the movie was released, reportedly loved the film. Indeed, he seems to have modeled several of his programs on Hammond’s.Before the events of the last few months reminded us of the left’s reflexive fondness for fascism, the few critics reviewing the movie thought it a warning about Donald Trump. Of course they did. If self-awareness has never been a liberal strong suit, projection was, is, and always will be."

That logo, first used in 1947, pictured a red-faced and smiling cartoon man wearing a single feather. Native American activists said it was an offensive racial caricature.The Cleveland Guardians owe their new moniker to the ""Guardians of Traffic"" statues on a local bridge.The Guardians have a new logo too - a baseball flanked with winged letter Gs.Actor Tom Hanks narrated the team's Twitter video reveal of the changes.""It has always been Cleveland that has been the best part of our name,"" he said. ""This is the city we love and the game we believe in and together we are all Cleveland Guardians.""These changes come amid widespread pressure to drop racist and offensive team names across the country.Last July, amid pressure from lawmakers and activists, Washington DC's American football team announced it was dropping its ""Redskins"" name. They have since been called the Washington Football Team.Activists also hope to change the names of a number of other teams that continue to invoke Native American stereotypes, including the Atlanta Braves, Chicago Blackhawks, and Kansas City Chiefs.This video can not be playedWashington NFL team drop controversial name and logoMore music stars change their 'unacceptable' namesWhat's changed since George Floyd's death?"

( July 18-19, 2020.) As most of you probably know these demonstrations have been going on in front of the Federal Justice  Center for over 50 straight nights. Since Trump called in the Feds, the  turmoil and violence has escalated. We all know what Trump is doing, the Feds are baiting the demonstrators, and when they react to the  police violence, Fox News is there to convince the American people that the demonstrators are the bad guys, and the police are the good guys. This is a political recipe that is as old as lying itself. The Feds and  the News want to shape public opinion that these violent protests are being committed by mobs of anarchists and thugs. Now, if the American people really want to know about mobs and thugs, they can go back in  history and examine the U.S. Empire, when their military is sent all over the world to steal and murder for corporate profits. But, I am getting ahead of myself, as the U.S. swarming locust have come to Portland to convince people all over the nation that the Federal Government is protecting us  from violent descent. The murder of George Floyd, and so many other  Black Americans has set off a powerful Rebellion. Black Lives Matter  has awakened, and it has become the consciousness of a sleeping giant.The last couple of nights have been very intense, as I have been tear gassed  and shot at with a projectile round while carrying 2 Nikon cameras shooting  as fast as I can take pictures. I am 75, but when the adrenaline is pumping and   you are running from the cops, my engine body is 35. It’s either that, or you fall  flat on your face and inhale mass quantities of CS gas. If you are close to the cops, you never know what they will launch. In this article, I am including two photographs.The  first photo was taken on July 18, 2020. I was very fortunate to get this image, because shortly after I took it, I got consumed by CS gas. That gas makes you very  humble, as you just turn and get the hell out of that space. Shortly after that I got my eyes washed out by a medic. This picture, as you might recognize, is now a video   that has gone viral with over nine million hits. The protester in the picture is a   Navy vet, Christopher David, who is 53, and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.This was his first demonstration, and he made a huge introduction into the world  of bearing witness. If you look at the picture closely, his right hand is trying to  block the cop’s hand as the cop is hitting him with pepper spray, which you can see. While this is going on, another cop his hitting Christopher David on the legs  with a long baton. That cop also hit him in the hand and broke two bones. And,  while this is all going on CS gas is everywhere. Seconds after I took this picture, this Navy vet turns the opposite direction and flips the cops off with both fingers. This  is a remarkable story, as this protester stood his fucking ground.The bottom phot is an image I took on July 19, 2020. On this  particular night, the cops chased us a couple of blocks. They then started firing projectiles at us from a couple of different weapons, to include more tear gas. As you can see in  this picture, the cop on the far right has just fired a munition round. One round  set off a fire, which the protesters quickly put out. I took a few more pictures of the cops firing what they like to call less than lethal riot munitions. As the cops  backed away from the intersection, one of them fired a round at me, as I saw it coming and hurriedly stepped out of the way, as it missed me by a few feet. I  can’t imagine taking a direct hit from one of these rounds, because it can kill  you if it hits you in the head. This is exactly what almost happened to a 26-year-old  man last week who was hit in the head by a projectile across the street from the Federal Justice Center. His name is Donavan La Bella. He was knocked  unconscious, and you can still see his blood on the sidewalk. He was sent to  the hospital where emergency reconstructive surgery was performed. He  will survive.It is hard to tell where this stand-off with the police is going. The Feds don’t  know this town, so they think they can control the tens of thousands of activists who live in Portland, Oregon, which George H.W. Bush labeled, ” Little Beirut.”The Feds are playing a chess game with Portland. If there is more overwhelming  violence against protesters, and more people get injured, or possibly killed, the  call from social media will bring out 50 thousand people to the streets. I have  been around these black belt protesters a lot, they are fearless, and I might say, they have become professional. As John Lewis once said: ” Find a way to get in the way.” His legacy is now in Portland, Oregon. I need to close, as John Lewis is calling me to prepare for another night."

But their efforts have slowed after the Legislature made theunprecedented move to extend the two-year sessionpast its typical July 31 end.Discussion on the bill has moved behind closed doors as House and Senate delegates work to reconcile competing versions that differ in their handling of qualified immunity, facial recognition technology and no-knock warrants, to name a few issues.Lawmakers are prohibited from talking about the ongoing discussions as all conference committee debate is being held in executive session.“We’re still working at it,” Sen.

Exclusive — Pence: Biden's ‘Bad Policy’ Could Derail Pandemic Recovery,18.67,25.0,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2021/07/18/exclusive-mike-pence-bidens-bad-policy-threatens-short-circuit-american-recovery/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"Pence’s comments came in a wide-ranging interview Friday evening about the Biden agenda and the upcoming midterm elections at the Family Leadership Summit after he gave remarks to a crowd of about a thousand Christian conservatives in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. While Pence has made a number of speeches since leaving office on January 20 this year, this interview with Breitbart News is his first since he left office.“The extension of, the plus-up on unemployment benefits by the Biden administration has worked a real hardship on small businesses and our recovery,” Pence said. “Look, this economy started to recover in the summer of 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the American people and the rightness of our agenda. With tax cuts, and rolling back regulations, and unleashing American energy, and America First trade deals, we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created 7 million jobs. I believe it also was the foundation on which America has made this historic recovery and in so many ways what the Biden administration has done and continues to do — and adding to that they’re pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largest spending bill in American history — I think what the Biden administration is doing threatens to short-circuit the American recovery we all long to see and that is underway. It is. But I think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets are starting to respond to the big government solutions — higher taxes, more regulation — being planned and coming out of this administration. That’s why we got to fight back and fight back hard.”Pence said he is “incredibly proud” of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for holding House Republicans together “in opposing the radical left agenda of [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.” He pointed specifically to that $1.9 trillion coronavirus spending plan, passed in March along purely partisan lines in both the U.S. House and Senate, that extended the newly-created federal unemployment benefits program that, at the beginning of the pandemic, supplemented similar state benefits. Combined, the federal and state benefits collected together could often pay people more to not work than to actually work — something that has led to small businesses like restaurants and stores across America having trouble hiring employees. The federal government never before offered supplemental unemployment insurance benefits. But, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration — with support on a bipartisan basis in Congress — passed such benefits. The program, meant to be temporary as the government was literally telling people to stay home and not work, was extended as part of the partisan plan Biden pushed at the beginning of his presidency. Pence ripped Biden for turning this into a partisan matter.“Even in the early vote on COVID [Chinese coronavirus] relief, they were able to stand united in opposition to a massive spending bill which really was a betrayal of the whole posture our administration had taken during the pandemic with regard to Congress,” Pence said. “Every bill we passed for COVID in Congress passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. We said we’re going to check politics at the door. Everything we did, everything we did was bipartisan. For President Biden and [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi right out of the gate to abandon the bipartisan precedent we had established in combatting the coronavirus pandemic I thought was a betrayal of everything we’d done to bring the Congress together around a united effort to end the pandemic.”It is not just the economic recovery that Biden is bungling, though, Pence said. When it comes to the vaccine, Pence said Biden should give former President Donald Trump and the previous administration credit for developing the vaccine — and getting the rollout up to speed — as there were a million shots a day being administered by the time Trump and Pence left office. Pence said that he does believe Americans generally see through Biden’s politicization of the pandemic.“I couldn’t be more proud of what the American people accomplished over the last year and a half,” Pence said. “Only in America, in the face of a global pandemic, could we reinvent testing from a standing start and do a billion tests within a matter of months. Only in America could you stand up a supply chain and enlist companies to manufacture medical company [sic] and fly medical equipment from all around the world so that no American was ever denied the healthcare that they need facing this pandemic. And only in America could you have the kind of research companies and the kind of innovation at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] that would permit the development of therapeutics and vaccines within nine months. We when we first sat down, when I first became head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we called all of the heads of all of the major pharmaceutical and research companies in — we were in the Cabinet Room. I remember the President asking them how long it would take to get a vaccine? Vaccines take five to seven years, if you can get one. We all said ‘not good enough — what do you need? What needs to happen?’ And that’s where the idea of clearing the way for FDA review and approval without shortcutting safety measures and initiating the idea for Operation Warp Speed because early on we were hearing that several of these vaccines showed very promising returns in the early Phase One trials. We just made the decision we’ll pay you to go ahead and manufacture millions of doses so that, if it’s approved, we won’t wait another year for you to manufacture. The combination of all of those things is an American accomplishment”“The fact that the Biden-Harris administration, that spent much of the campaign talking down a vaccine developed under the Trump-Pence administration, now has seen its way clear to ignore our administration’s efforts is disappointing but not surprising,” Pence lamented. “The thing is, I think the American people see through it. Everywhere I go—today I had a man come alongside me at a picnic I was at in Western Iowa. It was tough. He told me he lost his wife to COVID. But he wanted to express his appreciation to me. I was very moved. I told him ‘I’ll be praying for you and I’m very sorry for your loss.’ He said ‘I just still wanted to thank you for what you’ve done and what the vaccine has meant for other people.’ I just honestly believe the Biden-Harris administration would do well to give credit where credit is due, first to the American people and second to efforts of a prior administration to demonstrate everything we’ve accomplished putting the health of the American people first in this pandemic is a tribute to the American people and American innovation and only in America could we be at a place where we are today where America is coming back and we’re seeing life returning to normal. I flew out to my daughter’s wedding not long ago and couldn’t barely get through the airport and I just found myself walking through the airport thinking ‘Only in America.’”With the upcoming midterm elections, Pence said that Republicans can turn the tide and slam the door shut on the Biden agenda. To retake the U.S. House majority, Republicans only need to flip a net five seats from Democrat hands into GOP hands and, to retake the Senate majority, the GOP only needs to flip a net one seat.“We’ve seen this movie before. I was in Congress in 2010 with a Democrat president, a Democrat Senate, and a Democrat House,” Pence said. “What we did was we brought Republicans together around a unified conservative agenda and we stood strong against the Pelosi majority and we won 63 seats in the House of Representatives in 2010. We won the Senate a few years later and the White House two years after that. I think we’re going to do it all again in the next three and a half years.”Pence said he is noticing “buyer’s remorse across America” with regard to Democrat control in Washington and the Biden agenda.“I heard about it today when I was in western Iowa,” Pence said. “One of the families I met with spoke of a friend who voted for the Biden-Harris ticket and now admitted she was wrong. People see that what Biden is attempting to do is not advance kind of traditional Democrat policies but is literally trying to transform the country into a European-style welfare state.”Pence then called one Biden administration proposal — the implementation of an international minimum corporate tax rate, whereby other countries and the United States would agree to tax entities at the same levels at least and the U.S. would essentially be handing control over tax rates over to some international community entity — “downright un-American.”“You look at the international minimum corporate tax rate that is being orchestrated and discussed with powers around the country that I think is unconstitutional — the power to tax falls squarely with the government and the power to initiate taxes falls squarely with the United States House of Representatives,” Pence said. “The idea that the Treasury Secretary or the Biden administration could negotiate with President Macron to establish a minimum corporate tax rate that would be imposed on our companies is downright un-American. But I think your point is well taken that what the administration is advancing is agenda that is destined to short-circuit the economy but more than that it’s an attempt to transform America into a fundamentally different place than it’s ever been before.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this past week that he intends to try to force a vote on the so-called “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” — for which there still is no bill text — this coming week in the U.S. Senate. Combined with that, the Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are backing a separate but parallel plan that would spend another $3.5 trillion through reconciliation — which allows them to use a budget gimmick to pass bills out of the Senate with a simple majority. Pence warned his Republican friends in the U.S. Senate against going along with this plan.“With regard to the infrastructure bill, I will just tell you during my years in Congress I always thought it was good to let your yes be yes and let your no be no,” Pence said. “And I’d rather Republicans in the Senate simply made it clear that unless all the Green New Deal stuff is out, they’re not voting for an infrastructure bill. I think there is great risk in a two-bill strategy that could result in us seeing them advance the radical left’s climate change agenda. I would encourage Republicans to think really hard before going along with a first infrastructure bill as it might pave the way for policies that have very little to do with infrastructure but will stifle American prosperity for generations.”Pence also, as he did in his speech here, told Breitbart News about how during the Trump administration the United States became energy independent — and a net exporter of energy — for the first time in 70 years. But, he said, Biden has already undermined that.“America is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” Pence said. “This administration, with its climate change agenda, has set itself against the American people permitting to use the resources of our land in an environmentally responsible way. But what’s incomprehensible to me is that President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline but approved the Russian pipeline to western Europe. Think about that? One of your first acts in office is to kill a natural gas pipeline in the United States of America — one that had been tied up for years, one that we cleared the way on, and one that would add to our energy infrastructure — and then to allow Nordstream 2 to go forward? We have tens of thousands of troops in western Europe ostensibly under the mission of NATO protecting Europe from Russian aggression. The idea that they would now pave the way for European countries to become dependent on Russia for natural gas — it’s incomprehensible to me. What we ought to be doing is seeing our European trading partners building ports to be able to import natural gas from the United States of America. Again, what you’re seeing is I think an administration that’s lapsing back into the bad policy decisions of the past and they were policy decisions that the American people were glad to see our administration overturn to the benefit of an incredible boom economy before the coronavirus pandemic struck.”Pence also ripped the Biden administration — and specifically his successor as vice president, Kamala Harris — for mishandling the border crisis.“The Biden-Harris administration took the most secure border in American history and has turned it into the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime,” Pence said. “Suspending construction on the wall, ending the policies that we put into effect that had ended asylum abuse, I thought it was one of the signature accomplishments of our administration. President Trump tapped me and Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo to sit down in the Roosevelt Room and negotiate out an agreement that anyone applying for asylum in the United States would be required to remain in Mexico. It had been talked about for years and years and in the early years of our administration the Mexicans were only allowing it on a fraction of their border, so President Trump said ‘we’re going to tariff everything coming across the border from Mexico unless you agree to the remain in Mexico policy.’ The secretary of state and I sat down with the Mexican foreign minister and the ambassador and, over the course of several days, we negotiated and secured a remain in Mexico agreement for the entire southern border. That, which essentially ended catch and release on the southern border, sent a message to the northern triangle countries of Central America that the opportunity to game the system was over.”Pleaselet us knowif you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2024 Breitbart"
George Floyd's Daughter Told The Judge Sentencing Derek Chauvin How Much She Misses Her Dad,-2.0,41.33,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/gianna-floyd-george-daughter-victim-statement,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,25,"Gianna Floyd gives a victim impact statement over video.The sentencing of former police officer Derek Chauvin on Friday began with a heartbreaking surprise guest: George Floyd's 7-year-old daughter Gianna talking about how she misses her daddy.""I ask about him all the time,” said Gianna in a victim impact statement delivered to the Minneapolis court via video testimony. “I want to play with him.""Chauvin was found guiltyin April on all three charges of murder and manslaughter, after he pressed his knee into Floyd's neck until he stopped breathing and died.On Friday he was sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison.The sentencing is the first time that Gianna, who had attended press conferences and visited the White House with her family, has spoken extensively in public about the loss of her father.""I want to play with him, have fun, go on a plane ride,” said Gianna, wearing a striped bow-tie headband as she spoke over FaceTime.She told the court how she used to have mints with her dad ""every single night before we went to bed.""""My daddy always used to help me brush my teeth,"" said Gianna.Floyd's murder, captured on video, sparked a worldwide protest movement against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.""Daddy changed the world,"" saidGianna in a viral video shot last June, shortly after Floyd's death.Gianna Floyd, the daughter ofGeorge Floyd, on May 25, 2021, at the US Capitol in Washington, DC.But on Friday, Gianna's comments reflected the horrors of a child having a murdered parent.""I was asking, 'How did my dad get hurt?'"" said Gianna in her testimony on Friday, later adding, ""Those mean people did something to him.”When asked what Gianna wanted to tell her dad, the little girl didn't hesitate for a moment.“It would be, 'I miss you and I love you,'"" she said."
Supreme Court sides with Nestle and Cargill in case alleging child slavery,-0.67,48.33,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-sides-with-u-s-companies-in-case-alleging-wrongdoing-abroad/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,25,"The Supreme Court  sided with food giants Nestle and Cargill on Thursday and threw out a  lawsuit that claimed they knowingly bought cocoa beans from farms in  Africa that used child slave labor.The justices ruled 8-1 that an appeals court  improperly let the lawsuit against the food companies go forward. The  companies had been sued by a group of six adult citizens of Mali who  claimed they were taken from their country as children and forced to  work on cocoa farms in neighboring Ivory Coast.""Although respondents' injuries occurred entirely overseas, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents could sue in federal court  because the defendant corporations allegedly made 'major operational  decisions' in the United States. The Ninth Circuit erred by allowing  this suit to proceed,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a majority  opinion for the court.The case had been twice dismissed at an early stage before being revived by the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. When the case was argued in December,  then-President Donald Trump's administration backed Nestle and Cargill.The  Malian citizens had argued that Minneapolis-based Cargill and the  American arm of Switzerland-based Nestle ""aided and abetted"" their  slavery as children by, among other things, buying cocoa beans from  farms that used child labor. The group sued, seeking to bring a class  action lawsuit on behalf of themselves, as well as who they say are thousands of  other former child slaves.Nestle  and Cargill have maintained throughout the case that they have done  nothing wrong and that they have taken steps to combat child slavery. In  statements following the ruling both Nestle and Cargill repeated that  they remain committed to working to combat child labor in the cocoa  industry.The  case involves a law enacted by the very first Congress in 1789, the  Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreign citizens to sue in U.S. courts for human rights abuses. But Thomas said this case wasn't properly in U.S. courts.""Nearly  all the conduct that they say aided and abetted forced labor —  providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms —  occurred in Ivory Coast. ... But allegations of general corporate  activity — like decisionmaking — cannot alone establish domestic  application of the ATS,"" he wrote.Attorney Paul Hoffman, who argued the case for the Malian citizens at the high court, said in a statement that he was ""disappointed that the Court has delayed our clients' long quest for justice."" But he said it was not the end of the case. He said intends to ask a lower court  to be allowed to amend the group's lawsuit and allege that Cargill and  Nestle ""controlled the system of forced labor from the United States.""The high court in recent years has limited the use of the Alien Tort Statute. In 2018, the court ruled that foreign businesses cannot be sued under the law. In that case, the court rejected an attempt by Israeli victims of attacks in the West Bank and Gaza to use U.S. courts to sue Jordan-based Arab Bank, which they said helped finance the attacks.The case is Nestle USA v. Doe I, 19-416, and Cargill Inc. v. Doe I, 19-453."
House Speaker Michael Madigan says it’s not ‘ethically improper’ to find government jobs for people. Here’s what he’s failing to mention.,7.0,49.33,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-speaker-madigan-com-ed-patronage-scandal-letter-20201002-6wsggdldbrbfjezdtkob4q7ro4-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-10-02,25,"For years, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has defended his aggressive push to land political allies and their friends and family on taxpayer-funded payrolls, but rarely has he waxed as philosophically about it as he did last week in a three-page letter.Facing intense pressure from a federal investigation into ComEd’s bribes-for-favors scandal andan invitation from a House corruption committeeto tell the public what he knows, Madigan’s missive broke two months of near silence. The powerful speaker loudly proclaimed his innocence and tried to reframe his penchant for patronage hiring as a virtue.Not only is “helping people find jobs not a crime,” Madigan wrote, it’s not even “ethically improper” for politicians to make job recommendations.“To the contrary, I believe that it is part of my duties as a community and political leader to help good people find work — from potential executives to college interns, and more,” wrote the 78-year-old Illinois Democratic Party chairman, alluding to some of the very jobs that prosecutors brought up in charging ComEd with crimes. “What an employer chooses to do with that recommendation rests solely with their discretion.”What Madigan didn’t mention when discussing the numerous jobs he’s secured for people during more than 50 years in politics is how that practice has benefited him and what it’s cost taxpayers and electricity ratepayers.The Tribune hasspent the last decadechronicling how it works: Patronage jobs are the lifeblood of Madigan’s political organization. And the people Madigan recommends be hired often serve as foot soldiers on the campaigns for the very legislative seats that allow the speaker to stay in power. In turn, that control of the House is key to helping Madigan bring in clients at his law firm, which handles high-dollar property tax appeals on some of Chicago’s biggest buildings.Starting in 2010,the Tribune publishedthe “The Madigan Rules,” a first-of-its-kind, yearslong investigation that exposed how the speaker built his political empire and law practice, revealing how those two careers repeatedly intersected. The report found that in some cases Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients, though the speaker said his “personal code of conduct” ensured he maintained “high ethical standards.”In 2013, the legislature’s watchdoginvestigated Madigan’s rolein a Metra scandal after the commuter rail agency’s then-executive directorcontended he was muscled outfor not acceding to the speaker’s patronage demands.More recently, Madigan even answered questions about patronage under oath in what he said washis first-ever deposition. During testimony as part of a lawsuit, Madigan made clear he knows the finer points of his vaunted patronage army.Beyond that, the current ComEd probe has put under the spotlight another practice that’s gone on at the Capitol under Madigan: the cycle of House Democratic staffers and friendly lawmakerswho leave and then landa hefty stable of lobbying clients in part based on their perceived access to the speaker. Those lobbyists often become part of a campaign fundraising network that provides money to help Madigan-backed candidates.Though they’re not drawing a government salary, those lobbyists also contribute to the policies enacted in Springfield that affect the pockets of taxpayers.The speaker has not been charged in the ComEd case. He has denied wrongdoing.“As I have said before, I have done nothing wrong,” Madigan wrote in his letter, which explainedwhy he would not appearbefore the House panel looking at the ComEd scandal. “I believe that (the federal) investigation, once all of the facts are made available to the public, will demonstrate that I have not engaged in any improper conduct.”Speaker’s playbookWhile the ComEd investigation represents the gravest threat Madigan has faced to his reign, it’s not the first time his government and political operation has come under public scrutiny.In itsinvestigative series, the Tribune reported that public records showed Madigan’s law firm in 2008 represented 45 of the 150 most valuable downtown buildings ? more than twice what the closest rival represented. Some clients said it’s not that simple to separate the expert tax assistance the firm provides from the political reputation of the man whose name is on the door.At that time, Madigan ally Joe Berrios sat in judgment over property tax appeals that Madigan’s firm filed. Berrios doubled as a state lobbyist, plying his trade inside a Capitol where Madigan held sway. In 2010, Madigan helped Berrios get elected county assessor, giving him power over how all property is valued for property tax purposes. Madigan’s firmdid well on appeals when Berrioswas assessor.The Tribune also found Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients. As a public official, he got a private road behind a shopping mall repaved, helped secure state funding for an expanded tollway interchange and intervened for a developer looking for state cash. In each case, Madigan was a private lawyer for businesspeople who stood to benefit.Madigan said there were no conflicts of interest in the Tribune’s findings, which he described as “strained attempts to link my legislative actions to clients of the firm who might remotely and incidentally ‘benefit’ from such action.”In 2012,the Tribune reportedon how a large operator of assisted living homes signed on with Madigan’s law firm and found itself with several Springfield wins. Nursing homes, pharmacies and other assisted living companies in recent years all have hired the property tax law firm where Madigan is the rainmaker-in-chief. As speaker, Madigan made decisions affecting the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket, the Tribune found.Madigan said he abides by a written personal code of conduct to avoid conflicts on matters involving clients.In addition,the Tribune in 2014documented more than 400 current or retired state and local government employees who worked elections for Madigan, donated regularly to his campaign funds, registered voters for him or circulated candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. From the ranks of those workers, Madigan built the most potent ground game in Illinois politics, which he has used to influence elections in every corner of the state, especially state House races.One of those political workers, Raymond Nice, had a six-figure job at the Cook County recorder of deeds office and later briefly was appointed to a county employee panel. More recently, prosecutors alleged that Nice was designated a subcontractor and had payments funneled to him through a ComEd lobbyist. Nice did little or no work, prosecutors said.Metra scandalThat look at Madigan’s patronage army was spurred by a scandal at Metra over whether the speaker went a step too far in trying to exert his clout as he navigated the intersection of public business and ward-style patronage through his Chicago office and Illinois Capitol suite.Metra CEO Alex Clifford contended his tenure was shortened because he didn’t bow to Madigan’s patronage demands. According to Clifford, the speaker wanted Metra to give a raise to a 13th Ward acolyte who was a labor relations specialist and secure a job for another person who was not identified.Clifford refused. In the end, he walked away with a severance package worth up to $871,000 — a controversy that ended up with public hearings.“I thought it was an ethical and moral character flaw,” Clifford testified about Madigan’s actions.A secret 2014 watchdog reportobtained by the Tribuneconcluded that “insufficient evidence” existed to say Madigan violated the state ethics act or other related laws in the Metra scandal.But Thomas Homer, the legislative inspector general at the time, issued a statement noting that “a decision to close an investigation based on insufficient evidence does not constitute a Good Housekeeping seal of approval or a best practices award.”Madigan, who requested the Metra investigation at the height of the scandal, was quoted in the report as speaking highly of one operative the speaker backed for a promotion.“You can understand that there are many people that are involved with me and campaigns and community service. Among these many people, some are better than others. (He) happens to be one of those who is better than others,” the speaker is said to have told Homer.The report also highlighted how Metra’s then-board chair once entered Madigan’s Capitol office to talk about government issues and left with a yellow Post-it note bearing the names of two workers the speaker wanted to see promoted — moves the board chair later told the Tribune she didn’t make.And the report outlined how Clifford recalled a similar meeting in which a then-Metra lobbyist with strong Madigan ties was spotted carrying two resumes out of Madigan’s office.In his report, Homer wrote that the proximity of Madigan’s discussions first about government issues and then shifting to his favored employees “created the impression among Metra officials that the speaker’s support for Metra’s legislative initiatives may be linked.”“While this may not have been the speaker’s intention,” Homer wrote, “the natural inferences to be drawn by Metra officials should have been obvious.”ComEd probeLong ago, Madigan learned the ways of Chicago-style patronage under his mentor the late Mayor Richard J. Daley. Since then, Madigan has made so many inroads that at least one pocket of government has earned a nickname in his honor.At the city’s Streets and Sanitation Department’s bureau of electricity, Madigan enjoyed such success in placing people that the agency became known as “Madigan Electric.”That nickname has taken on a different context as the speaker has been linked to the ComEd scandal.ComEd has admitted in federal courtthat it sought to influence legislation in Springfield by arranging for jobs and vendor subcontracts for Madigan’s political allies, approved lobbyists and ward operatives even in instances where they performed little or no work.For instance, ComEd allegedly agreed in May 2018 to pay $5,000 a month to retiring 23rd Ward Ald. Mike Zalewski, an ally from Madigan’s Southwest Side sphere of political influence, as part of a “roster” of Madigan associates.Former Ald. Frank Olivo, who represented Madigan’s 13th Ward power base for years, is among those identified as getting a ComEd subcontract.Victor Reyes, the speaker’s onetime ally, a former political operative for Mayor Richard M. Daley and founder of the now-defunct patronage army the Hispanic Democratic Organization, is in a law firm identified as receiving ComEd legal contracts. The deal was set to shrink, but Reyes talked to a Madigan ally to try to save it from the chopping block, according to federal court records and testimony from a ComEd official.One 2019 meeting involving ComEd officials described matter-of-factly how Madigan had named people for decades to hold lower-ranking power company jobs, such as meter readers ? what one speaker ally called part of an “old-fashioned patronage system,” according to federal authorities.As part of an agreement with prosecutors, ComEdis paying a $200 million fine, the largest ever at Chicago’s federal courthouse. In exchange, federal authorities will drop a charge of bribery against ComEd after three years if the power company cooperates.The federal filings on ComEd also include allegations of Madigan clout involving an individual who was well-versed in the speaker’s ways.Juan Ochoa, the former head of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority,told the Tribunefor a 2014 story that Madigan called him to request a raise for the daughter of a former state senator who once represented Madigan’s Southwest Side neighborhood. Ochoa said the daughter was a hard worker who deserved a raise, and she got it after Madigan’s call.“I didn’t feel like he was putting a gun to me but, then again, he is the speaker of the House,” Ochoa explained at the time. “This was someone who is important to the speaker of the House, who to a great extent controlled our legislation and funding.”These days, federal prosecutors have alleged that in 2017, Madigan sought to appoint Ochoa to ComEd’s board of directors.The request was made by longtime ComEd lobbyist and Madigan confidant Michael McClain to then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, prosecutors said.Pramaggiore received internal company resistance and asked McClain if Madigan would be satisfied if she secured a $78,000 part-time job for Ochoa rather than the board seat, but McClain said the speaker would appreciate if she’d “keep pressing,” according to court documents.Around September 2018, having been elevated to an executive post with Exelon, Pramaggiore allegedly reassured McClain: “You take good care of me and so does our friend (meaning Madigan), and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.”Ochoa was appointed in April 2019, but he is no longer on ComEd’s board.Madigan’s ties to the ComEd scandal were on display on two fronts this week.In Chicago, former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who oversaw lobbying efforts,pleaded guiltyto bribery conspiracy for participating in a long-running jobs scheme designed to influence Madigan’s legislative decisions.In Springfield, Democrats and Republicans in the House debated whether the speaker conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The proceedings were part of an evenly split Special Investigative Committee, one that the nation’s longest-serving legislative leader dismisses as a Republican “stunt” to get free media coverage before the November election.DemocratsrejectedRepublican attempts to subpoena Madigan, Marquez and a lineup of the speaker’s associates who allegedly benefited from jobs and contracts.Madigan’s letter to the committee loomed large at a hearing, where House Republican leader Jim Durkin maintained Democrats would have to disregard ComEd’s admissions to believe the speaker “didn’t know what was going on around him.”In his letter, though, Madigan maintained that ComEd’s agreement with federal prosecutors “does not attribute any misconduct to me. It asserts that certain individuals at ComEd hired individuals I purportedly recommended in an attempt to influence me. But let be me clear: that attempt was never made known to me — if it had been, it would have been profoundly unwelcome.”Under oathWhat does Madigan look for when he makes a job recommendation?A Madigan depositionthe Tribunefirst disclosedlast yeargave a few clues. He acknowledged giving recommendations on behalf of a number of members of his 13th Ward organization for government jobs, ranging from the offices of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to Cook County’s circuit court clerk.Madigan knew the whereabouts of his troops so well that when he was asked about a policy analyst at City Hall, the speaker recalled that person, a member of his ward organization, had switched over to a job at a different government agency.“I recommended him to the (Chicago Housing Authority),” Madigan testified.And he was hired, an attorney asked? “He was hired.”Madigan also had a recommendation to replace the retiring Zalewski in the neighboring 23rd Ward seat when the alderman left the City Council: state Rep. Silvana Tabares.Who did you talk to, the speaker was asked?“Rahm Emanuel,” Madigan said.The then-mayor appointed Tabares to the seat.At another point, Madigan was pressed on whether it is his standard practice to recommend precinct captains for positions in various levels of government.“You can understand that many people come to me asking for recommendations for employment, and I render recommendations for employment in both the private and the public sector. I do it in both. But there’s a test that people have to meet,” he replied.“They have to be, to my knowledge, they have to be honest, hardworking people with integrity. And if they are, I’ll recommend to a potential employer the best of my knowledge and my experience with this person, this would be a good worker for your office, a good worker for your business whatever it may be.”rlong@chicagotribune.com"

On Wednesday, more than 260 flights, about 7% of its schedule, were canceled and more than 300 were delayed, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.""While our technology issues from Tuesday have been resolved, we are still experiencing a small number of cancelations and delays across our network as we continue working to resume normal operations,"" Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement Wednesday.Southwest said it is investigating the issue and doesn't have reason to believe it's connected to Monday's problem with a weather data supplier that delayed hundreds of flights.The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday had issued a brief, nationwide ground stop for Southwest, which prevents its flights from taking off to avoid overwhelming destinations.More than 1,690 Southwest flights were delayed Tuesday, close to half of the carrier's schedule, according to FlightAware.On Monday, 1,541 Southwest flights, about 41% of its schedule, were delayed, according to the site.The airline said that its operations on were disrupted Monday evening after its ""third-party weather provider experienced intermittent performance issues"" but told employees earlier Tuesday that it was in ""relatively good shape"" as operations resumed.The issues occurred just as airlines like Southwest are flying an increasing number of travelers as demand rebounds fromthe coronavirus pandemic.Carriers are grappling with a surge in customers along with employee reductions after they offeredbuyoutsand other packages to cut costs in the pandemic. Southwest,Delta Air LinesandAmerican Airlines, for example, have warned travelers about long hold times for customer service and encouraged them to use self-service options.While Southwest's issue Tuesday appeared to have only briefly impacted its systems, longer-lasting technology issues or outages can be costly. Delta estimated an August 2016 data center outage that led to about 2,300 cancelations over three days cost it about $150 million in pretax income that quarter."

“Settle for Biden” Instagram Account Hopes to Influence Young Voters,-5.67,46.0,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/settle-for-biden-instagram-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"Rememberthe mid-2010s, when memes of Vice President Joe Biden became so ubiquitous that he couldn’t hold anice cream cone,wear aviator sunglasses, or showaffectionto President Barack Obama without unleashing a fresh serving of shareable content? Or when Twitter agreed we would most definitely allow ayoungeriteration of the current Democratic presidential nominee to leave us on read?Now, those trends feel like totems of a more stable time gone by — one in which many young peoplesupportedthe nation’s top leaders and felt they were doing an okay job. Their attitudes towards those in or seeking power have since grown much more complicated. Biden’slack of interestin defunding the police or embracing “Medicare for All,” combined with hishistoryof allegations of inappropriate behavior toward women (which he has vehemently denied), have leftincreasingly progressiveGen Z and millennial voters with a moreapathetic viewof the former vice president.Recentpollshave indicated that while people between the ages of 18 to 29 say they’d choose Biden over Donald Trump, they have a less favorable view of him than older registered voters — and young voterstend to turn outat lower rates than their older counterparts.One increasingly popular Instagram account is trying to disrupt these expectations, encouraging young voters to simply “settle” for the former VP.This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.In late spring, as it became abundantly clear that Biden would win the nomination, Sam Weinberg, a 19-year-old Illinois native and former backer of Senator Bernie Sanders’s candidacy, experienced what he called “a bit of an internal freakout.”“I just thought, 'I’m going to do everything within my personal power to make sure that Donald Trump doesn’t have a second term,’ because I know that I certainly don’t have it in me to deal with four more years of Trump and the people who are going to be even more affected certainly don’t have it within them,” he toldTeenVogue.Thus, Settle for Biden was born. In Weinberg’s words, the Instagram account slash digital organizing platform is, “a combination of sardonic millennial and Gen Z humor combined with...you know, substantive policy proposals.”The introductorypostfrom early April, which garnered more than 600 likes — as well as comments like, “Burn in hell, everything that comes out of your mouths is a lie,” and quite simply, “no thanks” — noted that the page’s founders saw Biden as “bad,” but better than our current president, encouraging followers to shift their support to the nominee.“Now is not the time to be petty; now is the time to defeat Donald Trump and his dangerous agenda,” Weinberg warned in the post.The account’s follower list has since shot up to more than 129,000 and includes major public figures, from actor Kerry Washington to noted activists like Black Lives Matter cofounder Patrisse Cullors. Weinberg, who says he managed the account by himself until June, has had to expand operations due to its unexpected success.By enlisting a bevy of student volunteers, like Aditya Bhalla, a friend who attends Pomona College, Weinberg has built what he refers to as “a grassroots collective,” of other young former supporters of Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren across the United States. In addition to Instagram, the group now produces content for Twitter and Facebook, and is currently in talks with a few other digital organizing platforms.Bhalla, a double major in political science and math, is charged with creating some of the viral-worthy graphics, includingoneof famous abolitionist and Black Panther Angela Davis, whosaidin July that she would cast a vote for Biden’s bid because he “can be most effectively pressured” by the left. Alongside her photo was the question, “She’s settling for Biden. Why can’t you?”Just after Senator Kamala Harris was announced as Biden’s pick for vice president, Bhalla made agraphiccomparing Pence and Harris that highlighted the stark differences between the two — from opinions on climate justice toRoe v. Wade. It would soon become the most-liked post on the account, boasting nearly 41,000 likes as of late August. For Bhalla, “settling” applies to both candidates on the ticket.This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.“People view Kamala’s record as a prosecutor and say she’s just as bad, and I understand that. I understand why Kamala wouldn’t be your ideal choice for vice president,” he toldTeen Vogue. “At the same time, I do think there is a certain amount of value in terms of being the first Black female vice president. She’s half Indian. She has a very far-left Senate record, and I do think that has value.”Though Trump’s record was more than enough for Weinberg and Bhalla to back Biden, they’re keenly aware that getting others to coalesce around the Democratic nominee won’t be quite so simple.Weinberg described hate mail as “frequent,” but says he remains unfazed. His focus is on encouraging the persuadable to come around to his side, noting that Instagram users have repeatedly reached out to credit the account’s content for convincing their friends to register to vote.“This is the first election year where millennials and Gen Z will make up [such a large percentage] of eligible voters. But all odds are that they will not be the majority of people who actually cast ballots, so, we’re doing everything that we can to make sure that young people go to the polls and vote for the right person,” he explained.This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.Bhalla, on the other hand, is more empathetic to fellow young supporters of former candidates like Sanders and Warren who feel reluctant to shift their support to an establishment Democrat.“I think initially, my thought process before shifting to settling for Biden was that Democrats and Republicans are kind of on two sides of the same coin. They’re both controlled by the corporate elite. There’s a lot of money in politics, so it really doesn’t matter. But as time went on and the coronavirus continued to grow, we saw howDonald Trump handled protesters outside the White House, how he continues tosabotage the Postal Serviceand to me, those are threats to democracy,” Bhalla said. “Biden isn’t going to fix all of our problems, but he is not going to threaten a lot of the institutions that we do hold sacred, including our right to free and fair elections.”Weinberg’s mix of “sardonic humor” and “flashy” graphics may not ultimately convince young people to cast ballots. This isn’t 2016. People are more suspicious of how candidates are marketed online. However, Bhalla is banking on two things very relevant to young people: peer pressure and social media trends.“That 18-to-24 demographic is very involved, they’re paying attention, they’re protesting on their social media feeds, they’re reposting things about how to be an ally, how to be an advocate, how to become more politically involved. The way we see it, maybe we can capitalize on this recent shift in social media,” he says. “If you see a lot of people around you voting and posting that they’re voting and saying, ‘I’m going to vote,’ perhaps it has an effect on the rest of the demographic.”Weinberg and Bhalla won’t say whether or not they think Biden will actually win or whether or not they’ll be able to deliver on their platform’s mission, but they are optimistic about being able to continue to push the party left, with Bhalla pointing to the recent wins of progressive congressional candidates likeBlack Lives Matter organizer Cori Bush in MissouriandRepresentative Ilhan Omar’s resounding reelection victory in Minneapolis. “Settling,” it seems, is just one step in a continued fight to elect more progressives to office and keep up the pressure on Biden. But for now, the Settle for Biden team is focused on November.“Voting is one of the easiest things [youth] can do to make the changes they want to see, whether that’s the climate crisis, making college affordable, increasing the minimum wage,” Bhalla said. “Those are all things that are part of the Biden platform, and if people really care about those things, then they will go out and vote.”"
Symbols and Words from the Pope in Iraq,1.67,38.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/symbols-and-words-from-the-pope-in-iraq/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-09,25,"Become a member and enjoy the very best from The American Conservative in print & digital.It was the clumps of beard hair on the ground that stay in my memory, even more than the destroyed buildings. Walking around the Old City of Mosul in May 2018, accompanied by an Iraqi police general and armed guards, we were guided along the paths that had been cleared of ISIS booby-traps and unexploded coalition bombs. Several of the churches had only been cleared of bodies in the previous days, and the unpleasant sludge of remains was still visible on the floors.The Islamic State had used many of the churches in the Old City, all now destroyed or severely damaged, as headquarters, prisons, and torture chambers. My friend—a journalist and fellow Englishman traveling with me—remarked that there was human hair on the floor; I told him it was just carpet. Yet as we looked into a room where another body had been, I realized that itwashuman hair, facial hair. The general told us that ISIS fighters had shaved their beards in the last days of fighting in order to avoid capture. During their brutal control of Mosul, where Abu Al-Baghdadi had proclaimed the caliphate, from 2014 to 2017, men of the Islamic State were expected to grow their beards long, and could face 20 lashes if they shaved.Destruction was all around: cars riddled with bullet holes or upside down, and so many buildings destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A year later I was back. The situation had improved somewhat, with some of the rubble cleared and many buildings, including the building where ISIS threw homosexuals from the roof, fully demolished. However, the churches were still in wreckage, and the only church due to reopen was a prefabricated building that had been in a refugee camp in Erbil, which was being moved to Mosul. Virtually no Christian families had returned, and there was no resident priest or bishop.This last Sunday, Pope Francis became not only the first pope in history to visit Iraq, but one of the very few international figures to venture into the Old City of Mosul. His short visit, to the same square, surrounded by the destroyed churches of the different denominations that had once thrived in this ancient city, was a remarkable moment, perhaps the most remarkable picture of the three-day visit to Iraq. It was not so much what he said—he recited a prayer for all the victims of war and violence and called for peace and toleration—but the symbolism of his presence. There is still no resident bishop, only one resident priest, and that pre-fabricated building is now the Church of the Annunciation, the only functioning church in the city. Very few Christian families have returned.Mosul has not been rebuilt and many residents feel that the Iraqi government has greatly neglected the city. It is still considered dangerous, with ISIS cells re-emerging and, more importantly, the different Shia militias (who are the real powerbrokers) vying for control. Add to that the story that was barely touched on by the world media—the desire of an expansionist Turkey to claim back Mosul, a city it once controlled under the Ottoman empire—and the full import of the moment becomes apparent: The pope of Rome came when so many fear to return.Iraq’s beleaguered Christian population, and other religious minorities, especially the Yazidis, hoped that the pope’s visit will bring the world’s attention to their plight, and that the civil powers in both Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government would fully recognize their civil rights. Christians specifically wanted Pope Francis to encourage them, acknowledge the martyrdom that many suffered, and be a voice for their future. His words to Iraqi civic leaders on his arrival, apart from the usual niceties, had two direct challenges that the precarious minority groups wanted to hear: He challenged corruption and “disregard for law” in Iraqi society, and he asked that “no one be considered a second-class citizen.” The Iraqi Constitution treats all non-Muslims as second-class citizens, not equal under the law, so this statement was essential, but not as forceful as many had hoped it would be.Perhaps the most powerful words addressing the suffering Christians had endured were uttered in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation, after the meeting with civil leadership. That was the church where, in 2010, Islamist terrorists had attacked the congregation during mass, detonating suicide vests to kill two priests and more than 40 men, women, and children. The pope described the cathedral as a place “hallowed by the blood of our brothers and sisters who here paid the ultimate price for their fidelity to the Lord and His Church.” He reminded the Christians, and more importantly those who deny the Christian population a place in Iraq, that Iraq is a “land so closely linked to the history of salvation, and you are a part of that history.”Many Christians in Iraq had worried that the emphasis of the Vatican would be on religious dialogue and “Human Fraternity.” And that was certainly a major feature of the visit, referred to in almost every speech. The key moment, joint prayers with other religious groups at the birthplace of Abraham in Ur, was certainly a striking spectacle, but noticeably absent and unmentioned was the former Jewish community of Iraq. The great fear of Christians is that what happened to the Jews will happen to them.  Francis strongly condemned the persecution of the Yazidi community, something to be welcomed, and particularly drew the world’s attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and children still missing. The courtesy visit to the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraq’s Shiite Muslims, did not bring his signature to the Abu-Dhabi agreement on “Human Fraternity,” signed in February 2019 that the Vatican had hoped for, but Sistani’s words on the right of Christians to equality in Iraqi society were very valuable.Apart from the hugely symbolic moments in Mosul on Sunday, the last two events of the trip were meant to be entirely devoted to the Christian communities of the Nineveh Plain who have suffered so much at the hands of ISIS. Undoubtably the pope’s presence was the cause of the greatest joy. Perhaps his rather understated words both in Qaraqosh, the largest Christian town on the Nineveh Plain, and in the final mass in Erbil will not be remembered for their lack of emphasis on the sufferings the communities had endured. While encouraging Christians to “not give up,” and “not lose hope,” peculiar phrases in the last homily at the soccer stadium in Erbil warned that “hearts must be cleansed from the temptations of power and money,” which caused a degree of confusion, given that most of the Christians on the Nineveh Plain have neither. Some are speculating that the influence of Fr. Antonio Spadaro, one of the Pope’s closest advisors, could be seen in many of the speeches and homilies.The long-term success of the visit will be judged on two factors: firstly, whether Christians and other religious minorities are given equal rights under the Iraqi Constitution; and secondly, whether the dangerous level of emigration of Christian families and young people can be reversed, which may depend on economic stability and the hope of employment. The fact that the pope came, in a time of pandemic and danger, is something all Iraqis, and certainly the indigenous Christian community, welcomed and appreciated with great joy. Whether the visit will be remembered as a beautiful symbol, and not much else, remains to be seen."
The Threat of an Unvaccinated South,-2.33,44.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/the-south-will-define-americas-covid-19-recovery/619525/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"COVID-19 patients are once again filling up hospitals in the Deep South as leaders struggle to get constituents immunized.Frank Scott unbuttoned his shirt, rolled up the exposed white T-shirt sleeve beneath, and prepared to get the jab. On March 12, Scott, the mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas, was sitting in a wooden chair in the Express Rx pharmacy surrounded by cameras in an effort to help ease his constituents’ fears about the COVID-19 vaccine. Scott has never been a fan of getting shots—and had never had a flu shot before—but this one was different. He’s lost loved ones to the coronavirus; hundreds have died in his city. Almost as soon as his shot began, it was over. It was a year to the day since Scott had declared a state of emergency—implementing a curfew, prohibiting large gatherings, and closing community centers. As he sat there, with vaccines starting to become widely available, the crisis looked like it might soon be ending.Four months later, however,only a third of Arkansans are fully vaccinated. The hospitals in Little Rock, which Scott often calls the state’s health-care mecca, are near capacity, with a new surge under way. And city and state leaders are struggling to get residents who are hesitant, apathetic, or antagonistic toward vaccination to get the shot. “We’ve been on the ground like it’s a campaign trying to get it done,” Scott told me. “But we spend a lot of time dispelling mistruths, misinformation, and conspiracy theories.”Little Rock is not alone in its region. A recent study by researchers at Georgetown University, led by Shweta Bansal, an associate professor and an infectious-disease expert, identified locations where vaccination rates are lower than the national average, and crucially, that are also surrounded by other areas with low vaccination rates. They homed in on five specific regions, which they say are the most vulnerable to future outbreaks; four are in the Southeast, and one lies just adjacent. One area they pinpointed is a cluster of counties that covers the majority of southeast Alabama, stretching into Georgia and Florida; another spans the northwest part of Alabama into northwest Mississippi and Tennessee; a third covers the boot heel of Missouri and into north Arkansas; and a fourth cluster in north and west Louisiana stretches into east Texas. The final, most expansive cluster, just to the west of the southeastern region, blankets the Texas panhandle and extends into Oklahoma and New Mexico.Read: Delta is driving a wedge through MissouriThe outbreak that America is now seeing is exactly what Bansal and her team would expect based on their research. As Bansal puts it, “Unvaccinated individuals are efficient fuel like dry wood for the fire of future outbreaks. Vaccinated individuals are like soaked wood—while it can’t easily catch fire, if it’s surrounded by dry wood, the chances are much higher.” In other words, low vaccination rates in the South make this moment less safe for everyone there, and over time could jeopardize the country’s hope of ever getting the novel coronavirus more under control.One reason public-health officials and local, state, and federal leaders have struggled to persuade the unvaccinated to take the leap is because the explanations people have for why they remain unvaccinated are so varied. “Low vaccine uptake is being driven by a confluence of factors that are being subsumed under the termhesitancy,” Henna Budhwani, a public-health professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who studies vaccine hesitancy, told me. Some people might be skeptical of the vaccines, and some people don’t want to discuss them with anyone—not even their doctor, she said. Meanwhile, she added, some people in rural locations may not have access to vaccination sites at times that work with their job, while “others feel that public health is telling them what to do, and because they feel that this messaging is promoting an infringement on their autonomy, they are responding with defiance.”And because of the various causes, attributing the low rates to one group is difficult. In a state like Alabama, for instance, roughly 30 percent of white people, 27 percent of Black people, and 22 percent of Hispanic residents are vaccinated. “Regardless of race, the rates are abysmal,” Budhwani said. As such, “we need to respectfully reach into communities,” she continued, and that means continuing to engage with churches and schools as well as leaning on peer-to-peer messaging. “People tend to respond better when hearing public-health messaging from near peers, so for example, when trying to engage adolescents in Alabama, we should co-create messaging with adolescents and then these same adolescents should be involved in the delivery of the messages that they helped to create.”In several large southern metropolitan areas, access to the vaccines is not as much of an issue as it once was. “You can go any place: Walmart, Kroger, the community center, and get the vaccine,” Scott told me, commending Arkansas’s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, and public-health officials for making the vaccines freely and widely available. Still, some politicians have continued to disparage the vaccines. Earlier this week, Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama sent a letter to President Joe Biden imploring him to overrule a mask mandate for unvaccinated people at Fort Rucker, the military installation. “Our soldiers should not be intimidated or coerced by the government into taking an experimental shot that has death and other ill-effect risk associated with it,” Brooks wrote, in the exact sort of mistruth Budhwani and other public-health researchers hope to dispel.Read: America is getting unvaccinated people all wrongWhen I asked Scott what the best-case scenario for Little Rock is at the moment, he told me that he hopes to have 50 percent of his residents fully vaccinated by the end of August. Such a schedule would put them in good shape for the fall—though he can’t allow himself to worry that far out right now. “We have hospitals that are concerned on whether or not to take a COVID patient versus non-COVID,” he said. “I just want to get through the summer, in a successful way, with lives—literally, we have folks losing their lives for something that’s preventable.”Bansal remains optimistic about the chances for increasing vaccination rates—but that is, in part, because she feels that she has to. “I’m not sure I would have gotten through any of the last 16 or 17 months without optimism,” she told me. Still, she worries that without improved vaccination in the South, America will be stuck in a perpetual cycle of coronavirus waves.As Budhwani put it, “Vaccines work. Vaccines save lives.” People just need to roll up their sleeves to get them."

Multiple clinical studies have shown that natural immunity provides at least as much protection against reinfection as the most effective vaccines,” Zywicki said in a statement.GMU officials didn’t respond to a request by the Epoch Times for comment by press time.Vaccine mandates have become a hot-button issue, with advocates arguing that they’re necessary to keep people safe and opponents decrying them as unacceptable violations of bodily autonomy."
Charts of the Day: GAO Warns U.S. Is on Unsustainable Fiscal Path,1.0,47.5,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/10/Charts-Day-GAO-Warns-US-Unsustainable-Fiscal-Path,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-10,25,"The Government Accountability Office on Wednesday issued its thirdannual reportto Congress on the nation’s fiscal health, again warning that the federal government’s current path is unsustainable.“Congress and the administration face serious economic, security, and social challenges that will require difficult policy choices in the near term about economic growth and national needs,” the GAO says. “These near-term policy decisions should be accompanied by a long-term fiscal plan to put the government on a sustainable path. The longer action is delayed, the greater and more drastic the changes will have to be.”The GAO report also said that, while it will take more than executive action to put the country on a more sustainable fiscal path, there are steps that executive branch agencies can take to contribute, including reining in improper payments (about $150 billion in 2018); improving collection of owed taxes (a gap of about $400 billion a year); streamlining government to eliminate fragmentation, overlap and duplication; and improving the government’s financial statements and keeping closer tabs on tax expenditures.Some key details and charts from the new report (there’s also a shortpodcastwith Susan Irving, GAO’s expert on debt and fiscal issues!):The ratio of debt held by the public to GDP is set to surpass its 1946 high of 106 percent within 13 to 20 years, compared to a 14-to-22-year timeframelast year.Health care and net interest costs remain the primary spending-side drivers of the debt, with health care spending projected to continue growing faster than GDP and interest payments on pace to exceed defense spending in less than a decade."
‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?,-0.33,43.67,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"Nick Pope spent the early 1990s investigatingUFOsfor the British ministry of defence. Sequestered in a rarely visited government office – the “metaphorical basement” – he well remembers how his field of work was regarded.“I would walk down the corridor and people would whistle the theme music to either Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Twilight Zone,” Pope told the Guardian.Towards the end of his spell at the MoD, a new science fiction show featuring a pair of FBI alien hunters was also growing in popularity. “I do recall the X-Files theme tune being whistled, too,” he said.In the nearly two decades since then, attitudes towards UFOs have slowly been changing, especially in America where the subject matter has gone from the margins to the mainstream, with even former president Barack Obama opining on their potential existence.Rebranded by governments and enthusiasts as “UAPs”, or unidentified aerial phenomena, 2021 has seen arguably the first ever serious discussion of unknown flying things. In June the Pentagon is set to releasea highly anticipated reporton what it knows about UAPs, and the excitement about that disclosure has been fueled by a slew of witnesses coming forward to share their experiences with the 60 Minutes news show in May.Obama was among many public figures to add his thoughts on UAPs and the Pentagon report this month.“There’s footage and records of objects in the skies, that we don’t know exactly what they are, we can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory,” Obama said inan interviewwith CBS. “They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”The sincerity of the discussion around UAPs – “I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously,” the Republican senator Marco Rubio told 60 Minutes – is a far cry from the jeers Pope once faced.So what has changed in America?“In the last three years it has been elevated above just hearsay and segued into hard evidence,” said Pope, who is now based in Arizona, said. “Not just the testimony from military pilots who’ve been involved in encounters with these things, but radar data and the infra-red camera videos that everyone’s seen.”In recent years a series of government videos showing UAPs, have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong objectflying through the skynear San Diego in 2004.This April photos and videos taken by navy personnel wereleakedonline, showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky, and in May leaked military footage showedan oval flying objectnear a navy ship in San Diego – an apparent UAP hotspot.Members of the navy saw UAPs so frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told 60 Minutes.“Every day,” Graves said. “Every day for at least a couple years.”For Ted Roe, who runs the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, a non-profit where pilots or others can report their experiences with UAPs, this was merely confirmation of what he already knew.“That doesn’t surprise me at all,” Roe said. “Somewhere in the world every day this is happening – it manifests steadily, daily. And from my private conversations with current and former military fliers I feel that the reports that I get – as far as pilot reports – are clearly the tip of the iceberg.”But for all the apparent easing of taboo around UAPs, Roe says there is still a stigma.“Nobody is willing to risk their careers or reputation on this subject, even now,” Roe said. “Pilots won’t contact us until they retire. I’d say it’s almost 50-50, the cases I get, that are more recent, versus those that happened years ago and they didn’t want to talk about because they would lose their flight status, and because they were worried about their careers.”The government – all governments – have previously been reluctant to even acknowledge that they monitor UAPs.In 2007 the US defense department launched an “Advanced aerospace threat identification program” to investigate UFOs. The effort was so secretive that the public was only made aware of it 10 years later, aftera New York Times investigation.As leaked or officially published footage has spread, however, demands for transparency from the public and politicians has grown, prompting the CIA torelease thousands of documentson UAPs in January 2021.Rubio, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, has been a particularly loud voice, and he was part of a group of elected officials who succeeded in thrusting theIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021into the $2.3tn coronavirus relief spending bill signed into law by Donald Trump in December.That act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence”, and “a detailed description of an interagency process” for reporting UFOs. The report must be handed over by 25 June.“Men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are reporting encounters with unidentified aircraft with superior capabilities,” Rubio toldthe Tampa Bay Timesin mid-May.“We cannot allow the stigma of UFOs to keep us from seriously investigating this. The forthcoming report is one step in that process, but it will not be the last.”The flurry of recent videos and the imminent release of the report has ignited an excitement around unidentified flying things not seen for years. Pope warned, however, that after years of furtiveness from intelligence agencies, people should not expect the government to releaseeverythingit knows about these mysterious objects in the sky.“The report must be unclassified, but it could have a classified annex, so there’s a strong possibility that any earth-shattering facts will be in that classified annex, rather than the unclassified report,” Pope said.He added: “So people should be excited, but not too excited. They should be pragmatic, and a little expectation management might be useful.”"

They will cast electronic votes on the party platform and for their party’s nominee to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency.About one-quarter of this year’s delegates are Bernie Sanders supporters. Most of them are progressive political activists—and many are first-time participants in a national convention. This virtual event will not be the experience they expected. And while all of those with whom I’ve spoken are supportive of the precautions being taken in this era of pandemic, most remain in the dark about the convention plans and whether their participation is valued.Months ago, when the 2020 Summer Olympics and a host of professional sporting events were canceled, it should have been clear that we were going to have problems bringing tens of thousands of delegates, supporters, and press to Milwaukee. I fully recognize the political calculations that had to be made, the problems of disappointing the host city, the need to have an event that would serve as a launching pad for the presidential election season. And I have no doubt that the convention planning team and DNC staffers were working round the clock weighing all these problems and exploring options.Nevertheless, what was missing was a recognition that the convention wasn’t just the concern of the planning staff or the Biden campaign. It was personal for the delegates—especially first-timers, many of whom worked hard to earn their posts, felt empowered when they won, and were looking forward to playing their part in this quadrennial drama.Given this, it was troubling how little communication there was with prospective delegates and how little engagement there was with DNC members while deliberations were ongoing. I should be clear that I am not faulting the convention or DNC staff that delegates were left in the dark. This was a political call that should have come from the leadership of the party.Current IssueView our current issueWith this in mind, the Bernie Delegates Network (BDN) conducted a national survey of Sanders delegates. We wanted to get their assessment of the planning process, whether they felt respected as delegates, and ideas they might have shared had they been consulted.Their responses should be seen as troubling both for the party and the Biden campaign. More than 80 percent of those who responded said they felt disrespected or ignored. And their comments made clear why.Common refrains were that as delegates they “felt left out” and that the process was “lacking in transparency and input.” Some went further, cautioning that this year’s “organizing, like the 2016 DNC convention, seems to minimize participation by Sanders delegates.”Popular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Is Derek Penslar the Wrong Kind of Jew for Harvard?Is Derek Penslar the Wrong Kind of Jew for Harvard?Eric AltermanTaylor Swift, Enemy of the PeopleTaylor Swift, Enemy of the PeopleChris LehmannIsrael Is Using Bush’s War on Terror PlaybookIsrael Is Using Bush’s War on Terror PlaybookMaha HilalHow the World of Competitive Climbing Was Rocked by TransphobiaHow the World of Competitive Climbing Was Rocked by TransphobiaFrankie de la CretazPopular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Is Derek Penslar the Wrong Kind of Jew for Harvard?Is Derek Penslar the Wrong Kind of Jew for Harvard?Eric AltermanTaylor Swift, Enemy of the PeopleTaylor Swift, Enemy of the PeopleChris LehmannIsrael Is Using Bush’s War on Terror PlaybookIsrael Is Using Bush’s War on Terror PlaybookMaha HilalHow the World of Competitive Climbing Was Rocked by TransphobiaHow the World of Competitive Climbing Was Rocked by TransphobiaFrankie de la CretazTwo others summed up the views of many:“It should have been anticipated much earlier that the convention would be online and things planned with that in mind ahead of time. [There were] a lot of missed opportunities…” And there was “too little communication with stakeholders, that is, delegates and DNC members. It has been a closed affair— not seeking input…”Frequently, the Sanders delegates also complained that they had no idea how this convention will allow their voices to be heard. They expressed the desire to participate but said they “don’t know how.” And a number of first-time delegates were unsure whether their participation was even valued by the party.Some may dismiss these complaints as coming from the disgruntled losing side, but there is a risk in doing so. Young and old progressives are an important constituency. They make up a respectable share of Democratic voters, and many are activists who represent communities Democrats will need to win. As Jesse Jackson famously noted at the 1988 Democratic convention, “It takes two wings to fly.”In party-building, there can be no victor/vanquished. The role of a successful convention is to heal internal divisions and create unity of purpose among the various component groups of the party. In 2016, too little attention was paid to this critical undertaking. Bernie Sanders, personally, tried to soothe the disappointment felt by his delegation. But the message they received from the establishment was “We won, and you lost.” They felt shut out of the proceedings and left the convention demoralized.This year could have been different. So far, it has not been. There isn’t the same degree of rancor as there was four years ago; the Biden/Sanders task forces formed to create a unified approach to writing the platform, while producing a document not wholly satisfying to progressives, was still a good-faith effort to bridge differences.But leaving grassroots delegates in the dark as to how the convention will work—and reducing their role to passive online viewers—runs the risk of producing a massive letdown that could leave hundreds of delegates alienated. What this may mean is that at the conclusion of the party confab, many first-time Sanders delegates (and some old-timers, as well), instead of being energized and engaged, may turn off their computers feeling deflated and dejected. The unity so necessary for victory will not have been achieved.This can still be addressed. If there is a will, creative solutions can still be found to give us the “two wings” we need to fly.

On July 1937, however, Earhart achieved fame for an unfortunate reason.Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonandisappearedin theirLockheed Electra plane, while attempting a global flight. Despite extensive efforts to find them, they were never found, nor was any wreckage from their plane. Earhart was officially declared dead in 1939.Despite disappearing more than eight decades ago, Earhart has remained a pop culturefixture. She has also remained the focal point of conspiracy theories, some of them more bizarre than others.Officially, thepositionof the U.S. has been that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean while trying to reach tiny Howland Island to land and refuel.Some believe that Earhart was captured by the Japanese government after landing in the Marshall Islands, with some pointing to aphotographtaken in the 1930s that allegedly showed both Earhart and her plane there. In another theory, somespeculatedshe took on the identity of ""Tokyo Rose,"" a propagandist who made English-language broadcasts intended to demoralize Allied forces during World War II. There was no evidence for this narrative.But Ric Gillespie, author of the book ""Finding Amelia"" and executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery,toldthe BBC in 2017 that there is no evidence supporting the claim that a photograph shows Earhart in Japanese custody.Another theory is that Earhart and Noonan successfully landed on Nikumaroro, another tiny island southeast of Howland, but both died there as rescuers failed to find them in time. Per National Geographic, tantalizing clues, including human remains and airplane parts, were discovered on the island by a British exploration party in 1937.Another unfounded theory was that Earhart survived and returned to the U.S., but assumed a new identity, namely ""Irene Bolham."" This theory, put forward by book author Joe Klaas, was false, as ABC Newsreported:The theory should have died after Bolham sued Klaas, his associate Joe Gervais, and McGraw-Hill for defamation and McGraw-Hill pulled the book from shelves. But 33 years later, another book, ""Amelia Earhart Survives"" by Col. Rollin Reineck, came out in 2003 making the same claim.Stranger theories about Earhart's disappearance attribute it to analien abductionand even more bizarre, the idea that she wassavedby a race of people that live inside the Earth."
Methane-eating microbes in the ocean help moderate Earth's temperature,0.0,50.0,https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2021/06/14/Methane-eating-microbes-in-the-ocean-help-moderate-Earths-temperature/9061623703088/,https://adfontesmedia.com/upi-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,25,"June 14 (UPI) --Methane-eating microbes in the planet's oceans play an unappreciated role moderating Earth's temperature, according to a new study published Mondayin the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences.Carbon dioxide is the most abundant and famous greenhouse gas, but methane is plentiful and its warming effect is more than 30 times more powerful.AdvertisementMost methane that ends up in the atmosphere is released by human activities, but several natural processes also produce methane: volcanic activity, subsurface water-rock interactions and microbial metabolism.The majority of naturally produced methane on Earth is produced by microbes, and much of that is in the ocean. Over the last decade or so, a number of studies have shown the planet's oceans to be home to a lot more methane than scientists previously thought.RelatedStudy: Models underestimate amount of carbon absorbed by Earth's oceansArctic Ocean acidification will be worse than scientists thoughtCoral parents pass algae to their offspring to help cope with climate changeInterestingly, studies suggest very little of that methane is making it into the atmosphere.AdvertisementAccording to the latest study, an abundance of methane-hungry microbial communities on the bottom of the ocean are responsible for keeping much of that methane locked up in marine ecosystems.Without these microbes, scientists surmise Earth's atmosphere would host more methane -- making it even warmer than it already is.When scientists surveyed microbe communities surrounding seven geologically distinct seafloor seeps, they found the group colonizing carbonate rocks was responsible for the highest rates of methane consumption ever recorded.""The microbes in these carbonate rocks are acting like a methane bio filter consuming it all before it leaves the ocean,"" senior study author Peter Girguis, professor of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University, said in a press release.Though carbonate rocks are common on the ocean floor, they only sometimes form the kind of porous, chimney-like structures found rising from the seabed at a deep sea site just off the coast of Point Dume, California.That's where scientists found the record-setting microbes.""We measured the rate at which the microbes from the carbonates eat methane compared to microbes in sediment,"" said Girguis. ""We discovered the microbes living in the carbonates consume methane 50 times faster than microbes in the sediment.""Advertisement""We often see that some sediment microbes from methane-rich mud volcanoes, for example, may be five to ten times faster at eating methane, but 50 times faster is a whole new thing. Moreover, these rates are among the highest, if not the highest, we've measured anywhere,"" Girguis said.""These rates of methane oxidation, or consumption, are really extraordinary, and we set out to understand why,"" co-author Jeffrey J. Marlow, former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, also said in the release.By efficiently capturing methane as it seeps out of seafloor vents and converting it into bicarbonate, microbes help construct these unusual carbonate rock chimneys.Scientists suspect the carbonate chimneys they call home -- and their mineral surroundings -- are key to their unprecedented metabolic capabilities. Researchers found some of the microbial communities colonizing carbonate rocks are surrounded by pyrite, which is electrically conductive.Efficient electron exchange, the researchers hypothesized, may explain why these microbes can eat so much methane so quickly.""These very high rates are facilitated by these carbonates which provide a framework for the microbes to grow,"" Girguis said.""The system resembles a marketplace where carbonates allow a bunch of microbes to aggregate in one place and grow and exchange -- in this case, exchange electrons -- which allows for more methane consumption,"" Girguis said.AdvertisementGirguis, Marlow and their research partners recently recreated a diversity of seafloor environs in the lab and are now studying how microbes metabolize methane under varying conditions.Researchers hope their ongoing experiments will reveal how different characteristics of the carbonate environment influence metabolic rates among the methane-eating microbes.""First, we need to understand how these microbes sustain their metabolic rate, whether they're in a chimney or in the sediment. And we need to know this in our changing world in order to build our predictive power,"" Marlow said.""Once we clarify how these many interconnected factors come together to turn methane to rock, we can then ask how we might apply these anaerobic methane-eating microbes to other situations, like landfills with methane leaks,"" he said."

Yes. But what else do you expect from the woman who has made herself apopular fixtureon cable news with herwillingness to jettison professional ethics and declare the president mentally unstable?Former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is in the hospital. He threatened to harm himself this weekend at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,according to law enforcement officials.“Brad Parscale is a member of our family, and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.Self-harm is serious. Suicide is serious.Someone should tell that to Lee.“Here is another side effect of continuing with a mentally impaired leader,”the Yale University psychiatry professor said in reaction to the Parscale news. “It will attract mental impairment, augment mental illness (in both supporters and opponents), and cause disorder to reverberate through society.”Later, after social media users alerted Lee to the obscenity of her attack, she added, “The messages I receive from Trump supporters give a good measure. They went from normal: ‘How could you do this to our president?’ To more disturbed: ‘Dems are diabolical demons, and wretched, vile, inhumane Communists like you made a deal with the Devil’ (my last message).”Ah, yes. So, those angry at her manipulative use of Parscale’s reported breakdown are the real issue.Lee’s behavior should not shock you. She proved long ago that she is unethical and callous when it comes to her area of expertise.Democrats summoned Lee to Capitol Hill in 2018 when they needed a medical professional to condemn Trump’s mental health. “[Trump’s] going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs,”she told lawmakers at the time. Lee also signed a statement in 2018 urging members of Congress to “take urgent steps to restrain [Trump’s] behavior and head off the potential nuclear catastrophe” with North Korea. She continues to host events where she and her friends use their medical credentials to declare the president a loony tune.“The president’s condition has been visibly deteriorating to the point where there’s a lot of talk right now about his mental state beyond mental health professionals,”she said in 2019. “It no longer takes a mental health professional to recognize the seriousness of the current presidency.”Lee has never once conducted an in-person evaluation of Trump. The long-standing, prudentGoldwater rule means nothing to her. But what else do you expect from the media’s favorite “resistance” mental health professional? Lee is popular on the cable news circuit precisely because she is happy to violate professional ethics in service of “resistance.”Thatshe has a book to sellon the matter should not go unnoticed either."

It was detected this summer in the county, which is aDemocratstronghold.Officials say a person in Columbia, South Carolina, in July mailed voter applications for the deceased to the Broward County elections office.Officials said each of the 51 applications bore similar handwriting.Those applications were subsequently flagged as suspicious and referred to aFloridastate attorney’s office, which is investigating the matter.Paula McMahon, with the state attorney’s office, told the AP, “We cannot comment on an ongoing, active criminal investigation.”But according to the report, the investigation is complicated, as the applications by mail had no return address.Five of the names of the people on the application were already on voter rolls, The South Florida Sun-Sentinelreported.51 applications, at least three of them were not detected at first as fraudulent, the newspaper added.Two of the applications which evaded detection byBroward Countyelection officials had passed away a month prior to the applications.Those individuals were subsequently added to the county’s voter rolls.Broward Elections Supervisor Pete Antonacci told the newspaper that the applications were an effort to defraud election officials.“This is an organized effort by someone who knew a little bit about Florida law but not a lot, and had a scheme to either undermine the Florida registration system with fake voters, or intended to vote 50 times,” Antonacci said.The county election official blamed a delay in voter deaths being reported to the election board as the reason fordeceased peoplebeing registered to vote.“The system is based on the honor system, and the honor system is supposedly bolstered by the fact that if you lie on one of these applications, it’s a crime,” he said.“With determination, you can muscle your way in.”The disruption of the scheme inFloridawas reported just days before the Nov. 3 election, in which there are grave concerns about election integrity, which is mostly due to the addition of millions of insecure mail-in ballots across the country this year.Florida is a key swing state, which could very well decide the winner of Tuesday’s election.PresidentDonald Trumpwon the state in 2016 by just over100,000 votes.Get the latest news delivered right to your email.News, Politics, Culture, and more in realtime."

This is usually a formality, but Trump has refused to concede or admit he lost. He's also straight-up threatened the electors who are doing their jobs, according to the law and democracy.Swing States that have found massive VOTER FRAUD, which is all of them, CANNOT LEGALLY CERTIFY these votes as compl… https: //t.co/1ryOahzHVv— Donald J.

Trump (@Donald J. Trump)1607899779.0BLACK PEOPLE VOTING EVERYWHERE! MASS HYSTERIA! THIS ELECTION IS UNDER PROTEST!Pretty much everything Trump tweeted was a lie:Dead kidsdidn't vote in the election, not even dead illegal immigrant children. Trump has not only failed to prove widespread voter fraud, but when his legal eagles were offered the chance to show all their “evidence"" in Wisconsin, theydidn't even try.The states have already certified their results. The electors aren't committing a crime when they collectively state that two plus two equals four or more specifically 306 equals President Biden. I've had enough of Trump's whiny, democracy-torching bullshit.GiphyBut Trump plans to drag this out until he's dragged out of the White House. On “Fox & Friends,""Stephen Miller and the very ill chia pet on his head declaredthat an “an alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we are going to send those results to Congress."" That's not how anything works. This isn't a hostile takeover of a corporation or even fantasy football. The popular vote winner of each state's presidential election receives the allotted electoral votes. That is the existing law. Enough with the attempted coups.The anti-anti-Trump brigade — those who don't especially like Trump but hate liberals more — argue that Trump's refusal to accept the results of a free and fair election is no different from 2016's hashtag #Resistance movement. Yes, the so-called“Hamilton Electors"" wantedto deny Trump the White House through the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton, whoconceded the morning after Election Day,had nothing to do with this. More importantly, she wasn't an incumbent president desperately clinging to power. The Hamilton Electors also didn't try to install a defeated Clinton as president but a moderate Republican “compromise"" candidate, which is a classic Democrat move.States tightened up lawsagainst faithless electors after 2016so instead of charging someone a measly $1,000 after the fact for a failed coup, the states can remove the faithless elector and replace them with someone who'll respect the will of the people, no matter how dumb. TheSupreme Court upheldthese laws in a unanimous ruling.Trump's unhinged tweets and Miller's elector cosplay can't change the law or the results of the presidential race. However, they do promote the dangerous fiction that the election isn't settled. Trump tweeted after his (second) Supreme Court loss that “We have just begun to fight."" His supporters, who exist in an alternate reality of Trump's own design, are heeding his call, and his incendiary rhetoric, which Republicans ignore and enable, has put a target on the electors' backs.TheNew York Timesreports:In Michigan, Democratic electors have been promised police escorts from their cars into the State Capitol, where on Monday they will formally vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr.In Arizona, state officials are holding the vote at an undisclosed location for safety reasons, far from what is expected to be a heated hearing on election integrity issues that Republicans will conduct in the Statehouse.Even in Delaware, the tiny, deeply Democratic home state of the president-elect, officials relocated their ceremony to a college gymnasium, a site considered to have better security and public health controls.This is not normal.Earlier today,Michigan Republican legislative leaderspulled state Rep. Gary Eisen from his committee assignments after he said during a radio interview that he ""could not rule out the possibility of violence"" from all those patriots who hate it when Democrats win elections.From theDetroit Free Press:[A] radio hostasked Eisen to elaborate on his comments several times, saying what the lawmaker described sounded dangerous.

"Complaints spur intensified virus-related inspections for Minnesota bars, restaurants",-2.33,50.67,https://www.startribune.com/complaints-spur-intensified-virus-related-inspections-for-minnesota-bars-restaurants/572251012/,https://adfontesmedia.com/minnesota-star-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-29,25,"State regulators are stepping up enforcement of mask-wearing, social distancing and other requirements imposed on Minnesota's bars and restaurants to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.Owners of such establishments received notice this week of the increased oversight, which started on Friday, accompanied by the threat of fines and citations over complaints from customers as well as bars and restaurants that are obeying the rules that some of their competitors are ignoring.Bars and restaurants were permitted as of June 10 to reopen their indoor service areas at 50% of their fire code capacities as long as they met other requirements such as mask-wearing and keeping tables 6 feet apart. Gov. Tim Walz on Friday said he wanted to thank the majority that are sacrificing and complying, and he added that he owes it to them to confront bars and restaurants that aren't.""If they choose not to follow the best health guidance [they] put all of the businesses at risk, they put all of our health at risk,"" Walz said. ""That's the whole idea. The wearing of the mask is about protecting others. It's about stopping the spread and reducing it.""The guidance comes at a nervy time in the pandemic for state health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 862 lab-confirmed infections on Friday of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — bringing the state's overall total to 73,240 known infections — which represented an increase from the roughly 630 per day that had been reported on average for much of August.The state also reported four COVID-19 deaths on Friday — for a total of 1,810 in the pandemic — and that 301 people were hospitalized with the infectious disease. Hospital and case numbers had leveled off somewhat in August after increasing in July.The latest COVID-19 case growth appears somewhat tied to large group events and outbreaks in bars and restaurants where safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus are being disregarded, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.The state has confirmed 46 infections involving motorcyclists at the Sturgis rally in South Dakota and has found evidence that they have spread the virus to others within Minnesota. One apparently spread the virus at a wedding, Ehresmann said.The state also has investigated 50 establishments in Minnesota for suspected patron transmission of the virus that resulted in a total of 1,286 infections. Thirty of those bars or restaurants have been publicly identified because at least seven people were likely infected in them.""When establishments and customers don't follow the guidance, we see outbreaks,"" Ehresmann said.Inspections will occur in establishments that have been the subject of complaints, but also in random bars and restaurants as well.Unannounced ""observation-only"" inspections were conducted earlier this summer by the Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement Division of the state Department of Public Safety and various law enforcement agencies. The inspectionsturned up 14 bars and restaurants that committed violations.Most of those violations included employees failing to wear masks (116), followed by failure in social distancing (63) and excess capacity (30).In the advisory to the hospitality industry this week, the state commissioners for Public Safety, Health, and Labor and Industry wrote that ""most establishments are following federal and state guidelines, but it makes it difficult for them to compete or to explain to their customers when other establishments are not in compliance.""Some Republican members of the state House of Representatives challenged the stepped-up enforcement on a business community that has suffered economic hardships in the pandemic.""Threats of fines and closure are a departure from previous statements by the Governor — who has stated that their goal is 'education' — not to be punitive to businesses who are already struggling as a result of the Walz shutdowns,"" read a statement issued Friday morning by the House Republican Caucus.House GOP members said they are hearing about businesses being subjected to unannounced visits, which have led to citations and fines. The House Republicans said they are drafting a written response to Walz and relevant commissioners to his announcement.State Rep. Dave Baker, R-Willmar, a longtime restaurant owner until he sold his last place in January, said he's concerned that further enforcement pressure will doom many establishments.""I am really concerned that the executive branch is switching to the adversary vs. the advocate role,"" the third-term legislator said. ""The tone right now is so alarming. Why would the government go after the industry that has been wounded so badly during this pandemic?""Baker said that with summer coming to a close and outdoor seating certain to slice into overall capacity, some establishments aren't going to survive if they can't go from 50% to 75% capacity indoors.Restaurant staff are ""doing the best they can"" when it comes to wearing masks and following other rules, he said. ""I know there are a few rogue people who are snubbing their nose to everything, but let's deal with them one on one. … to publicly shame restaurants online with minor violations is just not something we need to do.""Hospitality Minnesota, a trade group that represents many restaurants and hotels, said it fears its industry is being targeted without merit.""Previous Department of Public Safety announcements [indicated] that 98.5% of operators they visited were following guidance to keep guests and workers safe,"" Hospitality Minnesota CEO Liz Rammer said. ""Enforcement efforts must be carried out fairly and evenly, and across all types of businesses that serve the public. … We are concerned that this industry is being disproportionately and unfairly targeted, and we have expressed these concerns to the Health Department.""The state's letter to bars and restaurants said that teams of inspectors from the three state departments will fan out during the next several weekends and look for violations.They will be looking for compliance in areas such as employees and customers wearing masks, social distancing, limits on party size per table, proper employee health screenings and staying under capacity maximums.Violations could lead to fines, loss of liquor license or prompt an order to close. Inspection results will be shared with the bar and restaurant operators, the letter read.Paul Walsh • 612-673-4482Jeremy Olson • 612-673-7744"
EPA guts plan that would have slashed pollution from Utah coal plants,-3.33,46.67,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2020/10/29/epa-guts-plan-that-would/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-29,25,"Federal environmental officials have approved Utah’s new plan for limiting coal-fired power plant emissions to address “regional” haze marring the state’s famous national parks, although environmentalists say it’s a step backward when it comes to improving air quality.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s decision,announced Wednesday, applies to PacificCorp’s Hunter and Huntington power plants in Emery County. The revised emission-reduction plan credits the utility’s priorretirement of the nearby Carbon Power Plantand prior emission-reduction investments, concluding it does not need to make any new upgrades at the operating plants in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.“It’s frustrating to have the answer right in front of us and then have politics overshadow the science,” said Kirstin Peterson, owner of Rim Tours in Moab. “The only thing that Utah’s new haze plan does is ensure that we’re going to continue having polluted skies that mar Utah’s tremendous landscapes and harm the health of visitors, wildlife, resources and our outdoor recreation economy.”In authorizing thenew plan, the EPA withdrewthe previous plan approved by the Obama administration in 2016, which had called for expensive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment installed at the plants. Such upgrades would have cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a leading cause of haze, by 75% according to theNational Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA.In 2017, however, a federal appeals court granted a request by the Trump administration to halt the plan.“We appreciate the efforts of EPA to act on Utah’s plan and the many stakeholders who participated in the development of the plan.” Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement released Wednesday by the EPA. “Utah’s regional haze plan has protected visibility in our national parks, supported rural economies and reduced emissions of harmful air pollutants for the residents and visitors to the state.”According to the EPA, Utah’s new plan will reduce missions by 1,879 tons per year relative to the 2016 plan.Conservationists, however, argued the replacement plan does nothing to clean the air.“Smart communities all across the West began moving away from fossil fuels and building new, thriving economies by diversifying and investing in clean energy, outdoor recreation, and long-term, sustainable job prospects even before COVID hit,” said Scott Williams, executive director ofHEAL Utah. “We cannot afford a rear-view mirror approach that puts a dying coal industry ahead of a vibrant outdoor recreation economy that Utah has built.”According to an analysis by NPCA, the Hunter and Huntington plants, which began operating in 1978 and 1974, respectively, are among the nation’s worst in terms of their haze pollution, which affects Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks. The three-unit Hunter plant ranks No. 2 on the list of all pollution sources in the nation, not just coal plants, while the Huntington plant ranks No. 18.“We need leaders with a bold vision, who can see past the politics and industry pressure to come up with a real plan that steers us toward clean energy resources,” said Cory MacNulty, NPCA’s southwest associate director. “We will continue to fight until Utahns and our national parks have the clean air they need and deserve.”"

Braindead brain surgeon Ben Carson and the clown from the MyPillow commercials were teaming up to hawk a laughably phony coronavirus miracle cure, and they’d gotten Donald Trump on board with it.But sure enough, the whole thing was very much a real story. Ben Carson has a documented history of lending his name to useless supplements disguised as phony miracle cures, including hawking tree bark as a supposed cancer cure, so it wasn’t surprising to see him involved in this latest scheme. But the MyPillow guy was somewhat of a surprise. After all, he’s always come off as a mere informercial doofus who likes Donald Trump way too much.But when MyPillow guy Mike Lindell appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper today, it immediately became clear that Lindell was someone different than the happy and goofy guy he portrays in his TV ads. When Cooper explained that there were no clinical trials for Lindell’s supposed coronavirus drug, Lindell turned angry and aggressive, as if the mask had finally been pulled back.By the time Anderson Cooper pointed out that there was no real difference between Mike Lindell and a “snake oil salesmen,” Lindell just about lost it. We should have known that there was something more sinister to the MyPillow guy than just being a goofy pitchman who was naive enough to fall for Donald Trump’s lies. Lindell exposed himself today in an ugly way. We’ll see if he now pulls back on this coronavirus scam, before it snowballs and destroys his pillow business as well.Bill Palmer is the publisher of the political news outlet Palmer Report"
Jim Clyburn Urges Filibuster 'Carveout' for Laws Protecting Constitutional Rights Like Voting,-4.67,42.0,https://www.newsweek.com/jim-clyburn-urges-filibuster-carveout-laws-protecting-constitutional-rights-like-voting-1608558,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn is urging PresidentJoe Bidento amend the U.S.Senatefilibuster in order to carve out laws that are directly tied to constitutionally protected rights, including voting.Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and one of Biden's top congressional allies, told Politico in astory published Saturdaythat the current voting rights protection bill will only pass if Senate rules are changed to allow a 51-vote majority on the For the People Act of 2021.Echoing the vehement demands of top congressionalDemocrats, Clyburn said it's finally time for the White House to get aggressive in order to protect Americans' right to vote. He said Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, we should do a carveout.' I don't care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburn said to Politico.Biden has so far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as a second piece of legislation that reauthorizes sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburn said Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carveout immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona.On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden's upcoming Tuesday speech in Philadelphia is set to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than a simple legislative consideration.Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democratic senator and crucial swing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburn said he told Manchin at the time: ""I'm not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I'm saying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likened state-by-state GOP voter suppression bills to aggressive forms of ""white supremacy."" Casey saidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn's tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is the solution: Enact a carveout for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens of states have recently passed GOP-backed voter suppression laws that are being pushed through state legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes. The six Supreme Court justices who recently upheld the Arizona voter restrictions were all appointed by a Republican Party president.Newsweekreached out to Clyburn's office Saturday for any additional remarks about the filibuster."

I really believe that holding resentments would hurt me ultimately.”Stevens wasarrested after cops said they found a gun in a car in which she was riding with two men in Queens.Her arrest was prominently played in the news media. Stevens went from deputy director of the Office of Criminal Justice — where she worked onimplementing a law to raise the age at which juvenile suspects are treated as adultsin courtrooms — to jobless and without insurance.Her troubles began in Queens, as she rode in the back seat of a 2002 Infiniti that also carried two men on her way to play basketball.When the men, Ceasar Forbes and Montel Hughes, stopped for cigarettes on 106th Ave. near 177th St. in Jamaica, cops approached the car and began searching it.Shortly before the stop — at about 10:20 p.m. — a nearby NYPD ShotSpotter microphone system had picked up the sound of five gunshots, cops said at the time.During their search of the car, officers found a 9mm handgun in a green velvet bag in the glove compartment, as well as a spent shell casing by Stevens’ feet.Cops arrested Forbes, Hughes and Stevens when none of them admitted the gun was theirs, according to a criminal complaint.But Stevens denied the two officers asked her any questions about the weapon and said she didn’t know of the gun’s presence until the charges in the case were read to her in Queens Criminal Court.“I did not know about the gun being in the car,” Stevens said Friday.By that time, the news media had caught wind of the arrest, and Stevens found out from news stories that she was suspended without pay or benefits from her city job, she told The News.A month after her arrest, Stevens gave a DNA sample, which didn’t match DNA on the gun, according to her lawsuit.“There wasn’t any evidence tying her to the gun so the charges were all dismissed,” a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case told The News.Finally, in November 2018 — after Stevens had spent seven months trying to pick up the pieces of her life — the case was dismissed and sealed, according to a certificate of disposition viewed by The News.In December 2018, Stevens sued the NYPD officers on the case in Brooklyn Supreme Court for false arrest and illegal stop and frisk.One of the arresting officers in Stevens’ case, Justin Ellis — a defendant in Stevens’ lawsuit — subsequently lost hisgun and shield after getting arrested in 2020 for shooting his wife’s physical traineroutside the cop’s Seaford home during a fight.Ellis’ criminal case is still pending and his lawyer confirmed he is still a member of the NYPD.Stevens is now working as a temp in a group home for young mothers.“My client is thrilled she was vindicated of all charges and can finally put this event behind her,” said Cary London, Stevens’ lawyer."

The indictment of one of the team’s officers appeared to be the last straw.“Have I ever seen anything like this in my career? No, I don’t think any of us have,” said Deputy Chief Chris Davis, serving Thursday as acting chief while Lovell is out of state for a week in St. Augustine, Florida, for training.The Police Bureau acknowledged Thursday that the Rapid Response officers “no longer comprise a team.” The officers remain sworn members of the bureau but no longer work on the specialized team that received additional training and was an addition to the officers’ daily assignments.Mayor Ted Wheeler, who serves as police commissioner, Davis and Lovell met via video conference at 9 a.m. Thursday. The mayor also reached out to Gov. Kate Brown and said the Oregon State Police will have its mobile response team on standby to assist Portland police if protests occur in the next few nights. The mayor also discussed backup support from the Oregon National Guard if necessary, according to his office.The mayor also invited Rapid Response Team members to share their concerns directly with him during an 11 a.m. video conference call. Close to 40 officers appeared on the call. Wheeler reportedly asked the team members to delay their resignations from the team for a week so the Police Bureau could work out logistics for their replacement, but several officers on the conference could be seen visibly shaking their heads in opposition, according to one person present.“I want to acknowledge the toll this past year has taken on them and their families—they have worked long hours under difficult conditions,” the mayor said in a statement. “I personally heard from some of them today, and I appreciate their willingness to share their concerns about managing the many public gatherings that often were violent and destructive. It is my expectation, and the community’s expectation, that the City remains committed to public safety and effective police oversight. City leaders will continue working in partnership with Portlanders, community organizations and police leadership to reform our community safety system.’'The specialized Portland police team has been on the front lines at social justice protests held in the city after the May 25 murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck and pinned him to the pavement.Many demonstrations devolved into clashes with officers late at night, and at times ended with vandalism, property damage and fires. The crowd control team was the unit often directed to disperse crowds after police declared unlawful assemblies or riots.The team’s use of force has led to multiple civil lawsuits in state and federal court, sanctions from a judge and now an indictment. Aside from the Oregon State Police, few outside police agencies in the past year were willing to assist Portland in protest coverage.Davis said Portland patrol officers assigned to mobile field forces also likely will be called into action, and the chief can order the Rapid Response Team officers to provide crowd control as well. An incident management team will be activated Thursday night and likely through the weekend should any problems arise, he said.“We’re committed to providing the community the best service that we can. And this does not mean that there will be no response in public order situations,” Davis said. “We’ll use the resources that we have.”The current contract with the police union says the city retains “the exclusive right to exercise the customary functions of management including, but not limited to, directing the activities of the Bureau, determining the levels of service and methods of operation... the right to hire, lay off, transfer and promote; to discipline or discharge for cause, to determine work schedules and assign work and any other such rights not specifically referred to in this Contract.”In late October, the president of the police union, the Portland Police Association, sent the mayor and police chiefa letter,urging both to “stand up and publicly support Police Bureau members who voluntarily serve on the Rapid Response Team (RRT).”The union president urged the mayor and City Hall to “stop using RRT members as political pawns,” and called the team’s members “exhausted and injured.” He wrote then that the “only glue holding their team together’' was their “commitment to serve their city.”“Our RRT members do not volunteer to have Molotov cocktails, fireworks, explosives, rocks, bottles, urine, feces and other dangerous objects thrown at them,” wrote Daryl Turner, then president of the union and now its executive director. He noted that the team members volunteer for the work without any specialty pay.“Nor do they volunteer to have threats of rape, murder and assaults on their families hurled at them. They do not volunteer to suffer serious injuries, to be subjected to warrantless criticism and face allegations by elected officials, or to suffer through baseless complaints and lengthy investigations devoid of due process.”He urged that the trained supervisors of the Rapid Response Team, “not politicians,” be allowed to make decisions on police tactics to use during demonstrations, and that investigations into use of force by team members be done in a timely manner. He noted that a number of seasoned team officers had been pulled from the team during months-long investigations.“These officers find themselves in a no-win situation. They are told to stand down and only intervene when things have gotten so out of control that they have no other option than to use high levels of force to regain control of unlawful demonstrations,” Turner wrote. “They are criticized for their perceived inaction on the front end and are criticized for their inevitable use of force on the back end. They can’t win because of the position others have put them in.’'The acting chief acknowledged the “challenging times,” the Police Bureau and community has faced in the last 14 months during the pandemic and mass protests in the wake of Floyd’s videotaped killing.“Our entire organization, and not even just our sworn staff, but also our professional staff in the last 14 months, has been put through something, none of us have ever seen in our careers, at a level and an intensity that I don’t think any other city in the United States has experienced,” Davis said.He said he recognizes that the officers serving so many consecutive nights on the protest lines have been facing “really, really extreme circumstances,” which “takes a toll.’'“It’s my responsibility to make sure that if we send someone to go out and do something, that I’m not subjecting them to any more risk than I absolutely have to, and that’s why we have to be smart about how we send them out to do this work, and what strategy we want them to follow,” he said.Budworth marked the first Rapid Response Team officer to face criminal prosecution stemming from force used during a protest. He’s accused of striking a woman, Teri Jacobs, in the face with a baton after knocking her to the ground on Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard after a riot was declared near the Multnomah Building on Aug. 18.Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt described Budworth’s baton strike as excessive force that was legally unjustified.Thedistrict attorney also told The Oregonian/OregonLive Tuesday afternoonthat he had asked the Oregon Department of Justice to review for potential criminal prosecution the force used by another Rapid Response Team member, Detective Erik Kammerer, during protests. His office, he said, continues to review other protest-related uses of force by officers.The union criticized Budworth’s prosecution as politically driven, and it contends Budworth’s baton strike was “accidental,” not criminal. The Portland Police Association issued a statement earlier this week, saying Schmidt needs to prosecute “the real criminals who are perpetrating vandalism, arson, gun violence, and other violent crimes in our community,” and not go after officers attempting to do their jobs with little support.On Thursday, Schmidt vowed to hold officers accountable for their actions. He issued this statement: “Management and staffing of the Rapid Response Team falls within the purview of the leadership of the Portland Police Bureau. I have confidence that the Bureau will continue their mission to maintain public safety. In the meantime, my office will continue to focus on the fair and just prosecution of criminal matters. We cannot expect the community to trust law enforcement if we hold ourselves to a lower standard.”Attorneys Juan Chavez and Franz Bruggemeier - both of the Oregon Justice Resource Center who have sued the city and Portland police on behalf of protesters and represent the woman who was struck with a baton by Budworth — say they the Rapid Response Team’s mass resignation demonstrates “the contempt its members feel for even the possibility that one of their colleagues is held accountable for his actions.”“Portland Police officers need to understand that they are not above the law nor are their actions exempt from the protections the Constitution aims to provide to people against exactly these types of abuse by police,” the attorneys said in a statement. “The refusal to acknowledge and address this wrongdoing goes to the heart of what’s wrong with Portland Police. The failure of our City’s elected leaders to step in is an indictment of their role in this mess and their complicity in the violence and trauma committed by PPB against the community.”By late Thursday, city commissioners issued their own reactions to the stunning development.Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, the most vocal critic of Portland police on the City Council, urged the city to formally disband the Rapid Response Team. She said its members’ resignation is an example of a “rogue paramilitary organization” that’s unaccountable to elected officials and residents of Portland.“Ironically, we now see some PPB officers engaging in the act they showed so much disdain for last summer by staging their own protest: resigning from the RRT the moment there is a possibility for accountability for inappropriate and potentially illegal conduct,” she said. “What today’s action says is that some Portland police officers believe they are above the law. I support District Attorney Mike Schmidt in his efforts to hold police officers accountable when they commit crimes themselves, because no one is above the law.’'Commissioner Mingus Mapps said while he supports the district attorney’s close review of mistakes made by Portland police during recent protests, he added, “at the same time, our city has endured nightly rioting, arson, and vandalism. I will continue to support our public safety officers while also reforming how we police in our city.”In March, a federaljudge also restricted officers with the Rapid Response Team from using crowd-control launchers during protestsuntil they completed further training and “can recognize and articulate a threat without speculating and before using less-lethal force.’'U.S. District Judge Marco A. Hernandez’s sanctions came after the judge’s findings in November that two officers had acted in contempt of his June 26 order barring police from firing FN303s and 40mm less-lethal launchers and using pepper spray on people engaged in passive resistance. The case stemmed from a suit filed by Don’t Shoot Portland, a Black-led nonprofit that advocates for social and racial justice in the city.Patrol officers who aren’t part of the specialized Rapid Response Team but are on mobile field forces are armed with batons and pepper spray.The Rapid Response Team officers carry less-lethal launchers, impact munitions and riot-control agents, tear gas, OC (the irritant Oleoresin Capsicum, or pepper spray) pyrotechnic gas or smoke, which are either fired from a 40mm launcher or thrown in canisters. Impact munitions they’ve been armed with include foam-tipped projectiles fired from a 40mm launcher or a plastic projectile containing an inert powder and non-toxic chemical called bismuth that’s fired from an FN 303 air-powered launcher. They received advanced training to respond to public order policing, natural or human-caused disasters.Last fall, the mayorissued an order for police to stop using tear gas for crowd controlunless lives were at risk and nothing else could resolve the threat — and only if he or his designee approved its use. There was no additional written guidance given to officers, beyond the mayor’s press release, the U.S. Department of Justice found.“Banning reasonable police tactics and less lethal tools only serves to escalate police action and force, rather than allowing RRT to use lower levels of force to control unlawful activity. Remove politics from police operations. Allow RRT supervisors, who have the most training, experience, and knowledge about crowd control, to manage these events unencumbered by shifting political winds,” Turner wrote to the mayor and chief in late October.While the mass departure of officers from a Portland police specialized team hasn’t occurred before, two other cities have seen such moves in the past year. Last summer,Buffalo Police Department’s dedicated riot squad quitafter two officers faced criminal investigations, accused of pushing down a 75-year-old protester outside City Hall. The action came after the Buffalo police union told its rank-and-file members it would no longer pay for legal fees to defend police officers related to the protests. And in April,17 officers, a sergeant and lieutenant resigned from the Albuquerque Emergency Response Teamfollowing a protest.Portland’s Rapid Response Team members also have been frustrated by the number of protest-related prosecutions that were rejected by the district attorney’s office.As of late January, the office had rejected almost three-quartersof 1,057 protest-related arrests referred by police.The dismantling of the team comes as the Police Bureau is struggling withan exodus of officers resigning from the bureaudue to low morale and complaints about lack of support from city commissioners. It also comes amid a spiraling number of shootings and homicides, andthe U.S. Department of Justice’s formal notice to the city that the Police Bureau has failed to complywith mandated reforms required under its settlement agreement.Further, any urgency to create a new uniformed, proactive policing team to try to combat the city’s gun violence has not materialized, withless than a handful of officers volunteering to serveon a team that the police chief had anticipated would include two sergeants and 12 officers.-- Maxine BernsteinEmail atmbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212Follow on Twitter@maxoregonianIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.By using this site, you consent to ourUser Agreementand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with ourPrivacy Policy."

Jared Kushner created a shell company and paid the Trump family $617 million.Business Insider reported:President Donald Trump’s most powerful advisor, Jared Kushner, approved the creation of a campaign shell company that secretly paid the president’s family members and spent almost half of the campaign’s $1.26 billion war chest, a person familiar with the operation told Insider.…..The shell company — incorporated as American Made Media Consultants Corp. and American Made Media Consultants LLC — allowed Trump’s campaign to skirt federally mandated disclosures. The tactic could attract scrutiny from federal election regulators.The Trump family appears to have violated campaign finance laws by creating a shell company, and then paying themselves funds that were not disclosed and odds are properly documented. The problem could much deeper than campaign finance violations.There is the possibility of potential money laundering and conspiracy charges if investigators find that the Trump family wasn’t just trying to skirt campaign finance laws, but were engaging in even more serious criminal activity.Trump was so confident that he would beat JoeBidenthat he spent half of the money that his campaign raised paying himself and his family. If Trump and Kushner thought that what they were doing was above board, they would not have created a shell company to hide their activities.Donald Trump will stay in politics,because bilking his followersand the taxpayers is his main source of revenue.The Trump campaign was a con, and all of those red hat wearing believers who donating money were lining Trump’s pockets.For more discussion about this story join ourRachel Maddow and MSNBC group.Jason is the managing editor.

GOP tweet misfires in linking crime trends to Democratic policies,-4.33,41.33,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/09/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-tweet-misfires-linking-crime-trends-democratic/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"Homicides are up across a group of 154 cities, but more than half saw no change or a decrease, and the broad category of all violent crime has plateaued across the group.Democratic leaders and most in their party oppose defunding the police.Many factors might have shaped crime trends, including the pandemic, widespread summer protests, and a struggling economy.Republicans see a winning issue in linking crime to Democratic policies.When homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, President Donald Trump wielded it as a campaign issue, saying Republicans would restore order to crime-ridden Democratic-led cities.He lost his race, but the GOP attacks continue. In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats.""Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,"" Republicanstweeted June 29.Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.We asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase infentanyl seizuresat the border,high-speed chasesin South Texas, and FBI directorChristopher Wraytalking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border.The RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies.Homicides increased in 2020. It’s possible that the toll could have topped 19,000 last year.But the RNC tweet is not narrowly about rising homicides. It encompasses several other claims that are flawed:Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining.""And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,"" Cassell said. ""So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious.""Some Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the50 largest cities, police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021.The RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it’s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month.One problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn’t published the 2020 edition yet.Other data sets lack the scope of the FBI’s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up.Apreliminary FBI crime reportfor 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. TheMajor Cities Chiefs Associationfound a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report fromCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter.The topline numbers don’t tell the whole story, however.For example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally — including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC’s broad-brush claim about escalating crime.The Council on Criminal Justice’s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 — from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021.That could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report’s authors say other unknown factors could be at work.The RNC’s claim that rising crime was a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlin said. ""Last year we saw both at play.""On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd.Cassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassell said.Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy ""dubious.""Even the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the ""homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country.""Looking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn’t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn’t begin until late May.The Republican National Committee tweeted that ""crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.""It’s not true that crime is rising to a level we haven’t seen in decades.Homicides are up, but there’s no evidence that the trend is tied to a police defunding policy or Democrats’ border policies, let alone that it’s a ""direct result.""Experts say many other factors may have played a role, including racial-justice protests and disruptions caused by the pandemic.We rate this claim False.Republican National Committee,tweet, June 29, 2021FBI,Quarterly data - Q1 2021, June 21, 2021FBI,Crime data explorer, accessed July 2, 2021FBI,Overview of Preliminary Uniform Crime Report, January–June, 2020, Sept. 15, 2020Major Cities Chiefs Association,Violent crime survey: 2020 end of year, February 2021Major Cities Chiefs Association,Violent crime survey: 2021 first quarter comparisons, May 2021Council on Criminal Justice,Pandemic, Social Unrest, and Crime in U.S. Cities 2020 Year-End Update, Feb. 5, 2021Congressional Research Service,Recent Violent Crime Trends in the United States, June 20, 2018Bloomberg City Lab,Cities Say They Want to Defund the Police.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but as Inauguration Day looms, what better way to honorhis work toward the mass Poor People's Campaignthan to heed this call to action.Washington DC'sgrowing houseless populationis in danger, and more than usual. Following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6,which killed five people, the BBC confirmed that armed groups — mostly white supremacist ones —are expected to returnen masse for President-electJoe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20. Stoked by PresidentDonald Trump, who on Jan. 13 became the first US president in history to be impeached twice, the threat of another insurrection has the city bracing, again, for impact.Coordinated mutual aid efforts are underway, but far from over. Due to COVID-19 compliance,shelters citywide are already operating at limited capacity(and reportedly full).According to The Washington Post's Kyle Swenson: ""If protests again turn ugly during the inauguration, those without shelter could be caught between battling police and extremists or make easy targets for instigators.""So, consider lending support if you're able, and in the spirit of Dr. King, choosing compassion. Four days before his assassination in March of 1968, Dr. King delivered his last major speech, titled aptly for today: ""Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution."" It was a sermon on the importance of eradicating poverty. ""Ultimately a great nation is a compassionate nation,"" he said. ""America has not met its obligations and its responsibilities to the poor.""

House Democrats make their case to Senate Republicans: Trump duped his rioters — and he'll dump you,-20.0,35.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/02/11/house-democrats-make-their-case-to-senate-republicans-trump-duped-his-rioters--and-hell-dump-you/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-11,25,"""His directive is Trump first,"" House impeachment manager and Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island reminded the Senate during the second day of arguments in support of the singular article of impeachment filed against the former president. It's a crucial takeaway that should be heeded by the Senate Republicans who plan to acquit Trump, caring not one bit about the overwhelming evidence of his guilt in inciting an insurrection on January 6. Senate Republicans are putting their loyalty to and fear of the sociopathic man-child from Mar-A-Lago over their patriotism and basic sense of decency. But as Cicilline pointed out, no matter what you do for Trump, no matter how much you debase yourself for Trump, no matter what risks you take for Trump, he will not hesitate to throw you under the bus.The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has been overshadowed by the fact that the majority of Senate Republicans plan to acquit Trump. So the only real question is whether or not the House Democrats who are arguing the case against Trump can maximally expose the cowardice and complicity of the Republicans.House Democrats kicked off arguments on Thursday with a compelling presentation by Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, focused on how the insurrectionists believed they were there on Trump's orders. ""They actually believed they would face no punishment,"" DeGette explained, noting that the ""mob screamed at officers that they were listening to President Trump"" and ""believed the commander-in-chief ordered this.""The rioters were so dead certain that they were safe from consequences, DeGette pointed out, that they didn't bother to hide their identities. On the contrary, as most commentators remarked on in the days after the attack, they were so unafraid that huge numbers of them livestreamed, photographed, or otherwise advertised their participation in the insurrection.The reason these insurrectionists were sure that they'd be free of consequences isn't mysterious. It's because Trump promised them that they'd be safe. In the speech he gave sending the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump literally said, ""When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.""Even as the House managers argued their case, more evidence emerged proving it.New court documents from the Department of Justice revealed, CNN reported, that the leader of the Ohio Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, ""believed she was responding to the call from then-President Donald Trump himself."" The documents show that Watkins was deeply concerned ""about taking action without his backing."" As federal prosecutors argued, this was ""evident in a November 9, 2020, text in which she stated, 'I am concerned this is an elaborate trap. Unless the POTUS himself activates us, it's not legit.'""Trump gave the order to ""march"" on the Capitol and instructed that there is ""not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" The insurrectionists felt like they were shielded from consequences and free to ransack the building. After all, Trump promised the rules were now ""very different.""But they were not safe, as DeGette laid out.Over 200 people have been arrested and charged so far, some on very serious charges. Some of the rioters, DeGette noted, have since said they were ""duped"" by Trump,including Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnon shaman"" who became the face of the riot withhis weird buffalo headdress. On Wednesday,a lawyer for another one of the riotersreleased a statementcomplaining that his client, like many who heeded Trump's call, ""will be spending substantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence. Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.""The evidence does point to the long-standing truth grifters like Trump understand: The best marks are people who think they're part of the conspiracy. That's how Trump gets people. He lures them in by appealing to their ugliest impulses — like the growing Republican desire to unfairly seize power by undermining democracy — and then leaves his co-conspirators, who clearly followed Trump because they liked the idea of a fascist insurrection, holding the bag.""He lied to his base, saying this was all okay,"" Rep Ted Lieu of California said during his argument on Thursday.Democrats finished their case against Trump in a way that was just as impressive as they began it, meticulously laying out the facts while not shying away from the emotions brought on by these terrible events. Lieu was particularly hard-hitting, pointing out that, ""When you or I make a mistake and something very bad happens, we would show remorse,"" but Trump's reaction to January 6 was to brag about how perfect his behavior was, showing how intentional this was from the beginning.The Senate Republicans who are lining up to shield Trump should really think long and hard about why on Earth they want to protect a man who wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire. A man who always repays loyalty with spit in the face. A man who thanked his vice president, Mike Pence, for years of loyal service by sending a mob to kill him. A man who, as the House managers amply demonstrated with court documents, didn't care who he killed by inciting an insurrection, even if the victims were his most sycophantic supporters in Congress.But ultimately, the real question isn't whether Trump is guilty. Everyone knows he is. The only question is whether Senate Republicans want to be complicit with an insurrection that directly threatened their own lives. Presumably, they think they're playing 11th-level chess and will get some political advantage out of it. But in the end, they're no better than the morons who stormed the Capitol because Trump told them it was ""allowed."" And if they believe otherwise, it's because Trump has successfully exploited their own overblown egos against them — as he does to all of his marks."

Kim Reynolds has included 41 of Iowa’s 99 counties in her state disaster declaration, according to the Associated Press. Several rivers in the region — including the Missouri and the Mississippi — have swelled to dangerous levels, flooding small towns and breaching more than a dozen levees.Three people have died as a result of the floodwaters and two men in Nebraska have been missing since Thursday, according to the Associated Press.Emergencies have been declared in 74 cities and 65 counties according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, and water levels are expected to rise with more rain expected and snow continuing to melt. According to the National Weather Service, 9 million people across 14 states are still under flood warnings.Vice President Mike Pence is traveling to the Midwest Tuesday to survey the damage in Omaha, Nebraska, where hundreds of homes have been damaged and tens of thousands of acres covered in water, according to the Associated Press.Devastation has been particularly concentrated in eastern Nebraska. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency described the flooding as one of“the most devastating disasters in recent history.”Towns like Fremont have been completely surrounded by water, making relief and rescue efforts particularly challenging.Pilots have been flying supplies in to people who are stranded,according to local media. Video footage from an airplane show fields and roads in the area completely submerged. Roads and highways have also been severely damaged in areas surrounding the city of Omaha.The flooding has so far had an estimated cost of$550 million on the public sector in Nebraskaand $90 million on private infrastructure.In Iowa, failing levees in Mills County forced residents to evacuate. Buildings in the towns of Hornick and Pacific Junction were overwhelmed by water, forcing more than 400 people to evacuate, according to the Des MoinesRegister."

These entities are making Trump into an example oftheir powerto frighten the half of America that supported him in November. We cannot allow them to intimidate us.But they sure are trying, and on some, they will succeed. They are using the excuse of an unrepresentative group of fools criminally ransacking U.S. Capitol offices with a lighter touch than many of this summer’s often unpunished Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioters. Remember: Some of those riotersgot away withmurder, attackingpublic buildingsincludingin state capitols,arson, andstopping ambulancesfrom bringing wounded police into hospitals for treatment.

In December, for example, a so-far unnamed credit card processing companyrefused to process donationsto the American Family Association because it is socially conservative. Previously, big banksrefused to bank for legal gun manufacturers after pressure from leftist activists.This is the kind of power the left holds over all the institutions that make life possible for Americans, and they have already revealed they are not afraid to flex that power against the left’s chosen enemies. All of this is merely the next step in years of campaigns to use economic pressure to control public policy.The watershed moment was the 2015 Religious Freedom Restoration Act attempt in Indiana that was turned into LGBT legal preferences because big corporations decided to override the state’s voters, and then-Gov. Mike Pence and state Republicans turned tail and ran. When a pressure tactic works, it will be increased. That’s precisely what has happened in the past five years, including the most recent information ops on the 2020 election.We all saw Big Tech and Big Media collude to hide information damaging to the left and amplify information and narratives damaging to the right. Corporations are now wielding supragovernmental power untethered by even the pretense of constitutional legitimacy, and our government seems entirely powerless to stop them.This all moves us closer to a nongovernmental social credit system like that employed by Communist China, which economically and socially punishes people for “wrongthink.” It appears that global oligarchs have decided to not only collude with China’s totalitarian control over its society, but to export that social control to formerly free nations such as the United States.Consider thesecompanies’ vocal support foranduse of Chinese slave labor in their supply chainsversus their nuclear retaliation against Trump saying words they don’t like. Then consider that they still distribute propaganda from foreign leaders who fomented global instability by mismanaging COVID-19 then lying about it (China), fund terrorism (Iran and Russia), and confine millions of minorities in slave camps (China).These companies give mass murderers, global villains, and slave traders a platform while denying one to their arch-enemy whose worst crime is saying mean, imprecise, false, and stupid words while not being a Democrat. So of course Chinese government censors cheered them on.Even US president’s account could be suspended due to serious risk, this shows freedom of speech does have boundary in every society. No country is capable of guaranteeing absolute freedom of speech. The lack of such capability is regrettable.pic.twitter.com/KKdnQz38Kz— Hu Xijin 胡锡进 (@HuXijin_GT)January 9, 2021This is a world that one of the leading lights of leftism, The New York Times and columnist Tom Friedman,welcome with open arms.

If this bright future requires ignoring a few million enslaved Uighurs, well, omelets require eggs, you know. Anything for the Party.This week’s escalation of totalitarian speech controls and witch hunts — Are you now or have you ever been a supporter of Donald Trump? — is terrifying, and not just because of the lack of defenses against leftists’ demonstrated control of information and funding. If they can do this to the president of the United States, whocan’tthese corporations do it to?If President Trump hadactually called for rioters to stopand “go home in peace,” andfirmly denounced violent lawbreakingwhile acknowledging the 99.9999999 percent of his supporters who are peaceful and lawful, but these corporations told the world he was instead “inciting violence” and encouraging “sedition,” how would we ever know the truth?If they choose to lie to us, to lie about one political party, to lie about events they use to impose draconian speech and social controls, and to ban us from ever sharing information that proves or even simply suggests they lied or aren’t telling the whole story, how would we ever know it?However long it takes, whateverethicalmethods it takes, their power must be broken. You and I can start by not believing a word they say. Next, we need to start securing and expanding our ability to find and proclaim the truth, for as long and as loudly as we can."
Trump fans are hoping he’ll commute Pollard’s sentence – The Forward,-0.67,39.67,https://forward.com/news/458462/the-timing-is-right-for-trump-to-help-jonathan-pollard-convicted-spy-move/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,25,"ByStewart AinNovember 13, 2020Supporters and friends of Jonathan Pollard, the American Jew who served Israel as a spy, are hoping that before he leaves office, President Donald Trump will enable Pollard to emigrate to the Jewish state by commuting his sentence or pardoning him.Pollard pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit espionage in connection with providing Israeli contacts with hundreds of classified documents he had obtained as a civilian intelligence specialist for the U.S. Navy.After serving 30 years in prison, he began 15 years of parole, whose conditions stipulate that he not leave the country. He also has a curfew and the government monitors his computer use.However, Pollard’s parole comes up for review by the U.S. Department of Justice every five years, and his five-year anniversary is on Nov. 21, saidDavid Schoen,a defense attorney not connected to the Pollard case who practices nationwide and has worked on cases involving government security clearance.Eliot Lauer, Pollard’s lawyer, could not be reached for comment.Pollard and his wife are eager to learn the government’s plans, especially because he longs to move to Israel and has already become an Israeli citizen, but they haven’t an inkling of what the Justice Department might do, said a friend of the family who talked with them Thursday morning but spoke on condition of anonymity.If the Justice Department makes no changes to his parole arrangements, Pollard could appeal to Trump for a commutation of his sentence, or a pardon. He could also appeal to the department itself, but going to Trump is the stronger strategy, Schoen said.Pollard’s allies are already trying to involve Trump, beloved by many Jews for moves he’s made related to Israel, such as moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.In 2017, Trump commuted the 27-year sentence of another high-profile Jewish prisoner, Sholom Rubashkin, the former CEO of the largest kosher meat-processing plant.“I think there is a good chance – based on his track record – that Trump may do something,” said Farley Weiss, president of the National Council of Young Israel. “There is no question that he has been the best president for Israel of any president in history.”Weiss asked deceased Sen. John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, to help Pollard leave prison on parole after he had served 30 years of his life prison sentence. Now he’s tapping his contacts again on Pollard’s behalf.Jewish supporters of both Rubashkin and Pollard claimed that their sentences were excessive. Farley called Pollard’s sentence a “miscarriage of justice.”Just before he was sentenced, Pollard tried to cast himself as a kind of Jewish patriot, the Forward reported, trying to help Israel by compensating for the American intelligence community’s failings.Others, includingthe Forward,have argued against leniency for Pollard.“Jonathan Pollard is not a Jewish martyr,”wroteNew Republic editor Martin Peretz.“He is a convicted espionage agent who spied on his country for both Israel and Pakistan (!) — a spy, moreover, who got paid for his work. His professional career, then, reeks of infamy and is suffused with depravity.”Stewart Ain, an award-winning veteran journalist, covers the Jewish community.

REPORT: Pfizer Vaccine Confirmed To Cause Neurodegenerative Diseases,24.67,9.0,https://nationalfile.com/report-pfizer-vaccine-confirmed-to-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"“The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing,” the report declares. “In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.” Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain.This is especially concerning since the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, an untested type of vaccine which creates new proteins and can actuallyintegrate into the human genome, according to a report from the National Library of Medicine. In other words, degenerative brain conditions may appear at any time in your life after receiving the vaccine.“The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations,” explains the report. TDP-43 is a protein known to cause dementia, ALS and even Alzheimer’s, according toAlzpedia. Similarly, the FUS protein is known to cause ALS and Hereditary Essential Tremors, according to theHuman Genome Database.The experiment done for the report was to determine whether or not these two harmful proteins embed themselves into our DNA, as an mRNA vaccine is expected to do. The report determined that “the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations,” meaning that both proteins have the potential to embed themselves into our DNA and cause harmful neurological diseases.The report’s abstract summary concludes that “The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.” The report itself ends with this warning: “The vaccine could be a bioweapon and even more dangerous than the original infection.”National File actually reached out to the CDC to inquire as to why the Pfizer vaccine is still being distributed despite these credible allegations.

Facebook Oversight Board Upholds Trump Ban but Ridicules the Reasoning,-18.33,30.67,https://newrepublic.com/article/162310/facebook-oversight-board-upholds-trump-ban,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-05,25,"He has yet to launch his rumored social media platform, but we now know where the former president will be posting for at least the next six months. It’s calledFrom the Desk of Donald J. Trump: a drab, dated microblog that would be equally comical and forgettable if it weren’t the new mouthpiece of this country’s most powerful demagogue.Unless Parler backs up atruckload of cashto Mar-a-Lago, this might be Trump’s only option. He remains banned from Twitter, and on Wednesday morning the Facebook Oversight Board—or FOB, a pseudo-legal organization conceived andsubsidized by Facebookto issue binding decisions on major content moderation issues—declaredthat Facebook’s post-Capitol insurrection ban of Trump could stand. “The Board found that the two posts by Mr. Trump on January 6 severely violated Facebook’s Community Standards and Instagram’s Community Guidelines,” wrote the FOB in its decision, arguing that Trump broke “rules prohibiting praise or support of people engaged in violence.” (Trump’s posts encouraged rioters to go home peacefully, but they also contained statements supporting their false grievances about a stolen election.)FOB and its parent organization agree here, but perhaps nowhere else. Facebook initially declared its Trump ban temporary but indefinite, then asked the FOB to weigh in. The board on Wednesday excoriated that decision as a reflection of Facebook’s rudderless policies, and its members are not pleased at being used to run political interference for the company. “In applying a vague, standardless penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities,” declared the FOB. “The Board declines Facebook’s request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty.”Punting the decision back to company leadership, the FOB said that Facebook now has six months to decide what to do about Trump—and to get its policies together in the process. It’s a vital, long overdue request, and Facebook shows no sign of being able to fulfill it.Meanwhile, Trump now has another six months to rile up his legions by painting Facebook as a leftist shill that silences conservatives. “Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before,” read aTrump statementdistributed via email. “The People of Our Country will not stand for it! These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.”This messy, embarrassing result, which will satisfy few across the political spectrum, must come as a shock to Facebook. While the FOB had a respectable roster of academic and political luminaries, it was widelyconsidereda rigged regulatory body that would, perhaps temporarily, pacify legislators and activists critical of Facebook policies. Instead, after issuing a few sober-minded decisions on lower-profile matters, the FOB has come out with surprising aggression, showing up its minders as blithe techies ignorant of the damage their platform causes.Yet however silly Facebook ends up looking, the FOB decision still represents a qualified success for the company. The system—Facebook’s system—works. It just needs some clarity and fine-tuning. Facebook, which is used to riding from scandal to scandal, has six months to improve procedures and gauge thepolitical weather vane, after which it can again declare itself a responsible steward of public conversation.Facebook surely will remain undaunted in the wake of the board’s judgment. Time and again, the company has proven unable to reckon with its own scale and impact, as it recklessly pursues growth at all costs. This is especially true in certain foreign markets likeSri Lanka,India, andMyanmar, where Facebook has been manipulated by illiberal and authoritarian governments to spy on dissidents, propagandize, and provoke real violence. In his use of Facebook as a rallying tool for an aggrieved base capable of its own sudden acts of political violence, Trump has more in common, stylistically and strategically, with India’s Narendra Modi or Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte than with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who lamented Trump’s initial ban.Facebook’s political utility and its runaway popularity have always outstripped its policies and its identity. While notionally liberal, it’s hard to say what Facebook stands for—even its supposed devotion to free speech has been watered down as something called“Voice.”The company has no firm public standards for how to deal with lying demagogic political leaders weaponizing its platform to intimidate opponents and manipulate supporters. It claims to have “human rights commitments,” including aCorporate Human Rights Policybased on United Nations standards, but the platform is a constant site of abuse. It probably should not be available in nondemocracies, which is to say nothing of its destabilizing effects on our own rickety political infrastructure.“Facebook has become a virtually indispensable medium for political discourse, and especially so in election periods,” wrote the FOB. “It has a responsibility both to allow political expression and to avoid serious risks to other human rights.” Because it can be a tool for free expression and also one for spreading misinformation or political incitement, the board said, “Facebook’s human rights responsibilities must be understood in the light of those sometimes competing considerations.” In short, Facebook’s own values may be in conflict with one another, perhaps irreconcilably so.There’s a deep reckoning to be had over how Facebook handles content moderation at scale, freedom of expression, and the outsize influence of certain politicians. The FOB’s decision wasn’t it. This necessary round of criticism will do nothing to solve Facebook’s core problems, which revolve around its business model, its profound dependence on surveillance, monetizing user behavior, and stoking division to boost engagement.The problem with Facebook is Facebook. We are well past the point of reform. All that remains is more bumbling, mealymouthed corporate decision-making that will only further enrage the left and right alike. Perhaps Trump’s stay of social media execution can somehow unite those political factions to take down Facebook, but more likely we’ll all be in the same place six months from now: yelling about Facebook’s obscene power, while the company ravenously accrues more of it."

The White House refuses to say whether or not Trump will accept results of the election,-25.33,31.67,https://occupydemocrats.com/2020/08/19/the-white-house-refuses-to-say-whether-or-not-trump-will-accept-results-of-the-election-1/,https://adfontesmedia.com/occupy-democrats-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,25,"A core component of the Republican Party’s strategy to reelect Donald Trump is consistently and unapologetically lying about just about every political issue on the table.Yet there are some things that Donald Trump says about his future intentions that the American public must take deadly seriously — his refusal to confirm that he will abide by the results of an election that he is already calling rigged before a single vote is cast and while he is doing everything in his power, including destroying the U.S. Postal Service, to suppress the ability of Democrats to vote against him.This unprecedented refusal to commit to an orderly transfer of power once the election results are confirmed was the subject of a question posed to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today during a press briefing.McEnanay was asked to explain Trump’s comment earlier this week that “the only way he would lose this election was if this election was rigged” and whether there was “any circumstance under which he could lose the election fairly.”The Press Secretary’s answer was a perfect example of why she’s been dubbed “Kay-lie” by many observers who are amazed at her ability to spout misinformation and outright fabulism in her defense of the president.Actually, it’s difficult to fault the truthfulness of McEnany in the opening line of her response to the question since she couches it with the qualifier “The president believes” which could provide an excuse for a large multitude of delusional notions.“The president believes that he has done a great for ther American people and he believes that will show in November,” the Press Secretary began her answer. “He believes that, uhh, that voter fraud is real, in line with what we see all across the country, particularly wirth mail-in ballots which are prone to fraud,” McEnany concluded by repeating Trump’s false talking points.While this level of misinformation regarding phony claims of mail-in voter fraud is frightening, what McEnanay said in response to a follow-up question should result in many a lost night’s sleep for anyone who values our nation’s democratic principles.A reporter asked whether Trump’s claims — that the only way he will lose will be if the election is rigged — means that he won’t accept the election resultsunlesshe wins.“The president has always said he’ll see what happens and make a determination in the aftermath,” McEnany replied.“He wants a free election, a fair election, and he wants confidence in the results of the election, particularly when you have states like Nevada doing mass mail out voting to their voting rules and when they tried this in the primary, it was a massive failure, ballots were piled up in trashcans, ballots were pinned to apartment dart boards, and with that being the system, the president wants to take a hard look at this and make sure these are fair election results and not subject to fraud,” the Press Secretary replied, rapidly repeating her talking points with barely a breath between her words.McEnany’s regurgitation of Trump’s self-serving attempts at reducing the confidence in an absentee ballot practice that has functioned without major problems – with the exception ofRepublican-planned election fraud— for decades is a dire forecast for an era of post-election turmoil as the president is already preparing the nation for the monumental tantrum he will throw if his attempts at skewing the playing field through voter suppression and the summoning of foreign interference do not yield the desired victory that he foolishly believes that he deserves.You can watch McEnany respond to the questions about Trump’s willingness to accept the election results in the video excerpt below.Reporter: ""Is the President saying if he doesn't win this election that he will not accept the results unless he wins?""Kayleigh McEnany: ""The President has always said he'll see what happens and make a determination in the aftermath.""pic.twitter.com/iH606u3V38— The Hill (@thehill)August 19, 2020After watching that, hopefully you’ll be convinced of how imperative it is that Trump is defeated in a landslide.Now is the time to double-check your voter registration and make sure everyone you know is committed to casting their ballot for Jow Biden and rid the White House of the scourge currently occupying it.Vinnie Longobardo is the Managing Editor of Occupy Democrats.

The move, which was expected because Biden said he would do it, drewsharp criticismfrom Texas, where the pipeline would have ended in the Houston area.The “working class party” is just fine with killing thousands of union jobs.Anything to appease the radical left and their pseudo-environmentalism.https://t.co/9LU0VQQwgd— Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX)January 19, 2021Michelle Michot Foss, a Ph.D. fellow in energy, minerals, and materials at Rice University’s Baker Institute said the extension would have benefitted the Houston region.“This project is one of those great security blankets. We have that delivery of crude from Canada. It comes right into the refining complex here, which provides roughly 30 to 40% of U.S. fuel supply and would help to keep prices affordable as everybody engages in economic recovery,” said Foss.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) also inveighed against the move. Unions and most Democrats — about 62% — opposed the cancelation. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in against the move. Canada is now said to be considering some type ofsanction against the United States. Biden’s move affects workers in both countries; it kills about 12,000 jobs in the United States and another 2,000 in Canada as both countries are still reeling from the COVID pandemic’s destruction of jobs.The United States is our most important ally & trading partner.As friends & allies, we are deeply disturbed that one of@POTUSfirst actions was to rescind the Presidential permit for Keystone XL Pipeline border crossing.That’s not how you treat a friend & ally.My statement:pic.twitter.com/v2vRrs5vPn— Jason Kenney (@jkenney)January 21, 2021It’s how a Democrat president treats not only an ally, but American workers as well.Canceling the Keystone XL also hurts the environment. The pipeline would have moved between 800,000 and 830,000 barrels of oil per day safely, off our roads and rails, from where it’s produced to where it can be refined. That was to be Texas, which leads the world in the clean and safe refining of oil into products the modern economy depends on every single day. So some of the jobs lost were in Texas, about which Biden will not care, as Texas did not vote for him.With the pipeline canceled, Canada will find other customers for its oil. That’s likely to be China and India, two of the world’s fastest-growing and most energy-hungry economies. Instead of being transported safely via the Keystone XL pipeline, the oil will be transported by trucks and ships — both of which emit far more gunk into the atmosphere than pipelines, and both of which are far more prone to accidents and spills. It’s likely to be refined outside the United States, where standards do not match U.S. EPA standards.Joe Biden killed thousands of jobs, hurt relations with a close ally, and hurt the environment on his first day in the job, while also violating his promise to put science first.Bryan Preston served as chief of staff to Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton.

First 100: Exempting the Unemployed from Surprise Tax Bills,-13.33,36.0,https://prospect.org/first100/first-100-exempting-unemployed-from-surprise-tax-bills/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-prospect-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,25,"Stop, you're going to have to pay taxes on that unemployment money, unless Congress does something about it.See, we’re having a discussion about “targeting” relief. Democrats are reportedly seeking to “target” checks to a smaller population of recipients. Larry Summers isbloviatingabout the non-targeted aspects of the bill being unnecessary. Only certain lucky duckies based on certain completely imprecise characteristics get to be the ones tapped for relief, you see.Yet under current law, some of the most vulnerable people in the country are directly targeted for an expense they probably don’t know anything about. Iwrote about this in December, that unemployment benefits are taxed at the federal level and in34 states. So anyone who received the generous $600/week benefit last spring or has been on unemployment for an extended period and didn’t withhold taxes from it—something almost nobody does—will be liable for a large payment during the upcoming filing season, which they might not see coming. The most liability would be for the four million-pluslong-term unemployed, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of all unemployed persons, according to thelatest jobs report.Some members of Congress are trying to fix this, by targeting relief right at those who need it. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Rep. Cindy Axne (D-IA) havereleased a billthat would exempt the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits in 2020 from taxation. This would relieve the burden of a surprise bill from people, as the standard deduction ($12,400 for individuals and $24,800 for couples) would likely take care of any additional tax liability.“We have so many Americans that were on unemployment insurance last year,” Rep. Axne told me in an interview, noting that 40 million Americans received some level of benefits.More than 18 millionare still getting benefits, and Axne wants to avoid a surprise bill for this population. “I can’t imagine the feeling that must give, to get a bill and not be able to pay for it.”Congress did this in the 2009 stimulus package, exempting $2,400 in unemployment benefits from taxation. The federal boost—just $25 a week!—was far lower in 2009 than the $600/week earlier this year and the $300/week currently.Congress has also already tried to fix tax issues for this population. Because many long-term unemployed would have missed out on the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is tied to work, in the last coronavirus relief bill Congress created a “look-back” provision that allows people touse their 2019 earningsto calculate their EITC relief, as well as for the Child Tax Credit. This will allow the normal situation where low-income people get a large refund during tax season. People have come to rely on that refund, using it to pay off debt or make deferred purchases.There’s one problem with the EITC patch, however; people have to know about it. And they have to find their 2019 tax return and use that to qualify for the credit. There could be utilization issues here, and combined with the tax time bomb from unemployment benefits, a lot of people could face a tax payment when they expected a refund. Others who had some income early in 2020 but lost that job and went on unemployment could also see a big surprise.“We do need to make sure we’re keeping money in people’s pockets,” Axne said. “How can we expect this burden on their finances when they’re already in peril?”Back in December, when Donald Trump delayed signing the COVID relief package until after extended unemployment expired, people were deprived and in some cases are still being deprived of their benefits, as designed-to-fail unemployment systems don’t spin back up quickly to reflect the new law. ACentury Foundation reportfound that beneficiaries lost $17 billion just in January because of the delay. Similarly, tax filing begins next week, making it more urgent to exempt unemployment from taxes. “This is why it’s so important to get it into the COVID bill,” Axne said. “We run that risk if we can’t get it into a bill and apply it to 2020 taxes.”We know exactly who people will blame for this as well; whoever’s in the White House, even though unemployment benefits have always been taxable. This would be an anti-stimulus at the worst possible time, and it’s easily avoided. And the relief would be that thing that’s in vogue right now: targeted. “This is a common-sense, pragmatic solution to what we’re facing right now,” Axne said. “Don’t kick someone when they’re down.”Because Rep. Axne also serves on the House Financial Services Committee, I had to ask her about the GameStop madness and over-speculation in financial markets, and she opened her response with a surprising story. “I think about my nephew, 18, a senior in high school, up until 4 in the morning figuring out how to get into the GameStop thing,” she said. “These are the people we have to protect, people around the country thinking they need a quick fix.”But Axne went on to say that the recent ramp-up of retail investing reveals something about America in an age of inequality. “Why do Americans think the only way they can get ahead is to go into the markets?” Axne asked. “It points to a bigger issue of equity in this country. People are tired of sitting on the sidelines while Wall Street gets richer and richer.”I made some similar pointsin a piece this week, looking at the various “sophisticated” speculation in the market. I know financial regulators met yesterday, but I fear they’re too focused on GameStop and Robinhood and not on all this useless speculative nonsense and over-financialization that has our economy in a doom loop. I was pleased that Rep. Axne is pointed in the right direction; let’s hope the Biden administration gets there too.David Dayen is the Prospect’s executive editor.

"Despite waiting for years, some Indian immigrants are now giving up their green card dreams",-8.33,44.0,https://qz.com/india/1871644/indians-on-h-1b-visas-are-giving-up-on-their-green-card-dreams/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,25,"Thirty-eight-year-old Amey first went to America to study at Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. Both he and his wife, who works at one of the world’s top biotech companies, are on the H-1B, a non-immigrant visa allowing foreigners to live and work in the US. One of Amey’s previous employers applied for his green card in 2011. Almost a decade later, a green card still eludes him.“We’ve been waiting patiently for our green card since nine years now and it will likely take another 10-plus years till we get it,” says Amey, who like the other Indians in America whom we spoke to for this story asked that we publish only their first names to avoid drawing attention from US immigration services.Over the last decade, Amey has worked at several technology startups. “I helped them launch award-winning products, hire teams, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding,” he says.A few years ago, he and his wife opened a mom-and-pop store in suburban Philadelphia where they hired around 15 local workers. Today, they live in Los Angeles with their two-year-old son and a five-year-old Goldendoodle.For millions of Indians who went to the US on the H-1B visa in the early 2000s, a green card was a tangible next step to security and freedom. The chances of getting one now, however, look grim. Indians ranging from those working on the frontlines in America’s fight against Covid-19at hospitalsto those employed at tech behemoths likeNetflixandGoogleare among those on the interminable line for green cards.Immigration Voice, a US nonprofit, has been sharing their stories on social media to help drum up support for a group it refers to as “legal high-skilled future Americans.”Of the total 1 million green cards given out every year, just 140,000 are for employment-based applicants. The majority of the rest goes to family-based applicants. And because of the annual 7% country cap on green card allocations in the employment route, Indians face unprecedented backlogs.“The bottom line is that the H-1B system is old and has many flaws, but has become the main vehicle for great foreign-born talent to enter the US either directly or after being employed as students” on OPT visas, says Ran Harnevo, the CEO of Homeis, an online network for expats and foreign-born nationals around the world. “There are super-talented employees that totally rely on this visa for several years with (a) very slim opportunity to evolve to a better visa or a permanent residency.”By the start of 2030, the green card backlog will exceed 2.4 million petitions, virtually ending all legal employment immigration from India and China, the countries with the most employment-based green card petitions, the Cato Institute’s immigration policy analyst David Bierwrote in a March 2020 brief.Getting the H-1B visa—a pre-requisite before an employer can sponsor an employee—is a herculean task in itself.Dhaval, 34, immigrated to the US from India in 2008 to pursue a PhD in computer science. He thought life would be much easier once he completed his doctorate but his name was not drawn in the H-1B lottery for four years. His optional practical training (OPT) period ran out and he had to enroll in a masters program that offered CPT (curricular practical training) to continue working.“In these five years of constant struggle with getting the immigration work visa, even after having the highest possible level of education, I lost valuable time in starting the green card process,” he said. In an upsetting twist of fate, he finally got the visa—but then his company decided to stop sponsoring green cards due to constant immigration rule changes carried out by the Trump administration.H-1B visa-holders typically hesitate to change or quit jobs, since losing H-1B status could get them kicked out of the country. Even if Dhaval switches jobs and gets a new sponsor within the year, the wait for a green card could be longer than 80 years.US president Donald Trump’s hardline anti-immigrant stance has made a historically onerous process all the more challenging. Under his administration, application denials and requests for evidence both have gone up.During a recent vacation, Amey’s visa drew extra scrutiny for reasons not known to him. He spent close to 40 days working remotely from another country until his visa was approved.Dallas resident Anuja, a post-doctoral research fellow in biochemistry, has faced similar issues. “Being on a visa has many problems, especially in my field, which comes under the technology alert list,” she says. “When I travelled to renew my student visa towards the end of [my] PhD in 2013, I had to spend five weeks in India to receive clearance to travel back to the USA.”Dhaval, Amey, and Anuja all give the same reason for wanting a green card: freedom. The freedom to change jobs and fields, to travel, to start companies, to buy properties and put down roots, and more.In spite of waiting it out for years, several green card aspirants have gotten fed up.“President Trump’s visa restrictions are a ‘kiss of death’ for American innovation, and signal to the most vulnerable communities that their immense social contributions simply don’t matter anymore,” said Homeis’ Harnevo. “He has shattered their American dream, and now they have nowhere to turn.”Canada, for one, makesimmigration much easierthan the US, and Indian-born workers in the US are taking note.Dhaval opted for Canada’smerit-based immigration systemin 2019 and got permanent residency status within a year. He plans to make the move in the coming months.According to the Cato Institute, the number of Indians applying for permanent residency in Canada has doubled since 2016. Amey, too, started looking into migrating to Canadian around a year ago, citing “uncertainty, the political rhetoric, and the constant anxiety related to the American legal immigration process.” The family is in the final stages of getting permanent residency in Canada.But not everyone has an easy way out.Anuja, who hails from Mumbai, is still holding out hope for permanent residency in the US because “the kind of research I am involved in doesn’t happen in India,” she says. She is trying to get her green card via the EB1 route, nicknamed theEinstein visasince it’s reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their fields. But the fear of things not working out is palpable.“If we were to lose our jobs today,” she says, “it would mean a flight back to India despite having spent our young years being as productive as possible in researching and mentoring, paying taxes, and being law-abiding citizens…not to mention visa issues in India due to havingUS-citizen kidsif you decide to go back.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

One camp argues that his dismissal was justified and another asserts it set a troubling precedent, which theNew York Timesunion should have done more to prevent.""What ever happened to the notion of worker solidarity ... to giving a fellow worker the benefit of the doubt,"" asked Steven Greenhouse, who spent three decades covering labor issues for theTimes. ""And why didn’t the NewsGuild do far more to defend and protect the job of a long-time Times employee, one who at times did tireless, heroic work on behalf of the Guild to help improve pay and conditions for all NYT employees?"" McNeil hadexcoriatedmanagement’s attempts to freeze pension plans in 2012, calling those involved ""belligerent idiots.""Timescrossword columnist Deb Amlen accused Greenhouse of an excessive focus on the ""perpetrator,"" arguing that he and others should shift their attention to the people McNeil had ""harmed.""""Why is it that the focus in discussions like this almost always [is] on ruining the perpetrator’s life, and not those who were harmed by [his actions],"" she asked.Reached for comment, Amlen told theFree Beaconthis is a ""private group"" and that she would ""appreciate it if you do not use anything I said or wrote.""The back-and-forth provides a window into the latest racial controversy roiling the paper, which saw a revolt among minority staffers over the summer after publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.). Opinion editor James Bennet ultimately lost his job.McNeil’s ouster came nearly two years after the incident that precipitated it. While chaperoning high school students on a pricey trip to Peru, the science reporter responded to a question from a student about whether one of her classmates should have been suspended for using the n-word. In the process, he uttered the offending syllables himself. An internalTimesinvestigation found his judgment wanting but stopped short of firing him.Only after theDaily Beastpublished an account of the incident, thrusting it into the public realm for the first time, was McNeil pushed out. ""We do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent,"" Dean Baquet, the paper’s executive editor, told staff in an email.McNeil's resignation on Friday—and Baquet's post hoc explanation that intent doesn’t matter—renewed the bitter debate among staff, with reporters warring with each other in public and private.ATimesspokeswoman muddied the waters further on Sunday, telling theFree Beaconthat racial epithets had no place ""in the newspaper."" The paperprintedthe same epithet as recently as last week in a magazine profile of the Princeton classics professor Dan-el Padilla Peralta.""Even in ironic or self-mocking quotations about a speaker’s own group (in rap lyrics, for example), their use erodes the worthy inhibition against brutality in public discourse,"" Danielle Rhoades Ha told theFree Beacon. She declined to say if that policy extends to social media, where otherNew York Timeswriters, including Nikole Hannah-Jones and Astead Herndon, have quoted the slur.Baquet’s statement in particular came in for scathing criticism in the Facebook discussion. ""‘We do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent’ might be the most racist statement I’ve ever read,"" said Lawrence De Maria, an award-winning crime and finance reporter. ""It demeans ALL races.""It is also untrue:""Larry Wilmore did not say, ‘You did it, my nigger,’"" Hannah-Joneswrotein 2016, referencing the black comedian’s routine at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Thereisa ""linguistic difference b/w nigger and nigga.""TheWashington Free Beaconasked Hannah-Jones whether intent made a difference in her case. She responded by posting this reporter’s inquiry, including his cell phone number, on Twitter, in direct violation of the website’sterms of service.Greenhouse argued that the staffers who went after McNeil,including Hannah-Jones and race reporter John Eligon, had their priorities backwards. Many of them, he wrote in the Facebook group, were ""far more willing to sympathize with these privileged 15- and 16-year-olds than with a long time colleague who has done much great work for the Times over the years.""The debate also spilled over onto Twitter.Timesreporter Michael Powell sparked backlash from colleagues when hetweeteda statement from the nonprofit literary organization PEN calling McNeil’s ouster ""chilling."" Eligon responded byaccusinghim of racism:""You often wonder what your white colleagues who are lovely to your face are actually thinking or saying about you — or people like you — behind your back,"" he wrote.The lack of clear standards has generated frustration internally. ""I don’t think anybody feels like we have any clarity about what happened with that incident or other alleged incidents,"" oneNew York Timesreporter told theFree Beacon. ""[W]e demand transparency of other people, and we don’t have it in our own processes.""It has also raised questions about who really edits the paper: Baquet or the radicals who work for him. ""Dean and AG [Sulzberger] make a decision, and then are bullied by a vocal minority into changing their minds,""Timescontributor Robert Worth said in the Facebook group.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is responsible for writing tax guidelines in the world’s wealthiest nations, is leading the discussions. This week, the new OECD secretary-general, Mathias Cormann, called Biden’s plan a “game-changer” and said he was “quietly optimistic” about reaching an international deal on taxing multinational companies.Biden is also asking the G-7 and G-20 nations to approve an additional proposal requiring the world’s largest and most profitable companies to pay taxes in any country they sell goods or services to. The new approach would upend century-old policies that now make it legally necessary for corporations to be physically present in countries where they are taxed.Though the proposal would also apply to other multinationals from many other countries, it is partly an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute among the United States, the European Union, and other countries worldwide over how to deal with major tech companies, most of them headquartered in the United States.Both the Obama and Trump administrations refused to consider a digital tax specifically targeted at companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. And until now, countries haven’t been able to tax the profits of goods and services sold under their jurisdictions if the corporation is not headquartered there. Under the Biden administration, the United States has gone from being the No. 1 holdout on corporate tax reform to the champion for such a transformation—including new taxes on Silicon Valley’s tech titans.It’s far from a done deal, with Ireland and other tax havens resisting the Biden proposal, but U.S. officials say they fully expect an endorsement from the G-7 as well as major G-20 nations such as Japan, India, Argentina, and South Africa. On Wednesday, the Biden administration imposed, and then immediately suspended, 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on six countries—Austria, Britain, India, Italy, Spain, and Turkey—that have imposed a tax on digital services that Washington says discriminates against U.S. companies. The move was interpreted as a warning to go along with the Biden proposal.“It’s a negotiating ploy,” said Michael Greenberger, an expert in international finance at the University of Maryland. “Essentially, what they’re telling these countries is this is not a free vote for you. There’s a significant threat of pain, and we’re going to give you six months to think about this.”If approved by the G-7 ministers, Biden is expected to sign off on the deal at his summit next week in Cornwall, England. If an agreement is then reached by the G-20 finance ministers at their meeting in July—and finally by leaders at the G-20 summit in October—the changes could amount to a virtual revolution in international corporate tax policies.And at a time when multilateral trade negotiations are stalled, the forthcoming pact could also open the door to new trade deals, some experts say.“This agreement could be the starting point for the reemergence of multilateralism in international trade,” said Eduardo Baistrocchi, a professor of tax law at the London School of Economics. “The next stage might be a new wave of free trade agreements.”A senior Biden administration official toldForeign Policythat the “two pillars” of the negotiations amount to a trade-off. The administration will demand agreement on one pillar—a minimum global corporate tax of 15 percent—in exchange for the ability to tax U.S. digital giants and other multinationals that often find tax havens where they are charged only a few percentage points.“We’ve never had as much momentum as we’ve had now,” the official said. Such changes would also have to be approved by Congress, but administration officials believe some Republicans might be on board, and the filibuster rule that has blocked so much legislation could well be eliminated by the time the proposal comes up for a vote, perhaps next year.For Biden, the new corporate tax plan is integral to his broader aim of reorienting the U.S. and global economy away from exploitation by major corporations and back to labor. Biden’s “Made in America” tax plan seeks to eliminate incentives for offshore investment and reverse a trend under which, even though U.S. corporations are the most profitable in the world, the United States collects less in corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP than almost any advanced economy in the OECD.Yet the problem of missing corporate tax revenue affects all advanced economies. For more than a decade since the Great Recession, revenue-strapped major countries have sought to find ways to collect tax revenue for multinationals that have headquartered themselves in tax havens such as Ireland, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Caribbean locales like the Cayman Islands. The so-called race to the bottom among countries has driven down corporate tax rates substantially over the last two decades. The average statutory corporate rate among OECD countries was 32.2 percent in 2000; by 2020, this had fallen to 23.2 percent, according to the OECD.“Our goal is to end the global race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxation,” said the administration official. “Every country is made worse off by tax competition, especially workers. … When people say they feel the system is rigged, and when you consider why we have such extreme inequality, tax is a big part of the story.” The official pointed out that corporate revenue as a share of U.S. GDP fell from an average of 2 percent in 2000 to 1 percent in 2018 and 2019. “That’s one-third of the average of the OECD,” the official said. “And we have to fix it.”Even before Biden assumed the presidency, the web had been slowly closing on tax evasion by individuals. In recent years, the OECD, working with more than 100 countries worldwide, adopted new international standards on the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes that have curtailed the use of tax havens and resulted in more than $100 billion in additional tax revenues to OECD countries, according to the organization’s data.And in 2019, the OECDproposeda new formulation for the way taxing rights are allocated across jurisdictions to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. Its proposal would empower states to treat some multinationals as single, consolidated entities and tax them on a share of their worldwide profitsbasedon where “real” economic activity occurs. The profits targeted are known as “residual” or excessive profits of higher than 10 to 20 percent margins. Biden’s proposal builds on these ideas.If enacted, Baistrocchi said Biden’s plan would amount to the “first systemic attempt” to redistribute profits and revenues from tax havens and multinational corporations since the 1930s."
CDC director denies political pressure affected new mask guidelines,0.0,46.67,https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/553750-cdc-director-denies-political-pressure-affected-new-mask,https://adfontesmedia.com/hill-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-16,25,"Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on Sunday said that the agency’s recent decision to recommend that vaccinated people no longer wear masks had nothing to do with political pressure from lawmakers.On “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace pressed Walensky to clarify what was behind the seemingly sudden shift in the CDC’s recommendations for mask wearing, asking her to confirm that pressure from lawmakers such as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) had nothing to do with the decision.“Yes, I can [confirm],” Walensky said.“I can tell you it certainly would have been easier if the science had evolved a week earlier and I didn’t have to go to Congress making those statements, but I’m delivering the science as the science is delivered to the medical journals,” Walensky said. “And, you know, it evolved over this last week. The cases came down over the last two weeks. And so that’s — I delivered it as soon as I can when we had that information available.”Wallace questioned whether the CDC was being overly optimistic in relying on the “honor system” for people to abide by the new mask guidelines.“We’re still vaccinating somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million people a day. And so every day, more and more people are getting vaccinated. The honor system is, to be honest, with yourself,” Walensky said. “If you are vaccinated, we are saying you’re safe. You can take off your mask, and you’re not at risk of severe disease or hospitalization from COVID-19. If you’re not vaccinated, you are not safe. Please go get vaccinated or continue to wear your mask.”Walensky confirmed that there were no plans to roll out vaccine passports on the federal level but acknowledged there “will be places at local levels” that might require proof of vaccination."
Trump admits he would have ignored coronavirus even without impeachment,-11.0,40.0,https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-impeachment-republicans-white-house-covid-19/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2020-04-01,25,"Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed thespreading Republican excusethat impeachment led to a slow andbotchedresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.“I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached,” Trump said at his daily coronavirus news conference from the White House. “And I think that’s a great tribute to something — maybe it’s a tribute to me — but I don’t think I would’ve acted any differently, or I don’t think I would’ve acted any faster.”A handful of GOP lawmakers have blamed the impeachment proceedings for the Trump administration’s failure to take swift action as the coronavirus spread in the United States — an admission that the Trump administration was slow to respond in and of itself.As news of a potential outbreak surfaced in China last year, the administration ignored guidelines from a National Security Councilplaybookcompiled in 2016 by former President Barack Obama’s administration, which laid out steps Trump could have taken to stop a pandemic in its tracks, including ensuring proper diagnostic capability, stockpiling personal protective equipment and other critical tools, and delivering a “unified message” from the beginning.Following a slow initial response, the Trump administration has facedcriticismover theshortage of testing kits, thelack of personal protective equipmentfor front-line medical workers, andmixed messagesfrom Trump, includinghow seriouslyto take the virus.As that criticism grew, GOP lawmakers unveiled a new strategy to divert attention from Trump’s shortcomings.Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner was one of the first Republicans toblame impeachmentfor the slow response, saying on March 23: “I had said, ‘We have to have a hearing. This sounds very serious. We have to have a hearing. We have to have a briefing.’ And guess what was going on in the middle of all this? Impeachment was going on.”Sen. John Cornyn of Texas alsosaidimpeachment slowed Trump’s response,tweetingon March 24 that Trump “did lose ‘precious weeks’ forced to defend himself against bogus impeachment charges.”Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pinned the bungled response on impeachment,tellingright-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that impeachment “diverted the attention of the government because everything, every day was all about impeachment.”But as soon as that message appeared to solidify among the GOP rank and file, Trump knocked it down.“Did it divert my attention? I think I’m getting A-plusses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment,” Trump said Tuesday.Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation."
The Only Fact about 9/11 that Really Matters,19.0,24.0,https://amgreatness.com/2021/09/10/the-only-fact-about-9-11-that-really-matters/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-10,25,"Thanks to delusional, feckless cowards in Washington, there will be another 9/11 and only those who understand the true lesson of 20 years ago can save us from it.Twenty years. A generation.What is left to be said?Haven’t we said it all? The names, the images, the stories of tragedy and heroism.The lives lost, the lives changed forever.God willing, the stories will be told for as long as there is someone to tell them—the individual tales that so encapsulate the things upon which our civilization is founded. The police officer, the firefighter, the chaplain, the office colleague who went back just one more time, the one who ran up the stairwell after the second impact, just to make sure that another innocent life, the life of a stranger, a colleague, a friend, a loved one, was rescued. The stories of those who died, sacrificing their lives in what our Lord and Savior instructed us is the ultimate act of love; “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.”The West—our civilization—is unique and the greatest of all civilizations that have ever existed because it rejects the cultural selfishness of the East, where the collective decides what is of import and the individual is, ultimately, expendable. Likewise it rejects the culture of the Middle East, where all that matters is power, whose tribe or clan is the most feared, or which can destroy the most.Ours is such a peculiar civilization in that it eschews the natural instinct to parochialism and power—jettisoning the seemingly genetically obvious “Me First!” instinct—replacing it with the exhortation “servus,” I am your servant, unto death if necessary. The mere fact that our Christian world’s greatest symbol is the Cross, a barbaric tool of torture and death, is remarkable. The persecuted are the saved. The persecuted are chosen. The persecuted, those marked for death, have already won. Forever.For these reasons, I choose to see the heart of 9/11 this way, as the greatest affirmation since the Civil War of our Christian heritage and the Christian values built into the founding of this, the greatest nation on God’s Earth, peopled by the greatest and most self-sacrificial and grace-filled citizenry in the world. But this should be obvious to anyone who loves America and understands that the West truly is the apotheosis of human culture.But remarkably, there is something missing in the conventional wisdom about September 11, an undeniable fact that the “elite” denied then and, incredibly, denies even more robustly today.Man is fallen. He cannot be “perfected.” Ask anyone who actually lived under a regime which sees as its putative objective, the creation of a “better” man, be it Robespierre’s Paris Commune (a realinsurrection), Lenin’s “Workers’ Paradise,” Mao’s China, or Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge.Man can choose—individually—to fight his innate and basest tendencies, but his natural state has been the same since the first Neanderthal prized his neighbor’s mate or coveted his hunting trophies and killed to obtain them. It matters not where or when it is, Man is always a fallen creature. Ask those herded into the concentration camps of the Balkans less than 30 years ago, or the Yazidi girls sold into sexual slavery by ISIS after Obama so precipitously withdrew our forces from Iraq just a decade ago.And this is the most important lesson on the anniversary of the events from that sunny Tuesday morning 20 years ago. Evil is real. It lurks in the hearts of men, it walks the Earth and will until Judgment Day.It is remarkable to think that 9/11 didn’t forever convince our “betters” of this truth. The imagery of people jumping from the Twin Towers to their deaths, the towers collapsing—the devastation jihadis brought to New York, D.C., and Pennsylvania. But it didn’t. Nor did the manual decapitation on camera of U.S. citizens, the mass murder of Egyptian Christians on the shores of an ISIS-controlled Caliphate, or even the broadcast immolation of a Jordanian pilot captured by those calling themselves warriors for Allah. Yet now we witness those self-same “experts” declare their hope for an inclusive Taliban government that will strive for “legitimacy.” This is worse than cretinism, it is a psychotic level of self-delusion.Evil is real. It walks the Earth today and it must be met with courage and brute force until it is crushed, just as it was when we entered the White House to serve a commander-in-chief who vowed to destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS. Which we did in just five months, despite being told by Obama that it was a “generational threat” which we just had to get used to enduring. And now, just eight months after President Trump left the White House, the jihadis who protected and gave succor to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden not only control Afghanistan, they have $83 billion worth of weapons Biden gave them, as well as new allies who also hate us, including the world’s greatest Communist dictatorship, China.Thanks to delusional, feckless cowards in Washington, there will be another 9/11 and only those who understand thetrue lessonof 20 years ago can save us from it.ΔSebastian Gorka, Ph.D., is former deputy assistant and strategist to President Donald Trump, host of the nationally syndicated""America First""radio show, and author ofWhy We Fight: Recovering America’s Will to WinYou can follow him on Twitter@SebGorka."

Does JOE BIDEN?No, the media and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not understand that. But most of the American people do, and that’s why Trump’s response was not just brilliant and correct, but savvy, when responding to the call by his opponent’s for top-down centralized control.“While Joe Biden will allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens, wants the President of the United States with the mere stroke of a pen to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months,” said Trump on Thursday. “I guess he thinks it’s good politics.”That last rebuke about politics was perfect. I hope whoever wrote it for him gets some kudos.“Different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the Corona problem. He does not identify what authority the president has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and know what is needed it.”WATCH below, via Grabien.Right on the button.Masks are good, he said in the same presser.

Judicial Activism Strikes Again As Tallahassee Judge Strikes Down DeSantis Administration’s Mask Mandate Ban,23.33,26.0,https://bigleaguepolitics.com/judicial-activism-strikes-again-as-tallahassee-judge-strikes-down-desantis-administrations-mask-mandate-ban/,https://adfontesmedia.com/big-league-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-28,25,"Florida’s Gorvernor Ron DeSantis has become a very popular figure in the conservative movement in recent months due to his efforts to push back on leftist tyranny wherever he and his administration is able to. Unfortunately, he seems to have hit quite the roadblock in the form of Judge John Cooper of Tallahasse. Earlier on Friday, the activist judgestruck downthe mask mandate ban the Governor has been trying to enforce, saying that they are “arbitrary” and that children lack “legal authority”. Correspondents will surely wait with baited breath to see if Judge Cooper will say the same thing regarding “legal authority” when it comes to lowering the voting age to 16 or lower.“I conclude that this evidence demonstrates that facemask policies that follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance are, at this point in time, reasonable and consistent with the best scientific and medical and public opinion guidance at this time,” Cooper wrote. “I am enforcing the bill passed by the Legislature and requiring that anyone who uses that bill has to follow all of the provisions, not some of the provisions.”And since the CDC is as infallible as the Pope, it would seem logical that the CDC with itsstellar track recordbe the bellwether with which judicial decisions should be made for the country’s third most populous state.Governor DeSantis’ primary motivation for this legislative effort was not only to provide parents the authority and autonomy needed to make informed and uncoerced medical decisions for their children, but to also push back on the emerging medical tyranny that has metasticized over the last year and a half, which seems to be the globalist’s latest and most fashionable attempt to claw away humanity’s freedom and dignity.It would also appear that many Republicans in Florida’s State Legislature are content with the trends in the Sunshine State and the rest of the country. One major exception appears to be State Legislator and Congressional hopeful Anthony Sabatini, who has on multiple occasions and venuescalled outwhat he considers the RINO leadership in the GOP at all levels of government.With the uniparty establishment taking greater pains to maintain their entrenched positions, it would appear that Republican politicians will continue to diverge in their actions, with more establishment types helping with maintaining the status quo and America First nationalists working harder and smarter than ever to overturn what they perceive to be the rot in all levels of government. The question of who will succeed will certainly be answered by time either way.Share:"

Lollapalunacy?

J.B. Pritzker has saidhe’ll be there himself— but University of Chicago epidemiologist Dr. Emily Landon called it “a bad idea” to move forward with the jam-packed event, especially with the more infectious Delta variant looming.“Lolla is too crowded. That’s the bottom line,” she said, acknowledging odds are slim Mayor Lori Lightfoot would pull the plug on the lucrative attraction.“It’s about harm reduction. You have to make the decision for yourself. These cases that happen because of Lolla aren’t likely to be a huge drag on the health care system. But will we see a bump? Yes, and Delta will probably make it higher,” Landon said.“A bunch of people are going to get COVID at Lolla, but a lot of people are getting it from other places now, too.”Fans attend Day 2 of Lollapalooza in Grant Park in 2019.Santiago Covarrubias/For the Sun-TimesThey’re getting it across the state, especially in downstate counties with lower vaccination rates. Cases started rising a few weeks after the state fully reopened June 11.Nearly 8,000 Illinoisans tested positive over the past week alone, an average of 1,140 new cases every day. The state was logging just 294 cases per day at the start of the month, and 238 per day in mid-June.Since then, the average statewide case positivity rate has increased fivefold, from a pandemic low of 0.6% up to 3.3% — the highest it’s been since the first week of May. Hospitals were treating 670 coronavirus patients Thursday night, the most they’ve seen since early June.Graphic by Jesse Howe and Caroline Hurley | Sun-TimesSource: Illinois Department of Public HealthGraph not displaying properly? Click here.State public health officials on Friday singled out 25 of the state’s 102 counties for being at a coronavirus warning level. DuPage is the first Chicago-area county to land on that list in several months, due to an increase in hospital visits for COVID-like symptoms.Most of the other warning-level counties are in central and southern Illinois, where vaccination rates are sometimes less than half the statewide rate. About 72% of all Illinoisans have gotten a shot, with about 56% fully vaccinated.Counties marked orange are considered at a COVID-19 warning level.Illinois Department of Public HealthEven though Lollapalooza takes place in the heart of Chicago, it could have a devastating impact on far-flung areas, said Landon, who urged attendees to “assume you’ve been exposed” and get tested afterward.“It can amplify the spread in areas with low vaccination rates. The people who go home to some south suburbs, to central Illinois, to Missouri — they’re going to set off little wildfires,” she said.But as far as personal risk, Lollapalooza “can be done safely,” according to Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society’s COVID-19 Task Force.“Outdoors is the safest place you can do it,” Chundi said. “If you’re vaccinated, you’re safe. If you’re vaccinated and masked, you’re really safe. If you’re not vaccinated and not masked, you’re not safe.”Attendees at the four-day music festival, which opens Thursday, have to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within three days of entrance, according to Lollapalooza.Anyone who is unvaccinated will be required to wear a mask while attending the event. And even those who got the shot are urged to consider masking up.Chundi said the check-in process could actually result in more transmission than other parts of the fest.“The bathrooms themselves are porta-potties, the vendors, they’re open-air — that all is basically OK. It’s getting huge crowds of people in and then getting them out of these choke points that causes concern,” he said.Thousands of music fans arrive in Grant Park for the first day of Lollapalooza in 2019.Erin Brown/Sun-Times fileStill, Chundi said the likelihood of Lollapalooza turning into a super-spreader event “is very low.” He expects cases to keep rising in the short term no matter what.“You’ve got 30,000 people going to Sox games, Cubs games and soon Bears games. In the U.S., we’ve decided the decision about getting vaccinated is your personal responsibility and your right. That’s getting us into some trouble,” Chundi said.“If we could get everyone to just mandate vaccination, we could get out of this whole mess.

Senior FBI Intel Analyst Admitted To Viewing Porn Of Girls As Young As 9 Years Old,1.67,54.67,https://dailycaller.com/2020/07/21/fbi-child-porn-intelligence-analyst/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-caller-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-21,25,"A senior FBI intelligence analyst admitted during a polygraph test that he viewed child pornography of girls as young as nine years old, according to a report of the investigation obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.The analyst, who is not identified in the report, was fired from the FBI, but the Justice Department and its child exploitation unit declined to file criminal charges against him.The report goes into greater detail about the investigation into the analyst than dida summaryof the probe released by the Justice Department’s inspector general in April.That summary said that the supervisory intelligence analyst (SIA)admittedto viewing and downloading child pornography several years earlier, but did not give any other details about the nature of the content.The investigative report, which the DCNF obtainedthrough the Freedom of Information Act, paints a more disturbing picture of the analyst’s activities.The analyst initially said he preferred pornography of girls between 15-17, before eventually acknowledging to having a preference for images of girls as young as 9 years old, and those “just starting to show signs of maturation,” according to the report.The analyst “admitted to masturbating” to child pornography, said the report, which is dated Feb. 21.The report said that the polygraph examiner conducted an interview with the analyst after he showed countermeasures, which are tactics intended to cheat a polygraph test.The analyst consented to allowing the FBI analyze his computers and phone. The FBI found 183 images of suspected pornography on the analyst’s computers and phone, but none were of underage girls, the report said.The report said that investigators with the inspector general’s office substantiated that the analyst knowingly possessed child pornography, a felony violation, but the Justice Department and its Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section declined prosecution.No identifying details of the SIA are included in the report. His position as a top intelligence analyst would suggest he worked for years at the bureau.The FBI did not respond to requests for comment about the report, or the SIA’s identity.Justice Department OIG report on FBI supervisory intel analystbyChuck Rosson ScribdAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

"If Mumia Abu-Jamal’s Case Is a ‘Non-Issue,’ Why Have Media Gone to Such Lengths to Silence Him?",-18.33,33.67,https://fair.org/home/if-mumia-abu-jamals-case-is-a-non-issue-why-have-media-gone-to-such-lengths-to-silence-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-01,25,"Challenging media bias since 1986.Philadelphia public broadcasterWHYY(4/24/21) was one of the few outlets to report on an April 24 rally seeking the release from prison ofMumia Abu-Jamal. The story included important information on Abu-Jamal, who is serving a life sentence for the 1981 killing of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.It noted that the case has “drawn scrutiny” over claims of police, prosecutorial and judicial bias and misconduct. It cited new evidence released as part of the appeal process, including a note from a key prosecution witness asking the prosecuting attorney for money—the sort of evidence that Johanna Fernandez, a history professor and part of Abu-Jamal’s legal team, notes has in other instances led to a defendant either being set free or getting an immediate new trial.Along with Fernandez, the piece includes the voices of Abu-Jamal’s brother Keith Cook, and MOVE member Pam Africa, as well as people who traveled from around the country to call attention to Abu-Jamal’s case, his current state of health—he has a number of debilitating conditions, and has just had heart surgery—and to put his story in a context of political prisoners here and around the world.I confess I was still irked byWHYYusing its lead paragraph to frame the story like this:The case has pitted Abu-Jamal’s supporters, including a long list of national and international celebrities who say he was framed, against police and their supporters, who resent the attention given to a man convicted of murdering a fellow officer.It bugs me, because those were the themes decades ago when Abu-Jamal was first convicted and sentenced to death (Voices With Vision,4/27/21). That he was a “cause celebre”—and therefore, wink wink, something something about liberal Hollywood, no need to pay attention—and that the upset of anyone concerned about his deeply flawed trial or his inappropriate sentencing was merely theatrical, because, after all, he was “convicted,” wasn’t he?Elite media at the time were open to straight-up lies: A 1995Washington Poststory (5/18/95) led with a macabre account from Faulkner’s widow, Maureen Faulkner, about how when her husband’s bloody shirt was held up in court, Abu-Jamal turned around and smiled at her. Except attorney Leonard Weinglass and the court record show that Abu-Jamal wasn’t in court when the shirt was displayed (Extra! Update,8/95).ABC‘s investigative news show20/20(12/9/98) employed a number of techniques for their big 1998 piece—stating prosecution claims as fact, even when they were disputed by some of the prosecution’s own witnesses or the forensic record; stressing how a defense witness admitted being intoxicated, while omitting that prosecution witnesses said the same (Extra! Update,2/99).At one point, actor and activist Ed Asner is quoted saying, “No ballistic tests were done, which is pretty stupid”—but then host Sam Donaldson’s voiceover cuts him off: “But ballistics testweredone,” he says, referring to tests that suggested that the bullet that killed Faulkner might have been the same caliber as Abu-Jamal’s gun. But he didn’t note that tests hadnotbeen done to determine whether that gun had fired the bullet, or whether it had been fired at all, or if there were gunpowder residues on Abu-Jamal’s hands.Producers fromPeople’s Video Networktold FAIR at the time (Extra! Update,2/99) thatABCnot only used clips they’d recorded from Abu-Jamal without permission, but they added layers of echo, making him sound, they said, “like a cave-dwelling animal.”No one was too surprised when it was revealed that in a letter asking permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to interview Abu-Jamal (a request that was denied),20/20pointed out that “we are currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police” (Extra! Update,2/99).After that, the main story has been non-coverage.For instance, in 2006, when Abu-Jamal won the right to appeal on three grounds—including a jury purged of Black people, the prosecutor lowering jurors’ sense of responsibility by saying their decision “would not be final,” and the fact that judge Albert Sabo was all kinds of biased—thePhiladelphia Daily Newstold reporter Dave Lindorff that it was a “non-issue” (Extra!,3–4/06)—although when a judge overturned the death sentence in 2001, the paper (12/19/01) found time to editorialize: “Let Mumia Rot in Darkness.”The late great media critic Ed Herman (Extra!,9–10/00) reported how thePhiladelphia Inquirerwouldn’t cover rallies and tribunals in support of Abu-Jamal, calling them “stunts,” but when the Fraternal Order of Police bought a full-page ad in theNew York Times, that merited a story.In 2000, when Amnesty International declared that the original trial was “deeply flawed,” theInky(2/18/00) made it the fifth “news brief” on page 2B.But if Mumia Abu Jamal’s case is a non-issue that only celebrities care about, why the active silencing?In 1994,NPRcancelled plans for a series of commentaries from Abu-Jamal—who is, after all, a journalist, a former head of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists—after Senator Bob Dole threatened their funding. They said it was because it was a “highly polarized and political controversy”—which they proceeded to say nothing about for the following year (Extra!,11–12/95).WhenDemocracy Now!prepared to air commentaries, stationKRTI, out of Philadelphia’s Temple University, cancelled the show and all ofPacificanews (Extra! Update,4/97), with a station VP explaining: “What’s good enough forNPRis good enough for me.”And when a Vermont college aired a taped commencement address from Abu-Jamal, it led Philadelphia lawmakers to throw together something called the Revictimization Relief Act, allowing crime victims  or prosecutors to sue inmates whose behavior behind bars “creates mental anguish” for the victims. Clearly unconstitutional, violating both free speech and due process rights, it was dubbed the Silencing Act by many, who noted that it didn’t just curtail prisoners’ right to speak, but journalists’ and all of our rights to hear them (FAIR.org,10/22/14).Media’s response was a shrug: TheNew York Timesran anAPpiece (10/21/14) with the headline “Pennsylvania: Gov Signs Law to Help Protect Crime Victims.”Elite media would have us believe they are engaged in a serious reckoning with the racism of the US criminal justice system, that they care about over-incarceration and prison conditions. And keeping people behind bars just because powerful people want them there, and not due to the merits of their case? Well, that’s what Other Countries do.If only there were a case, 40 years’ worth of case, that would allow them to explore those ideals—if not to do justice by Mumia Abu-Jamal (they can’t return what’s been taken from him), then to do some semblance of justice by their own claims of concern.Janine Jackson is FAIR’s program director and producer/host of FAIR’s syndicated weekly radio show CounterSpin.

Americans From Both Parties Want Weed To Be Legal. Why Doesn’t The Federal Government Agree?,-0.33,48.67,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marijuana-legalization-is-super-popular-why-hasnt-it-happened-nationally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-23,25,"Tuesday markedthe international holiday for marijuana— and consumers of the plant had lots to celebrate this year.New York,VirginiaandNew Mexicoall passed legislation in 2021 legalizing marijuana,1bringing the total number of states whererecreational consumption is legalup to 17, along with Washington, D.C. At the federal level, the House of Representativespassed a billthis week which allows banks toconduct business with cannabis-related companies in states where marijuana has been legalized,with the support of about half of the chamber’s Republicans and almost all of its Democrats; the bill now awaits its fate in the Senate.passed the House in 2019but wasn’t brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.But even if Biden may not be ready to pivot on marijuana legalization just yet (decriminalization, not legalization for recreational use, was part of his campaign platform), the polling on the issue has been loud and clear: People want weed to be legal.Gallup has asked Americans about whether they support legalizing marijuana since 1969, when only 12 percent of Americans supported the idea. As of their most recent poll last November, that number has ticked up to 68 percent, thehighest level of supporton record. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of states where recreational marijuana is now legal has also steadily increased since the Obama administration announced in 2013 thatit wouldn’t block state lawsthat legalized the drug, provided that marijuana was strongly regulated.And if recent polling in states where marijuana is not yet legal for recreational use is any indication, it is possible that even more states will change course. Although, as the chart above shows, legislators have often been slow to legalize marijuana for recreational use: Thirteen of the 18 states where marijuana is legal have done it via voter-driven ballot initiatives rather than legislation. That said, legalization is broadly popular even in more Republican-leaning states like Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas.Marijuana legalization may appeal to voters in both very blue and red states, in part, because it’s an issue with bipartisan support. According to a recent poll from thePew Research Center, 72 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans supported marijuana legalization for medical and recreational use. Further, Pew found that exceedingly few adults of any age were “completelyopposed to the legalization of marijuana,” though it did find that older Americans were less likely than younger Americans to be in favor of legalization. Only 27 percent of Republicans 65 and older supported legalization, the lowest level of support among any group Pew surveyed.But just because legalization is broadly popular doesn’t mean we should expect federal legislation on the issue soon. For starters,not all Senate Democratsback Schumer’s plan, and Senate Republicanshave yet to show any supportfor legalization. Additionally, while legalizing marijuana is popular, itisn’t a top priorityfor many voters. That may be, in part, due to the success of legalization efforts at the state level. More than one in three Americanslive in stateswhere marijuana is already legal for recreational use, and asizable majoritylive in states where marijuana is legal for medical use. For those who already have access to the drug, it may not matter whether it’s their state government or the federal government making that allowance. Finally, as my colleague Perry Bacon Jr. pointed out earlier this year,electoral politics are increasingly disconnected from policy, meaning that despite the popularity of marijuana legalization, there may simply not be a ton of electoral benefit for Biden for taking up the issue.Still, if the polling is any indication, legalizing marijuana is hugely popular, and Biden may yet change his mind, depending on how the politics of the bill play out. And if he does, he may even get some brownie points from Republican voters who support legalization. But if things start to get politically messy, Biden may not have a lot to lose by passing on championing this particular issue.According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker,453.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 40.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +13 points). At this time last week, 52.8 percent of Americans approved of Biden, while 40.8 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +12 points). One month ago, 55.1 percent of Americans approved of Biden, compared to 39.1 percent who disapproved."
Is There a Future for Fusionism?,12.33,30.67,https://reason.com/2021/02/10/is-there-a-future-for-fusionism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,25,"There's a well-worn tale about modern American conservatism: It says that the movement as we know it came into being during the mid–20th century as a ""fusionist"" coalition of economic libertarians and religious traditionalists. These groups, whose goals and priorities differed from the start, were held together mainly by two things: the sheer charisma ofNational Reviewfounder William F. Buckley Jr., and the shared enemy of global communism.As long as the Cold War endured, the story goes, each wing was willing to cede some ground to the other. In light of the threat posed by a rampaging Soviet Union—as militantly atheistic as it was militantly anti-capitalist—the differences between the libertarians and the traditionalists did not seem so great. Their interests, at least, were aligned.But the fall of the USSR meant the collapse of the common foe that had sustained the fusionist partnership. It was able to trundle on for a while, powered by a reservoir of goodwill, but it has long been running on fumes. In the last few years, the alliance's inherent tensions have come to a head. It's increasingly common to hear that, whatever value there may have been in cooperation during the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, the era of good conservative feelings is over.For many libertarians, the Trump years revealed their traditionalist allies to be hypocrites and opportunists, all too willing to sell out the ideals of fusionism in service of an aspiring dictator. Conservatives have commenced a not-so-slow descent toward authoritarianism, some in this group suggest; if the philosophy of liberty is to have a future, it must involve building bridges to the left, not the right.A number of traditionalists, meanwhile, have been tripping over each other in their rush to celebrate the end of fusionism. What the 21st century demands, they say, is a different, more ""muscular"" style of politics, practiced by a Republican Party that finally stops worrying and learns to love the state. By passing stronger laws, these ""post-liberal"" conservatives believe they can restore America's lost Judeo-Christian character and save their country from itself.This is quite a change from the Reagan Republicanism of a few decades ago. Back then, most folks on the right insisted that limited government and personal responsibility were the watchwords of conservatism. That consensus has now broken down.From literature to philosophy to religion, it's hard to think of a theme less original than the seductiveness of power. That, after all, is the story of Frodo and the ring; of Lord Acton and ""absolute power corrupts absolutely""; of Satan and the third temptation of Christ. One of history's great recurrent lessons is about the importance of keeping that desire in check, in our hearts and our governments alike. Which is why it's exasperating to watch so many conservatives—self-proclaimed heirs to the axiom that ""example is the school of mankind,"" in Edmund Burke's phrase—succumb in real time to the fantasy thattheyare the exception to this time-tested rule.As far as the post-liberal conservatives are concerned, libertarianism's preoccupation with protecting liberty has blinded it to the importance of promoting virtue (and a constellation of related values, including faith, family, community, and patriotism). The most moderate version of this argument suggests that libertarians have come to exercise too much influence over the right-of-center policy agenda and proposes a so-called rebalancing toward traditionalist concerns. A more radical version excoriates libertarianism as philosophically bankrupt and calls upon the keepers of the conservative flame to take a sledgehammer to the fusionist coalition once and for all.Hillsdale College's David Azerrad put the latter position starkly in a July 2020 essay forThe American Conservative. ""The common enemy that justified an alliance with the free market fundamentalists is long gone,"" he wrote. ""Today, libertarians actively side with our enemies: they promote open borders and empty prisons, and strengthen China's hand through their consumer-focused economic policies. Ours is primarily a conservatism of countries and borders, citizens and families, none of which can take root in the barren libertarian soil of atomized individuals and global markets.""The post-liberal agenda is typified by a desire for more government involvement in people's lives. AsThe New York Times' Ross Douthat wrote in 2019, this group seeks ""stronger state interventions in the economy on behalf of socially conservative ends."" Or, as Azerrad put it in his essay, ""the right must be comfortable wielding the levers of state power.""Economically, post-liberalism rejects the doctrine of ""unfettered"" free markets in favor of tariffs, an ""industrial policy"" intended to prop up American manufacturers in the face of competition from overseas, wage subsidies, and the like. On social issues, it supports everything from vice laws to a rollback of no-fault divorce to more robust speech restrictions on public morality grounds to (among a lively cohort of radical Catholics especially) the imposition of a confessional state and perhaps even a Christian monarch.There's little evidence that the post-liberals are speaking for the average Republican, let alone the average American. But the elite wind does seem to be at their backs.Fox News host Tucker Carlson was once an avatar of fusionism who supported Ron Paul for president in both 1988 and 2008 and toldReasonin 2010, ""I despise laws that tell people that they can't do things for their own good."" By January 2019, he was delivering a 15-minute on-air monologue decrying the failures of capitalism. ""Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy?"" Carlson asked. ""Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives,"" he continued, referring specifically to payday lenders. ""OK. But it's also disgusting.""Two months later, the Christian journalFirst Thingspublished a manifesto, signed by 15 conservative intellectuals, inveighing against a ""dead consensus"" that favors ""individual autonomy"" at the expense of ""permanent truths, family stability, communal solidarity, and much else."" Four months after that, the political theorist Yoram Hazony organized an impressively attended conference promoting conservative nationalism. He took the opportunity on behalf of those present to ""declare independence"" from neoliberalism, classical liberalism, and libertarianism.In November 2019, Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) raised more than a few eyebrows when he gave an address at Washington, D.C.'s Catholic University rejecting ""the notion that, left unguided, the market will solve our problems."" He called instead for a system of ""common-good capitalism"" capable of restoring the ""balance between the obligations and rights of the private sector and working Americans.""This, Rubio argued, can be accomplished only through some measure of state direction. ""Promoting the common good will require public policies that drive investments in key industries,"" he said, ""because pure market principles and our national interest are not aligned."" Fortunately for us all, the senior senator from the Sunshine State came equipped with plans for, among other things, ""a national co-operative that guarantees investment"" in the rare-earth mineral sector.Rubio's fervor for a conservatism that has made its peace with a bigger, more powerful central government has been matched and exceeded by some of his colleagues. First-term Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example—until recently the Republican Party's brightest young thing—seems not to have found a meddlesome technology regulation or ""pro-family"" policy he does not like. ""We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past,"" he said in a May 2019 Senate speech. ""We need not just a bigger economy but a better society.""In spring 2020, a new think tank called American Compass came online—""an organization dedicated to helping American conservatism recover from its chronic case of market fundamentalism,"" as founder Oren Cass put it in an announcement published byNational Review. Among the group's favored policies are subsidies for American manufacturers, reducing ""toward zero"" the number of visas granted to Chinese college students, and legally requiring corporations to put the common good ahead of profit seeking—perhaps by ordering them to include labor representatives on their boards of directors, thus ""short-circuiting the default assumptions of shareholder primacy by including workers among those to whom management is accountable.""That last suggestion is striking in its similarity to a 2018 bill introduced by progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), which would require U.S. companies ""to consider the interests of all corporate stakeholders,"" including by giving workers the right to fill 40 percent of board seats. Warren has been a public enemy of the political right for nigh on a decade. Yet the conservative media have heaped acclaim on Cass' efforts and held him out as the future of the movement.This sentiment culminated last August in a lengthy essay byNew York Timescolumnist David Brooks that contained glowing mini-profiles of Hawley and Rubio and that extensively quoted Cass. ""Over the long term,"" Brooks concluded, ""some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the G.O.P.""In 2018, Samuel Hammond, a researcher at the centrist Niskanen Center, persuasively argued that Warren's proposal represented a ""corporate catastrophe"" in the making. Today, he is a contributor to the American Compass blog, where not long ago he urged readers to stand up and insist: ""Conservatives believe in supporting families directly. And if that involves a pinch of redistribution, so be it!""Is there a contradiction there? Hammond doesn't think so. ""I really urge you to separate Warren's specific proposal,"" he says, ""from the broader investigation"" that Cass is leading into how to help the working class. In the end, ""the right will have to take on an orientation that's more skeptical of trade, more skeptical of big business, and more curious about pro-labor, pro-family policies.""The post-liberal conservative movement is a twisted artifact of the now-conventional view of fusionism as a partnership of convenience between two groups that have divergent and even contradictory belief systems: libertarians, who prioritize individual freedom above all else, and traditionalists, who know better.This understanding is subtly—but crucially—mistaken. Fusionism, properly understood, is not a marriage of two groups. It's a marriage of twovalue sets. A fusionist is someone who sees both liberty (in the classical sense of freedom from aggression, coercion, and fraud) andvirtue (in the Judeo-Christian sense of submission to God's commands) as important. Fusionism is therefore a distinct philosophical orientation unto itself. What's more, it has historically been the dominant orientation on the American right.Conservatives going back at least to the country's founding have believed that virtue and liberty were mutually reinforcing—and that neither could survive long without the other. A free society depends on a virtuous populace. (""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,"" wrote John Adams. ""It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."") But the reverse is also true: Virtue, to be virtuous, must be freely chosen. As the lateNational Reviewliterary editor Frank Meyer, usually identified as the godfather of fusionism, eloquently put it: ""Truth withers when freedom dies, however righteous the authority that kills it; and free individualism uninformed by moral value rots at its core and soon surrenders to tyranny.""Post-liberals tend to see liberty and virtue as fatally at odds. To be a good person necessarily requires accepting some limits on one's choices, after all. Mustn't one of the two fusionist pillars ultimately trump the other?There's no denying that the demands of morality, traditionally understood, pull against a theoretical ideal of freedom from all constraint. Fusionism reconciles this tension by insisting that the state protect people's fundamental rights to be secure in person and property—thus leaving individuals, and the various associations they come together to form, with as much space as possible in which to pursue the higher things. Within the governmental sphere, liberty is indeed the ultimate end. But within the infinitely broader sphere outside of government, it's just the beginning: A life well-lived consists in using one's freedom to do what's right. The clear recognition that these are separate spheres, with separate roles to play for the common good, is the genius of the fusionist project.Today's post-liberal conservatives appear to think they're distinguished by the belief that virtue matters. They behave as if their core disagreement with fusionists is about whether human beings have moral obligations that go beyond leaving others alone to do as they please. This could hardly be more wrong. Anyone who holds to the Judeo-Christian tradition—as fusionists by definition do—accepts that we have manifold duties to one another. The disagreement is about whether it's the state's job toenforcethose moral obligations.For a fusionist, the answer to that question must be no, for pragmatic as well as deeply moral reasons.The weight of evidence through history is that concentrated government power in the best case leads to incompetence and waste, while in the worst case it degenerates quickly into tyranny. Whether your main concern is material enrichment or the protection of human rights, limited government has been shown on the proving grounds of experience to be the best available means to that end.Arguably even more important is the Judeo-Christian doctrine of human beings' equal inherent dignity. As theCatechism of the Catholic Churchputs it, ""God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions."" And later: ""Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each other this duty of respect."" That is why state power is such a grave matter, fraught with danger not just to society but to the souls of those who wield it. Only when absolutely necessary—say, to stop one person from initiating violence against another—is it morally justifiable to overrule someone's right to live his life as he chooses.Understanding what fusionism is—and what it is not—is more important than it may seem. An arrangement in which traditionalists and libertarians are merely allies can easily become a game of tug of war in which each side jockeys to ensure that, on balance, its ownpriorities predominate. If one side finds itself too often on the losing end of that jockeying, it might reasonably move to dissolve the alliance altogether.But if fusionism is a discrete philosophical worldview—and a pervasive one at that, with a pedigree that runs through the American founding and with roots in the Hebrew Bible—then post-liberalism looks infinitely more radical. Remember: The new conservatives don't just call for a collective recommitment to the pursuit of virtue in the private sphere; they explicitly insist that power be exercised in the government sphere, with a goal of forcibly reorienting society to the common good.Such a shift amounts to a rejection of one of the two pillars of fusionism—which is to say it's a rejection of fusionism itself. How supremely ironic that the people who flatter themselves defenders of tradition have abandoned the hard-won philosophical inheritance of the American political right.All this leaves unanswered a serious question: If a free society requires a moral populace, what is a committed fusionist in an unvirtuous age to do?Traditionalists have plenty of evidence that we're living in such an age. American religiosity is in decline, with significantly fewer people attending weekly services (even before the coronavirus pandemic) than at any time in the last century. Addiction and suicide are through the roof, likely driven by a sense of alienation. Traditional teachings about sexual morality seem laughably antiquated against the backdrop of modernity. The divorce rate is down, but so is the marriage rate, and hundreds of thousands of abortions are performed each year.Some libertarians are less bothered by these concerns. Many prefer to focus on the ways market-driven technological advances have vastly improved our quality of life. Others go further, arguing that widespread acceptance of a greater range of lifestyle choices make this the best time ever to be alive.Virtue is overrated, this cohort might say,or at least misunderstood—and if you're reading this magazine, you may be inclined to agree. If people are using more drugs (see, for instance, the cover ofthis month's issue) while having fewer children, that's fine and dandy so long as it's their choice.These libertarians are not fusionists, though they can and do happily work with their fusionist brethren when it comes to protecting rights and liberties in the government sphere. At the same time, many libertariansareuneasy about secularism and community breakdown. As a churchgoing Roman Catholic, I certainly fall into this category—grieving the scourge of abortion, suffering under a culture that feels overly sexualized and excessively consumerist, and fretting that modern man has grown unwilling to sacrifice on behalf of something bigger than himself. I'm not the most stereotypical libertarian, but even within the liberty movement I'm not alone. And on the wider political right, such fears are omnipresent.Faced with problems like these, the allure of desperate measures is perhaps understandable. One common justification for the post-liberal turn is that culture and institutions, once broken, cannot be expected to repair themselves. External help is needed. The state can provide it, through laws that constrain behavior but also teach the populace to value the correct things: faith and family, community and country.Alas, the lessons of history do not cease to be true just because they're inconvenient. You cannot impose virtue on people by force, and a coercive legal regime is no more likely in practice to instill good values than it is to make the underlying problems worse.For one thing, there's no guarantee that the people actually in power—now or in the future—will agree with you about what the correct values are (or about how much power is required to enforce them). But beyond that, public policiesalwayscome with unintended consequences. Even assuming a legal code that perfectly aligns with the true demands of virtue, we can't know in advance what the effects will be. Perhaps citizens will absorb a better sense of right and wrong. Or perhaps, freed from the need to make weighty decisions for themselves, their moral muscles will atrophy, rendering themlesscapable of pursuing the higher things in life.Before you guess which result is more likely, consider the impact that decades of well-intentioned welfare policy have had on poor communities. As the financial incentives for entrepreneurship and family formation evaporated, recipients of aid learned to see themselves as lacking agency. Neighborly ingenuity, manifested through private charitable efforts and mutual aid societies, was crowded out by top-down government ""solutions"" that solve very little. Despite ever-increasing state and federal spending, the official poverty rate has hardly budged, and small towns and rural counties increasingly join impoverished inner cities as economic disaster areas. All of which suggests that our best efforts have failed to address the causes of the problem and may have exacerbated them.The central insight of fusionism is that the common good is best achieved when the state stays focused on protecting rights and liberties, leaving individuals and voluntary associations to do the rest. To be clear, there is nothing easy about that answer.The post-liberal temptation is to believe that government power can be a substitute for the hard labor of institution building and cultural change. It isn't. The solution must begin at home—on the front porch, around the kitchen table, and in the mirror. The law is not a magic wand. There are no magic wands, and there is no shortcut to the good society.Stephanie Sladeis a senior editor atReason."
Heiress Sentenced in Sex-Cult Case,-0.33,48.67,https://www.newser.com/story/296879/billionaires-daughter-gets-81-months-in-sex-cult-case.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/newser-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,24,"An heiress is heading to prison for her role in an abusive cult that turned women into sex slaves, the New YorkDaily Newsreports. A judge sentenced Clare Bronfman, the daughter of late Seagram's billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr., to 81 months in prison and fined her $500,000 on Wednesday. ""I have made mistakes, I'm sorry for the time and resources I have taken from the court,"" she said. Bronfman is accused of illegally bringing young women into the US for the Nxivm cult and using part of her $210 million fortune to silence the group's enemies with legal action. ""She used her incredible wealth as a means of intimidation, threat and exacting revenge on individuals who challenged its dogmas,"" Brooklyn Federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis said in sentencing her.Nine Nxivm victims spoke directly to Bronfman—who still publicly supports cult leader Keith Raniere—during the emotional hearing, theNew York Timesreports. ""I pray that you will take the claws of Keith Raniere out of you, and you will learn who Clare Bronfman really is,"" said victim Susan Dones as she wept. ""He is killing you."" Other ex-members said they undured ""scorched-earth litigation"" and ""hundreds of headline news stories"" after leaving the group. Bronfman's sentence was based on hertwo guilty pleas: racketeering and conspiracy. Raniere, meanwhile, was found guilty last year of charges including sex-trafficking and racketeering. He could get life behind bars when he's sentenced in October. (Women in Nxivm were apparentlybranded with his initials.)"

A woman told police she was pistol-whipped, beaten, choked and sexually assaulted by Moseley because she refused his demands to work as a prostitute.“Moseley wanted her to go out onto Tropicana Boulevard and work as a prostitute for him to make money so he could pay the hotel, get his items out of pawn and have money to spend,” police wrote in the warrants.The woman said she was punched, beaten with a phone and choked to the point of unconsciousness. She accused Whyte of punching and biting her, then participating in efforts to keep her from leaving. She escaped when her assailants fell asleep. Police were called when a security officer found the partially clothed woman running through the complex and yelling for help.Las Vegas Justice Court records show Moseley is charged with seven felonies, including sex assault, kidnapping, sex trafficking of an adult, conspiracy, battery by strangulation and domestic battery.Whyte is charged with sex trafficking of an adult, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and first-degree kidnapping.Both suspects are scheduled to appear Sept. 10 in Las Vegas Justice Court.Contact Glenn Puit by email atgpuit@reviewjournal.com.Follow@GlennatRJon Twitter."
"Texas Deputy Attorney General Calls Simone Biles a ‘National Embarrassment,’ Offers Weak-Ass Apology",-19.33,21.0,https://www.theroot.com/texas-deputy-attorney-general-calls-simone-biles-a-nat-1847385906,https://adfontesmedia.com/root-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-29,24,"Apologies are like coupons; they come with a list of rules.Saying to someone “I’m sorry your foot was in the street and therefore I rolled over it with my car,” is not an apology. Saying how you really feel and then apologizing because you’ve been called out is not an apology, it’s a get-right. Meaning, you’re trying to get right so you don’t lose your job or endorsements or public standing after spouting your true feelings.See,ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith’s apologyfor his xenophobic comments about Japanese Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani. Smith’s apology had nothing to do with own feelings and everything to do with getting right with his employer.So with that I say, fuck Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz, who fixed his dumbass fingers to tweet that Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in the history of the sport, is a “national embarrassment,” after she withdrew from the team final  and the individual all-around competition earlier this week to focus on her mental health.Biles lives in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston, and it remains unclear whether we’ve seen the last of the most accomplished gymnast in the sport at the Tokyo Games.In a now-deleted tweet, Reitz, who would probably get winded running a city-block, “quote-tweeted video from Kerri Strug’s 1996 Olympic performance on an injured ankle” then said, “Contrast this with our selfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles,”CBS Newsreports.Late Wednesday afternoon, Reitz tweeted to say he owed Biles “an apology. A big one”:It is exhausting dealing with the criticism of Black women who have elected to take care of themselves over everything. Show me one time where America ever gave a shit about Black womenwho still aren’t paid properlyand who arethree to four times more likely to die during pregnancythan their white counterparts. Why would a Black woman ever risk her mental health for a country that hasn’t figured out whythey are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancerand aremore at risk than white men to die from COVID-19?If Black women don’t look out for themselves and their own mental health who is going to? Surely not doctors.Doctors don’t even listen to them, and when they do, they don’t believe that Black women are suffering as badly as they say they are.Simone Biles is the face of a sportthat allowed her and her teammates to be sexually assaulted. Let that sink in.So fuck all of these Facebook warriors, elected officials and armchair quarterbacks who couldn’t carry Biles’ medals on a good day without needing to take a water break. And fuck America, too. You should be ashamed of yourself for wanting to ride the coattails of a Black woman when it’s patriotic, but can’t support her when she’s not performing for you. (See, the Democratic Party.)And fuck Reitz and his bullshit apology."

What should the media do with President Trump’s false election claims?,-9.0,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-president-trumps-false-election-claims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,24,"For the past six months, the country has been on edge as we led up to the 2020 election. But even now, as the election is essentially over, the country cannot totally exhale.We have 72 days between now and inauguration day when Joe Biden is expected to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. Buckle up because this ride will be bumpy.There’s no indication that the transition of power will go smoothly over the next two months. President Donald Trump has taken a defiant tone, showing no signs of conceding while ramping up his insistence that the election has been rigged. We expect to see recounts and lawsuits, which are acceptable in our democracy. We also expect to see plenty of baseless rhetoric and unproven conspiracy theories, which are not acceptable.So what role does the media play in how the next two months will go?In her latest piece,Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wroteof Trump: “He was a deeply abnormal president, but we constantly sought to normalize him, treating his deranged tweets like legitimate news and piously forecasting, every time he sounded the least bit calm, that he was becoming ‘presidential.’”She added, “From the beginning, TV news far too often took his public rallies and speeches as live feeds, letting his misinformation pollute the ecosystem.”There is a danger of that happening again. Based on how he has reacted so far, Trump seems likely to continue floating his false theories, putting the media in an uncomfortable position.Up until now, most news outlets have tried to walk a tightrope — reporting on the president’s protestations about the election, while attempting to point out that Trump’s assertions are not rooted in fact or reality.News broadcasters sound something like this: “The president says the election is rigged. There is no proof that is true.” We’ve heard versions of this on all networks for the past three days.But is that enough? Doesn’t there come a point when repeating the president’s unproven claims, even while debunking those claims, does damage? Doesn’t putting Trump’s bogus allegations into the ether chip away at the trust in our elections even though there is no reason to doubt the honesty of our elections?On one hand, Trump is the president. What he says and what he does right now is news, especially if his refusal to participate in a transition of power impacts the nation. On the other hand, just because Trump insists the election is a fraud doesn’t make it so — and it doesn’t make it news. AsThe Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg told Brian Stelter on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,”“The salience of this administration goes down by the day.”But it is not going to disintegrate completely.News outlets have to think long and hard about what truly is news at this point. It looks as if it will be impossible to completely ignore everything the president says about the election. When the media is forced to cover this part of the story, it must keep repeating that his conspiracies are not true. But the media also doesn’t have to cover Trump’s dangerous speech every time he tweets or talks.Trump has made his allegations known. The media has reported on that. For the media to keep reporting on it every single time Trump repeats it is no longer necessary.If something changes — if Trump concedes, or Trump offers something more than just wild, off-the-cuff lies — then report it. Otherwise, ignore it and cover real news. Goodness knows there’s plenty of it with coronavirus, the economy and so much more.Fox News’ Chris Wallace had a couple of moments over the weekend that need to be pointed out.First, on Saturday, after Biden was projected the winner of the 2020 election, Wallace commented on Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the election.“I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable,” Wallace said on the air. “It’s one thing to be pursuing legal challenges. It’s another to have this very heightened rhetoric that we know is the way the president does business. I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable because I think you’re going to start to see a lot of the Republican leaders who are realizing their fortunes and their futures are no longer so directly tied to Donald Trump are going to begin to pull back.”Wallace also pointed out how “un-normal” Trump’s refusal to accept Biden’s victory is.Then on his “Fox News Sunday” show, Wallace again brought up the idea that Republicans will have to push back on Trump’s election claims.“It would seem to me that Republicans on Capitol Hill have a role to play in this,” Wallace said. “A very few of them have said, look, you pursue your legal options, but, you know, damn down the rhetoric, like Mitt Romney, like Pat Toomey.”Then he said this whopper:  “There are a lot who are just silent. And then there are some — I mentioned Ted Cruz — you know who are like the Japanese soldiers who come out 30 years after the war — out of the jungle — and say, ‘Is the fight still going on?’”Here’s how NBC News’ Lester Holt closed his “Nightly News” broadcast on Saturday, the day Biden was projected to win the election:“The handwriting has been on the wall for days. Today, it was on the screen in bold letters and a check mark and for the first time it could be said out loud: America has decided to go another way. This kind of passion — the deep disappointment of the president’s supporters, the celebratory dances of Joe Biden voters — should be allowed their moment. As a country the campaign whipped us into a frenzy, too often rooted in fear of the other. Today, we let it out. Both sides deserve a collective primal scream over all we’ve been through.“But tomorrow, just maybe we can leave it on the field, wave away the smoke screens and confront what we know to be real and urgent — a pandemic that is literally killing us and sending too many into financial ruin. If we can reengage unity on anything, let it be in the insistence that our leaders, both incoming and outgoing, put us and our well being first.”In case you missed it, I had a special edition of my Poynter Report newsletter on Saturday, applauding how the media handled Election Day turned Election Week. If you missed it, you cancheck it out here.CNN was the big winner on what turned out to be the final day of the election. From 3 a.m. Saturday morning until 3 a.m. Sunday morning, CNN was the most-watched cable news network. It drew 4.2 million viewers, which was more than MSNBC (3.01 million) and Fox News (1.72 million). Interesting to note that Fox News was the most-watched network of all on Tuesday’s Election Day, but then CNN mostly took over from there.CNN’s Brian Stelter compiled exactly when the networks made the calls on Saturday to project that Joe Biden would be the next president.CNN was the first at 11:24:20 a.m. NBC was next at 11:25:15, followed by CBS at 11:25:45, and The Associated Press and ABC at 11:26. Fox News made its call at 11:40 a.m.Looking for an expert source? Find and connect with academics from top universities on theCoursera | Expert Network, a new, free tool for journalists.

House Democrats see political motive in Air Force decision to base C-130s in Georgia,-0.67,38.0,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/11/25/house-democrats-see-political-motive-in-air-force-decision-to-base-c-130s-in-georgia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-26,24,"WASHINGTON — Three top Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are taking the Air Force to task over a decision to base new C-130Js in Georgia, a move they contend could influence the state’s upcoming Senate runoff races.On Nov. 24, the Air Force selected four Air National Guard bases to receive 24 C-130J cargo planes, including Savannah Air National Guard Base in Georgia.But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., raised concerns that the Air Force is “playing politics” by announcing its decision so close to the runoff elections — especially since the service initially planned on selecting only three locations and Congress has not yet funded enough aircraft to be stationed a fourth site.“In this instance, the timing and decision to include Savannah, GA in the announcement, when Georgia is focused on Senate runoff elections, raises questions about the Secretary’s motives,” Smith said in a statement.“The Air Force did not need to make this decision now — plain and simple — and should delay moving forward with these basing actions until conference negotiations have concluded and the decision is not at risk of being politicized,” he said. “If the Air Force plods ahead, the service runs the risk of undermining the strategic basing process and may force Congress to take action to protect the basing process from being used to potentially influence congressional action or election outcomes.”However, the Air Force maintains that its decision was motivated by efficiency, not politics.“Since the Air Force is aware the House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill include additional C-130Js, the Air Force can leverage the exhaustive work already accomplished on the current C-130J basing process for a fourth location, Savannah Air National Guard Base,” said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. “Naming the preferred alternatives now allows us to move forward with the environmental impact process without delay, enabling the timely beddown of these C-130Js.”The Air Force first notified Congress in March that it planned to select three Air National Guard bases to host new C-130J aircraft.The service considered eight installations: Bradley Air Guard Station in Connecticut, Peoria Air Guard Station in Illinois, Louisville Air Guard Base in Kentucky, Great Falls Air Guard Station in Montana, Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas, McLaughlin Air National Guard Base in West Virginia, Cheyenne Air Guard Station in Wyoming, and the Georgia location.But as the Air Force neared its decision this fall, certain lawmakers grew concerned that the service was no longer staying true to its selection criteria, which would have prioritized bases that could host the aircraft without the need for expensive upgrades.Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., who chairs HASC’s seapower and projection forces subcommittee, said he shared those concerns during phone calls with Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown, and Air National Guard director Lt. Gen. Michael Loh.Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) walks with aides on Capitol Hill on February 14, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Bernstein/Getty Images)But the Air Force ended up choosing Louisville ANGB, McLaughlin ANGB, and Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, with eight C-130J aircraft slated to arrive to each base in 2021.If Congress funds an additional C-130 aircraft in the fiscal year 2021 budget, those will go Savannah.“The Air Force without the slightest warning added a fourth site, assigning aircraft not yet approved by Congress to be based in Georgia,” Courtney said in a statement. “This surprise move was never once included in the Air Forces basing plans shared with our committee over the last two years, and it taints this process in the midst of a presidential transition and two special elections in Georgia. That frankly does not pass the smell test.”Likewise, HASC Readiness Subcommittee Chairman John Garamendi, D-Calif., said the basing decision not only “intertwines” with the runoffs but “preempts” ongoing negotiations over the defense appropriations and the annual defense policy bills. He called for the decision to be reversed and postponed.“The questionable timing and irregular process has undermined my confidence that this decision was made objectively and without political influence,” Garamendi said in a statement. “I strongly urge the Air Force to rescind this decision and delay this announcement until January. Doing so will allow the Air Force to make its decision until after conference negotiations have been completed and remove itself from the Georgia runoffs and other politically charged circumstances.”Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican whose fate rests on the results of the runoffs in January, immediately hailed the basing decision and pointed to his own work trying to garner additional resources for the state’s military installations, which include Robins Air Force Base and Fort Benning.“This is extremely exciting news for Savannah’s airmen and the entire coastal community,” said Perdue, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “We’ve made it a top priority to modernize and upgrade military equipment in order to preserve our competitive advantage around the world, and the 165th Airlift Wing is a critical component of that effort.”Perdue was forced into a Jan. 5 runoff with Democrat Jon Ossoff after neither candidate received 50 percent of the vote during the elections earlier this month. If both Perdue and the other Georgia Senator, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, fail to win their races, the Democrats will have the two seats needed to clinch control of the SenateValerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

That is something we should expect and even embrace. Let’s just be sure we are hated for the right reasons. Being hated for the wrong reasons is not something to be embraced, let alone celebrated.Jesus said, “You will be hated by everyone because of Me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved” (Matthew 10:22).But note those words “because of Me.” We will be widely hated because of our association with Him, because of our preaching in His name and because of our adhering to His values. For this, we will be reviled, rejected, persecuted and even killed.Such has been the case throughout Church history, and such is the case worldwide to this moment, as every single day, Christians aremurderedsimply because of their faith. Great is their future reward.Jesus also said, “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated Me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed My teaching, they will obey yours also” (John 15:18-20).To the extent that we live by a different spirit than the fallen, rebellious world lives by, to that extent, we will be cast out. To the extent we emulate the character of Jesus, to that extent the world will treat us the way it treated Him.We will be widely hated because of our association with Him, because of our preaching in His name and because of our adhering to His values. For this, we will be reviled, rejected, persecuted and even killed.That’s why Jesus said, “Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matthew 5:10-12).The prophets were stoned more than applauded, hated more than celebrated, persecuted more than praised. Jesus said it would be the same for us — because of Him and because of righteousness.That is part of our lot in life: to be treated just as He was treated. (To refresh your memory, He was crucified.)When we are rejected because of Him, we consider it an honor. As Acts records, after the apostles were flogged for by the Sanhedrin for preaching in Jesus’ name, they “left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name” (Acts 5:41).What an honor and what a joy. The religious leadership was treating them the same way it treated Yeshua. And so the apostles rejoiced because they were whipped in His name, thereby recognized as part of His family, as leaders in His movement. That’s why they rejoiced.As for the injunction they were given by the Sanhedrin to no longer preach in that name, this was their response: “Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah” (Acts 5:42).With full respect for the governing authorities, they were going to obey God rather than man. They would preach more, not less. We should follow their lead when the government tries to silence us.But there is more that the Scriptures have to say about suffering persecution and opposition.Peter wrote, “If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name” (1 Peter 4:14-16).There is nothing honorable about being hated because of our self-righteousness (rather than for the sake of righteousness). There is nothing positive about us being reviled and even persecuted because of our hypocrisy and sin. There is nothing praiseworthy about being rejected because we are obnoxious or nasty or mean-spirited or violent.To repeat the words of Peter, “If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler” — or, as some translators put it, a “troublemaker” or a “busybody.”Yet some of us think we are suffering persecution for the Gospel whereas we are really experiencing the consequences of having big, opinionated, unfiltered and unrestrained mouths. We think we are being treated like Jesus when, in reality, we are being treated like jerks.So, by all means, let’s stand strong and tall, unashamed of the gospel of Jesus and unashamed of the principles of righteousness, which include standing for the unborn, for the family, for justice, for the poor.But let us not confuse suffering for Christ with suffering for our carnality. The former is our honor. The latter is our shame.Dr. Michael Brown (www.askdrbrown.org) is the host of the nationally syndicatedLine of Fireradio program.

Montgomery County issues new order to block in-person classes at private schools until October,-3.33,51.33,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-elrich-hogan-schools-20200805-2k6mwqglknf7rhqfxecf2id64e-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"Montgomery County officials doubled down on their efforts to keep private and religious schools closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, issuing a new order Wednesday to block in-person classes until October.That county has been in a dispute with Gov. Larry Hogan for the last several days over who has the authority to determine whether private schools can bring students back to campus.Montgomery’s health officer, Dr. Travis Gayles,issued an order last weekpreventing any in-person classes through Oct. 1. The Republican governorresponded Monday with his own orderstripping health officers of their ability — which Hogan had extended earlier in the pandemic — to close or modify county rules for school opening, with the goal of negating Montgomery County’s order.Gayles responded Wednesday eveningwith a fresh order to keep the schools closed, citing a different portion of state law that authorizes health officers to act to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.“The purpose behind what we’re doing is to keep kids safe,” Gayles said earlier Wednesday.Gayles said the transmission rate and number of new cases in the county and the region remain too high to safely open schools for in-person classes.Montgomery County has had nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 755 deaths since the virus emerged in Maryland in March. It’s second only to Prince George’s County in number of cases and ranks first in the state for related deaths.Most public school systems in Maryland, including Montgomery County, have chosen to offer online-only classes to start the school year, decisions that were made by local boards of education. Some private schools, however,are planning to offer in-person instruction.Private and parochial schools argue their parents and students want in-person classes and theschools are better able to meet safety recommendations. Non-public schools typically have fewer students than public schools, and some have large campuses and additional facilities that allow students and staff to maintain their distance from each other.The dispute over limiting in-person classes is another example of how studentswill have different access to education during the pandemicdepending on where they live, their family wealth or which school they attend.Montgomery County, with some of the state’s best public and private schools, has become the epicenter of the growing national debate. A group of Montgomery private school parents is challenging Gayles’ order in federal court. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Aug. 14.County Executive Marc Elrich said Hogan’s action to strip health officers of the authority to proactively shut down schools showed “no logic.”“I was surprised. I don’t think it was appropriate. I don’t think it is supported by data,” said Elrich, a Democrat,  during an online briefing with reporters Wednesday.“It makes no sense to have a policy to, on one hand, say: ‘I’m perfectly fine with the entire public school system of every county that wants to close it to close.’ And then, on the other hand, just saying: ‘I’m OK with private schools opening,'” Elrich said. “There is no logic.”Elrich said children and employees at private schools are just as at risk of contracting and spreading the coronvirus as children and employees at public schools.“I don’t understand the separation of the problem as more serious for one group than another group,” said Elrich, a former public school teacher.Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci responded to Elrich’s comments with a statement: “The governor has made himself clear: private and parochial schools deserve the same opportunity public schools have had to make reopening decisions based on public health guidelines. The county’s blanket closure mandate was overly broad and inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer.”"
An uncomfortable $15 minimum wage column,4.0,38.67,https://www.al.com/opinion/2021/02/an-uncomfortable-15-minimum-wage-column.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,24,"President Joe Biden is pushing to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of another COVID-19 relief package. Republicans have sounded the alarm, and Democrats don’t see why their political counterparts refuse to see the wage hike as an unmitigated good. Like most policy issues, it’s more complicated than the partisan spin makes it sound.The wage hike will not result in $38 burritos at Taco Bell. The restaurant chain confirmed as much to Politifact, “At our company-owned restaurants in New York City, where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, our Bean Burrito is $1.89 plus tax and Crunchwrap Supreme is $4.49 plus tax.” Rest easy. Mandatory wage increases do not necessarily result in massively expensive heartburn delivery mechanisms.The minimum wage does have a practical impact on hiring decisions. It is the lowest entry point to engage labor. If an employer needs someone to sweep and mop the floors, it might be worth hiring someone at $7.25 an hour for the task. At $15 dollars an hour, the manager might allocate the task across several existing employees and not hire anyone. Their workload goes up, but it’s not clear that pay would follow, especially if those workers are already above the minimum wage threshold. That may not be a problem for a large retailer like Amazon that already pays higher wages, but it definitely forces tough choices for smaller employers.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) hasstudiedvarious minimum wage proposals, and both Democrats and Republicans like to cherry pick the information that fits their respective narratives. Yes, the CBO does find that “1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless” under a $15 minimum wage. It also concludes “the $15 option would increase the wages of 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour.” The report determines that overall family income would slightly decrease.It’s almost as if economic realities don’t respond conveniently to political narratives.Hiking the minimum wage does mean higher pay for millions of workers, but it also means that up to 3.7 million (the CBO’s high-end estimate) might lose their jobs. That’s the real tradeoff we’re talking about. Supporters of a higher minimum wage should stop acting like it’s an unmitigated good, and opponents ought to be honest that it would absolutely increase incomes for some lower-income workers.But what about the machines?We’ve all seen the memes of various automated ordering kiosks being the “new” $15 minimum wage employee. Saavy businesses will always look for more efficient operational choices, but that doesn’t always hurt workers. A 2017 McKinsey & Company study found, “employment and productivity both grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and 100 percent of rolling 10-year periods since 1960.” In other words, technological advances across American history haven’t meant fewer jobs. Amazon’s Alexa is nice, but she can’t fill the shoes of the average Chick-fil-A employee with a smile on her face.While the minimum wage is billed as an effort to address poverty, income inequality is the real problem. According to CBO, average household income after federal taxes and means-tested federal program transfers was $35,900 for the lowest 20% and $229,700 for the highest. That’s a big difference, and it expands rapidly towards the opposing ends of the income spectrum.It might seem strange for a conservative to discuss income inequality, but it’s essential to protect a free marketplace. Absolute wage equality would remove powerful incentives to work hard and take economic risks, but being mindful about corporate income distribution is smart politics. Members of Congress who champion free markets should encourage. When companies take care of their workers in terms of benefits and do what they can to increase take home pay, workers thrive, their families are better off, and the average worker has an incentive to defend an employer against government encroachment.Progressives tend to take a more skeptical view that corporations will almost always prioritize shareholders over employees. When businesses don’t focus sufficiently on workers, their lives are more difficult. When laborers see the handful of folks at the top of the organization chart with fat pockets, politicians have a far easier time promoting themselves as champions of the little guy with a government cudgel.Thinking of the minimum wage in that context puts some options on the table. If the pain point is mostly for small businesses, why not offset the minimum wage increase with a corresponding tax reduction for the entities most economically harmed by it? If the logic is that the increase makes lower-income Americans less reliant on government social services, it’s a tradeoff that might make sense. Better yet, simplify and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and let most average families keep more of the money they already earn.The uncomfortable reality is that increasing the minimum wage to $15 isn’t as impactful at creating entry-level jobs, moving people out of poverty, or helping families thrive as we’d like it to be. If we want to make real progress on those issues, we must expect more from our elected employees in Congress who make a lot more than the bare minimum.Cameron Smith is CEO of the Triptych Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

"Navajo and Hopi voters turn out in force on Election Day, hoping for a clear voice",0.0,51.33,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2020/11/05/native-american-voters-turn-out-large-numbers-election-day/6169022002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,24,"As voting got underway Tuesday on the Hopi Nation, Karen Shupla, the tribal registrar, set out to visit three Navajo County polling stations serving Hopi voters. The Hopi Nation reaches into both Navajo and Apache counties in northern Arizona.What she found was part of a larger story on Election Day: Even with concerns about coronavirus, Native voters on the Hopi and Navajo nations showed up in large numbers at in-person polling locations.“Turnout has been great,” Shupla said.“We’ve even had people come in trying to register to vote,” she said, but Arizona does not allow same-day voter registration.Her first stop was a polling site inside the Kykotsmovi Village Community Center, near the Hopi tribal office. Shupla said the location offered curbside voting, along with a ballot drop-off box for the first time.In Sipaulovi Village, Shupla stood outside the Sipaulovi Youth & Elderly Building and worked with local Native Vote volunteers as they handed out teal-colored shirts to Hopi voters leaving the polls.Native Vote is a nonpartisan initiative developed by the National Congress of American Indians that focuses on voter registration, election protection, education and data collection.Because of the pandemic, all the Hopi Villages are closed to nontribal citizens and many of them have security posts set up in front monitoring traffic. One is set up in front of the Sipaulovi Village, and the staff was directing voters toward the polling site only. No one was allowed into the village unless they were a resident.“They’re busy,” Shupla said. There had been a steady stream of voters since the site opened and she was impressed with how smoothly the location was running.The final Navajo County polling station was at the Hopi LDS Church in Polacca. Shupla said she didn’t encounter any voting issues at any of the three sites, but she saw a lot of first-time voters.“I’ve never seen lines and we’re seeing lines,” she said. “I think people are seeing the importance of this election.”In Arizona, nearly 6% of the voting-age population is Native American, making it one of the highest percentages among Indigenous communities in the U.S., according to the National Congress of American Indians.The Navajo and Hopi nations stretch across parts of Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties. Of Navajo County's 108,000 residents, 43% are Native American. Of Apache County’s population of about 71,000, Native Americans make up 73%.ASU law student MacArthur Stant, a volunteer with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project, was also out visiting polling places on the Hopi Nation. He stopped in Polacca and SipauloviThe project is part of the ASU Indian Law Clinic and provides resources to tribes and tribal citizens in Arizona, “to ensure access to the polls and to prevent voter disenfranchisement,” the project's website says.At the polling stations, Stant said he saw a steady flow of voters throughout the day.“It’s been very exciting. A lot of first-time voters and it feels as if those first-time voters are going to stay voters,” Stant said. He noticed a lot of the first-time voters are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.“These are people who haven’t voted in their life and they’re starting to see the value and importance of it,” he added. “I think as a whole this starting to be very important.”For state elections, there were 14 Native candidates on ballots across Arizona and 11 of them won their election.Apache County voter Andrew Simpson said he felt both the Democratic and Republican parties haven’t spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,” he said.“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Simpson said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”Simpson voted early by mail, but still showed up to the polls on Tuesday at the Steamboat Chapter House. As a former council delegate on the Navajo Nation, Simpson said he wanted to see the turnout.In Chinle, voters were able to use one of the few early in-person voting sites in Apache County. The polling station was inside a blue warehouse and had two entrances, one for voters in the Chinle precinct and the other for the Canyon De Chelly precinct.Election official Karsteen Draper, 43, from nearby Del Muerto, greeted voters who walked toward the building, directing them to the correct precinct or to a poll worker who could help ensure they were in the right line.He said he's volunteered for elections before and has always enjoyed working with people. He likes answering their questions and helping them vote.""The line has been flowing smoothly. No long waits,"" Draper said. He planned on being the final voter of the night. As an election official, he had to make sure no one tried to get in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m.Volunteers with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project were set up in front of the polling station, providing voters with hand sanitizer and answers to voting or ballot questions.ASU law students Aspen Miller and Seth Jensen had been set up in front of the polling site since about 6 a.m. Miler said the site wasn't even open when they arrived.They talked to hundreds of voters throughout the day and the biggest confusion they encountered was that the Navajo Nation was having a tribal election, too.The Apache County polling site was set up only for the state and national elections. The tribal election took place at the Chinle Chapter House about two miles away.Jensen said turnout was steady and Miller agreed, saying there was always somebody inside voting.""Nobody's been turned away,"" she added.Married couple Ashley and Marlyn Willie from Chinle both knew they wanted to vote in person rather than by mail.“My vote will count then and there,” Ashley Willie, 27, said. ""Our voices can be heard through voting.""Marlyn Willie echoed his wife's thoughts. He said he's been voting since he turned 18, and now at 29, voting is still important to him because his future, his kids' future and eventually his grandkids' future all depend on who leads.""Not just this election but all the elections,"" he said. ""People have to get up and vote so they can be the change. We choose who gets to be in there.""In the 2016 election, Maryln Willie said he did vote for Donald Trump and he has tried to vote Republican much of the time, but that changed this election. He voted for Joe Biden.He doesn't believe the current division in the United States will change this election. ""Not with the two candidates we have,"" he said, and he doesn't believe either candidate can deliver on their campaign promises.""Not much is being said about our future,"" he added, and he said he changed his candidate this election year because of his kids.He believes that Trump has not handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly, and he said has to think about his children's health and safety. The coronavirus had hit Indigenous communities the hardest and no one knows how long it's going to last.""My children deserve to be safe,"" He said. ""I'm just hoping for a little bit of change.""As the polls closed on Tuesday night, Chinle Chapter House voter Joanie Hunter stood in line along with about 100 other tribal voters waiting to cast their vote in the Navajo Nation Chapter general election.Hunter already voted in the state and national election, casting a ballot early because she thought the polling line would be too long on Election Day.“I thought the chapter (election) should be fine,” she said but was proven wrong by the time she made it to the polls just before 7 p.m. Hunter said she was mentally kicking herself for not voting early.“I didn’t think there would be this many people,” she said.By the time Hunter got in line, it looped around the Chinle Chapter House complex with about 100 voters still waiting. At one point during the day, the line stretched past the parking lot toward the main highway.“I don’t mind waiting,” Hunter said, even as a few of her fellow voters walked away from the line. She said she cares about her chapter election because she feels it’s an election where her voice is really heard.“You get a say in whose running things,"" she added. ""I believe it does make a difference.""Thousands of Navajo voters cast a ballot for chapter leaders on Tuesday. Native voters often turn out in higher rates for tribal elections than nontribal elections, according to the National Congress of American Indians.In chapter elections, Navajo voters elect leaders for their local community governments at 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation.The Navajo Nation is about the size of West Virginia and spans three states, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It is split into five agencies: Western, Chinle, Fort Defiance, Shiprock and Eastern. Within those agencies are chapter houses and they serve as local governments for surrounding communities. It’s operated along the same lines as a city council.On Tuesday, Navajo voters elected chapter presidents, vice presidents, secretary-treasurers, commissioners, election supervisors, farming board members and grazing committee members.Local chapter elections are usually full of candidates campaigning until the polls close and free food is always nearby. Many of the candidates tend to share their platforms with Navajo voters while serving coffee, stew and frybread.But because of the coronavirus, the scene was different this year. There were no food stands set up in the chapter house parking lots or candidates hosting rallies for voters.The Navajo Election Administration and the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors implemented public health safety guidelines for voting at polling places and discouraged candidates from setting up food stands. Tribal voters were also encouraged to vote early or by absentee ballot to avoid large crowds and wait times on Election Day.At the Steamboat Chapter House as voters left their vehicles and walked toward the door, they were often greeted by an election official asking if they were voting in the chapter election or for Apache County. The Steamboat Chapter House served as a polling station for the state and national election on Tuesday.Chapter voters were directed toward the entrance of the chapter house on the right side of the building, while Apache County voters were directed toward an entrance on the left side of the building.Navajo voters waiting in line maintained social distancing, wore masks and often used the handwashing stations set up near chapter house entrance. Election officials also checked temperatures before voters entered the building.Andrew Simpson and his wife, Bessie Yellowhair Simpson, from Steamboat, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for relatives to arrive from Phoenix to vote. They both voted early, but as community leaders, they enjoyed sticking around on Election Day.But rather than their usual hugs and handshakes, they both wore masks, waving to people from inside their truck or bumping elbows with the few who walked up to the truck window. Yellowhair Simpson occasionally walked the grounds to greet people or talk.She is currently the commission secretary-treasurer for the Steamboat Chapter and was up for reelection this election. She did not retain her seat,according to unofficial results.The husband and wife also believed that Election Day is a great way to build relationships among the Navajo people, but because of the pandemic, they’ve lost that.It has prevented them from leaving their house, Simpson said, and at 74 he’s been told he is at high risk for contracting the coronavirus. The only time they leave home is to restock on essential items, so being at the polls on Tuesday gave them a chance to see and interact with people at a safe distance.“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” Simpson said, and he’s recognized most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”The unofficial results for the Navajo Nation Chapter General Election can be found on the Navajo Election Administrations website atnavajoelections.navajo-nsn.gov.Reporter Shondiin Silversmith covers Indigenous people and communities in Arizona.

Trump Creates Chaos By Using The Military To Respond To Racial And Economic Injustice,-24.33,28.67,https://therealnews.com/stories/trump-creates-chaos-military-respond-racial-economic-injustice,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-09,23,"Nation contributor Sasha Abramsky thinks the wheels might be coming off, and discusses his articles “Where Does America Go From Here” and “Trump is Framing US Residents as Enemies to be Met by Force.”This is a rush transcript and may contain errors. It will be updated.Mark Steiner: Welcome to the Real News. This is Mark Steiner. Good to have you all with us once again. You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about this. Trump authoritarian and racist predilections were always there from his loud mouth real estate days to his insulting reality shows on TV, and they began to manifest themselves as soon as he became president. The perfect storm has arrived of a COVID pandemic, economic collapse, and the depth of racism rearing its evil and ugly head and it converged all together to heighten the Trumpian threat against our democracy and laid bare the authoritarian underpinnings of not just Trump, but the political forces around him.There’s one man who’s been running a great deal about this for The Nation, for Truthout and other places is Sasha Abramsky and he joins us right now. He’s an author of eight books, the most was the one called Jumping at Shadows: The Triumph of Fear and the End of the American Dream and the article he wrote in The Nation that got our attention was Where Does America Go from Here? and is about to have another article out in Truthout on militarization and the police. And welcome, good to have you with us once again, Sasha.Sasha Abramsky: Always good to be on the show, Mark. Thanks.Mark Steiner: Let me start from this one quote, which says a lot to me about where this administration is going and how they’re responding to the rebellions and resistance and demonstrations taking across the country. When he quoted Chief Walter Headley, this arch-segregationist police chief from Florida in 1967, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” and that whole sentiment. I mean, when he speaks, when he says things, people think that because he’s a buffoon, it’s an accident. To me, this is no accident. This is who he is. This is what he’s pushing as a way of running this country.Sasha Abramsky: No, absolutely. And one of the things that I’ve been doing is I’ve followed Trump’s political career over the last five years from when he was a candidate through when he first won the presidency through the last three and a half years is look at Trump’s language. And what you see is, time after time after time his borrowing a phraseology from authoritarian leaders. From Mussolini, from Adolf Hitler, the quote this week about when the looting starts, the shooting stars and then he sort of backpedals and says, “Oh, I didn’t know the historical references. I didn’t know who I was copying,” but coincidentally, everybody he accidentally copies is an authoritarian from the far right of the political spectrum. He never accidentally stumbles into quoting Martin Luther King or accidentally stumbles into quoting the Dalai Lama or accidentally stumbles into quoting Mother Teresa. The people he accidentally quotes are people who spew violence, racial division and hatred.And so the thing that has just, I mean, it stunned me on one level, but on another level it’s been entirely unsurprising, has been that as this country faces this triple implosion, the implosion around the pandemic, the implosion around the loss of jobs that then accompanied the shelter in place measures and now the implosion around civic stability, as these three things have overlapped, trump has made zero effort to unify. He’s made zero effort to reach out, to try to calm the waters. He’s made zero efforts to hold summits at the White House with people to bring them into the political discussion, make people feel empowered, make people feel listened to. Instead, as the German foreign minister put it the other day, he has thrown oil onto the fire. But the thing is, if you throw oil onto a fire that’s already waging with this intensity, you lose all ability to control that fire.And so what Trump is doing is, he’s trying to create such unrestrained chaos, such a fear of civic unrest and civic violence that he can militarize his administration. And you said at the beginning, militarize the police. It’s actually way beyond that. The police have been militarized for many, many, many years. That precedes Trump. That goes back to the use of surplus military equipment after 9/11 and the Iraq War, it goes back to the war on crime in the 1990s and 1980s. It goes back to Richard Nixon’s war on drugs. We have a half century of militarization of the police, pretty much from the Vietnam War period onwards. What we’re seeing now, and this is unprecedented, is the President of the United States backed up by his Attorney General and at least, in part, backed up by his Secretary of Defense, has tried to introduce US military personnel and US military equipment, helicopters, even apparently Trump asked if he could use tanks, onto the streets first of Washington, DC, which is where they have direct operational control of the National Guard, because there is no state system in place in DC.But what Trump has asked for essentially, is the right to militarize a response from coast to coast. What he wants to do, and he said it very clearly, is use the military in a show of domination to reign in protesters. And he’s describing it as well, “I only want to rein in the moochers. I don’t want to rein in the good guys, the peaceful protesters.” If you look at what he did in DC the other day in pursuit of a photo op outside a church, they personally, Trump and William Barr, personally ordered heavily-armed US military personnel to violently clear a crowd of nonviolent protesters whose only sin was, they were standing in Trump’s path as he hoped to walk toward a photo opportunity outside a church.And this is why, if you look at what’s happened over the last three days, this array of top military figures from General Mattis to ex-General Allen, too ex-head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, they have all published public letters saying that Trump is now a threat to the constitutional order.And I don’t know if you and your audience have had time to read Jim Mattis’ piece in particular, but I doubt you will ever have encountered, in American history, an ex-cabinet minister talk about and write about the president he served in such language. Because what he did was, he compared the Nazi tactics of divide and conquer in the 1930s and ’40s to Trump’s tactics of divide and conquer today. [inaudible 00:06:14] was a threat to the constitutional order. He said we’ve had three years without mature leadership, and this is what we get to. And he basically said that Trump’s orders to the military are illegal and for those who uphold the oath of the constitution, they cannot be obeyed. That is a simply extraordinary public letter from the ex-Secretary of Defense to issue to the American people. It is a warning that lest we stop this madness now, we will slide into dictatorship.Mark Steiner: So let me pick up on that point here. It’s interesting to me. I mean, I was thinking about this tweet that Tim Shorrock from The Nation, the Washington correspondent put out. He said, “The numbers of US military security forces in DC right now, it’s just ridiculous. This is pure intimidation. Trump is,” he capitalized, “Very afraid. The longer we stay in the streets, the more frightened he gets.” So picking up on that point and what you just said. There’s one aspect here that’s really interesting to me and I’m very curious as to your analysis. So Jim Mattis and the others who are former generals in the United States Armed Forces, military leaders, are not exactly, they’re not neo-liberals, they’re not on the left. They’re not liberals. They’re not part of the spectrum beyond the left side of the political spectrum. What does it mean to you, with this seeming contradiction here? When you have these forces around Trump that I’ve referred to as these kind of white racist mobs, like the ones who took over the capitols in a couple of states armed and the neo-conservative lead who’s getting their way through Trump to change the entire nation, environmental laws, laws around voting rights and more. And then you have the generals who clearly are conservative, and many of them on the right, saying enough is enough. So there’s a lot of contradictions to go around here. I mean, how do you put that together?Sasha Abramsky: The contradictions have reached their breaking point. So you had a sort of uneasy alliance of convenience holding Trump’s presidency together. So you had the white nationalists who have some institutional power, I guess, within some of the uniformed forces in particular, but by and large they’re on the outside. They’re the militias, they’re the people who take to their weapons and intimidate Gretchen Whitmer, et cetera, et cetera. Then you have the economic neo-liberals who want nothing more than deregulation and tax cuts. And that’s probably more where Mitch McConnell stands. And then you have the people who care sort of all about the courts. It’s about abortion. It’s about getting conservative justices in. Trump’s been able to hold that circus ring together in some ways.And what’s happening now is the tensions are so overwhelming. The sheer level of economic misery that’s been sort of suddenly thrust on the country is so vast and has no end point in sight. But when you have 43 million people unemployed, you’re essentially looking at a situation where one in three in the American public, and now, if you think there are 43 million unemployed, that’s probably a hundred million people all total [inaudible 00:09:09], you’re looking at a level of economic destitution worse even that the height of the great depression. So you have all the makings of a sort of societal crisis.You then add in the conflagration that’s emerge over race relations and over this just stunningly brutal video of police essentially lynching a black man in Minneapolis, and you throw all that into the mix. And even with the most skilled rhetoric coming from the White House, you’d have an almost uncontrollable crisis. When you add into that, that Trump has no desire to control the crisis, but every desire to make it worse so that he can then impose a sort of authoritarian answer and try and sort of recreate Nixon’s silent majority, that’s when people start getting really scared.And so someone like Mattis, you’re absolutely right. He isn’t some sort of political radical, liberal, subversive blah, blah, blah. He’s as much a part of the establishment as any other human being in this country. And he’s right at the top of that power nexus. But the fact that so many ex-generals yesterday felt compelled to say this, the fact that the active head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Milley, felt compelled to send a memo to every head of the different branches of the armed forces yesterday saying, “Remember, you have all sworn an oath called the constitution and the laws of this country, and people have a right to rightful protest and peaceful protest.” The fact that the current head of the armed forces was compelled to say that tells you where we are and what they fear is about to be unleashed by the president.The fact that all four surviving ex-presidents, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama at pretty much the same time, all felt compelled to come out and warn of the dangers of conflagration and warn of the necessity to listen to the voices of the disempowered. The fact that that is all happening at once, tells you everything you need to know about how much people who really are on the inside, not outside, just like me and you, but people on the inside with an understanding of what is meant by the unleashing of presidential emergency powers, the fact that they are all now compelled to go public in the way they are, tells you how dangerous this moment has become.Mark Steiner: So let’s pick up on that point. I mean, in the piece you just wrote for The Nation, I love this line, you write, “The country claims to be the great exception has revealed itself to be something of a Greek tragedy instead.” And so when you look at this other thing when you, and then you talked about these kind of white racists marching down your street, saying “go after the jungle bunnies,” as they put it. And you wrote about how the breakdown of order and the collapse into warring gangs and tribes and the militarized police response. So picking up on that point and pushing it further, but it… You have to ask the question from the things you’ve been writing and what you just said, does your analysis say that Trump isolated and therefore not a danger? Or is he not isolated with all these kind of armed groups around the country who support him, plus parts of the armed forces, other places, and police who also support him? I mean, it’s just so…Sasha Abramsky: The answer is Trump is in some ways, extraordinarily politically weak. He’s been impeached. He’s sagging in the opinion polls. He’s lost his core support bases. He’s now trailing among older voters. By most traditional measures, Trump is hobbled beyond repair. The thing about Trump is, the weaker he gets the more dangerous he gets and this has been true throughout his presidency, but it’s been this sort of operating principle throughout his entire life, that he is a street fighter of the worst sort. He plays dirty, not for any greater good, but he plays dirty simply for personal self advancement. It’s gangster politics. It’s mafia politics.Now, the thing about our moment that makes that even more dangerous is the fact that all these different groups are ready for a fight. So when I was writing about the white vigilantes on my street, my area is in midtown Sacramento and there were these huge peaceful protests over the weekend, but then late at night, as the police broke up the peaceful protests, smaller groups that probably were sort of more concerned with looting stores than any political analysis, smaller groups peeled off into the midtown area, breaking into and destroying shops and restaurants and pharmacies and so on. And it was really quite hair-raising. I mean, I, in no way, shape or form want to romanticize what was happening. It was really destructive. But by about midnight or 1:00 in the morning, there was sirens everywhere. There were helicopters overhead. You could hear from my front door, you could hear the stun grenades going off. You could hear the volleys of rubber bullets being fired.And then by about 1:00 in the morning, I was seeing two things. I was seeing groups on bicycles that looked to me like they were probably sort of riding through the residential neighborhoods, looking for looting opportunities. But I also saw these young white men patrolling. And when I went out and asked one of them stuff, he started talking, as you said, about jungle bunnies or old ghetto bunnies. He was using really inflammatory language. And it made me really realize something. I knew it already, but it brought it right onto my front doorstep. The sort of realization that you have these sort of colossal clashes, not necessarily of ideological vision, though that’s part of it. But colossal clashes of warring tribes almost at this point, of gangs, of people out looking for trouble.It sort of reminded me in a way of the football hooligans that you’d see in England when I was growing up in the 1980s and ’90s where you’d these very organized groups. There was nothing spontaneous about the football riots. They were organized, they were tribalistic, they were based around region. They were based around football affiliation. Sometimes they were based around what pub you drank in, and they’d sort of clash together. It was almost social entertainment. They’d both come at each other and there’d be bottles thrown and knives thrown. And it was a Saturday evening on the town.The problem with extending that analogy to 2020 America is you’re talking about 300 million people in this country and more than 300 million guns in this country. You’re talking about the most heavily armed civil society on earth. And people are increasingly taking those guns with them to political protests and to rallies and to their public expression. If you bring in guns and other armor into an already tense situation, there’s the potential for a calamity. And when you then have the president basically egging on the rioters or egging on the fighters or egging on whatever you want to call these different groups, you have the president essentially using his bully pulpit, not to calm things down, but to make things worse.And the only way you can understand that is, he has to think at this point, it’s just his political advantage to cause as much chaos as possible and scare as many suburbanites as possible back into his camp, despite the economic collapse, despite the completely inept response to the pandemic. It’s his only survival mechanism. And if he has to invoke martial law to do it, if he has to invoke emergency powers to do it, if he has to bring US military tanks onto the streets, he has shown every indication he will do that. And again, coming back to what I was saying, that is why this moment is not just a moment that we can sort of say, “Oh, well, it’s like this previous moment, or this previous moment.” It’s pretty much unprecedented. The overlap of all of these simultaneous crises at the same time as Trump is doing all that he can to stir up trouble, makes it an unprecedented moment.And I think it is a moment when every American of good conscience has to be out on the streets to protect democracy. And I know we’re in a pandemic, we have to do it with masks on. We have to do it with as much social spacing as we can, but of all the things on earth, it is worth risking getting sick for, preserving American democracy and preserving American community has to be at the top of that list.Mark Steiner: I have a great deal more I could ask and continue this conversation with Sasha, but I want to conclude it on that last comment you made, because I think it was a very powerful and very important for us to understand. As we look calling out the military, the militarization of the police, the armed nature of our society, we are facing a really dangerous moment. And I think you articulated it better than I’ve heard before. So thank you once again for joining us, it’s always a pleasure talking to you, Sasha. Good luck to you. Good luck to all of us.Sasha Abramsky: Thank you, and stay safe and stay healthy.Mark Steiner: You, too. We’ve been talking to Sasha Abramsky, writes for The Nation, Truthout, is a noted author as well, and has joined us before and hopefully will join us again. And I’m Mark Steiner here at the Real News Network. Thank you all for joining us. Please stay safe and masked as much as you can, and we’ll be covering this with some depth to save what we have in this country and to move it forward. So thank you so much for joining us.

John Pilger: The Most Lethal Virus is Not Covid-19. It is War.,-32.67,11.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/14/john-pilger-the-most-lethal-virus-is-not-covid-19-it-is-war/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-12-14,23,"The names of more than 16,000 British servicemen and women are listed. The literature says they “died in operational theatre or were targeted by terrorists”.On the day I was there, a stonemason was adding new names to those who have died in some 50 operations across the world during what is known as “peacetime”. Malaya, Ireland, Kenya, Hong Kong, Libya, Iraq, Palestine and many more, including secret operations, such as Indochina.Not a year has passed since peace was declared in 1945 that Britain has not sent military forces to fight the wars of empire.Not a year has passed when countries, mostly poor and riven by conflict, have not bought or have been “soft loaned” British arms to further the wars, or “interests”, of empire.Empire? What empire? The investigative journalist Phil Miller recently revealed inDeclassifiedthat Boris Johnson’s Britain maintained 145 military sites – call them bases — in 42 countries. Johnson has boasted that Britain is to be “the foremost naval power in Europe”.In the midst of the greatest health emergency in modern times, with more than 4 million surgical procedures delayed by the National Health Service, Johnson has announced a record increase of £16.5 billion in so-called defence spending – a figure that would restore the under-resourced NHS many times over.But these billions are not for defence. Britain has no enemies other than those within who betray the trust of its ordinary people, its nurses and doctors, its carers, elderly, homeless and youth, as successive neo-liberal governments have done, Conservative and Labour.Exploring the serenity of the National War Memorial, I soon realised there was not a single monument, or plinth, or plaque, or rosebush honouring the memory of Britain’s victims — the civilians in the “peacetime” operations commemorated here.There is no remembrance of the Libyans killed when their country was wilfully destroyed by Prime Minister David Cameron and his collaborators in Paris and Washington.There is no word of regret for the Serbian women and children killed by British bombs, dropped from a safe height on schools, factories, bridges, towns, on the orders of Tony Blair; or for the impoverished Yemeni children extinguished by Saudi pilots with their logistics and targets supplied by Britons in the air-conditioned safety of Riyadh; or for the Syrians starved by “sanctions”.There is no monument to the Palestinian children murdered with the British elite’s enduring connivance, such as the recent campaign that destroyed a modest reform movement within the Labour Party with specious accusations of anti-Semitism.Two weeks ago, Israel’s military chief of staff and Britain’s Chief of the Defence Staff signed an agreement to “formalise and enhance” military co-operation. This was not news. More British arms and logistical support will now flow to the lawless regime in Tel Aviv, whose snipers target children and psychopaths interrogate children in extreme isolation. (See the recent shocking report by Defense for Children,Isolated and Alone).Perhaps the most striking omission at the Staffordshire war memorial is an acknowledgement of the million Iraqis whose lives and country were destroyed by the illegal invasion of Blair and Bush in 2003.ORB, a member of the British Polling Council, put the figure at 1.2 million. In 2013, the ComRes organisation asked a cross-section of the British public how many Iraqis had died in the invasion. A majority said fewer than 10,000.How is such a lethal silence sustained in a sophisticated society? My answer is that propaganda is far more effective in societies that regard themselves as free than in dictatorships and autocracies. I include censorship by omission.Our propaganda industries – both political and cultural, including most of the media – are the most powerful, ubiquitous and refined on earth. Big lies can be repeated incessantly in comforting, credible BBC voices. Omissions are no problem.A similar question relates to nuclear war, whose threat is “of no interest”, to quote Harold Pinter. Russia, a nuclear power, is encircled by the war-making group known as Nato, with British troops regularly “maneuvering” right up to the border where Hitler invaded.The defamation of all things Russian, not least the historical truth that the Red Army largely won the Second World War, is percolated into public consciousness. The Russians are of “no interest”, except as demons.China, also a nuclear power, is the brunt of unrelenting provocation, with American strategic bombers and drones constantly probing its territorial space and – hooray – HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s £3billion aircraft carrier, soon to sail 6,500 miles to enforce “freedom of navigation” within sight of the Chinese mainland.Some 400 American bases encircle China, “rather like a noose”, a former Pentagon planner said to me. They extend all the way from Australia, though the Pacific to southern and northern Asia and across Eurasia.In South Korea, a missile system known as Terminal High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, is aimed point-blank at China across the narrow East China Sea. Imagine Chinese missiles in Mexico or Canada or off the coast of California.A few years after the invasion of Iraq, I made a film calledThe War You Don’t See, in which I asked leading American and British journalists as well as TV news executives – people I knew as colleagues — why and how Bush and Blair were allowed to get away with the great crime in Iraq, considering that the lies were not very clever.Their response surprised me. Had “we”, they said – that is journalists and broadcasters, especially in the US — challenged the claims of the White House and Downing Street, investigated and exposed the lies, instead of amplifying and echoing them, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 probably would not have happened. Countless people would be alive today. Four million refugees would not have fled. The grisly ISIS, a product of the Blair/Bush invasion, might not have been conceived.David Rose, then with the LondonObserver, which supported the invasion, described “the pack of lies fed to me by a fairly sophisticated disinformation campaign”. Rageh Omah, then the BBC’s man in Iraq, told me, “We failed to press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough”. Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, agreed, as did many others.I admired these journalists who broke the silence. But they are honourable exceptions. Today, the war drums have new and highly enthusiastic beaters in Britain, America and the “West”.Take your pick among the legion of Russia and China bashers and promoters of fiction such as Russiagate. My personal Oscar goes to Peter Hartcher ofTheSydney Morning Herald,whose unrelenting rousing drivel about the “existential threat” (of China/Russia, mostly China) was illustrated by a smiling Scott Morrison, the PR man who is Australia’s prime minister, dressed like Churchill, V for Victory sign and all. “Not since the 1930s ….” the pair of them intoned.Ad nauseum.Covid has provided cover for this pandemic of propaganda. In July, Morrison took his cue from Trump and announced that Australia, which has no enemies, would spend A$270 billion on provoking one, including missiles that could reach China.That China’s purchase of Australia’s minerals and agriculture effectively underwrote the Australian economy was “of no interest” to the government in Canberra.The Australian media cheered almost as one, delivering a shower of abuse at China. Thousands of Chinese students, who had guaranteed the gross salaries of Australian vice-chancellors, were advised by their government to go elsewhere. Chinese-Australians were bad-mouthed and deliverymen were assaulted. Colonial racism is never hard to revive.Some years ago, Iinterviewedthe former head of the CIA in Latin America, Duane Clarridge. In a few refreshingly honest words, he summed up “Western” foreign policy as it is ordained and directed by Washington.The super-power, he said, could do what it wanted where it wanted whenever its “strategic interests” dictated. His words were: “Get used to it, world.”I have reported a number of wars. I have seen the remains of children and women and the elderly bombed and burned to death: their villages laid to waste, their petrified trees festooned with human parts. And much else.Perhaps that is why I reserve a specific contempt for those who promote the crime of rapacious war, who beckon it with bad faith and profanities, having never experienced it themselves. Their monopoly must be broken.This is a version of an address John Pilger gave to a Stop the War fund-raiser, Artists Speak Out, in London.If only more ordinary people had more access to John Pilger’s journalism the whole world would be a much better place. And his unconvicted fellow countryman Julian Assange would not be serving a thinly disguised death sentence as a political prisoner in a high security English prison. Wake up everybody. Your future, your childrens’ future and your grandchildrens’ future is at stake here. This is not a game.I absolutely agreeThank you, Mr. Chuckman, for a very interesting comment.A candid ,accurate summation of the lies and false reporting  by the majority of the media. Thank you Mr. Pilger…..Thank you, Mr. Pilger. You are the journalist I admire the most, and in this article you do not disappoint!Excellent!Thank you John Pilger for valuing the truth and stating it.The war drums exactly.The orchestra supported and encouraged by the media.We are all in the audience  and accountableJohn speaks the truth unreservedly, and well that he does.His interview with Duane Clarridge of the CIA is one to make you stop drop-jawed and stunned at this soldier of empire’s cold and full certainty of his hubris’s righteousness.  It affected me so much I had to bookmark it for future reference and further dispensation.Clarridge, it should be noted, was one of the principals of the Iran Contra scandal who was pardoned by one William Barr, then Attorney General of the US under George HW Bush.hXXps://vimeo.com/114561495Thank you John, for your truth speaking and remarkable endurance in reporting the facts and principled analysis in a world of propaganda and gross hegemonic   self interest. Go well.Thanks again, Mr. Pilger for the best in reporting. It’s a toss up whether these arrogant imperialists will get the nerve to tackle Russia or China in a hot war, but if they do, they will at last have comeuppance. They have murdered millions and millions of people who couldn’t stop them, I almost look forward to the day someone is stronger and as determined. Heaven forfend.Thank you for a beautifully written account of the Truth.Even though I am very anti-war, I can admire a great war monument.There are a number of them in the world, but the one that almost gives me chills is the gigantic “The Motherland Calls” in Volgograd (renamed from Stalingrad).Its gigantic size is justified in that it represents the bloodiest battle ever fought in the most destructive event in all of human history, Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union.The USSR lost roughly a thousand times the entire American losses on all fronts in WWII. Maybe, that’s why America is so cavalier about war – it never really experienced it.The intensity of feeling of “The Motherland Calls” is enough to bring tears.I actually find the British Armed Services Memorial exceedingly sterile. It possesses a kind of oppressive ugliness.There is definitely a surreal quality to the sculpture groups, unpleasantly so. Nothing inspiring about any of it.Well done in terms of technical quality, but with a sickening sense of dreary nightmare figures set in a rigid stone framework that very much reminds me of Italian and German totalitarian architecture.Its creators have unwittingly reveled its emptiness of purpose and soul.Sorry, but that “thousand times” the war deaths should, of course, have been a “hundred times.”I was quietly inebriated when I wrote that, a condition that is I fear becoming common at my stage and state of life.It is an enormous disparity still. All my other statements are accurate.I’ll make this simple.There is no such thing as the United Kingdom.So the borders are going to be changing.  First let Ireland get back it’s island that was invaded without mercy.  A very serious genocide that was that seems to have been forgotten.  Still, if not for it, I wouldn’t be typing this now!Afterwards, it is time for Scotland to get back its sovereignty.Remember what I said above.  The United Kingdom does not exist because how could you be united if it wasn’t your choice in the first place?BKBKMost books would agree that imperialism’s “success” depends much on collusion by its victims. Today western imperialism rides roughshod over much of the world because Russia and China refused to resolutely confront it. Instead both these two continental powers are more interestsd in accomodating and even collaborating with Imperialism. Otherwise they would’ve actively organized the many helpless victims of imperialism, from the Middle East to Africa and Latin America and elsewhere in the world to counter their tormentors. The old Cominterns were correct in that world imperialism could be defeated only world resistance.Oh I thank YOU Mr Pilger – I’ve admired your honesty from when you reported on those Vietnam travesties….The UK (my birthland, unfortunately) cannot, apparently let go of its imperialist-slaughter-mongering past. Nor can the USA….For the sake of the rest of humanity (outside NATO – they deserve all they get and more) let it all go down the drains…soon, very soon…Make your tax-deductible donation by clickinghere.KeepConsortium News going in the tradition of Bob Parry.

Is the QAnon Fantasy Unravelling?,-7.0,40.0,https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/is-the-qanon-fantasy-unravelling/,https://adfontesmedia.com/right-wing-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,23,"The protest, organized on social media by a pair of young women who call themselves the Patriot Sisters, attracted areported75 people, many of whom brandished “Thin Blue Line” American flags and signs emblazoned with the words “TRUMP 2020.” One woman strummed a guitar and sang religious songs, while other protesters prayed and declared that “voter fraud should be stopped in the name of Jesus.”The group also attracted supporters of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, including one man carrying a cellphone on a selfie stick, which he used to record the protest while chanting religious declarations interspersed with statements about child-trafficking and pedophilia—dog whistles used by QAnon adherents.“We will not lose this nation and allow human trafficking to continue,” the man carrying a selfie stick said in avideotitled “Prayer Rally for TRUMP! #Trump2020 #PrayForTrump #TheGreatAwakening.”“We will not lose this nation and allow pedophilia to continue…we declare that no darkness will triumph in these last days. Praise you, Jesus,” he said. (The Great Awakening is a term associated with QAnon, as well as with religious-right activists who believe God is using Trump to bring spiritual revival to the U.S.)The Patriot Sisters run popular Instagram and TikTok accounts, which they have used to promote the anti-mask movement, anti-Black Lives Matter rhetoric, and pro-Trump propaganda and misinformation. They have even made apostusing the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which was hijacked by QAnon followers to push falsehoods about the purported exploitation of children by liberal elites.While they may not necessarily be ardent supporters of QAnon, the Patriot Sisters’ attraction of some of the conspiracy theory’s impassioned followers not only emphasizes the recently formed overlap between evangelical Christians and QAnon, but also highlights the current state of despair festering within the movement – a despair centered around a single question:What now?Election night was supposed to signal a key moment in Q’s long-touted reckoning.The anonymous prophet fueling the QAnon movement spent years flooding the internet with unfounded conspiracies, proclamations about the so-called deep state’s cabalistic control of the United States, and Trump’s role as the anointed savior fighting off the forces of evil. The posts began on the infamous discussion board 4chan in Oct. 2017, where an anonymous poster claimed to have “Q clearance” granting him access to classified information at the Department of Energy, including nuclear secrets. Q quickly amassed a large following through his posts (known as “Q drops”), and the movement grew among right-wing circles.QAnon eventually morphed into a virtual cult where supporters claim that a cabal of elite pedophiles made up of Hollywood actors, Democrats, and other high-ranking officials is behind a global child sex-trafficking ring. The unfounded conspiracy theory also alleges that Trump is planning a day of reckoning known as “The Storm,” during which thousands of these deep state actors will be arrested. Many believed that the supposed reckoning and the eventual defeat of the deep state would begin with Trump’s victory in the 2020 election.Joe Biden’s victory served as a body-blow to the movement’s ardent followers.Q’s final drop before the election was on the morning of Nov. 3, and featured an Abraham Lincoln quote from 1863, in which the former president declared “that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.” The drop also bore the image of an American flag and a YouTube link to the theme song of the 1992 film “The Last of the Mohicans.”  TheYouTube linkwas viewed more than 35 million times and features more than 28,000 comments, mainly from loyal followers of the QAnon movement.“This is the Q message board today,” read one comment. “A genius way to get past the sensors. Seeing all the recent comments makes me proud win or lose. WWG1WGA.” (The code denotes QAnon’s best-known slogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”)While Q’s followers gathered in earnest to witness a reckoning that never came, Q himself was mysteriously silent. Even the operators of the websiteQ Alerts, which keeps track of the Q drops, attempted to reassure followers regarding their prophet’s suspicious absence. “Q has been dark for 9 days. At times Q strategically goes dark for days, weeks or in some cases months. Be sure you have some type of Q Alerts in place so you are notified when Q drops again. If your browser shows a red bell icon at the bottom/right, that is a great place to start.”Q’s disappearance (which lasted for nine days until the anonymous figureresurfaced again on Nov. 12) coupled with Trump’s defeat in the presidential elections, led to a range of responses from his followers. Some stood their ground and doubled down on the conspiracies, while others began to question whether they themselves had been fooled. Followers (known as Anons) flooded forums, Telegram chats, and Q-friendly spaces to discuss the events, share their despair, and seek comfort from others.“We Have (sic) been told time & again Trump wins in the end!! Don’t give up so easily, if you believe don’t give up,” one poster told a QAnon group of several hundred members on Telegram. Another responded that “giving up is NOT an option for me!!”This is not the first time that QAnon believers have faced disappointment. One of the initial claims of the conspiracy theory was that Hillary Clinton would be arrested and imprisoned in 2017. When that did not happen, QAnon followers recalibrated and decided that Clinton had been placed under house arrest and was wearing an ankle bracelet. Even her appearances in public only emboldened them to raise the stakes and claim that the deep state had replaced her with a clone.Then in 2018, Q claimed that Republicans would dominate the midterm elections and reclaim the U.S. House of Representatives. This, of course, did not come to pass, and while this likely impacted some of Q’s followers, the movement only continued to grow over the next couple of years.Q’s nine days of silence during a critical time in the supposed reckoning left a power vacuum within the cesspool of conspiracies on 8kun, the message board formerly known as 8chan that has been linked to white supremacy, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, various other hate crimes, and multiple mass shootings. Following three mass shootings in 2019 (Christchurch, New Zealand, in March; Poway, California, in April; El Paso, Texas, in August) where each ofthe assailants used 8chan as a platform to post their manifestos, 8chan went offline in August 2019 and rebranded in Nov. 2019 as 8kun.While 8kun quickly became a home for Q’s posts, the site saw a surprising shift on Election Day. Shortly following Q’s Nov. 3 drop, Ron Watkins—son of 8kun owner Jim Watkins—revealedthat he was “resigning as the admin of 8kun effective immediately.” According to theWashington Post, Watkins resigned to focus on his “health and marriage” and that he had “no thoughts or insight” into why Q had not posted in over a week.Given that Watkins was one of ahandful of people who could verify Q’s drops, several fake Q posts appeared over the following days which caused mass confusion among Anons before being discredited. Others spammed the forums with biblical passages comparing Moses’ miraculous parting of the Red Sea to QAnon’s ongoing fight against the deep state. The posts served the purpose of preying on vulnerable believers who were seeking answers for Q’s temporary disappearance.For some Anons, their determined and whole-hearted support for the baseless conspiracy theorycost them their marriages and destroyed their families. Those who have gambled on Q being a harbinger of light against the forces of evil cannot afford to turn back now, lest they realize they had sacrificed their loved ones to follow an anonymous internet troll. Faced with little alternative, many have doubled down on their beliefs and converged onto their last resort: unfounded conspiracy theories alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.Major Patriot—a popular twitter account belonging to a QAnon supporter—was among the first totweet out words of encouragementto his 168,000+ following, claiming that everything was going according to plan for the Trump administration despite the election results:I want to encourage any of you who may be alarmed about what is happening in our nation…Have Faith in God, our President and THE PLAN.  Rejoice now in VICTORY.  Do not worry.  Do not be afraid.  THERE IS A PLAN.  IT IS A GOOD PLAN.  IT IS BEING EXECUTED — and it will not fail.Many Anons followed suit, including some of the most prominent QAnon-related accounts on social media. They began to share disinformation surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Some pushed doctored videos and fake stories about ballot stuffing, while others propagated hashtags such as Stop the Steal, as well as the alleged ballot “watermarks” conspiracy theory.Everything happens for a reason and It’s far from over.@realDonaldTrumpis still the current sitting President of the United States of America. That alone with Election Fraud in plain sight (America is Watching) in lock-step with MSM, I can guarantee you Justice will prevail.pic.twitter.com/z2qKiUu1fA— QAnon Report ⭐⭐⭐ ?? (@QAnon_Report)November 8, 2020The QAnon accounts pushing Trump’s disinformation campaign were not limited to the United States. Amazing Polly, arguably the most outspoken QAnon supporter in Canada, has beenactively pushing the election fraud narrativeon Twitter. Polly, who appears to live in Ontario, is also a vehement anti-vaxxer and believes that COVID-19 was a planned event that helped enable a globalist coup—a claim sheadmits she inheritedfrom far-right conspiracy-monger Alex Jones.There was also a significant amount of Q-related activity from European followers of the movement, primarily in Germany, Italy, and France, as well as the United Kingdom. It has primarily been embraced by conservatives and the far-right, many of whom view Trump as a potential savior from leaders such as Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Emmanuel Macron.As Anons continued to amplify unfounded claims of widespread election fraud, some viewed the election aftermath as a renewed call to action. Philadelphiapolice arrested two armed men on Thursday Nov. 5, who were targeting the Convention Center where vote-counting was taking place. The two men were found in a Hummer with adecal on the rear window bearing the QAnon slogan WWG1WGA.The arrest is a stark reminder that the FBI has labeled QAnon as apotential domestic terrorism threat. QAnon supporters have beencharged with terrorismfor driving an armored truck to the Hoover Dam and blocking traffic for several hours,faced murder chargesfor the March 2019 slaying of Gambino crime family underboss Frank Cali, andkidnapping chargesafter a QAnon supporter attempted to kidnap one of her children who have been removed from her custody.The potential for violence has not stopped influential Q-adjacent accounts from pushing the election fraud conspiracies on social media. Midnight Rider, another prominent QAnon account with more than half-million followers, has been actively amplifying messages from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Michael Flynn, who served as national security advisor for the first three weeks of Trump’s presidency before resigning.Emboldened by Trump’s defiance and hisadministration’s refusal to concede the election, the accounttweetedon Nov. 11, “Losing never felt so good!”While the QAnon movement has been fueled by despair and denialism in the aftermath of the election, the movement is not without its small victories.Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was declared the winner in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, becoming the first QAnon supporter to win a U.S. House seat. She was followed shortly thereafter by mixed martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz, a fellow QAnon supporter who was elected to Huntington Beach City Council. (Author note: Right Wing Watch covered Ortiz’s campaign, including his support for the QAnon movement,here.)“Q is a patriot, we know that for sure,” Greenesaidin a 2017 video, which has since been deleted. “There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the President to do it.”The congresswoman-elect has spent the last week propagating voter fraud claims and falsely asserting that Trump won the election. She even designed a petition titled “Stop the Biden Steal,” which she hosted on her campaign website. Now the most visible and influential QAnon supporter in American politics, Greene hastargetedeveryone from President-Elect Biden to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while also asserting that her husband’s experience at the ballot box reflects an ongoing “absentee ballot scam.”Joe Biden isn’t President-elect. That’s a media falsehood.We CAN NOT allow CCP Joe to have National Security Briefings with these SERIOUS allegations.The Presidency is not for sale to the Communist Chinese!#BidenCrimeFamilyhttps://t.co/e8n6oRndou— Marjorie Taylor Greene ?? (@mtgreenee)November 12, 2020These prominent accounts are merely a handful of the accounts linked to QAnon that have been flooding hashtags and posts on social media. According to the non-profit research group Advance Democracy, QAnon-related accounts were responsible for approximately 10 percent of the tweets amplifying hashtags such as #StopTheSteal.QAnon followers have also beenspotted at several pro-Trump Stop the Steal rallies, and have joined forces with other far-right groups in promoting the upcoming Million MAGA March in Washington, D.C., on Saturday (aka the March for Trump, Stop the Steal DC). Q followerswill be joined by other MAGA loyalists, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and white nationalist “groypers,” as well as professional conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.By Nov. 12, Anon’s rejoiced at their fabled leader’s return to 8kun. At 9:32 p.m. Eastern Time, Q posted an American flag along with a short message aimed at rallying his digital troops.  “Nothing can stop what is coming. Nothing!” Q wrote.Q followed up with a pair of cryptic posts, which amounted to a series of open-ended questions followed by a link to the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators. While Q’s posts may distract his followers, many of whom are simply relieved that their leader has returned, it remains unclear whether the QAnon fantasy will able to sustain itself over the coming months as the disappointments continue to pile on.Contact Us|Privacy Policy© 2024 Right Wing Watch, a project of People For the American Way."
Biden Is Turning America Into the Land of the Freebie,26.33,19.67,https://spectator.org/biden-free-college-democrats-socialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,23,"With the media proclaiming President Joe Biden to be the new FDR, it’s important to craft the right governing philosophy for him. The answer is simple. The federal government should make real the most simple liberal — excuse me, progressive! — principle. Everything in life should be free. At least, everythinggoodin life should be free.I had this extraordinary revelation while reading theWashington Post, the repository of all that is wonderful and decent in the nation’s capital.Poststaffer Jen Balderama penned an articleentitled, “Community college saved me. Biden is right: It should be free.” It was an epiphany! I suddenly understood: If even one person benefits from something, it should be free to all. What could be more obvious? What a wonderful life Americans then would have.Why stop at giving away community college education? Consider the movement to eliminate student debt. The Left already is pushing this hard. It involves the same principle, at least for anyone who borrows to pay for a university degree. How foolish I was to work while in school and accept help from my parents to pay for undergrad and law school. Education was good for me. No doubt adding another lawyer to our terribly underserved society was great for the people! Soof coursemy schooling should have been free. Why should I have to pay for something just because I chose to do for my benefit? America — and, heck, everyone else on Earth — benefited. Make college free for all.And as much as we want wherever we want. If I feel called to be a permanent student, Washington should make my dream come true. Moreover, if I want to go to Stanford, Harvard, Yale, or some other pricey place, cost should be no object. Indeed, why should I be denied entry by discriminatory “standards” and “qualifications”? Elite schools are part of the racist, elitist, patriarchal, and whatever other evils that apply to structures designed to hold we the people in bondage. All universities should be public, open to all, and free to everyone. Cambridge, here I come!It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free.There’s also child care. Why should people be expected to be responsible for their own kids? Hillary Clinton was wrong to believe that it “takes a village.” That isn’t nearly enough people! Rather, it requires all the smart thinkers in Washington taking and spending everyone else’s money. Progressives believe that having sex and aborting babies are the most — actually, perhaps the only — essential liberties. Government is entitled to promiscuously and routinely interfere in every other human decision. If the intersection of these two fundamental rights unexpectedly leaves a baby alive, then the essential right to economic redistribution kicks in. And everyone else should pay for everything — starting with child care at birth.It is beyond question that health care should be free. Every last procedure. Being healthy is our rightful state, and getting sick isn’t our fault. Even if someone claims that we contributed to the problem — all the outrageousfat-shamingthat goes on after people have a heart attack, for instance! — it shouldn’t be held against us. Personally, I want it all.If a few extra pounds result, there should be some miracle medical procedure to remove a few of them — why should I be denied the chocolate that is necessary to help me determine the meaning of the universe and engage in other essential acts of personhood? My once-bountiful hair appears to be thinning: surely modern medicine can fix that. And it was nice getting the COVID-19 vaccine for free. Why do I have to pay more for aspirin than for a life-saving shot? It all should be free.Similarly, food should be free. We need it to live. And there should be food equality. It’s no one else’s business what we eat. If I prefer a diet of steak and shrimp, what is the problem? If I want caviar, it should be my right. Why should I be denied my preference? Why should rich people get to eat what they want and not me? That is downright unfair. It also is classist. Racist. Sexist. And probably some other evil “-ist”s as well. In my case, being fat is an essential part of who I am — especially eating cashews, chocolate, potato chips, and ice cream. It isn’t fair to deny me such necessities just because some dead white cisgender male living in what once was an empire that oppressed native peoples and allowed slavery claimed something was unhealthy. Food should be provided to everyone, without judgment and free of charge.So should transportation. How are those of us who aren’t Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos supposed to get around? Cars are expensive. Gasoline is expensive. Parking is expensive. We need to go to work (oppressive!) and school. We even have to drive to go out on dates (essential to humankind!). Buy groceries. Vote (early and often!). And organize unions for protest and the socialist masses to overthrow their oppressors.Moreover, gasoline-powered cars are bad for the environment. So mass transit should be everywhere and free. Electric cars should be free. Even taxis for those of us who don’t want to own cars should be free. Though not Uber and Lyft, tools of exploitation against the laboring masses. It is socially unjust to expect people to pay for something as essential as transportation.Housing should be free, too. No one should be denied the home of their choosing. Today poor people suffer in cities while their oppressors live in splendor in surrounding suburbs. Public housing is a good start but doesn’t go nearly far enough. It still allows enormous housing inequality. Why shouldn’t everyone get to live in a house like that owned by Bill Gates? Government should confiscate the existing housing stock and distribute it on a fairer basis. But much more is required. Government should make companies build houses for free for everyone. Make rich corporations give back to the community! True servants of the people, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who owns three homes, should be shown special consideration for having devoted their lives to taking from the rich for the rest of us. Personally, I believe I deserve at least two homes!Even jobs should be free. That is, government should employ anyone who needs work. Well, a paying position, not actual work, if you get my meaning. Nor is there any reason to let “need” and “qualifications” as defined by dead white cisgender males get in the way. Government should provide employment to everyone — no restrictions. Why should people be constrained by arbitrary limits that prevent the oppressed masses from being all they can be? Have you ever been denied an opportunity that you believed you deserved? It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free.Democrats should listen to progressive activists and institute the socialist ideal. Like to cook? Government restaurants should allow anyone to be a chef. A frustrated architect? Government construction companies should let anyone design and build homes for all. Better yet, produce skyscrapers to showcase the new equal and fair America. Just imagine Stalinist realism with a Bidenesque accent!Did you play doctor when young? No need to waste time in medical school! Government hospitals should hire anyone to fulfill their dreams. We would have true people’s radiologists, neurologists, thoracic surgeons, and more. Why let oppressive training get in the way of ideological commitment? Who doesn’t believe they can teach better than some antediluvian professor with an ancient degree granted by a school founded decades or centuries ago by a bunch of dead white slave-owning cisgender males? Government universities could allow anyone to teach. With appropriate emphasis on true human values. We have a chance to build a real and permanent socialist majority.There’s no limit to this idea. Why let qualifications get in the way of government service? The more decades of undistinguished office-holding, the better! Government institutions should allow anyone to take power and rule over the rest of us — oh, wait, at least that ideal has been fulfilled! All hail President Joe Biden! But this should be just the beginning.Free should become the new principle of government. Paying for everything remains a slight challenge, though. The who is obvious, starting with rich, oppressive, white, cisgender men and even women — there just aren’t enough guys, alas. Also high-income, conservative people of color, who obviously are not authentic and do not deserve to be treated as real people of color. And anyone else departing from progressive orthodoxy. But how to keep them working while seizing everything they earn remains a slight conundrum. Still, surely Joe, with the help of Kamala, Nancy, and Chuck, should be able to work out the details.Just think of the new national rallying cry: America the land of the free, the brave, and the perpetual freebie!"

President Trump Seems to Have a Problem With Yamiche Alcindor. Why Is That?,-15.12,39.62,https://www.vogue.com/article/yamiche-alcindor-donald-trump-feud,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-31,23,"At Sunday's coronavirus press briefing, held in the Rose Garden of the White House in front of a smattering of reporters and government officials, all practicing social distancing, President Donald Trump made some startling announcements. In addition to backing away from his earlier proclamation that thecountry would be back to normal by Easter, and instead announcing that the country would be under shelter-in-place ordersthrough the end of April, he soberly predicted thatat least 200,000 Americans might die from COVID-19during the current pandemic, adding that the reason that number wasn't higher was because his administration had “done a very good job.”But the most charged moment of the press conference was whenYamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent forPBS Newshourand a former reporter forThe New York Times, asked the president why he had recently said that some state governors might not need as much medical equipment as they had requested from the federal government to fight the frighteningly rapid spread of COVID-19. (OnSean Hannity's Fox News Channel show last Thursday, Trump said: ""I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,"" an apparent reference to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's recent claim that the state needed 30,000 ventilators.)Referring to Trump's remarks on that show, Alcindor addressed the president and said, ""You've said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. You said New York might not need 30,000 — """"I did not say that. I didn't say that,"" Trump responded.""You said it on Sean Hannity's Fox News, you said that you might — "" Alcindor said.""Come on, come on,"" said Trump said, cutting her off again. ""You know, why don't you people act — why don't you act in a little more positive — it's always trying to getcha, getcha.""Alcindor tried to ask the question again, but the president continued, ""And you know what, that's why  nobody trusts the media anymore."" He added: ""Look, let me tell you something. Be nice. Don't be threatening.""As Alcindor continue to press the president, he turned toward another reporter and a White House aide came over to Alcindor and snatched the microphone from her hand.It wouldn't be the first time Trumpwould show a flash of anger over Alcindor's questioning.Ata White House press conference in 2018, shortly after the midterm elections, Alcindor asked the president about comments he made at a rally that October, where he labeled himself a nationalist. Alcindor pointed out that some interpreted the comment as embracing white nationalists.Trump, looking annoyed, said, ""I don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question.""On Monday, at another White House coronavirus briefing, the president called on her again, and Alcindor asked why the United States was lagging behind other countries, including South Korea, in providing coronavirus tests for their citizens. He answered, ""We have done more tests than any other country in the world, by far.""Then the president challenged her on the premise of her question. ""I know South Korea better than anybody. It's a very tight — do you know how many people are in Seoul?"" he asked. ""Do you know how big the city of Seoul is?"" Alcindor just kept looking at him, poised to press her question again. ""Thirty-eight million people,"" Trump said, ""That's bigger than anything we have. Thirty-eight million people, all tightly wound together."" (The actualfigure is close to 10 million.)Finally, he stared at her, seemingly exasperated: ""You should be saying congratulations rather than asking a really snarky question.""With that, he announced the press briefing was over, turned his back on the reporters and quickly strode into the White House.On Sunday night, Alcindortweeted out her response to the interaction with Trump: ""President Trump today at the White House said to me: 'Be nice. Don't be threatening.' I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused.  Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.""What about Alcindor seems to get under Trump's skin so much?April Ryan has a theory.Ryan, like Alcindor, is a longtime Washington reporter whohas verbally tussled with the president at contentious White House news conferences.And Ryan, like Alcindor, is African-American.Ina 2018 essayforThe Washington Post, Ryan wrote about how Trump had frequently attacked her  (""nasty,"" loser""), Alcindor (""racist"") and another African-American reporter, CNN's Abby Phillip (""I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions"") in ways that seemed more deeply personal than his criticism of their white, male colleagues.The Washington Postheadline was: ""I’m a black woman. Trump loves insulting people like me.""Wrote Ryan: ""When Trump denigrates black women, he’s sending the message that he doesn’t see us equally.""With the latest round of exchanges this week, other journalists and prominent figures weighed in, echoing Ryan's sentiment. ""'Be nice. Don’t be threatening' oh my god what a textbook distillation of his racism and sexism,""tweetedRebecca Traister, a writer forNew Yorkmagazine.  I’m so sorry @Yamiche is his target but she’s so goddamn great at her job.""""You go girl,""tweetedSusan Rice, the former ambassador to the United Nations in the Obama administration. ""Pathetic when insecure men can’t stomach strong black women.""OnMonday's episode of the podcast""Pod Save America,"" Alcindor declined to speculate whether Trump might be singling her out because of her race. Instead she pivoted, saying that, in the face of this pandemic crisis, ""We don't have time for foolishness; we don't have time for sideshows.""Of course, Alcindor isn't the only reporter Trump has attacked during his three years in office.He's banned CNN's Jim Acostaand said to Peter Alexander, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" when the NBC reporter asked of the coronavirus outbreak: ""What do you say to Americans watching you right now who are scared?""But as others have pointed out, Trump does seem to have a particular problem with women who challenge him, regardless of race.As Molly Jong-Fast wrote forThe Atlanticin November, during the Ukraine hearings of the House Intelligence Committee, Trump took to Twitter to lash out at Marie Yovanovitch,  the former ambassador to Ukraine, in ways that seemed more pointed than his earlier criticisms of previous witnesses, Yovanovitch's fellow diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. (""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" his tweet began, before ending with ""it is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. "")""Why was the president’s response so different to witnesses who were roughly saying the same thing?"" Jong-Fast asked. ""What was the big difference between Kent and Taylor and Yovanovitch? All three are career diplomats, all three are Ivy League graduates, all three have worked in the State Department, all three are experts in Ukraine. But only one of them is a woman. Could that be why the president singled out Yovanovitch? It is almost as if the president is unable to control his rage against women. It is almost as if the president thinks he can bully women and silence them.""In acolumn inThe Washington Poston Monday, headlined, ""Yamiche Alcindor wants an answer, thank you very much,"" the paper's media critic, Eric Wemple, weighed in. He quoted a PBS spokeswoman in defense of Alcindor: ""She is doing exactly what is expected of a free press in our democracy: posing timely, pertinent questions to those in power on behalf of the American people. She was hardly the only reporter in the Rose Garden yesterday, or at other times, to be on the receiving end of such treatment. It will not deter Yamiche from asking fair and direct questions, especially at such a critical time.”""Good!,"" Wemple responded in his column. ""Those fair and direct questions, after all, continue illuminating the petty and insecure soul of President Trump as he runs away from his previous statements, utters barely comprehensible excuses for his mismanagement and otherwise diffuses a stink in the Rose Garden."""
Pelosi and Mnuchin agree to try to avoid government shutdown,0.0,49.67,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/03/pelosi-mnuchin-plan-clean-cr-but-length-other-details-unclear/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,23,"An agreement between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to pursue a “clean” stopgap spending measure significantly reduces the chances of a government shutdown at month’s end but leaves most other funding questions unanswered.Tuesday’s accord, days before Congress prepares to return from summer recess, shows that neither President Donald Trump nor Republican or Democratic lawmakers see a political advantage in risking a partial shutdown just ahead of the elections.The agreement on a “clean” stopgap may be shorthand for avoiding “poison pills” or other controversial provisions that could hamper such a measure’s enactment. Nevertheless, the door is open to potentially dozens of tweaks to spending provisions and temporary extensions of expiring programs, which often ride on a stopgap, Republican and Democratic aides familiar with the process said.The White House requested three dozen adjustments or “anomalies” to current fiscal 2020 spending laws that would be extended into the next fiscal year in a stopgap, and another 51 extensions of, or legislative tweaks to, federal programs set to expire before the end of the year. The House and Senate Appropriations committees have compiled their own lists of adjustments after conversations with agency officials.One looming question is the stopgap’s length, something Mnuchin and Pelosi, D-Calif., did not discuss, aides familiar with their phone conversation Tuesday said.The White House and GOP lawmakers prefer acontinuing resolutioninto December, giving the current Congress and president leverage to negotiate the final fiscal 2021 spending bills before a new Congress convenes in January. It is unclear where Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., will come down on this.Some Democrats speculate Pelosi may prefer a stopgap that extends into next year, when Democrats hope they will take control of the Senate and the White House in addition to holding the House.The agreement to negotiate a clean stopgap was a bright spot Tuesday in a reportedly otherwise dispiriting Mnuchin-Pelosi phone call over the shape of a new COVID-19 relief bill.In a press release following the conversation, Pelosi said the call “made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to have serious differences understanding the gravity of the situation that America’s working families are facing.”During a hearing before a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on the same day, Mnuchin said Schumer and Pelosi “do not want to sit down at the negotiating table unless we publicly agree on a topline.”“My own opinion,” Mnuchin said, “is we should go piece by piece, and any area of the legislation we can agree on we should have the House and Senate pass.”Pelosi has said Democrats would be willing to go down to a bill costing $2.2 trillion, while White House officials have talked about going up to $1.3 trillion.Lindsey McPherson contributed to this report."

Barr said he plans to review the matter along with the origins of counter-intelligence probe.It's already known that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign funded the creation of the dubious anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele.The document was used by the Obama administration to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.Judicial Watch has sued the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act for records of communications and payments between the FBI and Steele and his private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence.""How and why did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, who was already being funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC through Fusion GPS?"" asked Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.""That we had to sue for this basic information shows the FBI may have something more to hide.""The case was filed after the FBI didn't respond to a FOIA request filed last fall.It sought records of communications between the FBI and Steele, records related to any payments to him or his company and records ""produced in preparation for, during, or pursuant to any meetings or telephonic conversations between any official, employee, or representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mr. Christopher Steele and/or any employee or representative of Orbis Business Intelligence.""Judicial Watch previously disclosed that former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr told Congress that ""at some point during 2017, Chris Steele did speak with somebody from the FBI, but I don't know who.""Its FOIA lawsuit is the latest its investigation of the dossier.In a related case, Judicial Watch revealed the FBI cut off Steele from his position as a ""Confidential Human Source"" after he disclosed his relationship with the bureau to a third party.An estimated $168,000 was paid by the Clinton campaign and the DNC, through Fusion GPS, to Steele's company, Orbis, in 2016.Judicial Watch previously suedto obtain communications between Steele and then-FBI General Counsel James Baker.""The real collusion scandal of the 2016 election is the effort by the Clinton campaign and the Obama DOJ/FBI to spy on and destroy President Donald Trump,"" Fitton said at the time.

Professor defends teaching students to question COVID-19 ‘propaganda’ as NYU investigation continues,11.67,38.33,https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-defends-teaching-students-to-question-covid-19-propaganda-as-nyu-investigation-continues/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,23,"A New York University professor is suing several colleagues for alleged defamation in relation to his unpopular views on COVID-19 interventions, including the efficacy of masks and particular treatments.The private university opened an investigation againstMark Crispin Miller, a tenured professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communications, after 25 facultycalled on the departmentto respond to his “ongoing harm to our students.”Their letter refers to a September incident in Miller’s class “Mass Persuasion and Propaganda.” A female student, who has since dropped out of the course, accused him of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and the department chair quickly responded that MCC was considering “next steps.”Miller (above) responded bybloggingabout the dispute, asking readers to sign a petition in favor of his academic freedom. He mentioned NYU communications to his students and a department email urging him to stop teaching the course, and claimed he was acting in self-defense.The professor toldThe College Fixthat NYU Steinhardt School Dean Jack Knott told him the investigation would conclude by the end of the semester, but gave him no other details.Miller, who has spent more than 20 years on the NYU faculty, filed alawsuitin New York State court Nov. 30 after his colleagues did not retract their statements and apologize as he demanded.He shared several NYU communications withThe Fixto illustrate his legal claims. Miller explained in a phone interview that he wasn’t suing any of the junior professors who signed the letter: “Whether they signed it, willingly or not, I’m sure they had no choice.”According to the suit, Miller’s colleagues intended to “disgrace and humiliate” the professor “under the guise of phony and uninformed political and cultural correctness and orthodoxy.” He’s seeking $750,000 in damages, saying their letter led to loss of professional standing and the worsening of his Lyme disease.The faculty letter “takes every conceivable opportunity to cast me in a bad light,” Miller toldThe Fix. He also said in a separate email that the charges from his colleagues are “so false as to seem downright psychotic.”If Miller is a right-wing conspiracy theorist, he’s an unconventional one. The professor isnamedon Turning Point USA’s Professor Watchlist, which identifies faculty who allegedly promote “leftist propaganda in the classroom.”He also helped lead a movement in 2012 tohalt NYU’s redevelopment plansfor the Greenwich Village campus. The resulting lawsuitsuccessfully challengednearly half of the university’s expansion plan, though Miller toldThe Fixthe experience also convinced him not to sue NYU itself this time.Politically, Miller considers himself a leftist: “I’m anti-war, I believe in empowering the working class, cutting back corporate power – I could go on and on.” He said progressive luminaries such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Oliver Stone signed his petition, and Ralph Nader provided a separate statement of support.The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, whopublicly accused NYUof forcing him out of a fellowship because of pressure from Beijing, also signed Miller’s petition, the professor said.But Miller also believes the left has “changed radically over the years. I don’t really recognize it anymore.” The left today wants “censorship and government authority to be accepted without question—except if it’s Trump,” he said.Some of the professor’s colleagues have long despised him for his course content and extramural statements on subjects including the Sandy Hook massacre and transgender ideology.But a civil liberties group told NYU that Miller’s alleged conduct is expressly protected by its own policies, and cited court rulings against private universities including New York City’s Fordham.One group is not weighing in on the dispute: the American Association of University Professors. A representative toldThe Fixin an email that AAUP’s department of academic freedom and tenure confirmed “we haven’t been involved with this case,” and declined to comment further.Student Julia Jackson tagged NYU in atweet threadSept. 20 to complain that Miller had “spent an entire class period telling students that wearing masks doesn’t prevent the spread of COVID-19.” She also claimed that he said “hydroxychloroquine trials were made to fail so more people would be given the vaccine and have their DNA changed.”She linked to articles and videos shared by Miller, including atwo–partinterview of Canadian physicist Denis Rancourt on One America News Network (below), describing them as conspiratorial and “far-right.”Jacksoncalled onNYU to “relieve him” of educating and advising students. MCC Chair Rodney Benson thanked her for reporting the issue and said the department had “made this a priority.”MillerrespondedOct. 6 on his News From Underground blog, explaining that his pedagogical style is to teach students how to identify propaganda drives and seek out alternative claims.He urged his students to read studies that conclude masks and ventilators are ineffective at preventing transmission of the novel coronavirus and saving lives, “with due attention to the scientific reviews thereof.” Miller cited “possible financial links between” researchers and interests such as “Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation.”The blog post embedded Jackson’s tweet thread and mentioned a Sept. 21 email to Miller’s students from Knott and Carlo Ciotoli, who leads NYU’s COVID-19 Prevention and Response Team.Miller providedThe Fixwith this email (below), which he said a student forwarded to him. Prefaced by the claim that NYU has the “utmost respect for the principles of academic freedom,” it referred students to “the most authoritative public health guidance” – CDCrecommendations.“The evidence backs it up,” the email continued, linking sources. “And we remind you thatwearing a mask is required at NYU.” The NYU leaders said “we do not feel we have a choice” in pushing back on Miller’s alleged comments.Miller said he didn’t tell students to break the university’s mask mandate, which he actively observes – a point emphasized in his lawsuit.The blog post alleged that NYU had urged Miller to cancel his propaganda course because it would be “better for the department” if he instead chose to teach two sections on cinema. (Miller toldThe FixSunday that the quoted phrase was from an email sent by the department’s administrative assistant, while a later phone call with Benson, the MCC chair, claimed the change would be better for enrollment.)It linked to apetitionto back Miller’s cause, which as of Monday night has been signed by more than 20,000 people. Miller toldThe Fixlast week that the blind Chinese lawyer Guangcheng, who memorably escaped house arrest in China, was among them.Guangchengclaimedto have been forced out by NYU following “great, unrelenting pressure” from Chinese communists, at a time when the university was building a campus in Shanghai.NYU stated that Guangcheng’s stay was based on a one-year fellowship and that his claims were “both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,” including that the foreign campus was approved to be built before the dissident’s arrival at NYU.The Oct. 21 faculty letter to Steinhardt Dean Knott and Provost Katherine Fleming criticized the views that “Miller has espoused on his highly visible website” over the years.While it doesn’t say what is “highly visible” about Miller’s blog, the letter complains that “he prominently displays his title as a full tenured professor in our department.”Miller has characterized “transgender surgery as a eugenic form of sterilization,” mocked transgender people and denied “the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting,” they alleged.While Miller has a right to his views, his colleagues object to “discrimination, attacks against students and others in our community, or advocacy for an unsafe learning environment.” Students have complained about his discussion of controversial viewpoints and “non-evidence based arguments” for years, yet frequent complaints to bias review offices and administrators have not “improved” the situation. (The letter does not mention any specific complaints.)Miller’s post that linked Jackson’s public tweets opened an opportunity for “cyberbullying and threatening communication directed toward the student,” which “subsequently occurred and continues,” the letter claimed.I hope@nyuniversity,@nyusteinhardt, and@mccNYUagree that this professor should not be trusted with educating and advising students, and I hope they take immediate steps to relieve him of these duties. 8/— Julia Jackson (@julia_jacks)September 21, 2020It called for an “expedited review” of Miller’s “intimidation tactics, abuses of authority, aggressions and microaggressions, and explicit hate speech,” to be followed by “whatever further disciplinary measures are deemed appropriate.”In an email provided by Miller, Dean Knott told the professor Oct. 29 that an investigation had been opened that day. “I will ask Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs LaRue Allen to begin this review immediately” and decide, based on the collected information, whether to proceed “with next steps as outlined in the Faculty Handbook,” Knott wrote.Miller conveyed his shock at receiving the email in a Thursday phone call withThe Fix. “I was completely surprised that he hadn’t talked to me first,” he said. In a Zoom meeting requested by Miller, Knott said that NYU “lawyers and provost told him that they had to” investigate.Knott wouldn’t give him the scope of the investigation except that “they would talk to people,” according to Miller. “And I said what people? And he said, faculty and students. And I said, what faculty? None of them have seen me teach. And he said: well yeah, so the students.”Miller then told the dean that he would solicit and send testimonials from current and former students, “maybe 40 letters” so far that “make abundantly clear that there is not a shred of truth” in the colleagues’ letter. He excerpted several in his blog post.A few days after this meeting, Miller confronted his colleagues’ charges in arebuttalhe shared withThe Fix.He called “nearly all” their claims “demonstrably untrue,” and the letter “misleading in its various insinuations.” Miller did not launch an email campaign against the department, as they claimed, but rather highlighted “NYU’s violation of my academic freedom.”Miller reiterated his public assertion that he simply encouraged students to read “scientific studies—eight randomized, controlled trials, conducted among health professionals over the last 15 years or so—finding that masks are ineffective against transmission of respiratory viruses.”On Sunday he pointedThe Fixto his Sept. 5essay“Masking Ourselves to Death” for sources:researchfrom Rancourt, the Canadian physicist, as well asJoshua Jacobs,B. J. Cowling,Faisal bin-Reza,Jeffrey Smith,Vittoria Offeddu,Lewis RadonovichandYoulin Long.The essay mentions the two-part interview with Rancourt and adebatehe had with “another COVID-19 dissident,” physician Joseph Mercola, whose videos “have been banned on YouTube and Spotify since mid-June.” Miller also provided alinkto Mercola’s website pertaining to the censorship.Miller emphasized that he “very clearly” told students that he was “nottelling you not to wear masks,” but simply engaging in an intellectual exercise. Responding to the email from Knott and Ciotoli, he noted the CDC guidelines “that you regard as gospel truth abruptly changed in early April.” Previously they had “echoed the consensus of the [randomized controlled trials] that I encouraged my students to examine.”It is “wholly false” that he “attacked” Jackson, when in fact “the student attackedme, on Twitter, demanding that NYU fire me.” She didn’t speak up during that class and did not “bother reading any of those studies,” he claimed. “How, and where, and when,I‘attacked’ her your letter fails to specify—as it could not, because I never did.”NYU professor who questions COVID orthodoxy demands colleagues retract false claims about himbyThe College Fixon ScribdBy publicly writing under her own name, Jackson tweets “provoked attacks by others, which had nothing to do with me,” Miller continued, adding that he had received similar attacks spurred by Jackson’s tweets. (While he mentioned “three media hit-pieces” against him, Miller did not identify the articles.)He only identified Jackson by name once, in the petition defending himself, to show that she demanded his firing. “To cast me as the aggressor in this case is as perverse as your accusing me of having attacked” the department, he said.His website does not have “a single mention of Sandy Hook” and he only mentioned the school massacre in a class discussion on gun control. Miller recommended “some troublingly compelling scholarship on Sandy Hook” to students, because “we cannot simply rule out any argument that deviates from the official story.” (He exempted speculation about child-sex-slave colonies on Mars, whichThe Washington Postsaid was shared by a guest on theAlex Jones Show.)Regarding the alleged transgender mockery, Miller said the university “quickly exculpated” him from secondhand claims by a colleague, defendant Nicole Starosielski, based on “three brief online writings.”His writing on the subject is “highly critical of transgenderideology” because of its “troubling real-world consequences” in sports and prisons and the “radical medical intervention in the sexual development of children.” The ideology has also been aggressively promoted throughout the corporate media with the backing of “multibillionaires with large investments in Big Pharma,” which might have “eugenic purposes.”Miller cited his own “pleasant” email exchange with a transgender colleague at NYU. Though this person signed the letter against him, he understands “why she may have felt obliged” to sign it.The professor said he could make his own allegations about a “hostile work environment” going back “some time, but especially this semester,” citing comments from students about faculty disparaging him.The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education told NYU President Andrew Hamilton in a Nov. 13letterthat the university’s ownstated commitmentto academic freedom meant it must end the investigation into Miller.The civil liberties group noted a New York court ruled in 2019 thatFordham violated its contractual commitmentsby refusing to recognize a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.In a 2018 case closely paralleling the factual allegations in Miller’s dispute, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled thatMarquette University could not punisha professor’s extramural expressions because of its contractual promises on academic freedom.NYU did not respond toFixqueries on how its Miller investigation was any different from the rulings cited by FIRE.When the university ignored FIRE’s Nov. 20 deadline to respond, the grouppublicly condemnedNYU’s investigation. A spokesperson for the civil liberties group toldThe Fixlast week that NYU has still not responded.Miller has long been a bee in NYU’s bonnet. He’s one of several named plaintiffs in anongoing class action suitagainst its “mismanagement of our retirement funds,” he toldThe Fix. Having seen the university’s lawyers in action, Miller said they are “extraordinarily aggressive when it comes to legal action.”He’s more surprised by criticism from colleagues – “people whom I did everything I could to serve in trying to halt the real estate plan” and protecting pension funds. Some of them “wrote letters of recommendation” when Miller was “nominated for a distinguished teaching award in 2012.”He emphasized that “I’m not saying this to brag. I’m saying this to demonstrate how egregious this attack is.” Only one faculty member – untenured, from the School of Professional Studies – went to bat for him.Miller is the one person “above all” that the instructor recommends to her students, she wrote to President Hamilton and Provost Fleming Dec. 6. (Miller removed the colleague’s name from the email he showedThe Fix.)His propaganda course is the “best” to make students “critical thinkers, a person who can question mass delusions whether they be scientific or political.” She compared Miller to Galileo and Copernicus, who were “condemned for exploring unpopular truths.”The colleague asked rhetorically, whether “Christopher Columbus was a hero or whether masks do prevent the spread of a virus, don’t we want to encourage one and all to look at all the material out there?”Miller toldThe Fixhe doesn’t attribute the hostility to his political views, but rather to the “discomfiture” his work causes colleagues. He closely studies “official narratives to determine whether they are true or false and to try to figure out what purpose they serve and what interests are behind them.”The political right doesn’t have a monopoly on critiquing the “echo chambers” of academia, he said: “I think it’s also possible to make the same critique from a left-perspective.”Miller sees something similar occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Just for urging the study on the scientific literature on masking as a barrier against respiratory viruses is like a high crime now; that’s killing grandma.”IMAGE: Renegade Inc./YouTubeLikeThe College Fixon Facebook/Follow us on TwitterPlease join the conversation about our stories onFacebook,Twitter,Instagram,Reddit,MeWe,Rumble,Gab,MindsandGettr."

Here is a great compilation of real and unstaged photos taken by Pete Souza from the Situation Room, taken during theraid on Osama bin Laden. The most iconic is this one:Credit: Pete Souza/White HouseThe contrast between these photos and the staged one Trump released are clear.Everyone in the Obama photo is looking at the screen. The photos are taken from the side, not directly in front.  The facial expressions of the subjects in the photos are showing concern, emotion, focus on the magnitude of what they are witnessing.  Subjects are interacting.  The desk is covered with open laptops, photos, pads of paper, writing utensils and drinks.Contrast that with Trump's photo.  The photo is taken from the end of the table, directly in front of the screen they would be watching. The people in the photo do not seem concerned with having their line of sight blocked, suggesting they weren't actually looking at anything.   Second, no one is looking in the same direction. It is as though they are watching different screens or not even engaged. Third, and most notably, no one is interacting with anyone else in the photo. It looks like they all came in to the room and were told to look straight ahead and pretend to be serious for the photo.Finally, look at the cables in the Trump photo.They're all unplugged.Here's a clearer image of them:Credit: The White HouseDonald Trump,  Reality TV Show President.What an epic failure."

"Romney, bipartisan Senate group to propose 2-part coronavirus relief plan",-0.33,48.33,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/12/13/22173169/coronavirus-covid19-relief-package-congress-mitt-romney,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-13,22,"A bipartisan group of senators, including Utah Republican Mitt Romney, intends to introduce a $908 billion COVID-19 relief package Monday that will be split in two parts.One piece would provide $748 billion for support for small businesses, including Payroll Protection Program loans, added unemployment benefits, and vaccine development and distribution.The other would provide $160 billion for state and local government as well as temporary liability protection from coronavirus related-lawsuits. Those two issue have been major sticking points in reaching a deal as the clock ticks on the current Congress.The bipartisan group plans to hold a news conference Monday to announce the modified proposal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has long called for a liability shield from coronavirus litigation, while congressional Democrats have made money for states and cities their top priority. Breaking the proposal in two parts might give a relief package a greater chance to pass.Romney is among a group of lawmakers who have vowed to stay in Washington through the holidays to get a deal done as businesses across the country shut down, especially in the restaurant and hospitality industry, and Americans struggle to stay employed amid another COVID-19 surge.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., one of the leaders of the effort, said the bipartisan group and their staffs have met regularly the past month, including a call Saturday and another call later Sunday to “finish things up.”“The bottom line is there’s a lot of parts to this bill, and in the spirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that,” Manchin told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “But at the end, you can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”Romney expressed optimism earlier this month that Congress could get a relief bill passed before Christmas.“I think it would send a terrible message if we’re home celebrating Christmas and people’s unemployment has run out and businesses are being closed,” he said."

Plowshares Activists Pay Heavy Price For Resisting Nuclear Warfare,-32.67,31.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/17/kings-bay-plowshares-activists-pay-heavy-price-for-resisting-nuclear-warfare/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,22,"Patrick O’Neill gripped the hammer tightly in his hands. The police would soon surround him.O’Neill and six other Catholic peace activists had infiltrated the Kings Bay Naval Base in St. Mary’s, Georgia, with the goal of symbolically disarming the base’s six Trident submarines armed with first-strike missiles capable of holding 200 nuclear warheads.Some of the activists strung up crime scene tape and hung protest banners that read “The Ultimate Logic of Trident is Omnicide.” Others poured baby bottles of their own blood around the base.Using Google Maps, O’Neill and Mark Colville discovered a macabre shrine to nuclearism consisting of a half dozen statues of nuclear missiles that looked as if they were suspended in motion just seconds after launch.Staring up at a replica of a Trident D5 intercontinental ballistic missile, O’Neill’s mind turned to the book of Exodus in the Bible: the shrine offered proof that nuclear weapons were modern-day idols more powerful than a golden calf. Unlike that empty signifier, the pacifist recognized the immutable power of nuclear weapons. For him, it was the same as worshipping death.Time was running short. O’Neill sprinted up to the statue and beat it with the hammer. The missile was solid cement and the hammerhead broke clean off.“It was a formidable idol,” recalled O’Neill.Catholic peace activists like the ones who infiltrated the naval base at Kings Bay in 2018 have attempted to topple the formidable idol of nuclearism for 40 years, and they have paid a heavy price.Liz McAlister has already served 17 months behind bars and Father Steve Kelley continues to languish in a jail in Georgia. After spending more than 28 months under house arrest, O’Neill was slapped with a 14-month prison sentence in October. Carmen Trotta and Clare Grady will serve more than a year in prison, while Martha Hennessy expects to be incarcerated for 10 months. Mark Colville will be sentenced in December.On top of that, the activists are grappling with an establishment media blackout that they fear could be reflective of Americans’ apathy towards nuclear abolition at a moment when the threat of a nuclear holocaust is at its highest point in decades.O’Neill and the other Catholic peace activists knew they possessed neither the tools nor the numbers to physically disarm the nuclear naval base at Kings Bay. Rather, the goal of the Kings Bay action, like every Plowshares action dating back to the movement’s inception, was to call attention to the omnicidal threat that nuclear weapons continue to pose for humanity.The Plowshares movement began in 1980 when Roman Catholic priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan and six others surreptitiously gained access to the Re-Entry Division at the General Electric Space Technology Center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Carrying only hammers and pints of their own blood to symbolize the human cost of nuclear war, the activists pounded on nose cones that covered Mark 12A nuclear warheads and poured the blood over engineering blueprints and other documents.As their objective was to convert weapons of war into instruments of peace, the activists dubbed themselves the Plowshares Eight, a reference to a verse in the book of Isaiah in the Bible calling nations to “beat swords into plowshares.”The King of Prussia action captured the attention of the nation–theNew York Timestocallit “one of the best-known antiwar incidents in this country since the Vietnam War”–and announced to the world the beginning of a bold new faction within the broader anti-war movement in the U.S. that fused religion with non-violent direct action against nuclear weapons.“They were different. They were risky. They were costly,” said McAlister, a former Catholic nun and longtime Plowshares activist.Since 1980, dozens of Plowshares activists have repeatedly penetrated sites across the country ranging from military installations to missile silos and in the process laid waste to the idea that nuclear weapons could ever be stored safely. The 2018 infiltration of the naval base at Kings Bay is estimated to be the 100th Plowshares action.Legal trials and prison sentences that were sure to follow their acts of civil disobedience were viewed as opportunities for the activists to draw more attention to their cause and often revealed the extraordinary lengths the government took to suppress dissent among those who dared to confront the American war machine.“You could count on serious time as a consequence,” McAlister said. “And [the federal government was] consistent about seeing to it that we did that time.”McAlister and Philip Berrigan were excommunicated from the Catholic church after they married in 1973 but their social justice activism continued. McAlister said she avoided participating in Plowshares actions at the same time as her husband so that one parent could be home with their children.The couple estimated that they spent more than 10 years of their marriage separated by the carceral system. McAlister served another two and a half years, including jail time for the Kings Bay action, since Berrigan died in 2002.When Grady first heard about the King of Prussia action, her initial reaction was alarm at the personal risks that the activists undertook to broadcast their message out to the public. Her second reaction was skepticism that their actions, though brave, would lead to any concessions on the part of the American military-industrial complex.After some consideration, Grady realized, “Oh, our friends are not asking the U.S. government to do anything. They’re doing it themselves.”Two years later, Grady joined McAlister and five others in penetrating the Griffiss Air Force Base in New York in order to gain access to a B-52 bomber, which were once outfitted to carry nuclear payloads that could be dropped onto the former Soviet Union. Base security did notappearuntil an hour after the activists started beating on the hanger doors, which incidentally were unlocked.“In 1983, when we hammered on the B-52 bomber and related parts, that plane was actually frozen for evidence for five months,” Grady said. “That is one of the few moments where nuclear weapons with these actions actually were disarmed. I’m not sure that too many efforts could claim that at that moment.”The grassroots movement against nuclear weapons in the U.S. reached a peak in 1982 when an estimated one million peopleconvergedin New York City for a massive demonstration. Grady remembered the thrill of being a part of the historic protest, which stands in stark contrast to the minority status that anti-nuclearism maintains today.“People were very much aware at that time of the danger of nuclear weapons,” Grady said. “Nowadays, very few people know about it and very few people are organizing around it.”The dearth of activism against nuclear weapons in the U.S. coincides with a new nuclear arms race as measures designed to mitigate nuclear proliferation that took decades to stitch together are being dismantled piece-by-piece.The world is currently just 100 seconds away from global destruction, according to the Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 as a way to remind people about the threat of nuclear annihilation.Here in the U.S., a new nuclear threat, one potentially more cataclysmic than the first, is currently underway. And not unlike the nuclear submarines that pass innocuously through the waters of Kings Bay in Georgia, it is happening right under the noses of the American public.“What has happened is the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of a single focused enemy with a peer competitor in the nuclear field,” Jessica T. Matthews toldShadowproof. Matthews is the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Older people remember getting under their desks for nuclear drills when they were in elementary school and putting their coats over their heads. Growing up in the era of above-ground nuclear testing all the time. All that went away with the end of the Cold War and I think it seemed as though the threat of nuclear conflict went with it.”The United States ushered in the nuclear age in 1945 and despite deepening wealth inequality and skyrocketing unemployment resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to spend billions of dollars to maintain its nuclear hegemony over the rest of the world. This new nuclear arms race is a reminder of how even in an era marked by entrenched partisan divisiveness, Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain united on maintaining America’s nuclear supremacy regardless of the financial, environmental or human costs.In 2001, Republican President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, an arms control agreement dating back to the 1970s. President Obama, a Democrat, secured passage of the New START treaty limiting the number of nuclear weapons but only after he struck a deal with Congress to spend $100 billion to refit American nuclear facilities and labs. That plan has now turned into an across-the-board modernization of the country’s nuclear apparatus, including the Trident II D5 nuclear missiles that are housed at the Kings Bay naval base, currently priced at $1.7 trillion, Matthews said.More than any other president, Trump seemed bent on turning the clock back to the 1950s when the country maintained more than 30,000 nuclear warheads and bombs in its stockpile, compared to roughly5,800weapons today. In May, Trump administration officialssignalledtheir interest in breaking the 28-year moratorium on nuclear testing to get China and Russia to agree to arms limitations under the New START treaty, whichexpiresin 2021.President-elect Joe Biden will likely extend the treaty but the result of all these infractions upon our already threadbare nuclear safety net amount to a running leap into a second nuclear arms race that is expected to continue regardless of who sits in the White House.“It’s a train that’s in motion and it’s going to be very hard to slow it down or redirect it,” Matthews warned.So hard that barring any unforeseen conflicts that might actually bring us closer to the brink of nuclear war, Matthews is dubious that Plowshares actions and other grassroots organizing will be enough on their own to force the issue into the national discourse.“I think it’s a really hard time for that to happen,” Matthews said. “If there were a confluence of events…if the [Trump] administration decided to test [nuclear weapons] and then if Korea got hot, and if several things happened at once, I can imagine it. But I just don’t think this is an issue whose time has come for public attention.”Calls to drop the charges against members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven elicited support from figures like Daniel Ellsberg, whistleblower and longtime anti-nuclear activist, along with religious leaders, including Reverend William J. Barber of the revived Poor People’s Campaign and former archbishop Desmond Tutu.Though he has not publicly commented on the legal fate of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, Pope Francis hasembracedthe Catholic peace activists’ once radical demand for the abolishment of nuclear weapons.“There is an urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons,” Pope Francistoldthe United Nations in 2015, “in full application of the non-proliferation treaty, in letter and spirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.”Media coverage, meanwhile, has failed to keep pace. News about the Catholic pacifists’ bold act of nonviolent civil disobedience at Kings Bay and their subsequent trial appears predominantly in progressive or religious publications like theNational Catholic Reporter. Mainstream outlets, including those in Atlanta and nearby Jacksonville, Florida, have steered clear of the Plowshares activists.The lack of coverage has prompted some Plowshares supporters to conclude the seven activists have become the victims of a media blackout.Journalist Jeremy Scahill recently gave voice to that concern following the recent sentencing of Kelley and O’Neill. Speaking in October onDemocracy Now!, Scahillslammedthe press’ refusal to cover the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven.“These Catholic peace activists, during the Trump administration, tried to confront that nuclear threat, and there was a total media blackout on the action that they did,” Scahill said. “And, you know, if we lived in a just society, the Kings Bay Plowshares activists’ trial would have been reported on as one of the most brave confrontations of the most dangerous aspect of this government, and particularly this administration.”O’Neill pointed to a 2019 hearing for the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven attended by the actor and Catholic activistMartin Sheen. Only one reporter from a local newspaper showed up to document Sheen’s public show of support.Rather than a concerted effort by the media to suppress the activists, O’Neill fears that the lack of press coverage is instead a reflection of how complacent Americans have become after 75 years of living on hair-trigger alert. In the absence of sustained grassroots mobilization aimed at keeping the issue of nuclear abolition in the spotlight, O’Neill imagines news editors and journalists view the Plowshares activists as if they are political outliers or relics of a bygone era, with little incentive to cover them.“The media is not blacking us out,” said O’Neill. “They just made a conscious decision to say we’re not worthy of coverage. It just says something about how relaxed people are about being under the shadow of the nuclear arms race.”The deadly coronavirus pandemic compounds what is sure to be an already arduous prison sentence, posing an additional threat for members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, all of whom are more susceptible to COVID-19 since they are over the age of 60.In October, United States District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood sentenced O’Neill to 14 months in prison. Since he lives at a Catholic worker house in Garner, North Carolina, O’Neill toldShadowproofthat he preferred to serve out his sentence close to home at the nearby federal prison in Butner even though it has become a hotspot for coronavirus infections. More people at Butner havediedfrom COVID-19–26 prisoners and one staff member–than at any other federal federal correctional institution.Instead, O’Neill was ordered to report to the Elkton Federal Prison in Ohio. The facility was at the center of a COVID-19outbreakthat was so bad with one in four prisoners infected that it drew legal action from the ACLU. So far, nine prisoners havediedfrom the coronavirus. O’Neill said he is appealing the order but clearly both options pose a risk to his health.When asked about whether the Kings Bay action was worth losing his life over, O’Neill echoed the words of past Plowshares activists who saw a greater danger–in this case, the death of all living things–in not speaking out.“There are people in the world working to change the direction of the world, to move the world away from nuclearism and the development of more nuclear weapons and we’re very much in the minority right now,” O’Neill said. “But nonetheless, we’re not acting in vain.”“If we hadn’t gone to Kings Bay, people living in those communities there would never have given any thought to Kings Bay as being anything more than an employer, an economic boost. I think people now have to sort of think about things in a different light.”It is reasonable to think that at nearly 81 years old, McAlister’s 17-month stretch for breaking into the naval submarine base at Kings Bay will be her last time behind bars for nonviolent civil disobedience. But McAlister knows just as well as anyone else that nuclear annihilation is not reasonable and she stopped short at saying definitively whether Kings Bay would be her last Plowshares action.McAlister acknowledged her concern that fewer people are willing to join the Plowshares movement than they were 40 years ago at the height of anti-nuclearism. But just as the threat of nuclear war has not subsided since the end of the Cold War, McCalister is hopeful that people of conscience will continue to fight for a nuclear-free world.A former nun, McAlister says she never would have dared to undertake the risks that Plowshares activists must take if it weren’t for her faith in God. She firmly believes that it was God performing “minor miracles” that facilitated the entry of dozens of Plowshares activists into highly secured nuclear facilities and enabled them to put their hands directly onto the doomsday machine.“These are the most deadly weapons in the world,” said McAlister. “How is it possible for somebody like me to walk right in and be right next to them and pour blood on them? Use a hammer on them? But I’ve done it a number of times and so have some of my friends and my husband.”“And please, God, others will continue to do it,” she said.One person who answered the call was Martha Hennessy. The 2018 infiltration of the Kings Bay naval base was her first Plowshares action, which makes her an anomaly among the other activists.Hennessy, though, is no stranger to the movement. In fact, she is the granddaughter of Dorothy Day, who was one of the principal driving forces behind the creation of the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930s. Growing up, Hennessy witnessed firsthand the evolution of the Plowshares movement under the guidance of Catholic peace activists like McAlister and the Berrigan brothers who dared to take a stand against the threat of nuclear armageddon even in the face of assured retribution from the federal government.Her decision to infiltrate the Kings Bay naval base in a defiant act of civil disobedience against the world’s most powerful military came only after months of prayerful discernment, a kind of internal examination about what risks she was willing to take on behalf of her religious beliefs and moral convictions.The integrity of the Plowshares movement gave Hennessy the strength to take part in the Kings Bay action, a cohort that she believes will help her survive her 10-month prison sentence.“You know, walking onto a military base was not the first thing I wanted to do in this resistance work for nuclear abolition,” recalled Hennessy. “But the power of such an act can speak for itself and we had to bring the body of Christ there to the base.”“It’s our obligation to speak out,” she proclaimed."
Legislature slashes operating funds to UH by 10% over next 2 years,0.0,41.33,https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2021/05/06/legislature-slashes-operating-funds-uh-by-roughly-over-next-years/,https://adfontesmedia.com/hawaii-news-now-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,22,"HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Lawmakers slashed the University of Hawaii’s general fund appropriations budget by about 10% in the legislative session that just ended, diverting more than $90 million over the next two years away from UH programming.The bulk of the cut is to the UH-Manoa, the institution’s flagship campus, which saw a reduction of $35.6 million to its fiscal year 2022 general funds operation budget and a $30 million cut in 2023.In a post on the university’s website, UH Chief Financial Officer Kalbert Young wrote the Legislature’s “end product ... does not reflect a balanced or thoughtful approach to the overall UH budget.”“As is clearly evident, the budget passed by the Legislature demonstrates an approach that disproportionately reduces funding to the university,” Young wrote.“UH Manoa, by far, is the most severely impacted in the budget since it will have the largest amount of general funding reduction as well as the largest percentage reduction than any other campus.”Young said the Board of Regents had submitted a budget request seeking an additional $4.7 million. The additional funding was to go to athletics and the Hawaii Promise Program.The UH fared a bit better in its capital fund improvement requests.Oddly, Young said the Legislature set aside $42.5 million for a “research and education center” affiliated with UH community colleges ― even though that wasn’t requested by the Board of Regents.“It is unclear what that project entails,” Young said.Copyright 2021 Hawaii News Now.

Black People Are 3 Times More Likely to Experience Pulse Oximeter Errors,-4.0,46.67,https://heavy.com/news/black-people-pulse-oximeter-errors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,21,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have purchased small devices calledpulse oximetersfor use in their home – based on well-intentioned recommendations from health care providers and the media. Pulse oximeters are devices, usually placed on a person’s finger, used to noninvasively measure oxygen levels in the blood. Clinics and hospitals, for example, use them regularly to screen newborns for heart defects after birth.Yet pulse oximeter measurements are imperfect, particularly for Black patients. Our recent paper demonstrated that Black patients werethree times more likelythan white patients to have low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximeters. That could translate into as many as 1 in 10 inaccurate readings among Blacks.We areICUphysiciansandinternistswith expertise in health care research and policy. Our findings were guided by our personal experiences engaging with communities of color during the pandemic and seeing firsthand how easy it is for racial bias to affect health care.Low blood oxygen levels are harmful to patients and can indicate that they are seriously ill. Clinicians frequently use pulse oximetry measurements to decide whether a patient should receive oxygen therapy and how much oxygen a patient should receive. Health care workers may also use this information when deciding what type of care a patient needs, such as admission to a hospital, transfer to an intensive care unit or need for a ventilator.Pulse oximeters came on the market in the late 1970s and seemed to meet the need for an accurate measure of oxygen levels.Pulse oximetersuse light that passes through the skin to measure oxygen levels. Blood with higher oxygen levels absorbs light differently than blood with lower oxygen levels. However, anything that slows the passage of this light, like nail polish or skin tone, can cause inaccuracies. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic we started to recognize that these measurements seemed to be inaccurate for Black patients. Our study confirmed those suspicions, for example finding that sometimes when a pulse oximeter read 94%, the actual blood level of oxygen was much lower.A normal oxygen saturation is above 92%. Oxygen therapy is typically started when oxygen levels are consistently below 89%. In our study, we identified patients who had normal oxygen levels by pulse oximetry (between 92% and 96%) but low oxygen levels by blood oxygen testing (less than 89%).If low oxygen levels in Black patients are missed because of inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, Black patients may be less likely to receive appropriate oxygen therapy or other medical care when they need it. Some people with COVID-19 infection were encouraged to purchase pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels at home as a tool to decide whether hospitalization was needed. These inexpensive home pulse oximetersmay be even less accuratethan the hospital pulse oximeters used in our study.The extent to which biased pulse oximetersmay have delayed appropriate treatmentfor Black patients is unknown. It is also unclear just how these inaccuracies might affect other medical conditions whereracial disparities in medical carehave been previously identified.Thefirst pulse oximeterwas developed in 1974. However, because early designers did not use a diverse group of test subjects, sources of error, like skin tone, were underrecognized. Today’s pulse oximeters might be better than the ones from the 1970s – the FDA requires all medical technology to be tested on a diverse population of patients, based on age, gender and skin tone. However, the agency defines skin tone diversity by havingat least two “darkly pigmented” individualsin the entire testing sample. Our study shows today’s pulse oximeters are still not good enough and that the agency’s guidelines for diverse testing remain insufficient.A study fromthe late 1980sbegan to show that pulse oximeters might be inaccurate based on skin tone, and aseriesofpublicationsin the 1990s seemed to confirm these findings. Yet 40 years later, these findings have not been widely publicized, were not thoroughly investigated with additional clinical studies and are not routinely a part of medical school curricula at this time.Pulse oximetry will remain an important tool for clinicians, and our findings highlight the need to consider pulse oximetry data in the context of other information related to the patient.However, there are no other straightforward and noninvasive ways to estimate oxygen levels. Feeling short of breathpoorly correlateswith oxygen levels; skin findings, such ascyanosis, may be more difficult to identify in individuals with darker skin tones; and using other locations of the body to measure oxygen levels noninvasively (like the ear) may not produce more accurate results than the finger.An alternative strategy might be to perform more invasive measurements of oxygen level, such as sampling arterial blood. However, arterial blood draws are painful andcan lead to complications. They are also inconvenient and require specialized training. Requiring arterial blood for accurate measurements in Black patients but not white patients simply propagates a different form of racial bias.Medical technology developers should increase the number and diversity of test subjects, with device performance compared across groups to ensure the equity of their accuracy. In addition, prior testing was conducted only among healthy subjects, and our study suggests inaccuracies may be more prominent as oxygen levels decrease. Diversity, in this case, should include a range of patients, based on age, gender, skin tone, and disability.Our recent conversations with device manufacturers suggest that engineering solutions may already be available. However, once new technologies are available, replacing legacy pulse oximeters with more accurate devices will be difficult, given the ubiquity of existing pulse oximeters and the expense associated with purchasing new devices. Health care providers and patient advocacy groups will need to demand updated technology when it becomes available. Recognizing this now may lead to improvements in medical technology, better medical care for Black patients, and greater recognition ofstructural racism within medicine.[Research into coronavirus and other news from scienceSubscribe to The Conversation’s new science newsletter.]By Thomas Valley, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan;Michael Sjoding, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan Medical School, andSusan Dorr Goold, Professor of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy,University of Michigan Medical SchoolThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

The Polls Showed Democrats Poised to Reclaim the Senate. Then Came Election Day.,-9.25,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05112020/senate-republicans-majority-over-democrats-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,21,"The dreams of climate-concerned Americans who had hoped voters would hand Democrats control of the Senate—along with the power to act on a climate agenda—were all but dashed in the election, despite bitterly fought campaigns from Maine to Arizona.Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up three seats.Former astronautMark Kellyin Arizona and former Colorado Gov.John Hickenlooperin Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like that script might play out. But then key Republican incumbents held off their Democratic challengers—Sens.Joni Ernstin Iowa,Lindsey Grahamin South Carolina,Susan Collinsin Maine, and most likelyThom Tillisin North Carolina andDan Sullivanin Alaska.We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.While there were still technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple of seats, they appeared late Wednesday to be long shots at best, leaving some climate activists distraught.“I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,” said Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There is so much work to do.”There was a lot at stake for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfire seasons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires this summer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy.Democrats will still control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change.Expertshave saidthat in a Republican-controlled Senate, there still could be some less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have not so far put forward any comprehensive climate plans.“None of the Republican programs we have seen would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given the science around climate change,” said David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University.Scientistshave saidthat to keep global temperatures from rising beyond acceptable limits, there’s a global need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Perhaps the most telling upset that never happened was in Kentucky, where Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellkept his job, despite a fossil fuels agenda, his defense of Trump’s anti-science and deregulatory policies and no plan for climate change. McConnell, 78, was rewarded with a seventh term by soundly defeating Democrat Amy McGrath, despite her $80 million warchest.“I am glad they decided our arguments were better than hers,” he said Wednesday.Anticipating the Senate race outcomes would go Republicans’ way, he said, “If my math is correct, I will still be the offensive coordinator.”The current Republican majority is 53. For Democrats to secure a 51-vote majority, they would have needed a net gain of three Republican seats plus a tie-breaking vote by a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, assuming a win by former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. If President Trump wins, the Democrats would need to net four seats previously held by Republicans.But, by Wednesday evening, Democrats watched nearly all their hopes slip away. Sen. David Perdue’s continued to comfortably lead DemocraticchallengerJon Ossoff with 50.3 percent of the vote as the final ballots were being counted in Georgia, thus potentially avoiding a Jan. 5 runoff election. In the race for Georgia’s other Senate seat, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock led a crowded field in a special election and will face incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a Jan. 5 runoff, since neither collected more than 50 percent of the vote. Loeffler was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to fill the seat vacated late last year by Johnny Isakson.Warnock, a vocal environmental and climate justice advocate, received considerably fewer votes than Loeffler and her main challenger, Republican Rep. Doug Collins, illustrating the challenge Warnock will face in January.The widely respected Cook Political Report said Democrats’ “razor-thin hopes” of regaining control of the Senate would hinge on Georgia runoffs in January if the Perdue-Ossoff race also requires a runoff—and then Democrats would have to defeat both GOP incumbents, Perdue and Loeffler.Going into Tuesday’s election, climate voters revelled in the likelihood that a national climate policy might finally be on the near horizon as pollsters projected that Democrats had a good chance of winning the Senate majority and positioning Congress to reduce carbon emissions and advance clean energy.Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website had given Democrats a 78 percent chance of flipping the Senate. And the Cook Report had concluded that Democrats were the clear favorites to take back the Senate with just days to go until Election Day.But on Wednesday, the Cook report had a new analysis.It called the outlook for Warnock “ominous” in the runoff, while noting the Democrats’ failures in “multiple avenues of flipping the Senate” and that, “in all likelihood,” Republicans would hold on. “In races that Democrats were bullish on and even Republicans sounded very wary about holding in the final days, everything came up red.”Republicans went on a roll.In Iowa, Ernst, who hashada significant relationship with Big Oil, survived an embarrassing moment during a debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, where Ernst failed to know the break-even price of soybeans.In Maine, Collins, who has the strongest voting record on climate among Senate Republicans, won a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon in what the Portland Press Heralddescribedas “an intensely negative contest.”Big environmental groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters that hadabandonedCollins for Gideon now find themselves in the position of having to rebuild their bridges with her.Republicans also took back the Senate seat in Alabama held by Doug Jones, with a victory by a former football coach, Tommy Tuberville, whoarguedthat only God can control the climate.And one of most closely watched and expensive Senate races was inSouth Carolina, where Graham, a self-styled climate champion with little to show for his rhetoric, defeated a well-funded Jaime Harrison, a Democrat who had set fundraising records.“To those who have been following this race, I hope you got the message,” Graham said during his victory speech. “If you don’t get this message, it’s hopeless. The message I got: people like what I am doing and I am going to keep doing it. I am going back to the Senate with a purpose.”Part of that purpose, he said, was to “do everything I can to stop the radical agenda coming from Nancy Pelosi’s House.”Coming into the race, most scenarios for Democrats taking back the Senate started with Hickenlooper beating Sen. Cory Gardner and Kelly, a retired astronaut married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, defeating Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona.They were able to do that.During his campaign this year, Hickenlooper—who some progressives had dubbed “Frackenlooper”—managed to transform his reputation as a fossil fuel-industry supporter into a candidate pledging to fight climate change.  Gardner had sought to dodge the anti-climate label applied to the GOP.“From start to finish, the race for the Senate in Colorado has been about public lands and addressing climate change,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the national environment-focused political action committee, the League of Conservation Voters.Hickenlooper was also endorsed by the Protect Our Winters Action Fund, a climate action group led by outdoor athletes, which noted that “Colorado’s winter sports tourism economy is in harm’s way due to climate change.” The fund also backed Kelly, noting that he “has spoken favorably of a carbon tax.”In Arizona, Kelly told voters during the campaign how his views on climate and the environment were shaped by his experiences in space. He pledged to use science and data as tools to help tackle climate change and facilitate Arizona’s transition to renewable energy.In Montana, a tight race went to incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, who fought off a challenge by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock in an intense battle that left many Montanans eager for the campaign season to end.In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said national political pundits and pollsters that had forecast a good night for Democrats got it wrong once again in the race between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a charismatic Black candidate and former Agriculture Secretary.“We are going to elect someone who is going back to Washington and still be in the majority,” Reeves said at a victory celebration for Hyde-Smith, who easily defeated Espy by 13 percentage points.“It was the Second Amendment that was on the ballot tonight,” said Hyde-Smith, who had tied her fortunes to Trump’s agenda and supported production of Mississippi’s and the nation’s energy resources, including biofuels. “It was socialism that was on the ballot.”James Bruggers covers the U.S. Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

Adam Schiff’s Secret Subpoenas,16.67,32.0,https://www.judicialwatch.org/deep-dive/schiff-subponeas/,https://adfontesmedia.com/judicial-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,21,"Judicial Watch, Inc. is a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation, which promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law.Judicial Watch, Inc. is a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation, which promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law.“They do whatever they want, take whatever documents they want from you … maybe they can start wiretapping you, who knows?”As Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton discussed Friday, Judicial Watch is fighting to overturn a recent court ruling which alleges the House of Representatives enjoys “absolute immunity from inquiries about the subpoenas” they ordered on Rudy Giuliani, Rep. Devin Nunes, and a number of other prominent conservatives. As Fitton explained, Rep. Adam Schiff committed “a radical abuse of the impeachment power [when] he issued secret subpoenas.” The attorney representing Rep. Schiff, who Fitton argues obtained the records by trampling on the Fourth Amendment rights of several U.S. citizens, recently argued that the court cannot be given the subpoenas due to possible privacy rights infringements. The Judge responded by stating:“Well, I do think it’s, if not ironic, noteworthy that one of the interests you’ve just put forward is the invasion of privacy when the whole claim of Judicial Watch is that this Committee invaded the privacy of private citizens in the first place.”As Fitton observed, “the Pelosi/Schiff House asserts it has an unlimited government surveillance power and an unlimited ability to invade the privacy of any American with zero accountability and transparency.” “Those Fourth Amendment protections you have against unlawful search and seizure… Congress thinks they don’t apply to them.” Fitton concluded by stating:“The courts should reject Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi’s corrupt cover-up of the unconstitutional subpoenas that abused the civil rights of then-President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, journalists and other American citizens.”Judicial Watch’s Senior Attorney, James Peterson, is fighting in the U.S. Court of Appeals – District of Columbia Circuit to challenge what Fitton describes as a “disgusting abuse of power.” If you support safeguarding your constitutional rights against unlawful secret subpoenas, support Judicial Watch’s work today.© 2019 Judicial Watch, Inc.Judicial Watch is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

Why Nathan Cartagena Teaches Critical Race Theory to Evangelicals,-15.0,34.33,https://sojo.net/articles/why-nathan-cartagena-teaches-critical-race-theory-evangelicals,https://adfontesmedia.com/sojourners-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-28,21,"Last November, the presidents of six Southern Baptist seminaries released astatementdeclaring that critical race theory was “incompatible” with the central statement of faith in the SBC. This came a few months after President Donald Trump attemptedto bancritical race theory from federal anti-racism training; Republicans in state legislatures are now using similar language to try andbancritical race theory from state education systems.For Nathan Cartagena, a critical race theorist and assistant professor of philosophy at Wheaton College, conservative Christians’ growing belief that CRT is a threat to the gospel poses a pedagogical challenge: How do you teach students to understand an idea that they’ve been told is fundamentally anti-Christian?Cartagenadefinescritical race theory as “a legal movement aimed at understanding, resisting, and remediating how U.S. law and legal institutions such as law schools have fostered and perpetuated racism and white supremacy,” but he alsoemphasizesthat CRT now operates in “disciplines and domains that are beyond law or legal studies” and, as a whole, resists one-sentence definitions.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.When I interviewed at Wheaton the very first time, my guest lecture was on an essay about critical race theory by Tommy J. Curry. I wanted to see: Is this a place that would welcome such reflection? I received a warm welcome from the students, my department, etc., so I thought “OK, this is a place where I can do this.” I taught a reading group my first year at Wheaton that involved one of the important texts in the critical race theory movement,Faces at the Bottom of the Wellby Derrick Bell. The following year I asked if I could teach a half-semester class on critical race theory — I got a full thumbs up.As I was preparing to teach that class, I felt prompted, by the Spirit, that the church could use a book on critical race theory. This was about two summers ago, so CRT isnota hot-button topic at this point. But I thought the church could really use a deeper reflection on how the law has promoted white supremacy in distinctive ways against racialized groups, and how that’s connected to the church’s role in the expansion of European empires. I thought about how cool it would be to have resources to answer this question: What does sanctification look like in a racialized world? Paul doesn’t inhabit a racialized world, Jesus doesn’t inhabit a racialized world. After the 15th century, people are inhabiting a racialized world. Critical race theory can give us a lot of resources to answer such questions. I got the contract last April.Oh yes. When I first started teaching, most people had never heard of critical race theory, and they certainly weren’t familiar with an acronym. Now, the teaching is harder. People are carrying a whole host of ideas about CRT, the overwhelming majority of which are completely false. They’re coming with these ideas from people they trust — from people who have, perhaps, taught them accurate things and helped them to love Jesus in all sorts of important ways. These same people are saying “CRT is of the devil,” “CRT is nothing but cultural Marxism,” etc. Interacting with those students is completely different than what it would have been over a year ago. One of the reasons the challenges are greater is that people have made certain claims about the compatibility of CRT with [uses air quotes] the gospel. As a teacher who loves my students, I’m trying to figure out: What are these ideas? Where did they get them from? Because I try to offer pedagogy that’s person-specific. If you think that endorsing any claim a critical race theorist makes may well jeopardize your standing as a Christian, the stakes are so high it’s hard to have a discussion about these things.When I was first teaching on CRT, I was very explicit about when something was a CRT essay or quote. Now, one of the things I do is I present CRT literature without telling students that it’s CRT literature. Then I ask them what they think about it. The overwhelming response from the students is: “Wow, this essay is so rigorously researched, so clear, and so well-argued. Even if I don’t agree with every claim, I learned so much,” etc. Then, after they’ve sung a little praise song, [laughs] I tell them they’ve read a piece by a critical race theorist. You can see a look of disillusionment set in — this part gets really hard, if I’m honest. On the one hand, it’s a healthy destabilization. You’ve gotta remember that a lot of my students are racialized white folks. If they’re not now going to say that everything they just said was false, how do they reckon with believing there are things to learn from critical race theorists while knowing that the stakes, in some of these communities they’ve been a part of, are so high that to say such is to find themselves ostracized?This is one of the really important challenges I face as a teacher in historically white evangelical spaces: How do I remove false ideas and help people to grow in justice, mercy, and understanding regarding CRTandregarding communities that they’ve come from where they’ve slandered CRT folks? It's so much harder than it was a year ago because the stakes are so high. How do you do the good, anti-hegemonic work that’s filled with love of neighbor while also knowing that, as you help to move people out of what I call the “Platonic racialized cave,” it’s gonna hurt.I prefer to go with the following metaphor that you get fromBoethius and Aquinas. They talk about turning philosophical water into theological wine. That would mean that something like CRT, the movement, is going to be nourishing and life-giving in a way that water is. Then, I want to fit [CRT] in with certain ideas about being made in the image of God, common grace, and general revelation. As we talk about “theological wine,” we are seeing this nourishing “water” as now being in contact with Christ. It’s Christ, a member of the Trinity, that’s taking this up and helping us to see how we can view God’s creation better. CRT scholars are helping us to think through how to move in more decolonial ways and address the church’s egregious history.If we’re in a racialized world, and we get dog-whistle politics, Southern strategies, and so forth from the GOP, part of what it means to be an agent that’s salt and light in that world is recognizing, in a race-conscious way, all of these very subtle — and sometimes, of course, overt — modes of racism.Then I think about the Spirit as an agent of godly race consciousness. I’m thinking in distinctively trinitarian terms about how the Spirit is actually an agent of race-conscious liberation. The Spirit is going to help us see these racialized structures.To me, that’s an importantly different posture [than “eat the meat and spit out the bones”]. I’m coming with the expectation that I have things to learn from CRT scholars, that they’re going to say things that are gonna help me live a good life. Then, I prayerfully consider: How can I draw from the Christian tradition and understand these things in a more distinctively Christian register?The idea that there are legitimizing myths that maintain the evil status quo is ancient. You see that, for example, in the discussions of the northern and southern kingdoms in 1 and 2 Kings. You’re gonna see this in the book of Amos where you’re gonna get two different priesthoods. [In the book of Jeremiah] you’ve got people saying “peace, peace, everything’s fine,” and Jeremiah is like “No, not everything’s fine!” There are those narratives that were designed to blind people to the realities around them.I think for some Christians, the idea that there are narratives designed to blind initially sounds crazy, especially if they are from historically white spaces and socialization patterns. [But] if you’re reading the Old Testament or the New Testament, you see legitimizing myths.One of the key questions to ask is: What are the myths and the discourses that enable the kinds of unjust material conditions that we see throughout the centuries?There are different myths, discourses, and ideas at different times used to legitimize different things. For the most part, explicit promotions of a holistic vision of white supremacy start to decline around 1965. Before that, you get all sorts of discourses that are explicit about white supremacy; there are many different conceptions of whiteness — sometimes people are defending Anglo-Saxon white supremacy, sometimes they’re defending Teutonic or Aryan white supremacy, etc. — but it’s explicit. You get somebody like Rudyard Kipling talking about “the white man’s burden.” For them, this was all benevolent racism: “Oh these poor weaker races, they really need us.” Often, that discourse of taking up the white man’s burden, caring for these lesser races, [meant] “Oh the white race is completely superior, if we’re going to be godly we need to love these inferior races, that’s what it is to love our neighbor.” Now, [after 1965] did you still get presentations of superior and inferior cultures and races? Yes. But they’re not as ubiquitous and they’re importantly different from what you got before.Critical race theorists, especially people like Derrick Bell, situate themselves in traditions tied to their communities. So Bell is pretty clearly working out of something like what Cedric Robinson will call the Black radical tradition. Bell is drawing heavily from people like [W.E.B.] Du Bois and Fannie Lou Hamer. As he’s drawing from these groups, he’s seeing how people who were on the underside of empire and racial apartheid understood the socieities they were a part of. They understood the Christian theologies that were operating to justify racial apartheid, and, on the other hand, challenge racial apartheid. They’re able to see those things from a particular perspective and they develop practices, discourses, and narratives that speak from their perspective on the modes of injustice that they are seeing. They see it because of how they are culturally, historically, and linguistically situated. Bell is saying, “I’m going to work from such traditions and use them to evaluate contemporary settings.” Because he does that, he gives voice to a tradition he inherits and he extends it to new realities.It’s important to see that somebody like Delgado, Crenshaw, Bell, or Robert A. Williams is not merely saying, “I myself had these experiences.” When they talk about thinking from a certain perspective, it’s not individualistic. Rather it’s: “I’m bringing the thoughts, voices, insights of — in Spanish we’d saymi gente—my people. And I’m evaluating the social conditions in light of these things.”There are many times in Bell’s writings where he’s going to be quoting past Negro spirituals to help evaluate what’s happening in the present. He’s trying to help offer a way of thinking, with the historic Black church, about present conditions. He’s talking about that kind of perspective and voice. In so many scholarships, that’s precisely the voice that gets ignored and set aside. It’s not the individual's voice, it’s the entire community's voice that gets set aside.Mi gente in Puerto Rico have been colonized [by the U.S.] since 1898. We have been speaking out against U.S. racism, racial apartheid, exploitation, and oppression from the beginning, even before we were colonized. Almost nobody on what we call “the mainland,” unless they’re Latino or Latina, knows anything about this history. This is what’s known as organized forgetting. It’s not just that individual perspectives are set aside, it’s whole communities, entire traditions, that we don’t know anything about.Richard Delgado and Richard A. Williams highlight how the founders and the framers of the Constitutiondrewextensively from the Iroquois and their conception of confederacy when thinking about the U.S. Constitution. This is welldocumented, but almost nobody knows this history. Not only do they not know this history, they know another history. “Oh, well Locke and Hobbes, they were the keys, those were the only people that somebody like Thomas Jefferson or Ben Franklin was listening to.” And it’s completely false. Not only do you get the contributions — the rich confederacies — that the Iroquois were championing ignored, while being appropriated, but then somebody like John Locke gets the credit. And John Locke is one of the most racist people against Indigenous folks.I really love both these questions. Some of these questions presume a kind of leisure that only comes with being in the middle, upper-middle class, or beyond. This is one of the reasons I try to have blogs for free, because I’m trying to limit the amount of economic barriers. Even if I give recommendations, who can afford them? Who’s gonna have access to a library that is gonna have subscriptions to journals? This is a serious problem and it’s one I think the church is failing to address, and certainly one that evangelicals broadly are failing to address.Now, speaking to those that the Lord has called to be teachers and preachers in the church: If you don’t know much about CRT, it is your task — to love your neighbors, to love your parish, to love those you’re teaching — to acknowledge you don’t know much about CRT. You’ve got to start there. And then you have to ask, given all that you have to do, if you’re gonna start learning because CRT is a hot-button issue. And who knows how long that’s going to last. So looking at all the responsibilities you have, if one of your tasks is to be able to provide some voice of justice and love to this discussion about CRT, then what are some of those introductory resources that you can get? But, and this is so important, just because you’ve read Delgado and Stefancic’s [Critical Race Theory: An Introduction]you arenotnow an expert on CRT. Yes, you’ve gained a little bit more understanding, but you must recognize that it is greatly limited. So you need to speak and act in light of that.Also, there are people in the church that are CRT scholars, like myself, who are happy to talk to people and congregations and provide you with insight. But, most of us, especially when we’re dealing with historically white institutions, are going to ask that you show us a commitment, through reading,beforewe come and talk with you. We’re not interested in being part of a racial theater where we get parachute-dropped in for one talk, because that doesn’t promote real change. Those of us who are serious CRT scholars, who think there are so many things to rejoice about over the movement and the insights, are trying to do that to promote health and wellbeing to the church and the common good. We want to talk about how to get spiritual formation that is race conscious and discipleship that is designed to resist and remediate forms of white supremacy, and all the modes of racism that are following that.Whatever churches are going to be doing, as it relates to CRT, must be situated in a broader commitment to resist white supremacy and racism in their various forms. If you’re not situating it in these broader things, then I fear that mostly what you’re going to end up doing is unhelpful.Mitchell Atencio is associate news editor, sojo.net.Got something to say about what you're reading?

Tucker Carlson Raises a Very Serious Alarm Bell About Ashli Babbitt's Murder and the Enemy Within,21.67,22.0,https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2021/06/16/tucker-carlson-raises-a-very-serious-alarm-bell-about-ashli-babbitts-murder-and-the-enemy-within-n397591,https://adfontesmedia.com/redstate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,21,"President Joe Biden was sworn in on January 20, but it’s January 6 that stands out in the minds of many that truly marks the beginning of the Biden era. Yes, Trump was still technically president but we’re still waiting on answers that we have yet to get about what happened that day. The Biden administration seems to have no interest in releasing information about it, but the more private entities look into the matter, the more oddities arise.One, in particular, is the murder of Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was part of the riot within the Capitol and was shot while unarmed. At the time of this writing, we still have no idea who it is that shot her or why he decided to fire on her in particular. It’s just one of the many questions the Biden administration is actively not giving us answers to.Aspreviously covered by Nick Arama, Fox News host Tucker Carlson had a very solid point to make about this fact and one that he’s actively being mocked for bringing up, which should worry you even more.Carlson began by discussing how the Biden administration has declared that the largest threat to America isn’t China, Russia, Iran, our porous southern border, or even leftist extremists attempting to defund the police and burn our neighborhoods down. No, they say that it’s white supremacist as said by Attorney General Merrick Garland.It’s a very nebulous term. Who are these white supremacist radicals? Why won’t the Biden administration name names? For some reason, the administration is withholding that information, but it’s likely that they don’t know either. What they do know is that it’s a good narrative crop to harvest thanks to the January 6 riot at the capitol, a riot the left continues totry to call an “insurrection.”With this event in place, they can now create white supremacist boogiemen that can take the form of any person they need it to, including you.It also allows them to come up with solutions that sound just as nebulous to the public but gives them the freedom to do whatever they want. “We must adopt a broader societal response to tackle the problem’s deeper roots,” said Garland somewhat ominously.As Carlson points out, this is a scary thought as it marks a change in the way the government treats its citizens, specifically ones that don’t agree with the administration. A government can arrest and imprison or even kill a citizen, like Babbitt with no accountability or explanation as Carlson points out:Who did shoot Ashli Babbitt? Why don’t we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That’s OK now? No, it’s not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protesters still in prison on trespassing charges, while so many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What’s the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call it scary. We’d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator.And speaking ofJanuary 6th, why are there still so many things, basic factual matters, we don’t know about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration hiding more than 10,000 hours of surveillance tape from the U.S. Capitol? What could possibly be the reason for that? Even as they call for more openness. We need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those tapes today, but they’re not. Why?#ThreadMust Watch Tucker Carlson Segment On Revolver News's Piece About January 6th: Unindicted Co-Conspirators In January 6th Cases Raise Disturbing Questions Of Federal Foreknowledgepic.twitter.com/wzxwsPU0dE— The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle)June 16, 2021Carlson goes on to make a much deeper point about the possible involvement of the FBI in the January 6 riot, which is another article, but for the moment, focusing on this one fact is something we as a country really need to do.Was Babbitt wrong to storm the Capitol? Sure. Did she deserve to die for it?If the footage of her shooting is any indication, then no. She was unarmed and while she was attempting to advance into the Capitol she could have easily been detained or pushed back by authorities as they had been doing in other places. Instead, she was shot, and regardless of the apparent reason, no matter how obvious, when an American is shot on American soil by American agents an investigation is warranted and answers need to be given to the American people.Why is the government withholding that info? Moreover, what makes them think they can withhold it? What gives them the gumption to believe they don’t owe us answers? Are we now living in a country where killing citizens is just something our government can do if they’re protesting at the wrong place and at the wrong time? Do they not feel like they need to justify it?Meanwhile, as Carlson points out, why do the people who tout their narrative get to roam free despite the damage they do all over the country, including the Capitol city? Why not point out the fact that there were many racial supremacists in those riots that lean toward the black race? Why can they burn, loot, and assault with slaps on the wrist?There are far more victims of the Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots than there were victims of the Capitol riot. Is the fear and inconvenience politicians experienced far more egregious than the actual loss of livelihood and even life that American citizens experienced at the hands of leftist riots? Why do we need to know the most minute detail about officers who shoot black people but get absolute obscurity when they shoot someone from a different crowd?It’s questions we need to ask and definitely questions the Biden administration needs to answer. In fact, they need to have these answers ready before we ask them. Yet, they’re not providing answers. What they’re providing are narratives and reasons to dissuade from asking questions. “This was a white supremacist riot” they repeat ad nauseum with little to no proof that it was, making questioning their narrative a defense of white supremacists. No nuance. No context.No questions.Our government has gotten too full of itself. It sees itself above us. It kills us and tells us questioning why makes us morally bankrupt. They think their own accountability isn’t necessary and if you vote them out they’ll spend ungodly amounts of time and resources attempting to correct your mistake with lies that allow for excuses for the impeachment of not only a man but also your vote.Our government is out of control. We’re losing the Republic we were advised to keep and the unanswered for murder of Ashli Babbitt is a strong indicator of how far we’ve fallen from it."
"The MAGA Riot in Washington Was the Natural Culmination of Donald Trump’s Influence — And, Just Maybe, Its Swan Song",-19.17,34.0,https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-uprising-in-washington-was-the-natural-culmination-of-donald-trumps-influence-and-just-maybe-its-swan-song-1234880114/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,21,"As corrosive and unsettling as the images of lawlessness from the U.S. Capitol have been today, there’s a twist of fate at their core so brutally ironic it can make your head spin. When the MAGA protesters, turning off their incendiary right-wing TV and Internet channels and getting off their couches, set out for Washington to foment what Joe Strummer 44 years ago called a “white riot,” they probably didn’t expect to be competing with the headline “Democrats Retake the U.S. Senate.” Because, of course, few observers wereexpectingthe game-changing referendum we got from the two Senate races in Georgia.The grand paradox is that you can link that seismic pair of Democratic wins directly toDonald Trump’s 10 weeks of drum-beating over his increasingly destructive fantasy of election fraud. Why? Because his descent into total demagogic loopiness revealed his nature so starkly it turned voters off? No. Because enough Republicans were actually brainwashed intobelievinghim. They didn’t bother to show up for a “rigged” election, thereby making Trump a victim of his own success.Since today’s insurrection was all about the issue of election fraud, the Georgia vote lent the events an irony of extraordinary bite. And what it indicated is that the whole “Biden stole the election!” issue, as perilous and scary as it has often seemed, has proved in the end to be the ultimate political orgy of hot air: a great deal of smoke without fire. The far-right uprising in Washington today was framed, in the minds of those who participated in it, as a Boston Tea Party/burning-of-the-Reichstag defining moment. But it felt more like the Last Gasp of Trumpism heard round the world.Which isn’t to deny that it was disturbing as hell: not just a mob scene, not just a protest laced with anarchy, but a messy, furious, middle-class-yob-posing-as-rebel attack on the rule of law. Yet even as the images of the MAGA faithful swarming the steps of the U.S. Capitol, or climbing its walls like a scruffy medieval horde in windbreakers, seared themselves into our national memory play with a shock value that was undeniable, in another way the protest, the riot, the violent tantrum — whatever you want to call it — had a weird “OK, let’s finally do this!” inevitability about it.The right wing in this country has been nattering on about “civil war” ever since that person at a Tea Party rally held up a sign that said “Keep the government’s hands off my Medicare!” Today’s mini high-concept rehearsal for civil war was the natural culmination of what Trump and his enablers have been egging his supporters on to do for some time — from Trump’s shout-out to the Proud Boys in the first presidential debate, when he asked them to “stand back and stand by,” to Rudy Giuliani’s exhortations to “trial by combat” this morning.Yet it wasn’t just Trump’s winking appeals to lawlessness that incited today’s chaotic action. The nature of those who live in an alternate reality is that there’s something essentiallyvirtualabout their entire belief system. No,Joe Bidendidn’t steal the election; the truth of his victory has been ratified by every state and dozens of courts. And no, the Democratic Party is not controlled by a cadre of elites who run a child sex-trafficking ring. But if you believe the former (which most Trump supporters do), or if you believe the latter (the central article of faith in QAnon, the online cult that’s now moved to the center of the Trump cult), you’re not living in the real world. And that means that politics has become, for you, a kind of media-fed shadow play, a dance of illusions dressed up as “news.” “Drain the swamp” isn’t a policy; it’s a fairy-tale metaphor posing as policy.When your political beliefs are mired in the world of illusion, there may be a special need to transform those beliefs into something physical and tangible, to prove — to yourself! — that you’re not just another Fox News simulation-game ditto-head but a badass who means what you say. An assault on the Capitol Building is a metaphor that can feel “real” because it looks just like something you saw in a Gerard Butler movie.Is the insurrection we saw today the beginning or the end of something? Those on the right will want to see it as the beginning. They reject the very foundation of the Biden presidency (that thing called voting, otherwise known as democracy), and so today was the day they stood up, climbed the walls, and declared that they stood for something else: power at any cost. But the flip side of power, or at least unseemly displays of it, is impotence. And that, sealed by the amazing Democratic triumph in Georgia, may wind up being the signature quality of the post-presidency of Donald Trump, and all those who’ll now follow him like lemmings off the cliff of his own ego.It’s fashionable to say that Trump will continue to wield extraordinary influence. But I would argue that the last two months, fueled by his pathological obsession with election fraud, have changed the Trump brand. For a long time, Trump supporters could at leastsaythat he stood for things like standing up to China or shouting down political correctness. But now Trump stands, first and foremost, for the idea that he’s “still really the president,” and that Joe Biden is occupying the office under false pretenses. That’s not just politically outrageous; it’s nuts. And that’s what the armchair anarchists in Washington stood for today: not simply trashing America but going through the looking glass to do it. They’ve left us with a lasting image of what it looks like when political action loses its mind."

And what they had to say was downright dark.The McCloskeys, a pair of personal injury lawyers who famously pointed guns at demonstrators in front of their palatial residence this summer, instantly went down as one of the most unusual appearances in the history of presidential conventions. They’re a pair no other president would have invited — but Trump.Mark and Patty McCloskey warned that in an America under a future President Joe Biden, other Americans would likewise be forced to defend themselves from protestors on their own front lawns.“No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America,” said Patty McCloskey.The couple beamed into the convention from their Renaissance palazzo-style mansion in St. Louis, seated on a couch in a room richly-paneled with dark wood, and spoke straight to the camera.They warned other Americans that they, too, may soon have to wave their own weapons at unruly gangs of demonstrators if Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.“What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods across this country,” Patty McCloskey said. “And that’s what we want to speak to you about tonight.”The pair also complained bitterly about getting slapped with criminal charges for felony unlawful use of a deadly weapon over the incident.“Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime,” Mark McCloskey said. “But you know who was? We were.”The couple went on to allege that Democrats want to “abolish the suburbs altogether,” by ending single-family home zoning.“The radicals are not content just marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress,” Mark McCloskey said. “They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden’s party.

Was the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Mother of All War Crimes?,10.25,34.5,https://www.fairobserver.com/more/international_security/hans-georg-hiroshima-nagasaki-dresden-hamburg-bombing-war-crimes-history-news-15001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,21,"We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks.This year marks the 75thanniversary of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is reason enough to mull over its meaning and its implications. In a recentarticlefor Fair Observer, Peter Isackson has made a strong case that the annihilation of the two Japanese cities by American bombers represents the “mother of all war crimes.” Given the long history of atrocities committed during times of war, I find this a rather bold statement that should not go unchallenged.The case for the defense rests on two claims. First, the demonstration of American nuclear capabilities heralded in a period of stability, which quite likely saved Western Europe’s nations from being overrun and conquered by the Soviet Union and subjected to its rule. Second, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are far from exceptional as war crimes go, if indeed the bombing of the two cities was a war crime at all.In my younger years, in a very different world, I served for a couple of years in the German air force. I never flew a plane. I spent most of my time on duty in a tower close to the border to what at the time was the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic (CSSR), a member of the Warsaw Pact and a satellite of the Soviet Union. We did electronic surveyance of the CSSR airspace, following Czech and Slovakian fighter planes as they performed their exercises as best as they could (more often than not they couldn’t, lacking basic motivation). It was a tedious job, boring as hell, particularly when the weather was bad and the pilots were grounded.Excitement, however, surged once a month, when we waited for the arrival of Russian long-range bombers. They took off from Minsk in what at the time was the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Their mission: attack the towers along the West German border with the CSSR and the German Democratic Republic. We saw them coming, small dots on our radar screens. When they were in front of our tower, there was a small red blip, a fleeting flicker, and we knew if this had beender Ernstfall— an actual real-life attack — we would all be dead, gone up in smoke in a small nuclear mushroom.At the time, we did not think much of what had just happened. It was part of a game, along the lines of MAD magazine’s “Spy vs Spy” — inane, a waste of time, and somehow not very real. It was not until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the regime in Prague and the unraveling of the Soviet empire that we learned that the game had been much more serious and potentially deadly than what we suspected. There were plans on the other side of the border to overrun West Germany, conquer Western Europe and subject it to Soviet rule. Among thescenarioswas a nuclear attack on Bonn, West Germany’s sleepy capital, designed to decapitate West Germany’s political elite.What prevented the Soviets and their toadies from carrying out their plans was not human compassion but a realist assessment of the distribution of military forces and the resolve of the Western allies to use them. At the time, this was called MAD — mutually assured destruction. It was grounded in the notion that any attack on the part of the Soviets would immediately trigger a full response of Western nuclear forces, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Soviet Union. The leadership in Moscow was fully aware of this logic. They did not like this “balance of terror,” but they ultimately submitted to its logic. Others, by the way, did not.Andrey Gromyko, the Soviet Union’s long-term foreign minister,claimsin his memoirs that at one time, Chinese leader Mao Zedong tried to get the Soviet Union to launch a nuclear attack on the United States, arguing that “his country could survive a nuclear war, even if it lost 300 million people, and finish off the capitalists with conventional weapons,” thus guaranteeing the triumph of communism. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets were not convinced and increasingly distanced themselves from Beijing.The logic of mutually assured destruction fundamentally altered the behavior of great powers, at least with respect to each other. It is to be hoped that the logic of the “balance of terror” is going to be enough to keep the US and China level-headed in the future, despite rapidly growing tensions between the two.Unfortunately enough, war crimes are the norm rather than the exception when it comes to armed conflict. The claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are ontologically different rests on a technological assumption. For some reason, nuclear weapons are fundamentally different from conventional ones. I am not sure what constitutes the basis of this assumption. Take the firebombings of the German cities ofDresden and Hamburgduring the Second World War, which cost the lives of tens of thousands of ordinary people — women, children, the elderly. Take the massacre ofBabi Yar, in Ukraine, where in two days nearly 34,000 Jews were killed by GermanEinstazgruppen. Or, going back further in history, take the death toll during the Thirty Years War, which cost the lives of half of the population of what is today Germany.Massacres of the most atrocious form are hardly an invention of the 20thcentury, as Goya’s renditions of the barbarities visited on his fellow countrymen during the war against the French between 1808 and 1814, depicted in most horrifying detail. This was a war against an enemy that invaded the country in the name of the Enlightenment and revolutionary fervor. Or, as the Germans would say,Und willst du nicht mein Bruder sein, so schlag ich dir den Schädel ein— If you don’t want to be my brother, I will smash your skull.For the victims of war crimes — more often than not civilians — it probably does not really matter how they were killed and why they were killed. It is quite understandable — human all too human, as Nietzsche would say — that horrendous deeds provoke retribution. The firebombing of German cities, the rape of German women caught be advancing Soviet armies — both are understandable given the atrocities committed by Germans during the war, in the name of Hitler and the Third Reich. Most Germans, or so most recent research suggests, were more than comfortable supporting a regime that guaranteed them a modicum of prosperity. Few asked where it came from.For that, Germans were punished in the most horrendous fashion. Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and Cologne and many other towns and cities went up in flames, leaving behind a landscape hardly different from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Hamburg was named Operation Gomorrah, after the Biblical city destroyed by “sulfur and fire” for its sins, and,accordingto historian Keith Lowe, was on completely different level than the German raids on Coventry and London, “comparable with what happened in Nagasaki.” It was a just retribution for the crimes committed in their name, a retribution for the tens of millions of victims who paid with their lives for Hitler’s ambitions to conquer the world.I would suggest that the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the retribution for the crimes committed by Japanese forces, in the name of racial superiority hardly different from Nazi ideology, against the peoples subjugated during the war. I have grave doubts that the victims of the Nanjing massacre or of the hundreds of young Asian “comfort women” pressed into sexual slavery by Japanese forces would consider the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a war crime, but rather than an act of just retribution for Japanese atrocities committed during the war.Whether or not the United States was justified in meting out redistribution is a different question. After all, given America’s self-declared status as a leading Christian nation, it should perhaps have heeded the words of the Bible exhorting believers not to take revenge, “but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’ says the Lord” (Romans 12:19). But then, Americans have a tendency to pay lip service to the scripture while doing the opposite in real life.The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was one of these turning points in history that define a whole epoch. It demonstrated, once and for all, humanity’s ability to destroy itself. Had Hitler been in a position to get hold of “the bomb,” he surely would have used it to obliterate London, Moscow, perhaps even New York. The same goes for Stalin, only this time it would have been Berlin that would have gone up in a mushroom. If the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime, it was nothing more than another episode in a long history of atrocities committed in the course of wars, not more, not less — an episode which reaffirms once again the sad reality that the veneer of civilization is merely skin deep.We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.For more than 10 years, Fair Observer has been free, fair and independent.

These South Florida hospitals will be among the first with the COVID-19 vaccine,0.0,51.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-coronavirus-covid-vaccine-within-weeks-20201118-7edsoqrye5ccpl2x3bci7ofsau-story.html#nt=pf-double%20chain~homepage-top-heads~recommender~automated~-dont-move-popular-rec~7EDSOQRYE5CCPL2X3BCI7OFSAU~5~5~11~11~art%20no,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,21,"The new COVID-19 vaccine — not yet approved for use — is on its way to two South Florida hospitals.Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami will be among the first five hospitals across Florida to store the vaccine while they wait for final approval to use it, officials said Wednesday. The vaccine stored by hospitals will be whichever the government approves first, possibly Pfizer’s.The other three hospitals are AdventHealth Orlando, formerly Florida Hospital Orlando, as well as Tampa General Hospital and UF Health Jacksonville. The first vaccines would start arriving in mid-December and another shipment is expected in January.The plan to start supplying hospitals with the vaccine comes as a ray of hope as Florida’s COVID-19 infectionscontinue to rise. The number of new cases has followed monthlong trends of increases across the state, based on health department data. Infectious disease specialists warn that a rate over 5% shows the virus is not under control, and all three major South Florida counties have exceeded that level this month.There will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups.“During the first phase, the vaccine will be available for front-line health care workers in hospitals, long-term-care staff and residents, and first responders,” said Lidia Amoretti, spokeswoman for Jackson Health System.The Florida hospitals were chosen by the state because they’re in heavily populated areas and have the ability to maintain ultra-cold storage. Memorial Regional Hospital has “purchased freezers capable of storing the vaccine at the appropriate temperature,” said hospital spokeswoman Kerting Baldwin.“We put in an order three weeks ago so we would have more capacity. We had a freezer but we ordered another larger one,” said Aurelio Fernandez, the president and chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System. “We saw that Pfizer was getting close so we ordered a larger freezer.”The U.S. will get 40 million vials and the governor told him Florida will get about 2 million of those, Fernandez said. The Pfizer vaccine requires two shots so that means about one million people will benefit from the Pfizer vaccine.Jared Moskowitz, the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday that the deployment of vaccines to hospitals is part of a plan that kicked off earlier this year.Months ago, the emergency management division started “preparing for the vaccine and procured millions of syringes and gauze so that we would have the supplies ready to help deploy the vaccine,” Moskowitz said. “We’re ready to deploy the vaccine. But while we wait to get it, people need to continue to wear masks and do mitigation measures.”Pfizer recently announcedthat an early analysis showed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius until shortly before it is injected.Pfizer said Wednesdaythat new test results show its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, is safe and also protects older people who are most at risk of dying.Another company,Moderna, said Mondayits COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective.The news from both companies puts them on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.One of the main goals of the federal government’sOperation Warp Speedwas to work with drug companies to manufacture the vaccines even before clinical trials were completed, so that millions of doses would be ready to go if a vaccine was successful.Lubby Navarro, director of legislative affairs for Memorial Healthcare System, whose flagship hospital is Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, told Broward mayors at a closed-door meeting Monday that they are seeing a “third wave of increases” of new coronavirus patients.Memorial is one of the five hospital locations in Florida designated to have the vaccine, and “we should be receiving it in a couple of weeks,” she told the mayors, according to records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will manage the distribution, Baldwin said.There is no word yet if the vaccines will be approved for children, or only adults.Staff Writer Cindy Krischer Goodman contributed to this report."
Glenn Beck CALLS OUT companies working with China as HORRIFIC new details emerge about concentration camps,19.67,31.33,https://www.glennbeck.com/blog/chinas-modern-day-concentration-camps,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-beck-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,21,"An upcoming book, ""The Chief Witness: Escape from China's Modern-Day Concentration Camps,"" details one woman's ""fight to survive"" inside one of China's 380 unspeakably horrific concentration camps.On ""The Glenn Beck Radio Program"" this week, Glenn asked why, after seeing horrors like this in history before, aren't we taking acting to stop this?

Supreme Court ruling on student speech could impact Pasco school rules,0.0,46.33,https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2021/06/23/supreme-court-ruling-on-student-speech-could-impact-pasco-school-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tampa-bay-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,21,"A U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding students’ First Amendment rights might change the way one Tampa Bay area school district deals with students’ off-campus comments.In an 8-1 ruling issued Wednesday, the court found that a Pennsylvania school district was wrong to suspend a student who made profane Snapchat statements about campus activities after she did not win a spot on the varsity cheer team.While schools have some room to discipline students for things said outside school, the majority wrote, they do not have blanket authority to control all student speech.“[T]he school itself has an interest in protecting a student’s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”Pasco County school district officials had been keeping close tabs on the case.A year ago, the School Board amended its student code of conduct to include potential punishments for students on teams or clubs who make derogatory online comments while wearing school gear.Pasco students could face suspension or dismissal from their team, and in some cases teams could forfeit games or events.Director of student services Melissa Musselwhite said the rule was meant to target instances such as students in uniform posting TikTok videos that depict violence or making negative statements about school — particularly if they cause campus disruptions.Given the nature of the Pennsylvania case, and the court’s support of the plaintiff’s right to make general criticisms on her own time, Musselwhite said the district would reexamine whether its stance could hold.“We’re definitely going to look at it,” she said. “We won’t take very long.”School Board chairman Allen Altman favored the restrictions placed on students in uniform, saying they should positively represent their schools.He added, though, that if the district rule does not meet legal muster, it would be fixed. The board updates policies at least twice a year to reflect changes in state and federal law, and court precedents.Officials in the Pinellas and Hillsborough county school districts said they did not have rules in their codes of conduct that go as far as Pasco.Their regulations over student speech adhere more closely to the areas the court found permissible to govern, such as dealing with bullying, cheating, threats and safety concerns.Pinellas, for instance, has a policy on First Amendment freedom of expression, which states in part, “when a student exercises that right, the student must do so in a responsible manner that does not cause a disruption of the school or a school activity. A principal may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on your exercise of First Amendment freedom of expression when there is evidence of imminent disruption of the school.”School Board member Nicole Carr, a former assistant principal, said she was pleased the court left intact schools’ ability to deal with threats and bullying that occurs off campus. She agreed that the Pennsylvania school district went too far in suspending the student because of her Snapchat tirade.“If someone expressed an opinion that doesn’t negatively impact an individual or constitute bullying, you should be able to articulate your opinion,” Carr said.The Pennsylvania case arose from posts made by Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time and just starting high school. One post pictured her and a friend with raised middle fingers and repeated use of a vulgarity to complain that she had been left off the varsity cheerleading squad.“F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything,” she wrote. Now 18, Levy recently finished her first year of college.Levy’s parents filed a federal lawsuit after the cheerleading coach suspended her from the junior varsity team for a year. Lower courts ruled in Levy’s favor, and she was reinstated.The school district appealed to the Supreme Court after the broad appellate ruling that said off-campus student speech was beyond schools’ authority to punish.The dispute is the latest in a line of a cases that began withTinker v. Des Moines, the Vietnam-era case of a high school in Des Moines, Iowa, that suspended students who wore armbands to protest the war. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court sided with the students, declaring students don’t “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”The court also held then that schools retained the authority to restrict speech that would disrupt the school environment.Breyer wrote that Levy’s case seemed less serious than its Vietnam-era predecessor, decided in 1969.In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he would have upheld Levy’s suspension.Pinellas School Board attorney David Koperski said he did not see any need to change the district’s policies because of the ruling. He said the decision seemed to generally uphold 50 years of case law without breaking much new ground.He speculated that the court took up the case “not to make any new rules, but rather to essentially overturn the 3rd Circuit Appellate Court’s statement that the seminal 1969 case ... did not applyat allto off-campus speech.”That would have been a significant change, Koperski said.Jim Porter, the lawyer for the Hillsborough School Board, agreed that the ruling offered more of a clarification for school districts as they deal with student speech issues. The Hillsborough code of conduct does not spell out any specifics on student free speech.“I don’t anticipate, based on this decision, we would have to change anything,” Porter said.This report includes information from Associated Press."
"Bob Iger As Ambassador To China? Hollywood Names Are Floating For Joe Biden Picks, But Rumors May Clash With Reality",-1.67,38.67,https://deadline.com/2020/12/bob-iger-chinese-ambassador-rumors-jeffery-katzenberg-joe-biden-disney-1234658940/,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,21,"With a newly elected Democratic president, this is the season of speculation, where names are being floated as potential ambassador picks. And this time around, Disney’s executive chairmanBob Igeris getting attention as a prospect for one of the highest profile foreign posts, China.But while there is a lot of talk of Iger and others (including Comcast’s David L. Cohen and former MPA chairman Chris Dodd), it’s still just that: talk.Not only is it premature, but the polarization in the Senate could make things dicey for any nominee, much less one who comes from the ranks of Hollywood, a favorite punching bag of the right.Joe Biden‘s team is said to be concentrating right now on its top-level cabinet picks. Team Biden has been sending out word that the speculation is premature and that nominations won’t be considered until after January 20. Last week, Sean Savett, who has been working on the transition team for Biden, reacted to a rumor that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had been offered an ambassadorship to The Bahamas and declined.Related StoriesPoliticsJoe Biden To Get Covid-19 Vaccine On Monday; Kamala Harris Will Receive Shot After ChristmasNewsU.S. Economy Added 353,000 Jobs In January, Beating Expectations; Entertainment Industry Continues To Recover After Strikes“This is not true. No decisions on ambassadorships outside of UN have been made,” Savett wrote.Iger isn’t the only deep-pocket Tinseltown name being tossed into the embassy speculation mix. As happened several times during the Obama era, longtime donor and presidential confidantJeffrey Katzenberghas also been rumored of late to be up for a plum overseas posting. However, a source with knowledge of the former Quibi boss’ situation bluntly says that such talk is bogus at best.This isn’t to say an ambassadorship for a Hollywood figure would not be so out of the ordinary. After Barack Obama’s presidential victory, he tapped Charles Rivkin, then CEO of WildBrain Media, and Nicole Avant, a music industry executive and producer, to be ambassadors to France and The Bahamas, respectively. Rivkin is now the chairman of the Motion Picture Association, and Avant is a producer.Four years later, Obama selected Colleen Bell, a television producer, as ambassador to Hungary, and HBO executive James Costos as ambassador to Spain.But this time around, the confirmation process could very well be a hurdle, particularly given the attacks Republicans have been prone to make on showbiz. Things will be smoother if Democrats win control of the Senate in the January 5 runoffs, and either way, much depends on timing and the nature of anti-Biden intransigence. But for politicians on the left and the right, the Walt Disney Co. has been a sure-fire way to draw attention.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has attacked Disney and other studios for “kowtowing” to China, and he was among a group of lawmakers in both parties who signed a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek in Septemberexpressing concerns over the credits ofMulanbecause they included a note of thanks to Chinese authorities who have been cited for human rights abuses. An executive for the companylater said that the moviewas almost entirely shot in New Zealand, but some locations were used in China and that it was standard practice to acknowledge local governments in the credits.On the other side of the partisan divide is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who has chided Disney for the pay of its theme park workers compared with that of top executives, including Iger. The company recently said that it would lay off 32,000 workers, mostly in its theme parks, which face severe restrictions on attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic. One senior Hollywood executive with strong DC ties said that Iger would hit turbulence. “Hell no. There is no way that Iger would pass a confirmation hearing,” given the scrutiny facing the next posting in Beijing.Meanwhile, Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast, has been mentioned as a potential ambassador to the UK. In a recent interview with thePhiladelphia Inquirer,former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendellsaid that he talked to Cohenabout a high-profile ambassador post or that of commerce secretary. Cohen, who was once Rendell’s chief of staff, held Biden’s first major fundraiser. Comcast has called the speculation premature. Dodd’s namehas long been floated as a potential ambassador to Ireland.He recentlydeclined commenton those prospects.None of this is to say that these ambassador picks would not be qualified, even very well qualified — particularly when compared to some other nominees of the past. Iger, for instance, has a raft of experience interacting and negotiating with senior leadership in China, particularly when it came to building the massive Shanghai Disneyland, and he himself considered running for president this year. There are also less high-profile postings, outside of world hotspots, that wouldn’t be such a flashpoint.While ambassador posts come with a certain level of glamour and cachet, there are downsides. Whoever is an ambassador will be stepping into a role assisted by career diplomats with far greater knowledge of the bureaucracy of the mission, and they may be subject to the scrutiny of the State Department, including inspector general audits. There is also the matter of pay — there are healthy benefits, but salaries run around $150,000 per year, a fraction of what top executives are accustomed to getting.Money isn’t an issue for many of those who are tapped for ambassadorships, typically from the ranks of campaign bundlers and top donors. The postings are intriguing enough for many in show business to make a career turn, even with the scrutiny. The likes of Shirley Temple Black and John Gavin have served as ambassadors, and others who have held posts describe it as an experience of a lifetime, even with the drawbacks.Yet more often than not, speculation as to who will get these posts doesn’t pan out. Back in 2012, Anna Wintour was floated as an Obama pick as ambassador to the UK or France. She got neither posting.Chances are that the coming weeks will see even more industry names floated as potential ambassador picks, but there is still a ways to go before the choices become reality."
Taylor Swift Can't Shake Off This Lawsuit,0.0,48.33,https://patch.com/us/across-america/s/h8c2g/taylor-swift-cant-shake-lawsuit,https://adfontesmedia.com/patch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,20,"LOS ANGELES, CA — A lawsuit against Taylor Swift won't be shaken off, according to a Los Angeles federal judge. On Thursday, he refused to dismiss the two songwriters' claim that Taylor Swift used their lyrics from a 2001 song for her smash hit ""Shake It Off,"" court records show. That claim has been ongoing since 2017.In the suit, songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler alleged that Swift lifted lyrics from the 2001 3LW recording ""Playas Gon' Play,"" which includes the phrase: ""Playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate.""The lyrics in Swift's song, by comparison, read: ""Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.""U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald dismissed the claim in 2018, finding that the disputed lyrics lacked sufficient originality to merit copyright protection. However, an appeals court overturned the Los Angeles federal judge's decision the following year.In a Wednesday ruling, Fitzgerald refused to toss the case out of court.The judge wrote that Hall and Butler ""have sufficiently alleged a protectable selection and arrangement or a sequence of creative expression,"" and Swift's ""use as alleged is similar enough"" to survive the motion to dismiss.The plaintiffs seek a share of the profits from Swift's hit.According to the lawsuit, over 9 million copies of the song sold as of the filing date and 6 million copies of Swift's album ""1989,"" and the video for the song had nearly 2.4 billion views on YouTube.Swift's representatives reacted when the suit was filed, saying it ""a ridiculous claim and nothing more than a money grab. The law is simple and clear. They do not have a case.""City News Service, Patch Editor Ashley Ludwig contributed to this report."
‘An eternity in COVID time:' Connecticut residents report long waits for coronavirus test results,-2.0,49.67,https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-pol-testing-covid-20200722-r6mq2ageffaito6vadb5y7jbre-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/hartford-courant-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,20,"Earlier this month, Christopher J. Duff decided to get tested for COVID-19. He wasn’t feeling great and his two-year-old son was running a fever.“My symptoms were being extremely tired, some body aches and feeling very warm,” said Duff, who is 39 and serves on the Rocky Hill town council. “I’ve been working from home, social distancing and wearing a mask out in public, so I didn’t think I was likely to have COVID, but I wanted to rule it out and make sure, especially because we have a toddler and an infant.”The testing process, conducted at a CVS Minute Clinic in Rocky Hill, took a total of 30 minutes. Duff’s wait for the results took eight days.Across the state and the nation, wait times for some COVID-19 test results are stretching to a week or longer.Timely results are key to containing the spread of the virus, public health officials say. The longer a person is unaware of a positive test, the more time they have to infect others and lengthy delays can hamper contact tracing and other efforts to control outbreaks.“Five days is an eternity in COVID time,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday. “You don’t know what’s happened…in the five days it’s taking you to get that response.”In addition to causing stress and disruption for individuals, experts fear the rising backlog of test kits could jeopardize efforts to control the virus and reopen society.“We are concerned that the national demand for testing is causing longer wait times for test results,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of the state Department of Public Health.“Anyone that has a known exposure to a COVID-positive individual or who has symptoms should be in self-quarantine until they have a negative test result,” Gifford said. “That’s how were going to contain the spread of this virus…people [should] remain isolated from others if there’s a chance they may be infected. It’s very important…as inconvenient as we understand that is, that individuals remain in quarantine.”The wait for test results has grown longer in recent weeks, with national labs processing a spike in samples from Arizona, Texas, California and other hot spots.CVS Health attributed the “extremely high demand for tests” to rising caseloads in much of the nation.“This has caused backlogs for our lab partners and is delaying their processing of patient samples,” said Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for CVS Health. “Currently, due to these factors, it may take 6-10 days for people to receive their results and, in some instances, our lab partners may take even longer to return results. Our lab partners are working hard to address this issue.”With schools and businesses looking to reopen, demand for testing could swell even more, putting additional pressure on an already overburdened system, officials say.Early in the pandemic, Connecticut contracted with several in-state laboratories, which agreed to process a certain number of tests and to turn around results as quickly as possible.In most cases, the in-state diagnostic centers are reporting results within 24 hours, said Josh Geballe, Gov. Lamont’s chief operating officer.The state is currently in discussions with some of those facilities to take on additional capacity to help compensate for the backlog at the national laboratories.“We’re working as much as we can with our local labs and…there we’re getting a quick turnaround, 24 hours or less,” Lamont said. “We’re doing as much as we can to move all the testing analysis right here in the state of Connecticut and we’re not going to have that wait.”Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation’s largest labs, said it is trying to address the backlog. “At Quest Diagnostics, we are doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing to patients at this critical time,” the company said in a statement.Last week, the Federal Food and Drug Administration allowed Quest to pool its samples. Under this scenario, four samples can be tested at once; if the results are negative, all of those individuals are COVID-free. If it’s positive, the four samples are separated and tested individually to determine which is infected.Even as steps are taken to speed up the process, some state residents continue to face long waits for results.John Silver went to a mobile testing site in New Britain on July 9 for a COVID-19 test. He and his wife had several trips planned and wanted to make sure they weren’t infected before they set off.His results arrived nine days later, on July 18, and his wife’s arrived on July 20; both were negative.Although they had no symptoms and no reason to suspect they were sick, they isolated for the first two days following the test.“But nine days?” said Silver, who is 43 and lives in Farmington. “Just too much time.”Christopher Duff’s test was also negative.“Everyone’s symptoms lifted before we got results back,” he said, “although I was still concerned I could have it and be asymptomatic.”After eight days of waiting, “it was a relief,” he added."

San Diego Unified floats requests to Biden administration in State of District address,-3.33,47.33,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2020-11-18/san-diego-unified-floats-requests-to-biden-administration-in-state-of-district-address,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,20,"San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten released a proposed education plan for president-elect Joe Biden Tuesday during her annual State of the District address.Marten called for increased federal funding for schools and for a national teacher corps program to train more teachers to work in low-income schools.Shesuggested the incoming Biden Administration provide $350 billion in COVID-19 aid to schools, fully fund special education— something the federal government has never done — triple Title I funding for schools that serve low-income students, and provide more funding for military students. The new administration also should ensure that all 3- and 4-year-olds have access to quality preschool, Marten said.She also called for reinstating the National Teacher Corps, a 1965 program that trained teachers to work in disadvantaged schools.“Now before anyone discards these ideas as unrealistic given the current economic climate, let me remind you that every one of the San Diego strategies for school reform came out of the 2008 financial crisis,” Marten said during a pre-recorded speech, which wasdelivered onlineand received about 2,200 views.“Hard times breed clarity of purpose. We can create an educational recovery plan that meets the needs of all of our students by focusing on equity.”Marten warned that the pandemic is causing severe learning losses because of school shutdowns. A national recovery plan with funding for schools is needed to reverse those losses, she said.California public schools were spared from state budget cuts this school year, but there is no such guarantee for next year.“We now risk losing the progress we have made if we must contend with State budget cuts in January,” Marten said.Marten also described what the district has done so far during the eight-month long pandemic.Officials said the district has distributed more than 80,000 Chromebooks and 8 million free meals to children.Marten said San Diego is providing more daily, “live” instruction time than other California districts. San Diego Unified schools are providing three hours of live instruction each day during distance learning.Marten and School Board President John Lee Evans said students are suffering losses due to school closures, but they didn’t say how much learning loss is happening among San Diego students. The district has not yet released data about students’ academic progress during this school year.Evans said the plan is still for San Diego Unified to reopen on Jan. 4 for elementary students and on Jan. 25 for middle and high school students. But the reopening could be postponed if San Diego County does not improve its COVID-19 rates quickly enough to get out and stay out of the purple tier.“We all know that our students are suffering. We know that damage is being done by this pandemic,” Evans said. “Every person — the superintendent, the board, and all our staff — are working diligently to make sure our schools can open as soon as possible in the safest possible manner.”"

Donald Trump Pushes Birther Conspiracy Theory About Kamala Harris,-15.67,32.33,https://www.inquisitr.com/6223003/donald-trump-birther-kamala-harris/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inquisitr-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-14,20,"During a press conference on Thursday, PresidentDonald Trumpseemingly pushed a conspiracy theory about California DemocratKamala Harris,New York Magazinereported.Trump pointed to aNewsweekcolumn penned by conservative law professor John Eastman, suggesting that Harris is not eligible to serve as vice president.“I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements, and by the way the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented.”For years, Trump promoted the so-called birther conspiracy theory aboutBarack Obama, suggesting that his predecessor was not born in the United States.The debunked theory is widely regarded as racist.Trump made the remarks about Harris just two days after the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, announced her as his running mate.In his op-ed, Eastman argued that the California senator is ineligible to serve as president because her father was a Jamaican national and her mother an Indian national. Neither of the two, he argued, was a naturalized citizen at the time of Harris’ birth.Eastman pointed to the 12th Amendment and Article II of the U.S. Constitution. He also wrote that Harris cannot serve because of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.The law professor concluded that Harris’ background needs to be reexamined amid reports of Russian and Chinese election interference, writing that “it would be an inauspicious start for any campaign for the highest offices in the land to ignore the Constitution’s eligibility requirements.”Eastman was slammed for writing the column, with critics pointing out that his views on birthright citizenship are not shared by most constitutional law scholars.AsNew York Magazinenoted, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth was also vetted by Biden’s team.Although a natural-born citizen, Duckworth was not born in the United States, so Democrats reportedly feared that Trump and his allies would attack her with birther conspiracy theories.“But with another Black nominee on the ballot, Trump is returning to his wheelhouse, questioning the citizenship of a candidate born in the United States,” the publication concluded.In their first joint press conference, Biden and Harris accusedTrumpof leaving the nation “in tatters.”The duo also slammed Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Biden saying that the commander-in-chief spends more time golfing than addressing the unprecedented public health crisis.Biden talked about Trump’s attacks on the California Democrat, suggesting that they do not come as a surprise “because whining is what Donald Trump does best.”"

Bill Lee and the state of Tennessee are finally publicly reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to schools.The Tennessee Department of Education will launch a new dashboard on Tuesday that will include the total number of active cases among students and staff broken down by school across the state.The department will update the dashboard every Monday with the previous week's number of new cases and will include classroom or school closures and whether students are learning in-person, remotely or a hybrid of both for each district.“Parents and community members are working to make informed decisions, and we have determined the best path that balances informed decision making with our obligation to student privacy,” Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn said in a statement. “We believe this resource will not only help parents but will inform how COVID-19 is affecting student attendance, chronic absenteeism and overall student attainment.""Lee, Schwinn and state Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Pierceyhave all been criticized for not publicly reporting information on COVID-19 casesin schools.

Developing a dashboard to meet these needs appropriately was a process, Lee said during a news briefing.""We believe (the dashboard) will help parents make choices, but it won't compromise our commitment to parents and to students and to teachers,"" Lee said. ""It's uncharted territory. Most states are still grappling with this, but we think we have developed a tool that will be helpful in determining not only how many cases are in a school but also how it affects attendance, chronic absenteeism and even academic outcomes among our students.""Nearly200 COVID-19 cases linked to schools have been reportedacross the state since the first school districts in Tennessee reopened in late July, many prompting quarantines of students and staff and even temporary school closures.Dozens of school districts scrambled to launch their own online dashboards or other methods to report the number of positive cases among staff and students, how many individuals were in isolation or quarantine and school closures.Several states are already reporting or have committed to reporting the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, including Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Texas.Schwinn said that the majority of state reporting efforts are being led by state health departments — the Tennessee Department of Education is the first to report cases in schools itself.The commissioner has been under fire in recent weeks from a group of lawmakers and some school district leaders over the education department's handling of the pandemic.From what information to report about confirmed cases to what safety guidance to follow in classrooms, some school leaders say the department has not given clear, consistent guidance.Lee releasedthe state's school reopening guidanceon July 28 — days after some Tennessee school districts had already reopened. Initially, he and Piercey said that neither the education or health departments would be tracking or reporting COVID-19 cases in schools. Helater announced that the state would work on a plan for reporting such data.Just a week later, Lee reversed course again and saidthe state would not release the data. After that, Lee said the state was contacting federal officials about what it could release.Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, has consistently argued the public has the right to know what's happening in schools. She acknowledged that districts might be worried that if they release school data, people will use it to try to identify infected people.""It all comes down to, 'Are we somehow identifying that Joe Smith in third grade has COVID-19?"" Fisher said.But privacy concerns are also dueling with the public's right to know, Fisher said.“That has to be weighed with the need for the public to know what’s happening in the schools,"" she said. ""People don’t want to make decisions about their kids in the dark.”The state's new dashboard will be maintained by education department officials and school districts will be expected to update the department weekly. The state will not report specific case numbers for schools with less than 50 students enrolled — there are less than 40 of those statewide — and will not report the specific number of cases if the active case number is less than five.The education department routinely redacts student demographic or test data when it only applies to small numbers of students as a way to protect privacy.Department officials anticipate local school districts will likely still have the most up-to-date information on active cases in their schools and encourage families and community members to continue to reach out to local districts for more information.The Tennessean and the USA Today Network - Tennessee is also keeping track of COVID-19 cases in schools across Tennessee.Find out if cases have been reported in your local school by searching our statewide database or report suspected cases yourself usingour statewide database.Want to read more stories like this?A subscriptionto one of our Tennessee publications gets you unlimited access to all the latest news and the ability to tap into stories, photos and videos from throughout the USA TODAY Network's 261 daily sites.Reporter Isabel Lohman contributed to this story.Meghan Mangrum covers education in Nashville for the USA TODAY NETWORK — Tennessee.

US government bans tech exports to top drone maker DJI,0.0,46.67,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/us-government-bans-tech-exports-to-top-drone-maker-dji/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,19,"Front page layoutSite themeThis is one of the legal weaponsthe Trump administration usedagainst smartphone-makers Huawei and ZTE a few years ago. The export ban against those two companies had a devastating effect on the companies because it meant they couldn't get access to Google software, Qualcomm chips, and other Western technologies.It's not clear if the export ban will be as damaging to DJI as it was to Huawei and ZTE. Not only has DJI dominated the drone business for years, but Chinese companies dominate significant parts of the drone supply chain. So DJI might not have as much trouble sourcing components from domestic supply chains. Still, the announcement will certainly make it difficult for DJI to maintain its dominance of the drone business outside of China.The Trump administration's other major target is SMIC, a Shanghai company that owns and operates semiconductor foundries. In the past, SMIC has counted Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments among its American customers. When rumors began to circulate about an SMIC export ban a few months ago, Qualcomm reportedlybegan making plansto shift its semiconductor business away from SMIC. Qualcomm's biggest foundry partners are Samsung and TSMC, so it likely won't have too much trouble moving away from SMIC.The US government's focus with the SMIC listing is to prevent the Chinese company from getting access to the newest generations of semiconductor fabrication technologies.""Items uniquely required to produce semiconductors at advanced technology nodes—10 nanometers or below—will be subject to a presumption of denial,"" the US wrote in astatementannouncing the restrictions. The US is concerned that selling cutting-edge semiconductor equipment to SMIC will allow it to fall into the hands of the Chinese military.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.Sign me up →CNMN CollectionWIRED Media Group© 2024 Condé Nast.

McConnell says he will vote to acquit Trump in 2nd impeachment trial: sources,-0.67,46.0,https://globalnews.ca/news/7639361/mcconnell-to-acquit-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/global-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-13,19,"Senate Minority LeaderMitch McConnelltold colleagues Saturday that in a “close call,” he will vote to acquitDonald Trumpin the former president’s impeachment trial.McConnell’s decision, conveyed to colleagues in an email obtained by The Associated Press, ended the suspense over what the chamber’s most influential Republican would decide, essentially slamming the door on chances that Trump would be found guilty.“While a close call, I am persuaded that impeachments are a tool primarily of removal and we therefore lack jurisdiction,” McConnell wrote.He said the Constitution lets presidents no longer in office be pursued for “criminal misconduct,” easing his concern about Democratic prosecutors’ argument that an acquittal would allow a “January exception” against trying impeached presidents after leaving office.Trump is charged with inciting the deadly Jan. 6 riot by his supporters at the Capitol as Congress was formally certifying his election defeat by Joe Biden. A final Senate vote in the trial was expected later Saturday.McConnell’s views carry sway among GOP senators, and his decision on Trump is likely to influence others weighing their votes. Seventeen Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to reach the two-thirds threshold needed to convict Trump, a margin that seems all but insurmountable.Many had expected the Kentucky senator to vote to clear Trump of the charges, based on McConnell’s history as a GOP loyalist who likes to take few major risks. But before Saturday, McConnell had said little in public or private about his mindset, and no one was certain what he would decide.McConnell jarred the political world just minutes after the Democratic-led House impeached Trump on Jan. 13, writing to his GOP colleagues that he had “not made a final decision” about how he would vote at the Senate trial.It was an eye-opening departure from his quick opposition when the House impeached Trump in December 2019 for trying to force Ukraine to send the then-president political dirt on campaign rival Joe Biden and other Democrats.McConnell had also told associates he thought Trump perpetrated impeachable offences and saw the moment as a chance to distance the GOP from the damage the tumultuous Trump could inflict on it, a Republican strategist told The Associated Press at the time, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.But since this week’s trial began, McConnell has voted with a majority of Republicans against proceeding with the trial at all on the grounds that Trump was no longer president.McConnell’s decision to acquit Trump leaves the party locked in its struggle to define itself in the post-Trump presidency. Numerous and fiercely loyal pro-Trump Republicans and more traditional Republicans who believe the former president is damaging the party’s national appeal are struggling to decide the GOP’s direction.A guilty vote by McConnell would have likely done even more to roil GOP waters by signalling an attempt by the party’s most powerful Washington leader to yank the party away from a figure still revered by most of its voters.“The overwhelming number of Republican voters don’t want Trump convicted, so that means any political leader has to tread carefully,” said John Feehery, a former top congressional GOP aide. While Feehery noted that McConnell was clearly outraged over the attack, he said the senator is “trying to keep his party together.”Over 36 years in the Senate, the measured McConnell has earned a reputation for inexpressiveness in the service of caution. The suspense over how he was going to vote underscored how much is at stake for McConnell and his party.McConnell has spent the trial’s first week in his seat in the Senate chamber, staring straight ahead.A guilty vote by McConnell would have enraged many of the 74 million voters who backed Trump in November, a record for a GOP presidential candidate. That could expose Republican senators seeking reelection in 2022 to primaries from conservatives seeking revenge, potentially giving the GOP less appealing general election candidates as they try winning Senate control.McConnell’s decision will no doubt colour his legacy. He turns 79 next Saturday and doesn’t face reelection for almost six years. Even critics say McConnell likes to play the long game.“For McConnell, it’s always strategy, it’s always about how he can live to fight another day,” said Colmon Elridge, chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party.McConnell manoeuvred through Trump’s four years in office like a captain steering a ship through a rocky strait on stormy seas. Battered at times by vindictive presidential tweets, McConnell made a habit of saying nothing about many of Trump’s outrageous comments. He ended up guiding the Senate to victories such as the 2017 tax cuts and the confirmations of three Supreme Court justices and more than 200 other federal judges.Their relationship plummeted after Trump’s denial of his Nov. 3 defeat and relentless efforts to reverse the voters’ verdict with his baseless claims that Democrats fraudulently stole the election.It withered completely last month, after Republicans lost Senate control with two Georgia runoff defeats they blamed on Trump, and the savage attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. The day of the riot, McConnell railed against “thugs, mobs, or threats” and described the attack as “this failed insurrection.”A week later, the Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump for inciting insurrection. Six days after that, McConnell said, “The mob was fed lies” and he added, “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.”___Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report."

2020 DNC will meet for just two hours nightly during Milwaukee convention,-2.0,52.67,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/07/29/dnc-meet-2-hours-nightly-during-milwaukee-convention/5541718002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/milwaukee-journal-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,19,"Call it a convention in miniature.With the coronavirus pandemic upending previous plans, Democrats will meet for two hours nightly, from 8 to 10 p.m. Central time, when they stage their mostly virtual national convention at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee.The schedule — adopted by a key committee Thursday — provides the broad outline of what is shaping up to be a carefully crafted and staged proceeding.It will also be one of the shortest conventions in history by total time.The event runs Aug. 17-20, with Joe Biden expected to accept the party's presidential nomination in Milwaukee on the final night.Biden's vice presidential nominee, still to be announced, will be nominated on Aug. 19 and address the gathering. The speech is expected to take place in Milwaukee, although details are not confirmed.A keynote address is scheduled for Aug. 18, the same night of the presidential roll call, which will be conducted virtually.The convention will open Aug. 17, with committee reports on credentials, rules and the platform, and select speakers.Convention planners also confirmed that former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will participate, although where they'll be speaking from has not been announced.There will also be a tribute to the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis. That spot is being produced by Dawn Porter, who was the producer-director of ""John Lewis: Good Trouble.""Delegates have been asked not to attend the event in person because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. They are casting ballots remotely, beginning next week.Members of Congress have also been told not to travel to Milwaukee.Democrats are calling this a ""Convention Across America,"" featuring speeches and events from other sites, with Milwaukee anchoring the proceedings.This convention is anything but typical. Normally at a party gathering, meetings are well-attended during the day with the delegates gathering for several hours nightly to listen to speeches.The 1872 Democratic Convention in Baltimore is reputedly the shortest on record,clocking in at six hours over two days.This year's event is in essence an abbreviated event at an unprecedented time.Top Democrats were named to the convention leadership, led by honorary chairs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi was named permanent convention chair.U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, who helped bring the event to the city, will be the sergeant-of-arms.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the permanent co-chairs of the convention, with Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, U.S. Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Tom Carper of Delaware, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and U.S. Rep. Tony Cárdenas of California.Jason Rae, who lives in the Milwaukee area, is the party's secretary.Democrats also released a schedule of daily virtual meetings and caucuses that will take place around the convention.""We are looking forward to a historic convention anchored in Milwaukee, and through the leadership of the permanent officers who will help oversee this convention Democrats will come together to continue the work to elect Joe Biden as the next President of the United States,” DNC Chair Tom Perez said in a statement.“We have an exciting lineup of programming over the course of four nights as we seek a better future for all Americans, and unite around our shared values and Joe Biden’s vision for a better, safer future for the country.”"

Deadline Approaching For Abbott To Sign Constitutional Carry,12.5,32.0,https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2021/06/11/deadline-abbott-constitutional-carry-n46439,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,18,"Back on May 28th, the Texas state legislature formally sent HB 1927 to Gov. Greg Abbott. The bill establishing a Constitutional Carry law that allows legal gun owners to lawfully carry a handgun without the need for a state-issued license had the public support of Gov. Greg Abbott, but it’s been almost two weeks now and the governor has yet to sign the legislation.There’ve been some whispers around Austin that some in law enforcement are still lobbying the governor to reject the bill or demand changes after public opposition failed to derail the measure in the legislature.… a number of Texas police associations led by the Dallas Police Association held a news conference May 25 to speak in opposition to the bill. The officers who spoke are concerned about the lack of safety awareness if a carrier is not licensed.Locally, spokesmen for police agencies have either declined to comment on the issue until it is officially signed into law or say they will enforce the law no matter what because that’s part of the job.Shawn Vaughn, spokesman for the Texarkana Texas Police Department said TTPD will enforce the law without speaking out for or against it.“We enforce the law, whatever the legislature sees fit,” Vaughn said.Complaints about people carrying handguns are very few locally, Vaughn said.“We’ve had no major issues. There are some people who will still be prohibited from carrying guns, such as felons, and those are the main ones we are concerned about,” he said.Hooks Police Chief Ricky Woodard said his department will enforce the law without opinion.“I will support the law and the Constitution,” he said.Under Texas law, the governor has ten days to sign or veto a bill or else it becomes law without his signature. Adding in the Memorial Day holiday, the ten day period for HB 1927 should expire next Monday, so we don’t have much longer to wait to see what Abbott will decide to do.I have a very hard time imagining Abbott vetoing the bill, given that he publicly supported HB 1927 as it was making its way through the state House and Senate. Abbott is also up for re-election next year, and already faces a primary opponent who’s trying to run to the right of the governor. A veto of Constitutional Carry would give former state Sen. Don Huffines an easy issue to use against Abbott, and I doubt that the governor really wants to make his support for the Second Amendment a campaign question.It’s possible, however, that Abbott could allow the bill to become law while calling for tweaks to the bill’s language. The legislative session has concluded for the year, but the governor is expected to call for aspecial sessionat some point. Lawmakers could end up taking another look at the specific language in HB 1927, but I doubt that any wholesale changes weakening Constitutional Carry would pass either the House or the Senate. After all, Abbott isn’t the only Republican thinking about next year’s elections, and I don’t think supporters of HB 1927 really want to explain to voters why and how a bill that enjoyed the support of the legislature and the governor ended up as something less than what was promised.Ultimately, this may be much ado about nothing. Abbott recently told a Dallas television station that he hadmore than 1,000 billson his desk to sign or veto, so perhaps the governor simply hasn’t gotten around to HB 1927 yet. The clock is ticking, however, and with Monday’s deadline looming, let’s hope Gov. Abbott moves Constitutional Carry to the top of the pile of legislation on his desk. Having the bill become law without his signature would be an okay outcome, but given the importance of Texas becoming the 21st Constitutional Carry state, I think the pomp and ceremony of a public signing ceremony is warranted here."

The National Guard remains busy",1.33,49.33,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/09/03/natural-disasters-a-pandemic-and-unrest-the-national-guard-remains-busy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,18,"Fresh off the fire lines in San Bernadino, California, Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Thursday that this year’s fire season is shaping up to be one of the worst on record.“1987 was one of the worst fire seasons on record, and currently they’re on pace to exceed that,” said Hokanson, speaking to reporters. “If you go back to the beginning of fire season earlier this year, within the state of California they burned about 1.6 million acres, which is roughly the size of the state of Delaware.”The fires have destroyed more than 3,200 structures, including homes, and there have been eight deaths. More than 12,400 people remained evacuated Thursday.Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, assistant adjutant general of the California National Guard expressed confidence in the ability of guardsmen in his state to provide sustained response to wildfires.New classes of California Guardsmen are constantly being trained to respond to fires. Last month, a news release reported that more than 270 soldiers began training. Beevers said the Guard is presently training another 550 members who will rotate into the mix of current crews to prevent burnout.In addition to the human resources the Guard provides, Beevers expressed that the 16 bucket helicopters, 4 modular airborne firefighting systems-equipped C-130s, and surveying drones have also been an invaluable resource.More than ### National Guardsmen are currently activated for wildland firefighting missions. (Photo Credit: Master Sgt. Joseph Prouse)“These young airmen are being able to provide incident commanders in the field real time data on the unique behavior of a specific fire,” Beevers said. “They can put fire teams in the right place at the right time.”But the 1,300 soldiers and airmen from five different states activated to fight wildfires on the West Coast are only a sliver of the roughly 64,000 National Guardsmen currently serving domestically and overseas.That’s a significant decrease from June, when COVID-19 and civil unrest pushed numbers to a peak of nearly 120,000 members activated.Despite the workload 2020 has handed guardsmen, Hokanson said the force has remained capable and ready.“At the same time, we met every one of our overseas deployment requirements, and it had no impact there at all,” Hokanson said, referencing the high levels of domestic missions.Of the 64,000 currently activated, more than 18,000 are still tasked with COVID-19 relief missions across all 54 states and territories. Federal support for such missions wasextended until 2021at the beginning of last month.“National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to governors as the governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective states and territories,” President Donald Trump’s executive memorandum stated.Another nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen continue to provide relief to communities in Texas and Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Laura. Airmen on the ground have been working to clear roadways of fallen trees and debris, the Louisiana Air National Guard reported.There are a lot of people in need,” said Senior Airman Alejandro Peralta, a structural engineering journeyman, in a news release. “Hopefully, they are comforted and feel supported when they see the Louisiana Air National Guard working in the area.”This year’s hurricane season has a 60 percent chance of above-normal activity, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,and the season won’t end until Nov. 30.As hurricane and fire seasons continue on opposite coasts, civil unrest also rolls on across the country.Most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Eversrequested out-of-state assistancefor protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake and subsequent killing of two demonstrators.Military police companies from Michigan, Alabama, and Arizona responded.Approximately 150 Arizona National Guard soldiers from the 850th Military Police Battalion mobilized to Wisconsin in response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request Aug. 28, 2020. Arizona is one of three states sending personnel to Wisconsin which are expected to arrive later this evening (Tech. Sgt. Michael Matkin/Air National Guard)While a contingent of Arizona National Guard soldiers returned home from Kenosha, Hokanson said more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen continue to assist state and local law enforcement in various states.“2020 in general kind of proved just what a tremendous value the National Guard is for our nation,” said Hokanson.This story contains information from the Associated Press.Harm Venhuizen is an editorial intern at Military Times.

The Emperor of America – Why Is Biden Governing by Decree?,20.67,13.67,https://www.libertynation.com/the-emperor-of-america-why-is-biden-governing-by-decree/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,18,"With Democrats in control of both branches of Congress, opening a wide berth for legislative action, the question persists as to why Joe Biden has shattered the previousrecordfor unilateral decrees — i.e.,executive orders— in the early days of his presidency.In response, ask yourself these fundamental questions: If you were just elected to the highest office in the land as the oldest president ever to take the oath of office, in declining neurological health, uncertain of just how long you will be able to manage the relentless day-to-day pressures of the job, how would you govern? Would you play the long game, working diligently with a friendly legislature to write permanent change into the law? Or would you decide to leave an immediate and substantial imprint on the nation with a seemingly unprecedented burst of executive action right out of the starting gate? Would this not serve as a hedge against your presidency failing to run its full course and becoming a mere footnote in history?These questions have certainly been answered with an exclamation point by the 46th president. With more than 40 strokes of his executive pen, Biden has front-loaded his fumigation of the Trump presidency and thrown the necessary bouquets to his party’s progressive base. With the iron hand of chief of staff Ron Klain carefully orchestrating access to and scheduling for him, Biden has so far been able to pull off a single-shift presidency, arriving and departing from the Oval Office and required appearances mostly during business hours in small, tightly scripted bursts, with much rest in between.He is the quintessential and polar opposite to his predecessor, famously a perpetual-motion machine who, despite his signature commitment to “drain the Swamp,” employed executive orders far less frequently than Biden in the early days of his administration. And Trump moved swiftly out of the gate in leading the charge or backstopping his own party’s congressional initiatives on a range of issues, from taxes to immigration. When will President Biden begin to employ the majorities he holds in Congress? Time is short for theDemocrats’ narrow controlin the upper and lower chambers. As 2022 looms, they know history has rarely been kind to the ruling party in midterm elections.At some point soon, Biden’s decree machine will start to lose steam. He has shot his load early. The people will inevitably tire of governance by fiat. So what happens when aggressive and energetic presidential support is needed to push controversial legislation across the finish line? Will Biden’s bully pulpit, fired up almost exclusively by teleprompter, generate enough credibility for him to sell the public on, for example, a public option added to Obamacare, as Obama was able to do with Democrat majorities in both houses in 2010? Will he stand behind the inevitable flurry of aggressive and explosively controversial climate change legislation Congress is chomping at the bit to pass, even as those bills would face likely defeat in the Senate? Will he explicitly lend his support to equally contentious race-based initiatives likely to emanate from the House?All presidents seek to leave an indelible mark on the government over which they preside, and Biden is no different. But his time in the Oval Office may be shorter than most. His challenge is twofold: to calm the stormy waters stirred up by his predecessor’s ongoing crusade for systemic change, while attempting to demonstrate that the many institutions and practices challenged and exposed by Trump are worthy of restoration. No easy task for even a president in the prime of life. And while ruling by executive fiat is permissible within clear boundaries in our constitutional order, Biden will soon realize that his legacy will hinge not on what he commands from on high but on what he can persuade the American people to embrace.~Read more fromTim Donner.Do you have an opinion about this article?We’d love to hear it!

The COVID Tracking Project is (nearly) gone. Can we see clearly now?,-4.0,45.0,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/the-covid-tracking-project-is-nearly-gone-can-we-see-clearly-now.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"But the days went by, and the CDC did not, leaving the Tracking Project’s collective of journalists and tech folk to serve,in their own words, as “a de facto source of pandemic data for the United States.”The Atlanticagreed to host the project; its team grew to include hundreds of volunteers, and the project’s founders solicited philanthropic donations to pay some of them. “It just got really complex,”Madrigal told CNN’s Brian Stelter recently. “At first, we just thought you could pull numbers off dashboards and that was gonna be the main process. As it turned out, we actually needed to do deep research. We made hundreds and hundreds of contacts with state officials… We added race and ethnicity data, we added outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, we added tracking of long-term care facilities. So all of those things came together to just require tons of labor; I mean, tens of thousands of hours of people’s time.” State and federal officials cribbed the project’s data. Other journalists became reliant on it.Now, finally, the project is winding down. It stopped collecting data ten days ago; it plans to spend the next couple of months on analysis work and archiving before shuttering completely. The analysis will mainly focus on data streams—around race and ethnicity, for instance—that are still insufficient, but the project’s founders are confident that federal officials are finally adequately replicating much of its core data, and, crucially, that the new Biden administration can be trusted not to turn off the lights at a moment’s notice.Writing last week, however, Madrigal and Kissane warned that the landscape of coronavirus data is “persistently messy.” The pandemic response “has been nominally or actually based on the idea that we know what is happening across the country to a precise degree,” they wrote. “And although this idea—that we have solid data about the movements of the pandemic and the effects of the response—is much closer to truth now than it was a year ago, it’s very far from universally accurate.”This week, Madrigal and Meyer expanded on that themein an essay forThe Atlantic, pinpointing key truths about pandemic data and officials’ handling of it. The initial pandemic response plan assumed the presence of good data, and failed to account for kinks at every part of the data-production pipeline, from the local, to the state, to the federal. We now have much better national-level data on cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths—but this still offers a rather messy compilation of snapshots and time lags, not a real-time “window” into the current state of the pandemic, as officials sometimes imply. (Deaths often substantially lag cases, and commonly go unreported for weeks.) At least five states still “have disturbingly incomplete testing data”; nationally, tens of millions of rapid antigen tests appear to be unaccounted for. “Datamight seem like an overly technical obsession,” Madrigal and Meyer write. “But data are how our leaders apprehend reality.”The press, too. Over the course of the pandemic, responsible news organizations have pledged to “follow the science” and extolled the virtues of data-driven analysis, but as Madrigal and Meyer note, looking at data is less like “peering into a crystal ball” than “watching city sewers empty into a wastewater-treatment plant”—it’s more useful than not looking, “but you shouldn’t delude yourself about what’s in the water.” And yet,as I wrote in the early days of the pandemic, reporters moved quickly to paint unduly certain pictures with extremely incomplete information; reported cases and deaths, for example, were routinely relayed as “totals,” not as clear undercounts, which, of course, they were.Over time, data flows improved; testing, in particular, expanded, even prior to the election of a president who doesn’t view it asa conspiracy to make him look bad. But testing remains highly imperfect.Per the Tracking Project, reported daily tests hit a high-water mark close to 2.3 million in December—a figure,some experts then calculated, that was adequate toidentifymost symptomatic COVID cases and close contacts, but still fell well short of the daily rate that would be needed to properlycontrolviral spread by identifying asymptomatic people. From a public-health standpoint,these metrics are subject to healthy scientific debate; from a journalistic standpoint, every additional test is an extra confirmed truth about the world, and yet media-industry leaders have never pushed with any real consistency or urgency to frame expanded testing,as I suggested last year, as a freedom of information issue. (We’re better at demanding to see information the government is hiding than information the government is failing to collect.) In the absence of a further massive ramp-up, thepercentageof tests coming back positive often offers more useful insights than flat numbers, yet many outlets haven’t pivoted to this metric with any consistency either. And in recent weeks, testing rates have generally declined.This could be a function of fewer people needing one (though, again, it depends how you define “need”), but it could also reflect public exhaustion with mitigation measures, bad weather, states’ shift to vaccine infrastructure, and other contingencies.As I wrote recently, journalists covering the pandemic still have to grapple, over a year in, with massive uncertainty. We still haven’t figured out how best to communicate this—not only around new challenges like vaccines and variants, that currently attract the bulk of our attention, but around the very basic building blocks that we use to define and measure surges and lulls, sickness and death. The visibility of these underpinning realities is still murky. Some outstanding journalists—not least at the Tracking Project—have focused on finding outlines of clarity, and for that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Many of us have instead acclimated to the murk, preferring to see what’s in front of us, even though it isn’t the full picture.Below, more on the pandemic:"
"The inside story of an alleged victim of ""cancel culture""",-8.75,45.5,https://popular.info/p/the-inside-story-of-an-alleged-victim,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,18,"The concept of ""cancel culture"" is a relatively recent phenomenon, appearing in popular usagearound 2017. The idea is that groups of people, sometimes pejoratively referred to as the ""woke mob,"" demand punishment of individuals that offend their sensibilities.Those who decry the existence of ""cancel culture"" do not provide data to prove it is a cultural problem. Instead, they rely on anecdotes of people who are unjustly punished to persuade and outrage the public. These anecdotes have convinced some of the country's most prominent voices — fromSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR)toformer President Barack Obama— that ""cancel culture"" is a real issue.A prototypical anecdote was featured on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News on June 18. Carlson highlighted the plight of Melissa Rolfe, the stepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks.Carlson told millions of viewers that Rolfe was fired from her job as an HR Director at a mortgage broker because her stepson, a police officer, was charged with murder.Until today, his stepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But today, she was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently, she was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Rolfe's stepmother.According to a source familiar with the matter who spoke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job was safe. But today she was told, and we are quoting, ""We have to terminate our relationship with you."" No other explanation was offered, and honestly, no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened.Rolfe has already been scrubbed from the company's website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations.That night, Congressman Doug Collins (R-GA) embraced Rolfe's cause, claiming she was fired for the actions of her stepson. ""The 'Cancel Culture' and political correctness mob must be stopped before it destroys our country,"" Collins said.On June 30, Carlson invited Rolfe to be a guest on the show. She appeared with her lawyer, David Guldenschuh. Carlson asked Rolfe if she knew of any other possible reason for her firing, other than the actions of her stepson:CARLSON: Had you been in trouble with them? Was there any indication that they were going to fire you before you received the message saying you were terminated?ROLFE: No. I had received full support from the President and from my Direct Manager that my job was not in danger.But that does not appear to be the whole story.Adefamation lawsuitfiled this week by Rolfe's former employer, Equity Prime Mortgage (EPM), alleges that Rolfe ""repeatedly violated company policy and created an uncomfortable and hostile working environment."" The complaint accuses Rolfe of making hostile, sexual, and ""blatantly racist"" remarks. All of the conduct allegedly took place prior to Garrett Rolfe's shooting.EPM accuses Rolfe and Congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of organizing a ""smear campaign"" against the company, resulting in ""death threats, a boycott, and enormous reputational and financial harm to EPM.""If the allegations in the complaint are true, it suggests that Rolfe was exploiting the concept of ""cancel culture"" to cover-up actual wrongdoing. Rolfe did not respond to a request for comment sent to her through her attorney. Another attorney representing Rolfe and Green, Lin Wood, called the allegations against Rolfe in the lawsuit ""damnable lies.""Rolfe claims she was fired because she stood up for her stepson, police officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Rashard Brooks. But the complaint alleges misconduct that began well before the June 12 shooting.Rolfe started working for EPM in February 2020. EPM says, less than a month later, on March 19, ""Rolfe was reprimanded because she had made inappropriate jokes via text message about conducting rectal temperature checks in the office."" On April 23, ""Rolfe was reprimanded again, this time for referring to employees as “savages,"" according to the complaint.On June 11, Rolfe was reprimanded a third time by EPM CEO Eddie Perez. According to EPM, ""two employees reported Rolfe for calling employees 'fucking bitches,' saying an employee had only been hired because she had 'big boobs,' and making racist comments.”Popular Information obtained a document from EPM memorializing the meeting between Perez and Rolfe. The ""Employee Warning Notice,"" dated June 11, cites Rolfe for ""gross misconduct."" According to that document Rolfe responded by ""saying that she doesn’t see color, but that some people are 'idiots.'"" EPM says that Perez ended the meeting after Rolfe became upset but told her he would continue investigating.The next day, Garrett Rolfe killed Rashard Brooks, and Melissa Rolfe took a paid leave of absence. But according to EPM, the investigation continued, and employees came forward with claims of ""wildly unprofessional and hostile conduct"" by Rolfe, including:Rolfe told an employee that another employee was a “dumb bitch” and that the only reason a man would be interested in her was because she “must suck dick really good.”Rolfe told a Black woman who dates Black men that she needed “to get outside the box and upgrade [her] standards.”""We terminated Ms. Rolfe because, while in the workplace, she repeatedly made inappropriate and hostile comments to and about other EPM employees, which violated company policy, created an uncomfortable working environment, and resulted in a loss of confidence that she could perform her job as an HR director,"" EPM told Popular Information.The lawsuit filed by EPM also names the campaign of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican running for Congress, as a defendant. Greene won the Republican nomination on Tuesday night. She has gained notoriety for her embrace of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are running an international child sex-trafficking ring, and Trump is the only one who can stop them. Facebook hasremoved several of Greene's advertisementsfor making violent threats against Black Lives Matter protesters.EPM's lawsuit notes that Greene repeatedly claimed that Rolfe was fired because of the actions of her stepson.The lawsuit alleges that Greene ""coordinated the planting of a false story with Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but does not provide evidence to support that allegation. Greene has appeared previously on Carlson's show.On August 6, EPM sent Greene and her campaign a letter demanding a retraction. Greene responded by posting again on social media, claiming Melissa Rolfe was fired because she defended her stepson.Do we know why Rolfe was fired? No. That will be determined in a court of law. But we know enough to say the simple story presented on Tucker Carlson was reductive and misleading.It suggests we should be more cautious making broad conclusions about societal trends based on one-sided anecdotes. Another anecdote that has been widely embraced by critics of cancel culture is the firing of David Shor. We are told that Shor, a 28-year-old political data scientist, was fired from his job at Civis Analytics fortweetinga research paper that concluded race riots reduced Democratic turnout in the 1960s.This claim is repeatedagain, andagain, andagain. If Shor was fired for tweeting an academic paper, that seems unfair.But neither Civis Analytics nor Shor, who signed a non-disclosure agreement, has confirmed he was fired for the tweet. ""These rumors are incorrect and unsubstantiated. Civis was founded on the principles of free speech and the pursuit of truth through objective scientific research, and that has not changed. This is an internal personnel matter, and out of respect for our employees and alumni, we won’t be commenting further,"" Civis Analytics toldThe Atlantic.Do we know why Shor was fired? No. But an unconfirmed anecdote is not evidence that our society has been turned upside down.This is important because the concept of ""cancel culture"" is being used toarguethat ""protests for racial and social justice"" have gone too far because they have created ""a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity."" We are told that ""institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.""Many people are treated unfairly. But there is little evidence that unfair treatment is now disproportionately impacting, for example, supporters of the police rather than minority groups. Free speech is a bedrock principle of American democracy. But free speech is not inconsistent with being held accountable for your words and actions.If you value this work, please help spread the word!

Katie Hill Lost Her Job in a Flurry of Leaked Nudes and Tabloid Headlines. Now She’s Telling Her Story,-6.67,38.0,https://www.glamour.com/story/katie-hill-lost-her-job-in-a-flurry-of-leaked-nudes-and-tabloid-headlines-now-shes-telling-her-story,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-10,18,"If you know about Katie Hill, you know about her nude photos.You wouldn’t say, “Oh, Katie Hill, she’s the one who’s openly bisexual and was the first woman and the youngest person to hold her congressional seat, right?”You wouldn’t say, “I remember Katie Hill! She flipped a deep-red Republican district in California in her first ever race.” Or even, “Katie Hill—she’s probably the only person to hold political office who can quote both Susan B. Anthony andXena: Warrior Princess.”You would say, “Yes, Katie Hill—the one who resigned after her pictures were leaked.”If you know of Hill, you know a handful of the most traumatic and personal facts about her life. You don’t know that she identifies with aTamora Pierceprotagonist (Sir Alanna of Trebond, of course) or that she hasendometriosisor that in afreshman classwhich included Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, it was she who was elected to represent the group to leadership. You don’t know that she reports feeling terrified to leave her husband, whom she’s said was abusive (through lawyers, her ex-husband hasdeniedany abuse), that she was suicidal after her scandal, and that a few months after she resigned, her brother, who had struggled with opioid addiction, died.Hill had a meteoric rise and an even faster fall: She was a former community college student who became the leader of a major nonprofit, then launched and won a seemingly impossible run for Congress in a deep-red district by the time she was 31. In Congress she shone for exactly one year. Then a right-wing site published the photos, which promptly spread as only nude photos of a 29-year-old congresswoman can. Hill says the photos, some of which were taken without her knowledge, could have only come from her then husband, who she says threatened to “ruin” her if she left him. Hereportedlysaid that he was hacked. The pictures showed that Hill and her then husband were involved in a relationship with a younger woman, an employee of Hill’s campaign. She resigned, with a resoundinglast stand of a speechon the floor of the House of Representatives.The fact that Hill’s private photos were published is a tremendous act of violation. But the injustice was complicated by the fact that Hill did have a relationship that she knows was outside the bounds of appropriate behavior. It didn’t break congressional rules, but the relationship tainted Hill’s image as a champion of the #MeToo movement. She apologized, but there was no taking it back. She was the boss. The relationship had been with a staffer. There should have been boundaries. There weren’t. That whole whirlwind—the allegedly abusive partner, the violating pictures, the uneven power dynamic, the perceived sordidness of a non-monogamous relationship—was compressed into one world for the public: scandal.Hill was shamed, blamed, and presumed to be out of politics forever. Not so fast, Hill says. The 31-year-old has a political PAC, called HER Time, that’s dedicated to electing women. She has a new book,She Will Rise, that reads like the best possible combination ofSeventeen Magazineand feminist manifesto. She has a new podcast, cheekily namedNaked Politics. And she has a plan to set women free—a legislative project to aid women and girls in demanding a kind of freedom she has never enjoyed.Glamourasked Hill about life after public shame.It was this crucial time in my life, coming out of the trauma that happened with my ex-husband, and with the photos, and with resigning. And then right after, within two months of when I resigned, my brother passed away. So being able to just sit down and tell my story—it was really therapeutic. I feel like it’s something that I needed to do for myself anyway, even if I hadn’t been able to publish a book. I’m glad that writing the book kind of forced me to do that, because I don’t know if I would have been able to do that otherwise.Yes! It’s almost too strange, there are these experiences that happen to so many people, but they’re all rolled into one with me. I don’t know why during your life you go through things—and I think there’s got to be a reason behind it, and that’s the only way I’ve been able to cope with it all. But I think part of my job is to tell these stories and hope that some of them have an impact on people. There still aren’t very many people in high-profile positions who talk about these things, so I kind of feel obliged to. I mean, I’ve got the scars from my surgery—it’s one of those weird things where it’s like, “How do I have to prove it to you that this happened?”To me, it feels like you have to be able to own it even more. It’s about taking ownership of your own body and your own choices, and that’s hard! It’s a process for me to figure out—what are self-destructive behaviors that come in the wake of all this trauma, versus what are healthy coping ones? I don’t necessarily have a good sense of what a normal sex life for me should look like. I’m just trying to take my time with it, but I’m 100% in on sex positivity. I do get nervous about any BDSM stuff, because of my own experiences with it as it tied into an abusive relationship—but other people doing that in a healthy and safe way? That’s great for them.I tried to put into words our mission as feminists, as warriors, as women, which is to ensure that women are really guaranteed a few basic things—consideration, autonomy, safety, equality, and power. We do need to achieve equal power for any of these things to happen, which means electing women and installing women into positions of power at every level—whether it’s in government, in media, in nonprofits, in the corporate world. And there is a real legislative agenda that can move us in the right direction for all of this. What came out of the book was 10 real legislative goals that have either been composed or passed at the House, or passed at certain state and local levels, but have been blocked at the national level by Republicans. I don’t even think this should be a partisan issue! But it is. With HER Time, the PAC that I started, the overarching goal is to be able to elect women and then push forward this agenda. And I’m hoping we can get that to become a movement.The biggest thing I learned from it is that when I started to campaign, it truly felt like a movement and these people were my friends. That shouldn’t have been the case, because I was paying them. I truly do believe that the #MeToo movement and everything related to the abuse of power is really driven by patriarchy and power over women, so I don’t think the case is the same. But I do think we all have to be taking stock of that, and it’s not something that I did. I didn’t think of myself that way, and that was a mistake. You have to set your clear boundaries from the beginning. More than anything it probably just boils down to: Don’t shit where you eat.Starting three and a half years ago, when I entered the space of becoming a candidate, I really was skyrocketing. I just kept going and going and going up, and then I just fell, like, off a cliff. Now the rebuilding part is slower. It’s like you’re climbing out of a canyon and you’re trying to find the most efficient way out, and also knowing that there’s danger in coming out too fast, but also you’ve got this really strong desire to get out as fast as you can.With the outside parties that were in play, and my ex, I think that I very much came from the mindset of, “I’m not just going to sit here and kind of stew in this and be quiet for any lengthy period of time, I have to get back on my feet.” I’ve been a horseback rider for basically my whole life, and when you fall, the number one thing you’re taught, that’s just drilled into you, is that you have to get right back on. The reasoning behind that is that you get a fear, really quick, it gets instilled in you, and it kind of becomes unbreakable if you don’t immediately get back on. You have to know that youcando it. I think that’s kind of where I am right now—I got back on the horse. I might not ever be at the level where I was before, but I got back on.Samantha and Felicity.Oh, it’s Serena.

Nurses question hospitals’ claims they’re contracting coronavirus in the community instead of at work,-4.33,48.33,https://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/12/nurses-question-hospitals-claims-theyre-contracting-coronavirus-in-the-community-instead-of-at-work.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"Doctor Lauren Baumgardner closes her eyes and takes a moment to make a final adjustment to her mask as she prepares for rounds on the COVID-19 floor at MetroHealth hospital April 21, 2020. Joshua Gunter, cleveland.comJoshua Gunter, cleveland.comCLEVELAND, Ohio – Over the past several months, hospitals have repeatedly said contact tracing shows the doctors, nurses and other health care workers who’ve acquired COVID-19 are largely being infected through community spread.Leaders from the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals made those assertions during a Nov. 16 news briefing where they announced that hundreds of health care workers and other hospital employeeswere sidelined due to the virus. The claim has also been repeated by leaders from other Ohio hospitals who’ve appeared at Gov. Mike DeWine’s coronavirus briefings.Yet those assertions have puzzled and disheartened nurses who are at the front lines of the pandemic.They question how hospitals can pinpoint where they acquired a virus that is so widespread, and they contend it’s just as likely they were infected while treating COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, nurses feel that suggesting they’re getting the virus through community spread insinuates they’re being careless once they’re off the clock.“Every time someone from a hospital is talking, they seem to want to throw in that this is all community spread, that health care workers are not getting [COVID-19] in the hospital,” said Brandon Marlow, a labor representative from the Ohio Nurses Association. “It just seems very curious, why it’s a consistent message they feel they need to give.”Marlow said he isn’t sure why hospitals continue to say employees are being infected outside of work. He assumes it could be related to liability reasons, and said several hospitals have made the same assertions in private meetings with the ONA.However, several of Cleveland’s largest health systems said they are offering paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19 without requiring them to use vacation or paid time off.Data on the topic is scarce, although one study published in The Lancet foundfrontline health care workers were at higher riskfor contracting COVID-19 than the general community.Doug Meredith, an ICU nurse at Cleveland Clinic Akron General, said health care workers who are around coronavirus patients every day know the severity of the virus and take precautions to protect themselves outside of work. He said it’s discouraging to hear hospitals suggest employees are getting infected elsewhere.“I think [nurses] do take it personally. They do feel like their professionalism is being questioned, because of what they do outside of work,” he said. “Because I think we all try to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Cleveland said they trust their employees and do not believe they’re being careless in the community. Instead, they feel the high number of employees who’ve contracted the virus is the result of a spike in infections across Ohio.“Our caregivers are highly professional, and contracting COVID-19 outside the hospital is not a reflection of their professionalism, but a reflection of how contagious this virus can be in the community,” a UH spokesman said.How do they know?Hospitals say they’ve been conducting contact tracing when an employee tests positive for COVID-19 to identify the source of infection. Leadership for the Clinic, MetroHealth and UH said during the Nov. 16 news briefing that the rise in infections among employees largely mirrored the spike in coronavirus cases in Northeast Ohio.But the ONA is skeptical the hospitals can truly identify where and when someone was infected, Marlow said. Even though employees are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking other precautions in the hospital, there’s still a risk they’re being exposed.“What [hospitals] would like to say is that because all these measures are in place, there’s no way somebody could be getting it in the hospital,” he said. “And I don’t know if that’s a conclusion a reasonable person could come to.”Marlow said the ONA has repeatedly asked for data that shows employees are being infected in hospitals but has yet to receive any such proof. The Clinic, MetroHealth and UH did not provide any specific contact-tracing data to cleveland.com.UH said roughly 4.5% of its caregivers have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. That compares favorably to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13.4% of U.S. health care workers have tested positive. Less than 1% of the UH cases have been linked to exposure at work, a spokesman said.All three health systems have said they’ve conducted robust contact tracing and have protocols in place to protect employees, such as temperature checks for visitors, mask requirements and social-distancing measures.Meredith has not tested positive for COVID-19, but some of his colleagues have. He said he’s not aware of any contact tracing that took place after those exposures.Nurses are already dealing with skeptics in the community who claim the virus isn’t that serious and the pandemic is overblown. So it’s frustrating to hear hospitals tell nurses that they’re acquiring it outside of a workplace where they’re constantly interacting with COVID-19 patients, Meredith said.“It’s kind of like you’re hearing it from both ends, and you’re stuck in the middle,” he said. “Sometimes you feel like you’re completely on your own.”The liability questionEarlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in Ohio’s House of Representatives sought to address the issue of workplace liability through H.B. 573, which proposed making COVID-19 an occupational disease under the workers’ compensation law. Rep. Lisa Sobecki of Toledo and Rep. Kristin Boggs of Columbus introduced it March 23, the same day Ohio’s stay-at-home order went into effect.Yet the bill never got a hearing after being referred to the House Insurance Committee on May 5. Sobecki said she isn’t sure why it failed to gain any traction, although the state’s Republican lawmakers have consistently pushed back on any legislation surrounding the coronavirus and evensought to strip DeWine’s authorityto issue statewide public health orders.Sobecki said she’s unaware of any outside lobbying to prevent the bill from becoming law. But she said she heard from constituent groups who supported the legislation, and feels it’s important for Ohio to stand behind the essential workers who’ve put themselves in harm’s way throughout the pandemic.“We haven’t seen bills that help everyday Ohioans in the middle of a pandemic,” she said. “It really saddens me.”She plans to reintroduce a new version of HB 573 once the Ohio Legislature begins a new session in 2021.“This is not going to go away. The pandemic doesn’t stop on Dec. 31,” Sobecki said. “This pandemic is going to continue until we can get the vaccine to Ohioans.”Cleveland health systems said they’ve nevertheless taken steps to support employees who contract COVID-19. The Clinic is giving its employees paid time off if they contract COVID-19, regardless of where they’re infected. Those employees are not required to dip into their own PTO, a Clinic spokeswoman said.“There’s a lot of positive things [the Clinic] is doing as well, to try to take care of workers who are off with COVID,” Meredith acknowledged.UH employees who acquire COVID-19 at work qualify for workers’ comp. If they’re infected through community spread, they may use the health system’s leave and short-term disability programs, a UH spokesman said.Marlow said other Ohio hospitals have similar programs in place to help employees. Those efforts are appreciated, but the ONA also wants hospitals to provide robust contact-tracing data and give more weight to the possibility employees are being infected at work.“I think what makes the most amount of sense is to not pretend once you walk into a hospital, it’s a magical place where it’s no longer the community and you can no longer contract the virus,” Marlow said.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.By using this site, you consent to ourUser Agreementand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with ourPrivacy Policy."

Gun Rights Absolutists Celebrate Martin Luther King Day in Virginia,-10.67,39.0,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/01/19/gun-rights-absolutists-celebrate-martin-luther-king-day-in-virginia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,17,"MONDAY, JANUARY 18, 2021, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — The revolution was occupied by the absurd on Monday. A day officials feared would descend into anti-government violence instead stumbled into a surreal pageant of YouTube celebrities dressed in colorful wigs and clownish outfits interviewing heavily armed militias. All had converged on the state Capitol of Virginia, the gun rights activists openly defying city ordinances a year after Governor Ralph Northam had banned the open display of firearms at protests in the Capitol area.It was a day of calls for unity among disparate groups — Boogaloo Bois, Proud Boys, local militias, and an independent Black Lives Matter gun club — that share no inherent politics except a profound, almost religious reverence for protecting their right to bear arms. They had all come with a clear public relations agenda.The New York Timesand Reuters were there, too, alongside the YouTube personalities, the media far outnumbering police and protestors. Reporters asked grave questions about the state of American democracy. Camera crews from all over — Japan, the Netherlands, France — tailed the milling militias, fascinated by the spectacle of an America fracturing in armed revolt.“It’s all bullshit,” said a reporter, who asked not to be named so his opinion would not break the line of neutrality his news organization prizes. “This is about normalizing guns at protests. The politics of the absurd are a key part of fascism. We’re all buying into it.”Some Virginia residents call this annual protest “Lobby Day,” because it comes early in the General Assembly of Virginia’s annual legislative session. Since 2002, thousands of mostly second-amendment hard-liners, many of whom come armed, swarm the state Capitol, demanding that the government loosen restrictions on guns. Lobby Day was scheduled to coincide each year with Martin Luther King Jr. Day because, as one gun rights site states, “Many people are off work, street parking is free, and the Delegates and Senators are in their offices.”One wonders what the towering civil rights advocate, who preached and practiced nonviolent protest during the 1950s and ’60s, and who was slain with a Remington rifle 52 years ago, might have thought of such a dubious tribute.One mile down the road from the militias, the media throngs, and the BLM gun rights group marching under a “Fred HamptonGun Club” banner, a small and peaceful assembly organized by the local Black Lives Matter chapter was staging a cookout around a 60-foot-tall stone and bronze equestrian statue of General Robert E. Lee.The Confederate commander is now draped in a BLM flag. The statue sits in the middle of a traffic rotunda, which was occupied last summer at the height of the George Floyd protests. The stone base is covered with graffiti reading “BLM” and adorned with portraits of Floyd.These two assemblies, one for gun rights and one for civil rights, have peacefully coexisted since 2002. But this year, with the country on edge two days before the inauguration of Joe Biden, officials mounted an aggressive defense. A brigade of state police circled the street at the base of the state Capitol, perched high on a rolling hill and sectioned off with steel fencing; the lower windows of the Capitol building were boarded with plywood. The National Guard had been activated days in advance. A state police helicopter hovered overhead.But despite all of this, the day began with a brash display of defiance of Richmond’s rule of law. Mike Dunn, the leader of the Virginia faction of the Boogaloo Bois — an extremist group with fantasies of civil war against the government — marched his unit of about a dozen armed troops, clad in Hawaiian shirts and carrying assault-style rifles, to the threshold of the gun-free zone. Dunn then turned to address the crowd of police and armed militia groups, holding a battered “GUN FREE ZONE” sign, which had been ripped from a lamppost, over his head.“This means infringement on our second amendment,” he proclaimed. Then he threw the sign at the feet of a police officer, who did not react. “This means we don’t care,” he added.A reporter in the crowd asked what would happen if the police arrested them for breaking the local gun laws. “We will exercise our second amendment the way it was intended to prevent that from happening. We will defend ourselves. I hope that paints a picture for you.”The police stood idly by as Dunn turned and commanded his unit to pass through the gun-free zone and up the hill to the fences encircling the Capitol. Some of the officers shifted uncomfortably, others looked on with loathing, though most just presented blank stares.But the final battle would be for media attention. Mike Dickinson, who owns a local strip club and consistently fails to be elected to Richmond’s 1st District City Council, marched into the rally spewing anti-government rhetoric, shouting through his bullhorn that the boarded-up Capitol “looks like a ghetto.” A wannabe YouTube celebrity named Crackhead Barney, who earns views from her 800 subscribers by attending far-right events and asking absurd questions, trailed close behind him.Performing for her camera crew, Barney did three takes of her opening act, pulling an American flag from her underwear. Then she approached the Boogaloo Bois for an interview as they stood calmly in armed formation with police ranked behind them. When I asked why they chose to pose in front of the police, a Boogaloo Boi named Peezy said casually to me, “We thought it would be a meme-able picture. Plus, I think a lot of them are glad we’re openly defying gun laws in their city.”Barney approached Dunn, and in front of her camera crew and about 30 other journalists, asked, “So, why are you here?”The Boogaloo Bois leader spoke in the sly, quick vernacular ofthe internet culture that birthed their movement. He was well equipped to match the absurdity of Crackhead Barney.“We’re here to support an armed revolution against the government,” Dunn said matter-of-factly.“That’s scary,” she replied, adding that she, as a black woman, would be arrested for saying the same.Dunn cocked his head. “Can you do me a favor?” he asked. “I want you to say it.”For a brief moment, Crackhead Barney broke character, analyzing the risk of what she was about to say. She then snapped back into it.“I want to do an armed revolution against the government,” she said into the camera. ❖"

What Was the Debt-Ceiling Showdown Really All About?,10.67,29.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/what-was-the-debt-ceiling-showdown-really-all-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,17,"The Western liberal tradition to which we belong has as it foundation two things: proportional representation of the will of the people and capitalism.Both are equally as important. One cannot survive without the other. Yes, the Europeans may be a bit more socialist leaning, but democracy has never survived true socialism or communism. And there are no precedents for capitalism flourishing in systems that reject proportional representation.In essence, any vote against capitalism—that is, capitalism at its core, not its regulatory edges—is anti-democratic. And vice versa. Yet, voting against capitalism is what what the entire Republican Senate minority just did.No thing, and no person, has economic value in a vacuum. All value—like all motion—is relative. Value (and thus price) is the relationship of one thing to another.The entire discipline of what we call “finance” is an exercise in making relative valuations. But to start, finance had to settle on a reference point—a “risk free” thing which could be used as a yardstick for everything else, so that everything else can be priced accordingly. While everyone knows there is no such thing as a “risk free” investment in an absolute sense, the mechanism that finance chose made sense: government bonds. In particular, U.S government bonds. And in even more particular, the 10 year Treasury yield.Every mortgage, every auto loan, every wage—everythingis priced relative to the value of the risk-free rate—the U.S. 10 year Treasury yield.The reason why government bonds are considered risk free is because they, by definition, are. A bond is an obligation of a country to pay a holder of that obligation at a future date. That obligation is met through something else owned by the country—meaning currency. It is impossible for a country to default on its own bonds, because it could just create more currency to meet the obligations.Which means that there is only one way to default on sovereign debt—willfully.But the debt!Perhaps one of the most disingenuous (but effective) arguments put forward in modern politics was the case for conservative “fiscal responsibility.”You have to manage your own debt, so why shouldn’t the government?That line makes sense to people. Building on this parochial bedrock, conservatives flirted many times with the idea of the businessman-president until finally nominating Donald Trump, a bankruptcies vitamin hawker who played the role of businessman on TV.Under President Trump the size of governmentgrew to its largest levels since the 1960s. Never mind the fact governments probably shouldn’t be run like a business, or a household because it turns out that there is no constituency for fiscal conservatism. Despite what conservatives have said for 40 years, their revealed preference is clearly for bigger government and more spending.And you know what? As a policy matter, that’s okay.Can debt grow so large it topples the financial order? Sure.But as of 2021, in sum, the United States has a net worth (assets-liabilities) of $132 trillion.The Biden administration’s proposal to take on $3.5 trillion of national debt over 10 years to reduce significantly the greatest risk to our mature civilization—which is wealth inequality—would lower America’s national net worth by around 2.25 percent. That’s it.We would be spending 2.25 percent in order to cut child poverty in half. Would you as an individual donate 2.25 percent of your personal net worth to cut child poverty in half? I bet you would. I bet you would even donate 2.25 percent of your net worth over a 10 year period to cut child poverty in half for just one family. Prices are relative and this price isn’t all that high relative to the good we’d be purchasing.Of course, there could be side effects. The plan might not cut child poverty in half. There could be inflation. There may be prudential reasons not to enact it. But to argue that the size is so onerous is wrong-headed.Back to willful default. The Senate Republicans who now fashion themselves as champions of fiscal responsibility were willing to turn the risk free rate—on whicheveryasset is priced—into a non-risk free rate by refusing to raise the debt ceiling.They were voting for America to default. This isn’t just hypocritical. It is also another attack on democracy. Because if the risk free rate had been made risky, then then financial calamity would have been unspeakable. Because again: Functioning democracy is intertwined with functioning capital markets.During the first and second Trump impeachments, a number of Republicans voted to remove Trump, and so we thought,Hey, as long as we have Mitt Romney and the others, there’s hope.But the problem is that these Republicans aren’t thinking expansively enough about democracy. About what democracy is. About what democracy requires. It’s not just rejecting Donald Trump’s cult of personality. It’s understanding and supporting the policies which make democracy possible. Even when such support runs counter to the party’s daily marching orders.All 50 Republicans in the Senate voted not to raise the debt ceiling and therefore willfully default on America’s debt. That vote was just as antithetical to a functioning democracy as was the votes to decertify the election results on January 6.For democracy and capitalism to survive, they need each other. And we need a better class of Republicans. Even the “good Republicans.”Who is always right? Sarah? JVL? Or do you Beg to Differ? Show your support with Bulwark merchandise. Whichever side you choose, we’ll be back tomorrow, and we’ll do this all over again."

How You Can Help Get Justice for Breonna Taylor's Death,-5.0,46.67,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a32477844/breonna-taylor-police-shooting-kentucky/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-04,17,"At the end of 2020, Louisville Metro PD reportedly notified two officers, who were involved in the death of Breonna Taylor, of their termination. Detective Myles Cosgrove, one of the officers who shot Taylor, and Detective Joshua Jaynes, who helped plan the raid, have now both officially been fired. A Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson confirmed the news, viaNPR.According to the outlet, interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry signed the letters of termination. On the same day, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced that Erika Shields will be LMPD's next police chief following her role as Chief of the Atlanta PD.Both Jaynes, whoreportedlysupplied false information in the search warrant, and Cosgrove, who fired dozens of rounds into Taylor's home, have 10 days to appeal their termination. Cosgrove and Jaynes have both been on paid administrative reassignment since March 13th. Previously, a grand jury indicted only officer Brett Hankison, who was charged with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment and fired in June.On Friday, the Kentucky attorney general’s office released recordings of the grand jury proceedings in theBreonna Taylor case. There is roughly 15 hours of audio in the recordings, but asThe New York Timesnoted, the statements or recommendations from prosecutors to jurors about what charges the officers should receive were not included in the recordings.Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky attorney general who handled the case said the statements  ""were not recorded, as they are not evidence."" The Times reports that Cameron insists the jurors were given ""all the evidence.""The recordings come after a jurorspoke outabout why no one received a direct charge in the case.More than six months after police shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her Kentucky apartment, a Jefferson County grand jury decided to indict one of the three officers involved. Former officer Brett Hankinson has been charged with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment, a Class D felony in the state,for shooting into a neighboring apartment. As the New YorkTimesclarifies, none of the officers involved were charged for causing Taylor's death, and according toThe Appeal, a Class D felony is punishable by between one and five years in prison.Taylor, who worked as an emergency medical technician, was in her Kentucky apartment with her boyfriend when police attempted what has beenreferred toas a “botched” search warrant execution. Her family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and hired Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney who is also representing the families ofGeorge FloydandAhmaud Arbery. TheLouisville Courier-Journalreports that the city will pay Taylor's family a $12 million settlement in the lawsuit, said to be the largest in the city's history and one of the top in U.S. history. Crumphad previously calledfor charges of second-degree manslaughter in Taylor's case and has sincesaidthe indictment is ""outrageous and offensive.""Prior to the grand jury's announcement, the Louisville mayorannounceda countywide curfew, and the interim chief of policedeclareda state of emergency for the Louisville Metro Police Department. Across the nation,protestors had preparedfor the announcement, setting up events in various cities.Now, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said that on Wednesdayhe will be releasing the recordingfrom the grand jury proceedings in Taylor's case. The decision comes after an anonymous grand jury member in the case filed a motion to have the records released; the judge at Hankinson's hearing also ordered that the recording be entered into the court record.Back in May, Crump toldThe Washington Post,“They’re killing our sisters just like they’re killing our brothers, but for whatever reason, we have not given our sisters the same attention that we have given to Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Stephon Clark, Terence Crutcher, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Laquan McDonald. Breonna’s name should be known by everybody in America who said those other names, because she was in her own home, doing absolutely nothing wrong.” He continued, “Ifyou ranfor Ahmaud, you need to stand for Bre.”Below, what you need to know about Taylor’s case, her family's settlement from the city, and how you can help right now.In the early morning, police officers came to Taylor’s apartment where she was asleep with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker. According to theAssociated Press, police had a warrant to search Taylor’s apartment as part of a drug investigation, though the family’s lawsuit states the suspect in the investigation had already been detained at the time of the search. Police believed one of the suspects was using Taylor’s apartment to “receive mail, keep drugs, or stash money earned from the sale of drugs,” per theLouisville Courier-Journal.The suitstatesTaylor and Walker believed the plainclothes police were breaking into the apartment since they entered “without knocking and without announcing themselves as police officers.” A judge had signed a “no-knock” provision for the police, meaning they were able to go into Taylor’s apartment without identifying themselves, thoughpolice claimthey did. Walker shot at a police officer in what he says was self-defense. Police then fired into the apartment, hitting Taylor. The suit says Taylor was unarmed and Walker had a license to carry. The lawsuit filed by Taylor’s family also states that neighbors have confirmed the police did not knock or identify themselves before entering. An FBI ballistics lab later found that Myles Cosgrove was the officer to fire the fatal shot at Taylor, theCourier-Journalreports. However, a state ballistics test ""was inconclusive.""One officer was shot in the leg, and Walker was arrested andchargedwith assault and attempted murder of a police officer. Prosecutors have sincedismissedthe charges. TheAssociated Pressreports that no drugs were found in the apartment, and Taylor and Walker had no prior criminal history or drug convictions.New audio was released in July, revealing interviews with police and Walker,perNBC. In the interview, Walker is heard recounting the night of March 13th and the events that led to his girlfriend's death.""It's a loud boom at the door,"" he said. ""First thing she said was, 'Who is it?' No response. We both get up, start putting on clothes, another knock at the door. She's like, 'Who is it?' Loud, at the top of her lungs. No response. I grab my gun, which is legal, like I'm licensed to carry, everything. I've never even fired my gun outside of a range. I'm scared to death."" He added that Taylor yelled ""at the top of her lungs"" again to ask who was there. ""No response, no anything."" He said Taylor put on clothes to answer the door, but then it came ""off the hinges.""He continued: ""I just let off one shot. Like, I still can't see who it is or anything. So now the door's, like, flying open. I let off one shot, and then all of a sudden there's a whole lot of shots and we like we both just dropped to the ground.""In an interview, Sgt. Mattingly, who broke down Taylor's door with officers Cosgrove and Hankison, said: ""The first banging on the door, [we] did not announce."" He said, ""I think after that we did. ... After that, each one of them said, 'Police, come to the door. Search warrant. Police, search warrant.'""In his interview, Walker said he did not hear this: ""All I can hear is a knock at the door."" He said, ""Even if somebody was saying something on the other side, you probably couldn't hear them. But as loud as we were screaming to say who it is, I know whoever will be on the other side of the door could hear us.""In June, Mayor Greg Fischerconfirmedthat Hankison, one of the three officers, would be fired from the Louisville Metro Police. The other officers involved are on administrative reassignment.""I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,"" the department's interim police chief, Robert Schroeder,wrote in a letterto Hankison. ""I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. The result of your action seriously impedes the Department's goal of providing the citizens of our city with the most professional law enforcement agency possible. I cannot tolerate this type of conduct by any member of the Louisville Metro Police Department. Your conduct demands your termination."" Schroeder also added in his letter that Hankison had been disciplined for reckless conduct in early 2019. According to theNew York Times, Hankison appealed his firing but the hearing will be delayed until a criminal investigation is completed.Fischer named new interim police chief Yvette Gentry on September 27th, the first Black woman to serve as Louisville's police chief, perWDRB. She'll replace former police chief Schroeder, who is retiring. ""This is going to signal some change. A new day is coming,"" Gentry said at a press conference,CNNreports. She'll hold the position for no more than six months and hasn't applied for the job permanently. The mayor also said body cameras will now be required when executing a search warrant, and there will be a new civilian review board for ""police disciplinary matters,"" according to theNew York Times.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear had said the local prosecutor, state attorney general, and federal prosecutor assigned to the region should review the results of the police investigation.Voxreports: “On June 29, the Louisville Metro Council also announced a resolution to investigate the actions of Mayor Greg Fischer and his administration surrounding Taylor’s death.”In regards to the grand jury's decision, on September 28, an anonymous grand jury member filed a motion to have the jury's records and sealed transcripts released, according toNBC News. The anonymous juror also asked for permission to speak publicly about the proceedings.In the motion, the grand juror states that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron ""attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to them,"" though the jurorswere not offeredthe option to charge the other two officers. The motion states, ""Using the grand jurors as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for these decisions only sows more seeds of doubt in the process while leaving a cold chill own the spine of future grand jurors.""Previously,Cameron had said in a news conferencethat the grand jury agreed with his team's investigation, saying, ""While there are six possible homicide charges under Kentucky law, these charges are not applicable to the facts before us because our investigation showed, and the grand jury agreed, that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in the return of deadly fire after having been fired upon.""After Hankinson pleaded not guilty this Monday, the judge at his hearingalso orderedthat the grand jury recording be entered into the court record. (Taylor's family hadalso previously askedfor the grand jury details to be released.) Shortly after the motion was filed, Cameronannouncedhe would release the recordings on Wednesday and that the juror was free to share ""their thoughts on our presentation.""TheNew YorkTimesreportsthat Elizabeth Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said in a statement, ""Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.""Taylor’s family filed a lawsuit accusing the officers of wrongful death, excessive force, and gross negligence, according toTheWashington Post. It was reported on September 15 byLouisville Courier-Journalreports that the city of Louisville will pay a $12 million settlement to the Taylor family. ""I am deeply, deeply sorry for Breonna's death,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a press conference, surrounded by the Taylor family and their lawyers, per the outlet.The settlement also hasmultiple police reform mandates, including a demand that all search warrants be approved with a judge prior to their use by officers. Other measures include the establishment of a housing credit program to motivate officers to live in the areas they serve over and the utilization of social workers on specific police runs. ""The city's response in this case has been delayed and it's been frustrating, but the fact that they've been willing to sit down and talk significant reform was a step in the right direction and hopefully a turning point,"" attorney Sam Aguilartold CNN.Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said the settlement is only one step in the continued pursuit of justice for Breonna.""Her beautiful spirit and personality is working through all of us on the ground, so please continue to say her name: Breonna Taylor,"" Palmer said of her daughter, viaCNN.In early June, the Louisville Metro Council's Public Safety Committeeapproveda new ordinance called ""Breonna's Law"" that would make it so ""no-knock"" warrants could only be sought if there's ""imminent threat of harm or death"" and would also be limited to ""offenses including murder, hostage-taking, kidnapping, terrorism, human trafficking and sexual trafficking,"" per theCourier-Journal.On June 11th, all 26 members of the Louisville Metro Councilvotedto pass the ban, which prohibits any search warrant that doesn't require police to verbally announce themselves and their purpose at the property. ""Breonna's Law"" also states that any Louisville Metro Police Department or Metro law enforcement must knock and wait a minimum of 15 seconds for a response, according toNBC News. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischersignedthe ordinance on June 12th.After the ordinance was passed, Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer said, ""I'm just going to say that Breonna, that's all she wanted to do was save lives. So with this law, she'll get to continue to do that,"" perNBC News.Nearly three months after Taylor's death, the Louisville Police Department released a four-page incident report from March 13th. You canread the report here, although there isn't much to see—and what's there runs contrary to what we know about the night Taylor was killed by police.The report details the location (with partially redacted address), age (with redacted birth date), and full name of the victim. (TheCourier-Journalnotes that both Taylor's address and date of birth have been ""widely reported"" already.) Charges are listed as ""death investigation — LMBD involved."" Mattingly, 47; Cosgrove, 42; and Hankison, 44 (ages reported via theCourier-Journal) are listed as the three officers who fatally shot Taylor. Hankison is alsoundergoing a sexual assault investigationafter allegations by at least two women.Beyond that, rows of information are left blank and there are two major inaccuracies regarding the night Taylor was killed. The department's report lists her injuries as ""none,"" even though she was shot at least eight times by the officers. The ""no"" box is checked under ""forced entry,"" even though police are believed to have used a battering ram to break through Taylor's door.According to theCourier-Journal, the Louisville police department blamed discrepancies on the reporting program. A statement from the department said, ""Inaccuracies in the report are unacceptable to us, and we are taking immediate steps to correct the report and to ensure the accuracy of incident reports going forward.""After the grand jury decision, Taylor’s sister Ju’Niyah Palmerposted an Instagramof her and Breonna with the caption: ""sister i am so sorry 🥺"" She also wrote on her Instagram Story: ""sister, you was failed by a system you worked hard for and i am so sorry""In a May 2020 interviewwith theWashington Post, Taylor’s mother Tamika Palmer said she first found out something was wrong when she got a call from Walker, who said he thought someone was trying to break into the apartment. He then said, “I think they shot Breonna.”“I want justice for her,” Tamika said. “I want them to say her name. There’s no reason Breonna should be dead at all.”Tamika also told theCourier-Journalthat Taylor was working on plans for her future: ""She had a whole plan on becoming a nurse and buying a house and then starting a family. Breonna had her head on straight, and she was a very decent person.""In a separate interview with theWashington Post, Ju’Niyah said: “She was my person. I was her shadow.” She said, “Mostly at night is when I can really think, and I have moments—like, I’ll cry, but I haven’t grieved it, if that makes sense. I still don’t want to face it.”Writer Cate Young started the #BirthdayForBreonna campaign,compiling a list of action itemspeople can do to commemorate Taylor's life. Young told Refinery29, ""Very often when we have these moments where these stories [of police violence] bubble up, it's usually because several cases happen in a short proximity of time, and when women are involved their names get erased. . . It was frustrating because her life mattered, too, and I wanted to make sure that we were acknowledging that she deserves justice just as much.""AChange.org petitioncalling for justice in Taylor's death was signed by 11.4 million people, the second highest number ever for a petition on the site, according toCNN.Here, just some of the other ways you can help get justice for Breonna Taylor:According to theCourier-Journal, Louisville Metro Council member Bill Hollander said he has received thousands of messages to his email and that his voicemail fills up multiple times a day with people asking to fire and charge the officers involved. Governor Beshear has also reportedly received thousands of emails, voice messages, and cards.Some Louisville activists have also taken more extreme measures in their fight for justice, includinggoing on a hunger striketo demand all three officers are fired and stripped of pension benefits. Other protestors from the Until Freedom grouporganizeda sit-in on Attorney General Cameron’s front lawn.This post will continue to be updated."

"Catholic hospitals can't be forced to perform gender transition surgeries, court rules",3.33,43.67,https://www.christianpost.com/us/federal-court-halts-hhs-mandate-on-gender-transition-surgeries.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-christian-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,17,"A federal court in North Dakota has ruled that a group of Catholic hospitals and others should not be required by the Department of Health and Human Services to perform gender transition procedures, including those for minors.U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in North Dakotaissued a ruling Tuesdayin the case ofSisters of Mercy, et al. v. Azar.Welte, appointed to the federal judiciary by President Donald Trump in 2019, granted permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiffs and concluded that they are exempted from an HHS rule known as the “Transgender Mandate.” He cited the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.“The Catholic Plaintiffs have demonstrated an entitlement to permanent injunctive relief. An RFRA violation is comparable to the deprivation of a First Amendment right,” wrote Welte.“Having weighed the pertinent factors, the Court will permanently enjoin the Defendants from enforcing the successfully challenged interpretations of federal law against the Catholic Plaintiffs.”The decision prevents HHS from “implementing regulations thereto against the Catholic Plaintiffs in a manner that would require them to perform or provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures, including by denying federal financial assistance because of their failure to perform or provide insurance coverage for such procedures or by otherwise pursuing, charging, or assessing any penalties, fines, assessments, investigations, or other enforcement actions.”In 2016, the Obama administration implemented a new regulation through the Affordable Care Act commonly known as the “Transgender Mandate.”The regulation required that healthcare providers perform gender transition procedures, even on minors, even if they hold religious objections to the controversial practice.In response, a group of Catholic entities filed a lawsuit against HHS over the regulation. Those groups include an order called the Sisters of Mercy, two Sacred Heart Mercy Health Care Center clinics; SMP Health System and the North Dakota-based University of Mary.The Catholic plaintiffs were represented by Becket Law, a legal nonprofit that specializes in religious liberty cases and has argued litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court.“The court’s decision recognizes our medical heroes’ right to practice medicine in line with their conscience and without politically motivated interference from government bureaucrats,"" Becket Senior Counsel Luke Goodrich said in a statement.Under the Trump administration, HHS broadened the exemptions for the regulation in 2020. However, these changes were complicated by the Supreme Court decisionBostock v. Clayton County, which concluded that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to sexual orientation and gender identity even though neither category is specifically mentioned in federal discrimination law.In his opinion, Welte decided that theBostockruling did not fully return HHS to the 2016 version of the rule, noting that in the Supreme Court “separately expressed continued commitment to safeguarding employers’ religious convictions.”Welte is the second federal judge to rule against the HHS mandate.In 2019, Judge Reed O’Connor of Texas, an appointee of President George W. Bush,struck downthe mandate after a lawsuit was filed on the behalf of healthcare providers in five states that are members of the Franciscan Alliance as well as the Christian Medical & Dental Associations and Specialty Physicians of Illinois.Follow Michael Gryboski onTwitterorFacebook"

The U.S. Refuses to Give Up Its Colonies,-20.67,32.0,https://progressive.org/dispatches/us-refuses-to-give-up-colonies-hunt-200805/,https://adfontesmedia.com/progressive-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,17,"Several Supreme Court justices maderacist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy.The representatives of the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands presented a united front as they called on Congress to either help them move toward independence or grant them the same rights as the residents of the fifty states. These include full voting rights, equal representation in Congress, and equal treatment under the law.It’s not at all an outlandish idea. Michael F. Q. San Nicolas, theU.S. Representativeof Guam,saidduring the hearing that the U.S. government should be “graduating its territories into whole parts of it or setting them free.”Today, the United States controls five inhabited island territories: Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The people of American Samoa are U.S. nationals, and the inhabitants of the four other territories are U.S. citizens.The five territories are integral parts of the United States, populated by Americans who have proven their dedication to their country. Territory residents inGuamandAmerican Samoaserve in the military at much higher rates than those in the states. The territories are also home to more than100,000 veterans.Still, the Americans who live in these territories are denied basic rights that most citizens take for granted. They are not represented in the Senate, and their Representatives in the House cannot vote on legislation. They are not even allowed to vote for the Presidents who might send them to war.The territories also experience significant economic disadvantages, receiving fewer benefits from federal programs such asMedicaidand theSupplemental Security Incomeprogram. All five territories have a lower per-capita income than the average per-capita income of the fifty states and the District of Columbia.The “lack of equal representation and equal voting power has a direct correlation to persistent poverty across all of the U.S. territories,” Stacey E. Plaskett, the representative of the U.S. Virgin Islands,testifiedat the hearing. “Americans living in the territories are accustomed to being last in line: for hurricane relief, for COVID-19 equipment, for basic health care, education, and more.”The five island territories were relegated to their subordinate status by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1900s by what became known as theInsular Cases. By creating a new status for the territories called “unincorporated territories,” the court made it possible for the United States to control the islands without granting their inhabitants equal rights under the Constitution.Several Supreme Court justices maderacist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy.“Those decisions were explicitly informed by racial assumptions,” Plaskett says. They “have created a near permanent colonial status for those living in the territory.”Notably, many of the justices who ruled on the Insular Cases also ruled in theinfamousPlessy v. Fergusoncase, which created the “separate but equal” doctrine that provided the legal basis for segregation in the South. Although the Supreme Court later overruled thePlessy v. Fergusondecision, it has let the basic logic of the Insular Cases stand, continuing the legal basis for the territories’ colonial status.Critics argue that the racist thinking that informed the Supreme Court’s original arguments continues to shape the way officials in Washington view the territories today.“It is not a mere coincidence that more than 98 percent of territorial residents are racial or ethnic minorities,”saysNeil Weare, the president and founder ofEqually American, an organization that advocates for equal rights for the people of the territories.For the past several years, Weare has been working through Equally American with the goal of getting the Supreme Court to overturn the Insular Cases. In one of his major cases,Fitisemanu v. United States, Weare argues that people born in the territories have a constitutional right to citizenship.“Until the Insular Cases are overruled, the federal government will continue relying on them to justify discrimination against residents of the territories,” he insists.In the meantime, representatives of the U.S. territories have been urging Congress to exercise its power by passingH.R.1, a bill that would create a Congressional Task Force to recommend ways of providing the residents of the territories with equal voting and representation rights.The bill, which the House passed last year, acknowledges that “political participation and the right to vote are among the highest concerns of territorial residents in part because they were not always afforded these rights.”While the billlanguishesin the Senate, the people in the territories continue to endure second-class status. Though they constitute a larger population than the combined populations of the five smallest states, they lack voting rights or representation.“The nearly four million people who live in U.S. territory are not the subjects of a king or a master,” PlaskettremindedCongress. “Their interests will not be fully represented within the government of the United States until they have full and equal voting rights, just like other Americans.”Edward Hunt writes about war and empire.

"Sexual assault and harassment prevention program ‘hasn’t achieved its mandate,’ says Army secretary",0.0,49.33,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/11/18/sexual-assault-and-harassment-prevention-program-hasnt-achieved-its-mandate-says-army-secretary/,https://adfontesmedia.com/army-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,17,"An independent review of Fort Hood’s command climate is complete and its findings are slated to be released Dec. 8, butArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthysaid an initial look at the report reveals shortcomings that must be addressed.The report was compiled by a team of personnel from outside the Department of the Army who were tasked with examining the command climate and culture at Fort Hood and its surrounding community in central Texas.“My preliminary review of the report, recent cases and recent media coverage, have hardened my belief that the Army’s SHARP program hasn’t achieved its mandate to eliminate sexual assaults and sexual harassment by creating a climate that respects the dignity of every member of the Army family,” McCarthy said in a video statement Wednesday afternoon.Army leadership intends to also release an action plan to address the review’s recommendations when it’s released next month.The Army’sSexual Harassment/Assault Response and Preventionprogram, or SHARP, has been under scrutiny in recent months following the death of Spc. Vanessa Guillen, a Fort Hood soldier who prosecutors say was murdered in an armory on post by a fellow 3rd Cavalry Regiment trooper.Guillen’s family said she had been sexually harassed by a fellow soldier prior to her death, but she didn’t report the incident for fear of retribution. Following those allegations, Army Forces Command sent a small team in June to specifically look at theSHARP program on Fort Hood.FORSCOM’s review found that the post’s SHARP program overall meets Army standards. But the team also found that 18 out of the 52 women surveyed on post, about one-third, reported being sexually harassed. That number concerned lawmakers and prompted questions about whether the standards of success for SHARP programs need to be changed.TheGovernment Accountability Officeannounced in late August that it would review the Army’s SHARP program, as well, following complaints from members of Congress who sought more answers.Natalie Khawam, an attorney representing the Guillen family, said McCarthy’s comments “corroborated what I have been emphasizing.”Khawam drafted a piece of legislation called the Vanessa Guillen Act, which would create an independent system to investigate both sexual harassment and sexual assault incidents. It would also provide independent charging decisions for courts-martial.“Victims like Vanessa Guillen, who suffered from sexual harassment and assault while serving our country, were failed by the system,” Khawam told Army Times. “In September Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi has promised to schedule our bill for a vote. We have patiently been waiting for her to tell us the date.”In his comments on video Wednesday, McCarthy said that it is “abundantly clear” that Army leaders must do more with regards to sexual harassment and assault investigations.“I am deeply saddened and concerned by the recent news reports of how sexual assault and sexual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to our soldiers,” McCarthy said in the video statement Wednesday. “Leaders, regardless of rank, are accountable for what happens in their units and must have the courage to speak up and intervene when they recognize actions that bring harm to our soldiers and to the integrity of our institution.”McCarthy did not elaborate on which media reports he was referring to specifically, but Guillen’s case has sparked hundreds of survivors to come forward to sharestories of sexual traumain the military.Some of those stories were chronicled this week by CBS Evening News, which interviewed nearly two dozen victims and several whistle-blowers who worked for the SHARP programs as part of a series aired Tuesday.The problems at Fort Hood, however, go beyond issues related to sexual assault and harassment. The post has been plagued this year with a number of violent deaths that set it apart from other installations.Severalof thedeaths that involve foul playinvolveviolence against soldiersstationed there by civilians in the local community.“The numbers are high here,” McCarthy said during a visit to Fort Hood in early August. “They are the highest, in most cases, for sexual assault and harassment and murders for our entire formation — the U.S. Army.”Kyle Rempfer was an editor and reporter who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents.

"Chicago Public Schools Reverse Course, Plan to Start Year With Full Remote Learning",-2.8,52.6,https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2020-08-05/chicago-public-schools-reverse-course-plan-to-start-year-with-full-remote-learning,https://adfontesmedia.com/u-s-news-and-world-report-bias-reliability/,2020-08-05,17,"Officials announced Wednesday that Chicago Public Schools will start its school year with full remote instruction through at least the first quarter, as the nationwide debate continues over whether to reopen schools to in-person learning amid the coronavirus pandemic.The public school system – one of the largest in the country, serving more than 350,000 students across more than 600 schools – last month announced a hybrid model in which most students would have returned to classrooms two days a week,according to WGN-TV. Now, the school year will start virtually on Sept. 8, as officialsconsult with public health expertsand consider whether to welcome students back in a hybrid fashion starting Nov. 9.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement Wednesday that the decision was ""rooted in public health data and the invaluable feedback"" received as officials polled families on their concerns leading up to an ultimate decision previously planned for the end of August. But two Chicago Public Schools leaders, Chief Executive Officer Janice Jackson and Chief Education Officer LaTanya McDade,said in a statementthat they decided to make the call now to afford parents and families ""ample time to plan.""""As educators and dedicated education professionals, we all want students to be in school, but at this time, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) believes that current COVID-19 transmission trends would not allow us to reopen schools in a safe and responsible manner given the sheer number of people we serve every day,"" Jackson and McDade said.The announcement comes as the debate over whether schools should open amid the pandemic is intensifying ahead of the traditional start to the school year across the country.President Donald Trump, who has long lobbied for students to return to school, in a Wednesday interview on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" repeated claims that children are ""virtually immune"" from COVID-19.""If you look at children, children are almost – and I would almost say definitely – but almost immune from this disease,"" Trump said.An increasing number of public school systems – such as those in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles – have announced plans to at least start their school year with virtual learning. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers,said last weekthat the union is considering strikes if schools fail to adhere to best reopening practices."
Long COVID poses a subtle workplace crisis as sufferers say they're working longer hours and feel more stressed,0.0,45.0,https://www.businessinsider.com/long-covid-work-crisis-longer-hours-stress-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,17,"Long COVID may pose a workplace crisis, as new data offers a snapshot into how sufferers feel the impact on their working lives.Those self reporting symptoms of long COVID say they are working longer hours than before and in general have higher levels of anxiety.Some feel like they don't have anyone to talk to about their symptoms,according to the latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).There are two stages to the condition that is clinically diagnosed as long COVID, according to the British Lung foundation.Symptoms that last for between four and 12 weeks is known as Ongoing Symptomatic COVID-19. Symptoms that last for more than 12 weeks — and are unexplained by another diagnosis — are referred to as Post COVID Syndrome.Symptoms reported by sufferers can vary in their type and severity and include breathlessness, fatigue and aches and painsamong a variety of others.For the ONS survey, 39,268 UK adults aged 16 and above were polled to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on British society between April 7 and June 13.In total 6.2% of adults said that they had experienced symptoms of long COVID — that included 2.6% who said they were unsure.A tenth said that they had tested positive, but had not suffered any chronic symptoms.The survey covered self-reported symptons of long Covid, rather than those whose conditions had been clinically diagnosed.Of those who reported long-term symptoms, 44% said that it had affected their day-to-day work either through their ability to do their job or through other factors like having to work from home. Some 30% said that this impact had been negative.There has been an increase all around, with 36% saying they had not experienced long COVID but had felt the impact of the coronavirus on their working lives.But it's long COVID sufferers who were more likely to say that they worked longer hours as a result of the pandemic than those with no symptoms (25% versus 21%).Their mental health is also generally worse (40% compared to 30%). The majority, 65%, said that they felt more stressed and anxious as a result of their long term condition — compared to 59% for those without chronic symptoms.A quarter feel like they have no one to talk to about the condition. A further 25% say they feel like a burden on others.Other UK government studies have estimated that as many as2 million people had had COVID-19 symptoms that lasted at least 12 weeks by February 2021.Global numbers are hazier, but theWorld Health Organisation estimated in February that one in 10 people who catch COVID-19 could suffer long term symptoms."

"Mitch McConnell Calls ""Loony Lies"" Promoted By Marjorie Taylor Greene A ""Cancer"" To The GOP",-11.67,33.67,https://nowthisnews.com/politics/mitch-mcconnell-calls-loony-lies-promoted-by-marjorie-taylor-greene-a-cancer-to-the-gop,https://adfontesmedia.com/nowthis-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,16,"Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY)seemed to call outRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA)“loony lies” as a “cancer” to the Republican Party. Without naming her directly, the Senate minority leader said in a statement on Mondayreported by The Hillthat someone who supports the conspiracy theories Greene has promoted is “not living in reality” and is not using their time in Congress to focus on helping American families.“Somebody who’s suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.’s airplane is not living in reality,” McConnell reportedly said in the statement. “This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.”Greene responded Monday night by tweeting, “The real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully.”Social media posts have recently surfaced showcasing the wide range of conspiracy theories that Greene has supported.She has liked or favorited posts that call for the murder of various Democratic politicians. She has suggested that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a government conspiracy and that the California wildfires were started by a laser beam from spaceoperated by Jewish bankers. A recently surfaced video shows herharassing Parkland survivor and gun reform activist David Hoggjust weeks after the mass shooting, calling him a “coward” and claiming he was being funded by billionaire George Soros.House Democrats have said they are ready to move forward with removing Greene from any committees in the House of Representatives if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) does not take action and strip the representative of her assignments. In 2019, the GOP stripped then- Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of assignments after he inquired how language like white supremacy “became offensive”during an interviewwith The New York Times.“Republican members will have the chance to distance themselves from her,” columnist Michelle Goldbergwrote in The Times. “If they don’t, it will be because they know she belongs.”Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) has 61 co-sponsors on a resolution to expel Greene from Congress, which he hopes to introduce this week, according to his spokesperson. A two-thirds majority vote is required for such an expulsion, which is why it rarely happens — but it has happened before. Roll Callreportsthat 20 members of Congress have been expelled in the past, with the most recent example being the late former Rep. James Traficant Jr. (D-OH), expelled in 2002 after he was convicted on 10 felony counts including bribery, racketeering, and fraud.McConnell is one of a small handful of GOP lawmakers who have spoken out against the QAnon-promoting Greene, though pressure has been mounting for other Republicans to respond. The Senate minority leader had earlier signaled potential support for and then ambiguity regarding voting to impeach former President Donald Trump, whose Senate trial begins next week. McConnell, one of Trump’s most powerful allies through his entire presidency,blamed the ex-presidentfor provoking the deadly mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6. But then he was one of 45 Republicans who voted last week in support of dismissing the trial.Separately, McConnellgave a statement to CNNdefending Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), one of10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trumpin January. Trump loyalists in the GOPhave been callingfor Cheney, who voted with the ex-president nearly 93% of the time, to be stripped of her third-ranking position in the party. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)traveled to Wyomingto call for voters to force her out of office in 2022.""Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on them,"" McConnell said in the statement to CNN. ""She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for her service and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation."""

“Birds of Prey” a showcase for Harley Quinn,0.0,33.0,https://www.theeveningtimes.com/theeveningtimes/2020/02/18/birds-of-prey-a-showcase-for-harley-quinn/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-evening-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-02-18,16,"By Bob Garver rrg251@nyu.eduI’m writing this review less than three hours removed from Joaquin Phoenix winning an Oscar for “Joker.” It is the second time an actor has won for playing the Clown Prince of Crime, after Heath Ledger’s posthumous win for 2008’s “The Dark Knight.” Other actors known for iconic takes on The Joker include Jack Nicholson in the 80’s, Cesar Romero in the 60’s, and my personal favorite, Mark Hamill in the 90’s animated series. About the only actor whose portrayal of the character was widely panned was Jared Leto in 2016’s “Suicide Squad.”This movie takes place in the Leto continuity.To be fair, Leto’s lousy Joker is nowhere to be seen in this movie. Instead we get to spend a whole movie with one of the high points of “Suicide Squad”: Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn.Harley is usually inseparable from The Joker, tethered to him in an unhealthy relationship based on obsession and emotional dependence.But here the couple is broken up, to the point where Harley burns the bridge with her ex-lover by blowing up their favorite chemical plant.Her newfound freedom puts her on the bad side of the villainous Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), who in the past wouldn’t have harmed Harley because of her connection to The Joker, but now himself feels free… to do all the harming he wants.Things aren’t going well for Sionis on a number of fronts. Harley broke his driver’s legs, and he’s not 100% sure he can trust new driver Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) of the Gotham Police Department is building a case against him.A crossbow-wielding vigilante named Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is killing prominent criminals in Gotham. And young pickpocket Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basko) has stolen the diamond that he needs to seize control of the entire Gotham underworld.Sionis has the resources to eliminate all five enemies individually, but does he have the resources the eliminate them together? On one hand, it’s unlikely that five such disparate women will want to work together, on the other, the film’s title and everything about its advertising indicate a team-up.The problem with the movie in a nutshell is that it doesn’t have room for complex characters. Montoya is a principled cop, fine. Cain is a street urchin with unloving foster parents, fine (aside from Basko’s stiff acting). But Huntress and Black Canary’s stories seem rushed and I never connected with either character the way I was supposed to, and I very easily could have with more development. Then there’s Harley herself, and while her backstory is more than fleshed out in an animated opening and references to her background as a psychiatrist, the movie forgets to have her really struggle with the very emancipation that’s right there in the title. She’s fiercely independent right off the bat, and until Sionis brings it up in the last act, I completely forgot about her previous dependence on The Joker, even though that is and has always been a major part of her character.Other complaints I have about “Birds of Prey” include Sionis’s villainous mannerisms seeming unnatural coming from McGregor (as if the character, not the actor, has studied comic book villains and is making a half-hearted attempt to emulate them) and a climactic action sequence in a funhouse being more at home in the chintzier Joel Schumacher Batman movies.Positives are mostly limited to the film’s dialogue taking full advantage of the R rating and the performances by Robbie and Perez.There’s a good Harley Quinn movie somewhere out there, but the DC Universe hasn’t hit it yet. Early numbers indicate that the film is underperforming at the box office. In fact, the studio has gone into full-on panic mode attempting to re-brand the film while it is still in theaters by billing it as “Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,” although I’m not sure that the problems with the film are in its title. I do hope it does well enough for us to get a sequel, but not so well that there isn’t pressure on the filmmakers to step up their game for the next movie.Grade: C+“Birds of Prey…” is rated R for strong violence and language throughout, and some sexual and drug material.Its running time is109 minutes."

"With Abuse Victims Trapped at Home, Detroit Moves Restraining Order System Online",0.0,47.0,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/detroit-michigan-online-restraining-order-personal-protection-order-domestic-violence/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-29,16,"Before the pandemic spread, getting a domestic violence restraining order was an onerous process in Wayne County, Michigan, which includes Detroit, Dearborn, and several smaller cities. Obtaining one required going in person to the court building to complete several pieces of paperwork, waiting around to see if a petition was granted, and then finding out when a hearing would take place. The whole process could take all day. “It can be incredibly intimidating to file a personal protection order,” said Jeni Hooper, program coordinator of the community response team at First Step, an advocacy group in Detroit for survivors of domestic violence.The coronavirus has required court systems to adapt — and at a time when expertswarnthat social isolation, economic uncertainty, anda historic wave of gun-buyingare driving up domestic abuse. Calls to the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violencewere up102 percent in March and the first half of April, compared to the same period last year.In Wayne County, officials accelerated plans to digitize the process for a personal protection order (PPO) as it is called locally. On April 17, three days before its courthouses closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Wayne County Circuit Courtlauncheda digital portal through which people canrequest ordersremotely. As part of theprocess, a petitioner can ask a judge to prohibit the respondent from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Themajority of stateslack an automatic gun prohibition with an temporary pre-hearing order, even though experts warn that a failure to disarm abusers when an order is served exacerbates the risks for victims.Kathleen McCarthy, the presiding judge in the family division of Wayne County Circuit Court who spearheaded the e-filing program, said that when she was deciding whether to temporarily close the courthouse last month, her biggest concern was how domestic violence survivors would be able to get restraining orders. Growing up in a household with domestic violence had made her particularly attuned to the risks, she added.The pandemic “turned everything on its head and forced everyone to learn and to acquire the technology to do these things in a more up-to-date fashion,” McCarthy said.In 2018, Wayne County had the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents by county in Michigan, according toa Trace analysisof the most recent availablecrime statisticsfrom the Michigan State Police and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.When a state stay-at-home order started on March 24, officials and advocates in Michigan feared the problem would get worse. “A lot of times people need to get these personal protection orders and the person they need to get it against is still somewhere around them,” said Shelly Drain, an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County.“The pandemic puts survivors at a much more increased risk because they can be isolated with their abuser,” added Hooper.In April, the county registered a slight decline in reported incidents of domestic violence compared to the last year,accordingto an analysis of county data by theDetroit Free Press. But local crisis centers have reported an increase in calls about domestic violence in the same period compared to last year, a possible sign of underreporting.McCarthy says the e-filing system has been processing an average of 17 PPO applications per day, about the same volume that came through the old system in March. That’s down from a pre-pandemic average of about 25 per day, she said.Researchshowsthat when an abuser has access to a gun, the risk of homicide becomesfive timesmore likely. Federal lawbarsconvicted abusers and those subject to domestic violence protective orders from owning guns. But the law refers to permanent orders of protection that have been handed down by a judge, not orders that are served prior to a hearing.Twenty-one stateseither bar gun possession for people subject to a PPO before a hearing is held, or allow a judge to authorize a gun prohibition. Michigan falls into the latter category. Most of the time, Drain said, judges in Wayne County order a gun prohibition even if a petitioner hasn’t asked for it. McCarthy added that all sitting judges in her jurisdiction must attend domestic violence training, where “it’s clearly taught that removing guns from the household is the number one way, if you can, to prevent a fatality.”Thee-filing systemmakes it much easier for petitioners, whether in a pandemic or not, said Hooper, whose group is one of several domestic violence organizations available to help petitioners complete the process. They can file on behalf of a domestic violence survivor if that person is unable to access the forms themself. The courtwebsitealso makes it easier for petitioners to find court-approved process servers or send documents by certified mail.Georgea Cole, an advocate for victims with the Americorps Urban Safety Domestic Violence Program at Wayne State University, spends the vast majority of her time helping domestic violence survivors file for PPOs, including through the new system.Normally, she works out of police stations throughout Detroit, speaking with people who are referred by an officer or via a domestic violence hotline. She says working from home has hindered her ability to connect with survivors. “You can’t get that kind of refuge virtually,” she said.But for other survivors who are unable to get to a physical place of safe harbor, the online filing system offers potentially life-saving access — even without the pandemic or state of emergency. Cole said she thinks that the addition of online filing after the state reopens can allow for the greatest access possible for survivors whose circumstances restrict different resources.“We see both of the methods work,” Cole said. “But everything is not for everybody.”Wayne County is not the first place to add an e-filing system for personal protection orders. Macomb County in Michigan has had such a system in place since 2018. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, three states — Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin — allowed people to electronically file restraining order petitions directly to the court without having to visit a courthouse or meet with a legal advocate, according to an analysis of data from theNational Center for State Courts. Since the pandemic began, others likeUtahhave also allowed temporary restraining order petitions to be emailed directly to the court.But online systems remain unusual. And that largely comes down to funding, said Rachel Teicher, director of intimate partner violence intervention at the National Network For Safe Communities. “It costs money to set up these systems and adopt them and make sure they’re secure and that the process works,” said Teicher. But she said the investment is worth it. “It saves victims a lot of time and stress.”Wayne County officials hope that other jurisdictions might follow their lead. Said Drain, “It can really be rolled out everywhere.”"

Emails: Hunter Biden Left $400K Off 2014 Income Tax Return. False Return Filed.,18.0,32.67,https://thenewamerican.com/emails-hunter-biden-left-400k-off-2014-income-tax-return-false-return-filed/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"Copyright © 2024 The New AmericanHunter Biden’s famous laptop yielded another revelation about the “president-elect’s” son last week, but once again the media mostly ignored it.Biden The Younger didn’t report $400,000 from Burisma Holdings on his 2014 income tax return, NBC News reported.Burisma Holdings is the energy company that hired Biden despite his complete lack of knowledge about the energy business andhis record as a drug addict.And Burisma is also the nexus of the Biden-Burisma influence peddling scheme. In 2016, then Vice President Joe Bidenforced Ukraineto fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, which employed Hunter at the time.Though the connection betweenBiden senior’s move againstthe prosecutor and his son’s employment at Burisma is obvious, the media called suggestions of influence peddling a “debunked conspiracy theory.”And now, they’re ignoring another Biden scandal: filing a false tax return.The report from NBCis clear and succinct: Hunter Biden cheated on his taxes:Hunter Biden’s former business partner sent him an email in 2017 saying he did not disclose on his tax returns $400,000 in income from the Ukrainian natural gas company where he sat on the board, according to a copy of the email obtained by NBC News.The message from Eric Schwerin, then president of Rosemont Seneca Partners, says Hunter Biden would need to “amend” his 2014 returns to reflect the “unreported” income, according to the copy of the email.“In 2014 you joined the Burisma board and we still need to amend your 2014 returns to reflect the unreported Burisma income,” says the email dated Jan. 16, 2017.The email goes on to note that Hunter Biden, who is now the subject of a federal tax probe, netted more than $1.2 million for the year. The earnings include the $400,000 from Burisma as well as income from Rosemont Seneca Advisors and a legal firm.NBC received the email from Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello. Costello’s copy came from the hard drive of Biden’s now famous laptop.NBC did not know what Hunter Biden did about the tax problem. Nor did it explain how Biden’s tax accountant — it’s safe to say he has one — made the mistake if that is what the omission was. Or did Biden try to hide the income? Unsurprisingly, his attorney clammed up.Biden owedinterest and penaltieson the unpaid taxes. If he has not amended the false return, those fees have grown substantially.Last week,The New Americanagain reportedthat Biden is the target of a federal money-laundering probe.That storybroke in October, but the lefitst media ignored it.They wantedJoe Biden in the White House.As CNN described the probe, ongoing since 2018, “investigators appear to be focused on Hunter Biden’s business activities connected to China. Some of his business dealings in China are publicly known through interviews and documents released in September by Senate Republicans on the Finance Committee and the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.”Continued CNN:After his father left office in 2017, Hunter Biden worked on securing a deal with CEFC China Energy to invest in US energy projects, according to documents released by Republicans.At least one of the matters investigators have examined is a 2017 gift of a 2.8-carat diamond that Hunter Biden received from CEFC’s founder and former chairman Ye Jianming after a Miami business meeting, one person briefed on the matter said. In 2019, Biden provided the New Yorker magazine an account of receiving the diamond from Ye. He told theNew Yorkerthat he felt uncomfortable receiving the diamond and gave it to other associates, and that he doesn’t know what they did with it. “I knew it wasn’t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,” he said in hisNew Yorkerinterview.Well, the other  “weird” thing is why CEFC, an energy company, would partner with a manifestly unqualified dope fiend. Maybe for the same reason Burisma hired him:his last name.That said, more news about the Biden-China Connection surfaced on Wednesday. Fox News published the contents of more emails that connect the Bidens to Communist China, asTNAreported.Those emails confirm testimony from Hunter Biden’s former business partner, Tony Bobulinski. He met with Joe Biden to outline his work for the family in its joint venture with the Chinese Reds. That company was called Sinohawk.The Bidens’ Asiatic adventures aside, the laptop’s revelations include these:What federal agents have done about the photos of underage girls and Biden’s illegal drug use is unknown.Hat tip:Fox NewsR.

Family of U.S. teen jailed for breaking COVID protocol in the Cayman Islands speaks out,1.0,44.67,https://www.upworthy.com/teen-jailed-for-breaking-cayman-islands-covid-protocol,https://adfontesmedia.com/upworthy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-21,16,"Traveling during a pandemic is risky, no matter who you are or where you're going. It's also beset with rules and restrictions put in place every step of the way, from airports to airlines to governments of the places you're visiting. Depending on where you're going, breaking those rules can have serious consequences—beyond just potentially spreading a deadly virus.Skylar Mack, 18, learned that lesson the hard way after she was arrested in the Cayman Islands for breaking the British territory's mandatory 14-day quarantine. The Mercer University pre-med student from Georgia flew to the Cayman Islands on November 27 on a visit with her boyfriend, Vanjae Ramgeet, 24, who is from the territory. Accordingto TODAY, Mack tested negative for COVID-19 before she left and again after arrival, but was still supposed to remain isolated for two weeks.On day two of quarantine, Ramgeet competed in a jet ski competition and Mack went to watch him. According tolocal news, neither of them wore a mask or practiced social distancing at the event. Mack also left the electronic bracelet she was supposed to wear behind, after reportedly asking the public health department to loosen the tracker the day after her arrrival.Both Ramgeet and Mack were arrested for breaking pandemic protocol.The Cayman Islands are home to about 64,000 people and have seen311 casesand two deaths from COVID-19. The territory has enacted strict rules for keeping their numbers low, including quarantining travelers. Punishments for breaking the rules were increased the day before the jet ski competition, according to Cayman Compass. Previously, a breach could result in a sentence of up to one-year imprisonment and/or a fine of $1,000. That was increased to up to two years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $10,000.Ramgeet and Mack both pled guilty to the breach, and were initially sentenced to 40 hours of community service and a $2,600 fine. But a prosecutor successfully argued that the sentence was not stringent enough to serve as a deterrent to others who might be tempted to break the rules. On appeal, Mack was sentenced to four months in prison. She and Ramgeet are the first people to be sentenced under the Caymans' harsher punishments.Mack's lawyer, Jonathan Hughes, argues that the government is trying to make an example of Mack without taking into consideration her age and history of responsible behavior. Mack, an honors student, has never had any run-ins with the law.""They're two young people who have never been in trouble before,"" Hughes said in a phone interview withThe Associated Press. ""This is the first time they've had interaction with police, the courts, prison.""In an interview on TODAY, Huges said, ""This particular sentence would have a particularly harsh effect on her, and the court ought to have considered the individual before it, not just the crime.""In a conversation with TODAY,  Mack's grandmother indicated that it was out of character for her granddaughter to break the rules.""It's not like her to make this kind of a mistake,"" Jeanne Mack said. ""She knows she screwed up. She knows she should have to pay for it.""She also shared how Skylar is faring in prison, where she's been since December 15.""She cries, she wants to come home,"" Jeanne Mack told TODAY. ""She knows she made a mistake. She owns up to that, but she's pretty hysterical right now.""People have reacted to the story in predictably divergent ways, with some saying that four months of prison for an 18-year-old who simply went to a jet ski competition is too harsh, and others saying that she's legally an adult and has the same responsibility to follow the laws of the nation she's in as any other adult. Some feel that young adults often make stupid choices and that Mack could learn from her mistake without such a harsh punishment, while others point out that a deadly pandemic is not a time for leniency for""youthful indiscretion.""There's also no shortage of people with little sympathy for someone who has the privilege of being able to travel to a tropical island in a pandemic choosing to flout protocols in place to protect the entire population.Meanwhile, Mack's lawyer and family are hoping for an overturn of the four-month imprisonment. Hughes is arguing in a court of appeals today for a lesser sentence, and the family is trying various avenues, including contacting President Trump.Mack was originally scheduled to fly home today. While there are no binding quarantine rules for Americans returning from international travel, it's perhaps worth pointing out that the per capita death rate from COVID-19 in the U.S. is 30 times higher than in the Cayman Islands."

Finding community as an openly gay man in ‘80s San Francisco, watching scores of friends die but ultimately surviving the AIDS plague. Embracing his sexual orientation professionally and excelling as a result. Cultivating a 33-year relationship, marrying, and having a child when adoption and surrogacy were nearly impossible for gay couples. Spending an entire career with the same company and retiring 40 years later as one of the few openly LGBTQ CEOs of a Fortune 500 company.And not just any company making widgets, but Macy’s Inc., an iconic brand perhaps best known for bringing all of America — red and blue — together each Thanksgiving morning for 97 years at its spectacular parade kicking off the holiday season.Now, after 40 years at Macy’s, including seven as CEO, that began with a management training program in 1983, Gennette, 62, is sitting down exclusively with the Washington Blade in a conference room in New York and reflecting on all the progress he’s seen the country make on LGBTQ rights and insisting he wants to stay involved in the fight.“LGBTQ rights are under attack now and I want to be in that arena — and not as a leader of a public company,” he said when asked about his future plans. “Department store retail is not for the faint of heart and my husband and I have been so fortunate. We know our experience is not everyone’s experience and we’re in a position to be able to do something.”When pressed, Gennette said he’s not yet sure what that looks like but, “I want to be in the fight,” perhaps in the philanthropic and donor space. He and husband Geoff Welch plan to take a few months to think through what’s next and how they might play a role in the LGBTQ movement. “That’s a clear passion of mine,” he said.Gennette cites two professional accomplishments of which he’s most proud: leading Macy’s out of the retail-killing pandemic with a stronger balance sheet than before COVID; and helping to create the various DEI programs that foster an inclusive, healthy culture at the sprawling company.“I get a lot of energy from that and will take that into my next chapter.”His last day at Macy’s will be Friday, Feb. 2 and it’s fitting that his final appointment on his final week is to attend the Human Rights Campaign’s Greater New York Dinner on Saturday where he will be honored with the HRC Corporate Visibility Award for his “unwavering dedication to bolstering LGBTQ+ inclusivity in business.”“As the LGBTQ+ community navigates a national state of emergency and faces an onslaught of targeted attacks, having the representation, leadership and support of such dedicated LGBTQ+ advocates fortifies our strength in this fight for freedom and equality,” said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson in a statement announcing Gennette’s award.Despite the accolade, Gennette seems uncomfortable with the term “activist” and never would have predicted that he would become an important figure for LGBTQ visibility in corporate America.“I’m an introvert,” he said, “I never saw myself as a visible role model. My husband was more of an activist than I was; my head was down doing my work at Macy’s.”Figures like Gennette have become accidental activists, helping to open minds — and board rooms — to future LGBTQ workers and executives who may never fully understand the challenges faced by previous generations. Chief among those challenges, perhaps, was AIDS. Gennette talks solemnly about those years in ‘80s San Francisco.“When you lived in the Castro through the ‘80s, it was difficult; you had a community that was just being decimated by the scourge of AIDS and losing friends,” he recalls. “My husband lost his first two lovers to AIDS. Many people I worked with at Macy’s were lost to AIDS, you just couldn’t get away from it. It was a difficult time for all of us.”Gennette added that living through the worst of AIDS in one of the hardest-hit cities ultimately proved cathartic because of the activism that resulted.“AIDS shaped my perspective on how a community can come together and influence local, state, and national lawmakers,” he said. “It ushered in a lot of political activity.”That activity triggered a wave of progress, from affirming state legislation, to out political leaders and celebrities, and ultimately to our first federal legal protections and eventually marriage equality. But the last two years have demonstrated the fragility of all that progress as state legislators across the country have introduced hundreds of bills aimed at rolling back our progress. Our right-wing enemies have tried everything from banning drag shows and LGBTQ-themed books to barring affirming healthcare for trans youth. There’s even a draconian “Don’t Say Gay” law now on the books in Florida that’s reminiscent of Vladimir Putin’s ban on “promoting homosexuality.” Not content with attacking only the LGBTQ community, Florida in January banned all DEI activities at state-funded colleges and universities. Welcome to 2024 America.How does Gennette view these attacks and setbacks, especially given his own legacy of expanding DEI programs at Macy’s?“Forward momentum always has consequences and the pendulum always swings back,” he warns. Gennette cites the overturning of Roe v. Wade as an alarming development in efforts to roll back settled law. “This idea about equality I don’t think we’re ever done with it,” he said. “What’s happening with the trans community is a testament to that. We need to stay organized and young people have to be vigilant about that.”His advice to young people embarking on their careers and applying for their first corporate jobs is to be out and authentic. “You’re never going to show up in your full potential if you don’t. … It’s going to take courage.”Gennette found the courage to come out in the early 1980s when such pronouncements could mean the end of your career and estrangement from family. He was 19 years old and a sophomore in college with conservative but supportive parents. “I had a lot of anxiety about it, I said, ‘I‘m gay,’ — and my mom said, ‘You don’t mean happy.’” His parents were accepting but lamented the presumed loss of grandchildren. Years later, Gennette’s mother would assist in locating a surrogacy program that was open to gay couples, leading to the birth of daughter Judith in 2000.His mother passed away last October and he describes her as his hero and “most seminal figure in my life — she was a kick-ass pioneer” who carried the PFLAG banner along with Gennette’s father in the San Francisco Pride parade.Meanwhile, back at Macy’s, Gennette came out to colleagues in his training program. One assistant buyer warned him that “people are talking” and that identifying as openly gay could be a “career killer.” But Gennette ignored the warnings and came out to his boss.“It was a big relief to acknowledge that to my boss,” he said. “It was like a weight lifted off my proverbial shoulders. I didn’t see senior executives that were gay, but I did see myself in the culture [of Macy’s] … It was a company that did right by disadvantaged communities even then in 1984.”Gennette’s experience wasn’t the norm for corporate workers in the 1980s (or even today) and he acknowledges that the retail sector was more accepting. And Macy’s, in particular, proved a progressive home and played a key role in shaping the kind of executive he would later become.“I don’t know that I would be a CEO today if not for that formative experience,” he said. “You’re on the pulse of pop culture and fashion and being gay was a part of my identity, but it wasn’t my full identity and I give Macy’s a lot of credit. I don’t know that I would be where I am if I’d been at a different company.”Indeed different companies are responding to the recent attacks on the LGBTQ community in different ways. Bud Light faced a boycott last year after a promotional stunt with transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney caught the intolerant eye of Kid Rock. Sales plummeted and parent company AB InBev’s stock fell 20 percent. The company responded by distancing itself from Mulvaney, which led to a boycott call from the LGBTQ community. Meanwhile, retailer Target faced a boycott over its wide selection of Pride month merchandise. The company responded by moving Pride merchandise from displays at the front of stores to less prominent locations in the back, which triggered criticism from LGBTQ advocates.Gennette said the Target incident had no impact on Macy’s, which offered its own Pride merchandise despite the boycott risk.“It’s when you flip and succumb to pressure that you get yourself sideways,” he said, noting that, “It always comes back to your core values. We had Pride merchandise at the front of our stores and we were participants in Pride parades around the country.”Further, Macy’s executives are always paying attention to what’s happening politically and culturally in case they need to respond. When the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked, Macy’s decided it would support any employees who had to travel out of state for abortion care. Other recent events have prompted internal discussion and response.“George Floyd put us on notice about being vocal about our internal programs and how you use your CEO voice to be true to what you’re doing internally,” Gennette said. “With respect to Macy’s, our core values of inclusion and giving back, we’re always looking for a more inclusive future for all. We do a good job of taking the pulse of where things are — conservative and liberal voices — and anticipate what could be coming that we need to react to.”That commitment manifests in several marquee DEI programs at Macy’s, including S.P.U.R. Pathways: Shared Purpose, Unlimited Reach, which the company describes as a “multiyear funding program to advance entrepreneurial growth, close wealth gaps, and shatter systemic barriers faced by diverse-owned and underrepresented businesses.” The program, created in partnership with Momentus Capital, has invested $30 million in underrepresented businesses and entrepreneurs, Gennette said. “We’re not taking our foot off the gas.”The proactively progressive approach of Macy’s begs the question: Do we need more CEOs from underrepresented communities? And why aren’t there more openly LGBTQ CEOs of Fortune 500 companies?Gennette is confident that the future will bring much more diversity to America’s board rooms and C-suites.“We’re at the beginning of our journey still,” he said. “There will be more [out CEOs] in the coming years. I have a lot of interest in increasing LGBTQ presence in board rooms. There’s so much talent out there ready to become the next CEOs, it’s something I think about — how can I contribute in retirement to help on this question?”Before he jumps into a role in LGBTQ advocacy, Gennette plans to take some time off with husband Geoff. The two met at Gennette’s 30th birthday party in California.“He showed up at the party and maybe it was the blue Speedo or the sonorous voice but we started dating from that point.”The two committed to each other in a 1995 ceremony, long before the advent of marriage equality. They’ve been together ever since, living in five states and nine cities.At the end of our conversation, Gennette agreed to a game of rapid fire.The Macy’s board recently rejected a $5.8 billion takeover bid after laying off more than 2,300 employees and closing five stores. Shares of Macy’s closed last week up 4 percent after a report that private equity firm Sycamore Partners is interested in taking Macy’s private. Gennette declined to comment on those recent developments but he remains bullish on the future for Macy’s.“Macy’s serves a big tent — red states, blue states — everyone in America has been touched by someone who’s gay and that activism is changing hearts and minds,” he said. “We serve a diverse nation and standing for that is good for profitable business.”Local youth advocacy group reflecting while looking to the future in 2024PublishedonBySMYAL, a local advocacy and services organization for LGBTQ youth, is turning 40 this year. The nonprofit has various services, including workshops, clinical services and housing, for youth ages six to 24.“It’s really profound and breathtaking, right? To know that over the course of the 40 years, we’ve been able to thrive and evolve to continue to meet the needs of queer and trans youth in our community,” said Erin Whelan, the executive director of SMYAL.Whelan moved across the country to come on as SMYAL’s executive director a year and a half ago. She was drawn to the nonprofit for many reasons, one being its reputation, and the broad age range that SMYAL serves.“SMYAL has been and continues to see youth as young as six as a part of this community,” Whelan said. “And understands that the needs might be different but the want and desire to feel seen, heard, celebrated and affirmed is there regardless of our age.”She was also drawn to the organization’s housing program, which started in 2017. SMYAL serves more than 45 LGBTQ youth in the region through its housing program, which includes case management, social support and skills development, including job training.In 2024, Whelan said she hopes to grow SMYAL’s reach and make services more accessible. This includes expanding the housing program, expanding language accessibility and reaching the most marginalized people under the LGBTQ umbrella, including Black people and trans people.While SMYAL is a youth services organization, Whelan said she also wants to reach more adults in programming.“I do think that there’s a broader reach that we can have for families who are uncertain, worried, fearful, scared,” Whelan said. “How can we connect with those families for them to have the questions they need answered in order to feel comfortable starting to think about how to support the youth in their home?”As part of its 40th anniversary, there are plans to focus on SMYAL’s archive. A few years ago, the Rainbow History Project, a local organization working to preserve LGBTQ history in the D.C. area, archived photos and information about SMYAL’s history. There are plans to highlight these archives to share where the nonprofit has been and its history, and focus on alumni of SMYAL’s programming and their stories.The organization was “born out of advocacy,” Whelan said. When LGBTQ youth were involuntarily hospitalized in D.C., local leaders joined together to advocate and provide safe spaces for LGBTQ people in the region.SMYAL began as a once-a-week support group in 1984. It was a safe space for people to feel seen and connected, Whelan said, especially in the ‘80s when LGBTQ people were so ostracized.For Rebecca York, who originally came to SMYAL when they were in high school, then as an intern in college, and now as the director of youth development and community engagement, it’s been amazing to see the organization grow and evolve.York oversees all of the non-clinical and non-housing youth programming, including the Little SMYALs program for kids six to 12 and SMYAL’s scholarship program.The Little SMYAL’s program sticks out to York. Offering accessible resources for queer youth from such a young age is amazing, they said.“I didn’t have that, it’s amazing to see,” York said. “It’s incredibly important work and I’m really, really proud to be back and doing it again.”SMYAL has many events scheduled for this year, all focused on providing a safe space for LGBTQ youth to be themselves. These safe spaces, which SMYAL has valued since its founding, are key to positively affecting youth mental health — especially during a time when LGBTQ youth are being targeted, York said.Reagan Peters-Roussell, a youth fellow at SMYAL helping run drop-in programs, agrees.“There is an attack on queer and trans youth, not even all across the country, all around the world, with legislation but even outside of legislation,” Peters-Roussell said, who uses she and they pronouns. “There are a lot of people who are getting over that stigma of what it means to be queer and trans. They have their own preconceived notions, and there aren’t a lot of spaces where we can say, ‘Hey, being queer and trans can be all these wonderful, beautiful things,’ and SMYAL is a living example of that.”Peters-Roussell, a junior at Howard University, is most excited about the Youth Pride Prom and Youth Pride this year.Their favorite part about those events is seeing people unapologetically be themselves and explore their identities in a safe, comfortable space.Peters-Roussell wants to thank the founders of SMYAL, she said, for advocating and fighting for an organization despite the stigma.“I 100% believe that the world would be a worse place without SMYAL in it,” they said.Here are the events planned so far for SMYAL’s 40th anniversary year. Specific dates will be available later on in the year.LGBTQ+ youth under 18 are invited for a night of learning the history of drag, featuring a drag story hour and performances. Costumes are encouraged.

She began playing piano at 7 years old, and it took off from there. Now, Redmond, a composer and pianist, is making her Kennedy Center debut this month.Redmond is part of theAmerican Opera Initiativeat the Kennedy Center, a program that commissions original one-act opera works. Her piece, which she co-created with librettist Sam Norman, will premiere on Jan. 19.“Hairpiece” follows the story of a wigmaker, Esther. Redmond and Norman brainstormed the storyline together, and Norman wrote the story while Redmond composed. The other main characters, a man and a non-binary person, all come together, and clash, but also find common ground and get to know themselves on a deeper level. The opera explores what it means to feel comfortable in authentically expressing gender, and how that need to feel seen connects people.Redmond, who is trans, said her identity intersects with her work in many ways. She described music and creativity as both self-expression and a way to connect with others. She hopes the audience will see themselves in the work she creates – in “Hairpiece” or otherwise.“I want people to relate it to themselves in some way and their own story, and maybe release some emotion or find some catharsis,” Redmond said in an interview with the Blade.For Redmond, music is a less explicit way to express oneself, and with that, a deeper way to convey and communicate feelings.She enjoys pushing boundaries in her work and enmeshing seemingly opposite genres and mediums, and this passion comes from her experience being trans, she said. Part of why she’s drawn to opera is because it’s stylistically diverse.“As a trans person, I’m very obsessed with liminality, and transitions, and doing things across boundaries,” she said.Opera has a complicated past and present, but many works address queer issues, Redmond said. And, while many stories told through opera are not explicitly queer, it’s important that people can explore an identity that’s new and comfortable to them.“There are so many examples of people finding themselves in opera, and then that not being what they thought they were,” she said.There are also generations before her who have paved the way in composing and creating queer works. Redmond wants to fuel that herself, she said.“I want to continue that legacy,” she added.In addition to beginning her musical journey at 7, her family has deep connections to music. Her mom is trained in opera, and her uncle is a professional musician. Music was always in the house growing up.“I had a lot of people to look up to,” she said.When Redmond was a teenager, she decided to go to college to study music. Redmond went to The Julliard School for her bachelor’s and master’s degrees, completing the master’s in the spring of 2023.Her musical interests are not limited to opera and classical repertoire. She’s also interested in rock, jazz, electronic, and other genres.In her free time, she continues to play music. Redmond, who is based in Manhattan, just started a band with her friends a few months ago, where she plays keys. They are in the early stages and don’t have a name yet, but the group is leaning toward a post-rock, punk sound.“It’s something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, playing in a band,” she said.Outside of music, she loves to cook, she said — especially soups and stews. Her family is Italian-American, and food has always been a point of connection, she said. She’s always on the prowl for new recipes to try out.Redmond is a lover of collaboration, and working with a librettist for the American Opera Initiative is a prime example of the benefits of working alongside other artists.“When there’s a collaborative focus, there’s just more people to learn from more perspectives and things that are a little different than what I’m used to,” Redmond said. “That’s intriguing to me. And I think more stimulating even than if I were to just be creating on my own.”The American Opera Initiative is entering its 11th season this year. Operas commissioned are performed by the Washington National Opera Cafritz Young Artists, who are part of a resident-training program at the Kennedy Center for singers and pianists.Throughout the program, which began in March, Redmond has learned so much through mentors. There’s also been a great amount of confidence in her.“It’s just been a great experience because of the trust that they have in our creativity and ability,” she said.“Hairpiece,” along with two other one-act operas, premieres on Jan. 19 at the Terrace Theater.

What's In Biden's First 2021 Stimulus Package? Here's What To Know,-10.0,37.33,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/whats-in-bidens-first-2021-stimulus-package-heres-what-to-know-64109010,https://adfontesmedia.com/elite-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,16,"Despite continued opposition, congressional Democrats are making progress in passing President Joe Biden's first major piece of legislation since taking office. On Feb. 27 at 2 a.m. ET, the House of Representatives approved Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package in a 219-212 vote, with Republicans unanimously rejecting the legislation. So,what's in Biden's first 2021 stimulus package?Here's what you need to know.Biden first unveiled his proposal, dubbed the ""American Rescue Plan,"" on Jan. 14 to overwhelming public support. Per Feb. 24 data from Morning Consult,76% of voters (including 60% of Republicans) support the legislation. The relief plan is largely aimed at providing public relief amid the economic fallout from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which, as of March 1,has killed over 513,000 Americans, perThe New York Times. If approved by the Senate with no changes, the plan will provide $1,400 in direct payments to qualifying Americans, a$400 weekly boost to regular unemployment benefitsthrough September 2021, and $40 billion in grants to higher education institutions, among other things. Through executive orders, Biden has alsoextended eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, and placedpauses on federal student loan payments.Thebill would provide the $1,400 paymentsto individuals making up to $75,000 a year, phasing out for individuals earning $100,000 and more. Significantly, this version of thepayment would also apply to adult dependents, like college students, according to CNBC. Per Vox, the bill also addresses some major national problems highlighted by the pandemic: itallocates $40 billion in grants to colleges, with the majority meant to go to emergency financial aid for students. It also provides$25 billion toward emergency rent and utility assistance, and allocates$7.6 billion to expand internet connectivityto both teachers and students in remote learning situations. It also includes aid such as disaster relief, food assistance, child care, vaccine distribution, and aid for restaurants among its provisions.However, the package may undergo some major changes to pass through the Senate and make it to the Oval Office to be signed into law. Congressional Republicans have been pushing back on the bill's price tag, and on Jan. 31, presented their own smaller$600 billion stimulus plan. PerThe Washington Post,the plan wouldcut direct payments from $1,400 to just $1,000, and completely eliminate Biden's push for a $15 federal minimum wage.""We know that the billwill look different on the way out [of the Senate]than it did when [Biden] presented it in his primetime address,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Feb. 28. ""But there is an urgency here,"" she added. ""Because by [March 14], 11 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance, so we need to move quickly and rapidly to get this relief out to the Americans.""One major change has already been made: On Feb. 25, nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonoughruled against Biden's push to increase the federal minimum wageto $15 as part of the stimulus, on the grounds that the wage increase was outside the parameters of what was allowed underreconciliation— the process by which Democrats are trying to pass the stimulus. Reconciliation is a fast-track path to passing budget legislation in the Senate with a simple 51-vote majority, but it also comes with limitations on what can be included in a bill. While congressional Democrats seemdetermined to overturn the decision, Psaki stated thatBiden ""respects the parliamentarian’s decisionand the Senate’s process.""Additionally, neither the bill nor the executive orders include forgiveness for student debt, backtracking — at least for the moment — on aBiden campaign promise. In a Feb. 16 CNN town hall, Biden shot down congressional Democrats' call to cancel $50,000 in loans with an executive order. ""I will not make that happen,"" he said. ""I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I don't think I have the authority to do it,"" he added. During his first days in office, however, Biden issued an executive order to put apause on payment expectations through September 2021.Democrats are racing to pass the bill through both congressional chambers before federal unemployment benefitsbegin lapsing for many Americans in mid-March. Per Insider, the Senate willexamine and possiblyrevise the relief packagefrom March 2 to March 5. If changes are made, the bill will go back to the House as early as March 8 for a secondary vote. Congressional Democrats aim to have the bill signed into law by March 14. ""The sooner we pass the bill and it is signed, the sooner we can make the progress that this legislation is all about,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a Feb. 26 news conference, ""saving the lives and the livelihood of the American people.""Be the first to know what's trending, straight from Elite Daily"
Greta Thunberg Hilariously Trolls Donald Trump on Twitter With His Own Tweet,-10.0,31.0,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a34599592/greta-thunberg-trolled-donald-trump-tweet/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-06,16,"Greta Thunberg, 17-year-old environmental activistand overall badass, is a literal icon…but with that icon status comes more than a few people who just cannot bear to witness and accept the greatness. Sadly, one of those haters includes Donald Trump—a 74-year-old man who seems to enjoy picking on a teen for some reason.Case in point: After Greta was namedTime’s Person of the Year in December 2019, Trump saw it as an opportunity to try to drag her and her efforts to combat climate change. “So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!” Trump tweeted at the time.But Greta got to have the final laugh in the matter. As you may know, Trump refuses to acknowledge thathe’s currently trailing Biden in the 2020 presidential election, so when Trump tweeted “STOP THE COUNT” yesterday, Greta saw it as an opportunity to embarrass him.Greta quoted Trump’s tweet to her verbatim and wrote, “So ridiculous. Donald must work on his Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Donald, Chill!”Now, this? This is what you call a comeuppance, my friends."
"Woke Progressive Lunacy Targets Sarah Paulson For Refusing To Include Her Pronouns In Her Twitter Bio, Despite Her LGBTQ Activism",14.33,32.33,https://www.chicksonright.com/blog/2021/04/01/woke-progressive-lunacy-targets-sarah-paulson-for-refusing-to-include-her-pronouns-in-her-twitter-bio-despite-her-lgbtq-activism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicks-on-the-right-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-01,16,"Do you remember the DC woman,Lauren Victor, who got mobbed by Black Lives Matter activists who demanded she raise her fist in solidarity? She refused, and was subsequently threatened and screamed at by the angry and unruly mob. She even explained that she really was sympathetic to the cause and supported the movement, but that it wasn’t the mob’s place to force her to do anything. But radical woke progressive activists think they have every right to do anything they want, and you only have the right to acquiesce to their demands.1) In a scene that played out several times Monday, a Black Lives Matter protest that began in Columbia Heights confronted White diners outside D.C. restaurants, chanting “White silence is violence!” and demanding White diners show their solidarity.#DCProtestspic.twitter.com/fJbPM76vb0— Fredrick Kunkle WaPo (@KunkleFredrick)August 25, 2020You see, radical progressives maintain that “silence is violence,” so not only are younotallowed to disagree, you also aren’t allowed to remain passive on the subject, or even remain quietly supportive. You are expected tovocallyandactivelyparticipate with them.Well, Wednesday was apparently “Transgender Day of Visibility.” And some members of so-called “Gay Twitter” are big mad at actress Sarah Paulson, a vocal LGBTQ advocate who is in a same-sex relationship and who recently criticized J.K. Rowling for supposed anti-trans bigotry.Oh yes. YES YESSSSSSShttps://t.co/0yxK7jtsRv— Sarah Paulson (@MsSarahPaulson)June 7, 2020Here’s the story.Despite her pro-LGBTQ views, activism, and lifestyle, radical woke progressives expected Paulson to also post her pronouns in her Twitter bio, which has become a call-sign for radical progressive ideology and activism, on “Transgender Day of Visibility.”One Twitter user demanded of Paulson,“Put ur (sic) pronouns in your bio it’s not that hard.”Sarah Paulson, who is a free-thinking individual who can make her own decisions, refused to do so simply because someone was demanding that she do it. Paulson responded,“It’s also not that hard for you to not tell what to do.”One user then insisted she just do it because “its (sic) a very simple thing to do,” and another admitted that “it was kinda rude” to ask (or demand) in that way that Paulson include her pronouns, but said it is “actually really important” and would “mean a lot to many people if u did it.”Pretty much immediately after Paulson refused to submit to the radical progressive demands, those same radical progressives began calling for the actress to be cancelled, even going so far as to say that her refusal to include her pronouns in her Twitter bio was “transphobic.” Just like refusing to post a black square on your social media a few months ago was tantamount to actively calling for the violent death of black Americans. To the radical woke progressive activists, you’re either vehemently supportive of their chosen cause or you’re a violent and vile bigot who doesn’t deserve to be permitted in society. Those are your only options with them, which is absolutely absurd on its face.Then the party of compassion, empathy, and inclusion proceeded to send some of the most vile and hateful comments to this woman who is actually their ally.The actress Sarah Paulson, who last year endorsed the vitriolic abuse JK Rowling received because she stood up for women’s rights against trans activism, has received over 1,000 misogynistic and abusive messages in a few hours, because she refused to put her pronouns in her biopic.twitter.com/kIXffJyltx— ripx4nutmeg (@ripx4nutmeg)April 1, 2021One comment suggested that her pronouns were “dumb/whore” or “ugly/b**ch,” and others simply called her a “c**t” and a “fugly b**ch,” among other colorful insults.All this because she didn’t want to be forced to include her preferred pronouns in her Twitter bio.It’s social extortion by radical progressive lunacy."
"Violence in the Capitol, Dangers in the Aftermath",-1.33,43.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/violence-in-the-capitol-dangers-in-67f,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,16,"Nonetheless, a few tried. Scorn and sometimes worse were universally heaped upon them.On September 14 — while bodies were still buried under burning rubble in downtown Manhattan — Congresswoman Barbara Leecast a lone voteagainst the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). “Some of us must urge the use of restraint,” she said seventy-two hours after the attack, adding: “our country is in a state of mourning” and thus “some of us must say: let’s step back for a moment, let’s pause just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.”For simply urging caution and casting a single “no” vote against war, Lee’s Congressional office was deluged with threats of violence. Armed security was deployed to protect her, largely as a result ofmedia attacks suggestingthat she was anti-American and sympathetic to terrorists. Yet twenty years later — with U.S. troops still fighting in Afghanistan under that same AUMF, with Iraq destroyed, ISIS spawned, and U.S. civil liberties and privacy rights permanently crippled — her solitary admonitions look far more like courage, prescience and wisdom than sedition or a desire to downplay the threat of Al Qaeda.Others also raised similar questions and issued similar warnings. On the left, people like Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky, and on the right people such as Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan — in different ways and at different times — urged U.S. politicians and Americans generally to resist unleashing an orgy of domestic assaults on civil liberties, foreign invasions, and an endless war posture. They warned that such a cycle, once initiated, would be very difficult to control, even more difficult to reverse, and virtually guaranteed to provoke even greater violence.These few who dissented from the instant consensus were, like Congresswoman Lee, widely vilified. Both Sontag and Chomsky werebrandedanti-American Fifth Columnists, while David Frum,writing inNational Review, denounced Buchanan and others questioning the excesses of the War on Terror from the right as “Unpatriotic Conservatives”: no different, proclaimed the neocon, than “Noam Chomsky, Ted Rall, Gore Vidal, Alexander Cockburn, and other anti-Americans of the far Left.”In retrospect, it is hard to deny that those who defied, or at least questioned, the potent 2001 emotional consensus by urging deliberation in lieu of reactionary rage were vindicated by subsequent events: the two-decade expansion of the war in Afghanistan to multiple countries, the enactment of the Patriot Act, the secret implementation of mass surveillance systems, the trillions of dollars of taxpayer wealth transferred to weapons manufacturers, and the paramilitarization of the domestic security state. At the very least, basic rationality requires an acknowledgement that when political passions and rage-driven emotions find their most intense expression, calls for reflection and caution can only be valuable even if ultimately rejected.The U.S. Capitol remains a potent and cherished symbol even for Americans who are deeply cynical about the ruling class and political system. Its nobility is something continually engrained deep into our collective psyche since childhood, and that meaning endures even when our rational faculties reject it. It is therefore not hard to understand why watching a marauding band of hooligans invade and deface both the House and the Senate, without any identifiable objective other than venting grievances, reflexively engenders a patriotic disgust across the political spectrum.It is unhinged to the point of being obscene to compare yesterday’s incursion to the 9/11 attack or (as Sen. Chuck Schumerdid last night) to Pearl Harbor. By every metric, the magnitude and destructiveness of those two events are in an entirely different universe. But that does not mean there are no applicable lessons to be drawn from those prior attacks.One is that striking at cherished national symbols — the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the Capitol — ensures rage and terror far beyond body counts or other concrete harms. That is one major reason that yesterday’s event received far more attention and commentary, and will likely produce far greater consequences, than much deadlier incidents, such as thestill-motive-unknown2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 59 or the 2016 Orlando shooting that left 49 dead at the Pulse nightclub. Unlike even horrific indiscriminate shooting sprees, an attack on a symbol of national power will be perceived as an attack on the state or even the society itself.There are other, more important historical lessons to draw not only from the 9/11 attack but subsequent terrorism on U.S. soil. One is the importance of resisting the coercive framework that demands everyone choose one of two extremes: that the incident is either (a) insignificant or even justifiable, or (b) is an earth-shattering, radically transformative event that demands radical, transformative state responses.This reductive, binary framework is anti-intellectual and dangerous. One can condemn a particular act while resisting the attempt to inflate the dangers it poses. One can acknowledge the very real existence of a threat while also warning of the harms, often far greater, from proposed solutions. One can reject maximalist, inflammatory rhetoric about an attack (a War of Civilizations, an attempted coup, an insurrection, sedition) without being fairly accused of indifference toward or sympathy for the attackers.Indeed, the primary focus of the first decade of my journalism was the U.S. War on Terror — in particular, the relentless erosions of civil liberties and the endless militarization of American society in the name of waging it. To make the case that those trends should be opposed, I frequently argued that the threat posed by Islamic radicalism to U.S. citizens was being deliberately exaggerated, inflated and melodramatized.I argued that not because I believed the threat was nonexistent or trivial: I lived in New York City on 9/11 and remember to this day the excruciating horror from the smell and smoke emanating throughout Lower Manhattan and the haunting “missing” posters appended by desperate families, unwilling to accept the obvious reality of their loved ones’ deaths, to every lamp post on every street corner. I shared the same disgust and sadness as most other Americans from the Pulse massacre, the subway bombings in London and Madrid, the workplace mass shooting in San Bernardino.My insistence that we look at the other side of the ledger — the costs and dangers not only from such attacks but also the “solutions” implemented in the name of stopping them — did not come from indifference towards those deaths or a naive views of those responsible for them. It was instead driven by my simultaneous recognition of the dangers from rights-eroding, authoritarian reactions imposed by the state, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. One need not engage in denialism or minimization of a threat to rationally resist fear-driven fanaticism — as Barbara Lee so eloquently insisted on September 14, 2001.Human memories are usually short and the dominance of social media has abridged them even further. Many have forgotten that the Clinton administration seized on the 1995 courthouse bombing in Oklahoma City to radically expand law enforcement powers andescalate its demandsfor full-scale backdoor access to all encrypted internet communications. The fear necessary to justify such draconian measures was fueled by incessantmedia hypingof weekend citizen militias in places like Idaho and Montana said to be plotting armed insurrection against the federal government.One of the first major War on Terror attacks on core Constitutional rights which Iwrote aboutwas Newt Gingrich’s2006 speechsuggesting that the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee to fight terrorism should be “modified”.The former House Speaker approvingly citedaCommentaryarticleby former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy — entitled “Free Speech for Terrorists?” — insisting that some ideas are so dangerous, especially in the era of terrorism and the internet, that the First Amendment must be limited to permit greater censorship powers:With an enemy committed to terrorism, the advocacy of terrorism—the threats, the words—are not mere dogma, or even calls to “action.” They are themselves weapons—weapons of incitement and intimidation, often as effective in achieving their ends as would be firearms and explosives brandished openly. . . .Do we so lack confidence (except in the sacrosanct status of speech itself) that we are unable to say with assurance that some things are truly evil, and that advocating them not only fails to serve any socially desirable purpose but guarantees more evil? Must our historical deference to opinion, however noxious, defer as well to a call to arms against innocents, or a call to destroy a form of representative government thatprotectsreligious and political freedom? May we not even ban and criminalize the advocacy of militant Islam and its métier, which is the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians? . . .In America's bumptious, bounteous marketplace, there are no limits on words as the building blocks of ideas, or on ideas as the legitimate instruments of persuasion. Terror has no place in such discourse. It is the function of law to express our society's judgments. Ours should be simple and humane: words that kill are not words we need abide.As a free speech advocate and civil libertarian, I was naturally repelled by this notion that some political ideas could be deemed so dangerous by the state that they can be legally suppressed. In response, Iasked rhetorically in 2006: “Are thereanyAmerican values at all in which Bush followers and neocons actually believe -- any constitutional principles that are sacrosanct and whose violations they would oppose if undertaken in the name of fighting The Terrorists?” I concluded: “It certainly doesn't appear so.”Beyond raising alarms about civil liberties erosions, I also often insisted that the underlying causes of terrorism aimed at the U.S. should be considered if for no other reason than to understand how to address it without destroying core liberties for Americans.While religious fanaticism may sometimes be the cause, far more often, I argued, such attacks weremotivated by rageover the killing of innocent people, including children, by the U.S. Government’s bombs, drones and tanks in Muslim-majority countries. Right-wing advocatesoften demonizedsuch arguments as pro-terrorist or as “justifying” terrorist attacks, but the left largely supported the inquiry into motivating causes, just as they have long supported the attempts to understand what motivates violent crime, on the ground that misguided actions are often driven by valid or at least widely shared redressible grievances. But the view that we should attempt to identify the core motives of terrorist acts or violent crime, rather than just label them evil and vow to destroy their perpetrators, was largely deemed taboo in mainstream discourse.Within hours of the Capitol being cleared, we heard truly radical proposals from numerous members of Congress. Senators and House members who objected to Electoral College certification, or questioned its legitimacy, should be formally accused of sedition andexpelled from the Houseif not prosecuted, argued Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), with other House members expressing support. Even those unarmed protesters who peacefully entered the Capitol should, many argued, be hunted by the FBI as domestic terrorists.Calls proliferated for the banning of the social media accounts of instigators and protest participants. Journalists and politicians cheered the decision by Facebook and Twitter to temporarily bar the President from using their service, and then cheered again when Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerbergannounced on Tuesdaythat the ban on Trump extended through Biden’s inauguration. Some journalists, such asCNN’s Oliver Darcy,complainedthat Facebook had not gone far enough, that more mass censorship was needed of right-wing voices. The once-radical 2006 Gingrich argument — that some opinions are too dangerous to allow to be expressed because they are pro-terrorist and insurrectionary — is now thriving, close to a consensus.These calls for censorship, online and official, are grounded in the long-discredited, oft-rejected and dangerous view that a person should be held legally accountable not only for their own illegal actions but also forthe consequences of their protected speech: meaning the actions others take when they hear inflammatory rhetoric. That was the distorted mentality used by the State of Mississippi in the 1970s to try to hold NAACP leaders liable for the violent acts of their followers against boycott violators after hearing rousing pro-boycott speeches from NAACP leaders, only for the Supreme Court in 1982 tounanimously rejectsuch efforts on the ground that ""while the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity,"" adding that even ""advocacy of the use of force or violence does not remove speech from the protection of the first amendment.""The complete reversal in mentality from just a few months ago is dizzying. Those who spent the summer demanding the police be defunded are furious that the police response at the Capitol was insufficiently robust, violent and aggressive. Those who urged the abolition of prisons are demanding Trump supporters be imprisoned for years. Those who, under the banner of “anti-fascism,” demanded the firing of a topNew York Timeseditor for publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) advocating the deployment of the U.S. military to quell riots — a view deemed not just wrong but unspeakable in decent society — are today furious that the National Guard was not deployed at the Capitol to quash pro-Trump supporters. Antifa advocates are working to expose the names of Capitol protesters to empower the FBI to arrest them on terrorism charges. And while Rep. Cori Bush’s proposal to unseat members of Congress for their subversive views went mega-viral, many forget that in 1966, the Georgia State Legislature refused to seat Julian Bondafter he refusedto repudiate his anti-war work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, then considered a domestic terrorist group.Those who argued in the summer that property damage is meaningless oreven nobleare treating smashed windows and looted podiums at the Capitol as treason, as a coup. One need not dismiss the lamentable actions of yesterday to simultaneously reject efforts to apply terms that are plainly inapplicable:attempted coup, insurrection, sedition. There was zero chance that the few hundred people who breached the Capitol could overthrow the U.S. Government — the most powerful, armed and militarized entity in the world — nor did they try.Perhaps many view it as more upsetting to see august members of Congress hiding in fear of a riot than to watch ordinary small-business owners weep as their multi-generational store burns to the ground. Undoubtedly, national reporters who spend much time in the Capitol and who have long-time friendships with Senators and House members are more horrified, far more so, by violent gangs in the Capitol rotunda than on the streets of Portland or Kenosha. But that does not mean that rational restraint is unnecessary when searching for sober language to accurately describe these events.There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, thousands of people shooting their way into the Capitol after a long-planned, coordinated plot with the goal of seizing permanent power, and, on the other, an impulsive and grievance-driven crowd more or less waltzing into the Capitol as the result of strength in numbers and then leaving a few hours later. That the only person shot was a protester killed by an armed agent of the state by itself makes clear how irresponsible these terms are. There are more adjectives besides “fascist treason” and “harmless protest,” enormous space between those two poles. One should not be forced to choose between the two.It has long been clear that, in the post-Trump era, media outlets looking to keep viewers hooked, and government officials looking to increase their power, will do everything possible to center and inflate the threat posed by right-wing factions. I’ve said this more times than I can count over the last year at least.Like all inflated threats, this one has a kernel of truth. As is true of every faction, there are right-wing activists filled with rage and who are willing to engage in violence. Some of them are dangerous (just as some Muslims in the post-9/11 era, and some Antifa nihilists, were and are genuinely violent and dangerous). But as was true of the Cold War and the War on Terror and so many other crisis-spurred reactions, the other side of the ledger — the draconian state powers clearly being planned and urged and prepared in the name of stopping them — carries its own extremely formidable dangers.Refusing to consider those dangers for fear of standing accused of downplaying the threat is the most common tactic authoritarian advocates of state power use. Less than twenty-four hours after the Capitol breach, one sees this tactic being wielded with great flamboyance and potency, and it is sure to continue long after January 20.Ready for more?"
Revealed: The army of Big Tech lobbyists targeting Capitol Hill,-6.67,45.33,https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2021/02/revealed-army-big-tech-lobbyists-targeting-capitol-hill,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-15,16,"TheNew Statesmanhas analysed federal lobbying data from 15 leading tech companies to shed light on the growth in spending over the past decade that has made Big Tech such a dominant political force on Capitol Hill.We used data from the Center for Responsive Politics, and Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) reports to analyse Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, IBM, SAP, Intel, Uber, Lyft, Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE and TikTok owners Bytedance.Communications and electronics are the fourth highest-spending sector in US federal lobbying, with almost 700 companies spending $436 million in 2020. The 15 companies theNew Statesmananalysed make up just under a quarter of that total.The titans of Big Tech have faced a reckoning over the past few years. As their lobbying spend continues to rise, people rightly question the influence they are having over legislation. But experts who spoke to theNew Statesmansay the patterns aren’t as simple as they may seem on the surface, and the rise in spending has been coupled with increasingly sophisticated methods of influence.Nien-hê Hsieh, a professor of business ethics at Harvard University says that in the 1990s, “there was a real reluctance or reticence to engage in Washington” from the leading tech companies of the day.“Some people probably even thought that technology is the wave of the future as opposed to government or tech or politics and so it was maybe also in some ways framed as apolitical,” he says. “I think a lot of the promise of these new technologies was that they would in some sense transcend politics.”In the early 2000s, the Microsoft antitrust suit set a precedent for federal involvement in tech companies, and proved that government and tech couldn’t be separated. Since then, tech lobbying on Capitol Hill has seen huge growth.The early 2010s saw huge growth in lobbying spending by tech companies. A plateau in the late Obama years was followed by another steep increase once Trump took office. But in recent years some major players have slowed or even decreased their spending, suggesting that major corporations are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to wielding power on Capitol Hill.Despite being slowed down by the pandemic, overall 2020 federal lobbying figures barely decreased from 2019 – down from $3.51bn to $3.49bn. The same is seen in Big Tech, with spending by the 15 companies dropping from $99m to $96.3m. Daniel Auble, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, says first quarter spending in 2020 was “a record, basically the biggest quarter we’ve ever seen”.Jane Chung, an advocate lobbyist on Big Tech at Public Citizen, a non-profit that describes itself as “lobbyists for the people”, says this huge growth in tech spending can be linked with a shift in public and political opinion of big tech. Last year’sreport by the House Subcommittee on Antitrustis considered by many to be a landmark step in curbing the power of Big Tech.Facebook’s entry into the federal lobbying game can be seen from the beginning of the decade. Exponential spending growth in the early 2010s and throughout the Trump presidency has made Facebook the biggest spender in Big Tech alongside Amazon, which has also been rapidly increasing its spending year on year.While many of the companies we analysed decreased their spending slightly in 2020, Facebook and Amazon both increased theirs significantly. Facebook upped their federal lobbying spend by 18 per cent to $19.7m, and Amazon by 12 per cent to $18.7m.Among the bills Facebook lobbied on is the Earn It Act, a law intended to prevent child exploitation that has met criticism from privacy groups. In early versions it proposed tocrack downon social media sites that did not meet certain standards for handling of child abuse imagery, but tech companies argued this could be an “attack on encryption” by allowing law enforcement to access users’ private messages.Among Facebook’s most lobbied bills in 2020 was the Honest Ads Act, a piece of legislationMark Zuckerberg has publicly supportedthat would require more transparency on political advertising on social networks.Facebook also lobbied the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, which would have given news outlets the ability tocollectively negotiatetheir distribution terms with Google and Facebook, which currently dominate the digital advertising market.In 2020 Amazon lent its voice to some of the most lobbied bills, includingthe Cares Actandthe Heroes Act, which together provided more than $5trn in economic stimulus amid the Covid-19 pandemic, in March and May. It also lobbied on theInform Consumers Act, which would require more transparency from third-party sellers on online marketplaces such as Amazon.Amazon has also weighed in on hot-button legislation, such as the Equality Act, which Biden has committed to passing in the first 100 days of his presidency. Amazon has been vocal about its support for the Raise the Wage Act, andoutspoken in pushing large employersto raise their minimum wage to $15.Chung says that although the reason behind some lobbying is self-evident, at other times it may not be so clear. One of the things Public Citizen does, she says, is conduct in-depth research on a company to try to figure out its vested interest in the bill.“I would be very surprised if there were indeed any philanthropic motivations behind their lobbying,” she says.Also, says Chung, sometimes a company might lobby for an issue that seems counterintuitive to its business interests, so that it can be included in the discussions and shape the legislation from an early stage. For example, she says, Amazon has been outspoken incalling for price gouging regulations. But a federal ban on the practice may aid Amazon by overridinga complex patchwork of state rules.“[Companies will] go behind the scenes and, to a large extent, be able to influence what is in that bill and ensure that it’s not as harmful as it could be,” says ChungGoogle, however, shows a different story. From 2011 to 2018, its federal lobbying spend far exceeded that of its competitors, reaching a height of $21.9m in 2018.But it has decreased its spending in the past two years. A 2019report in the Wall Street Journalsaid that Google had fired many of its lobbyists amid government antitrust scrutiny.“There was at least one, maybe two years, where they were the biggest spender among companies, so maybe that was too much attention for them,” says Auble of the Center for Responsive Politics. “Maybe they felt that they could be similarly effective with a smaller footprint.”Similarly to Facebook, in 2020 Google lobbied on the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. It also lobbied on the Cares Act.In 2018 and 2017, it lobbied across a number of bills that directly affected its business, such as theEmail Privacy Act, which demands law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access private communications stored on Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other providers, and the the AV (Autonomous Vehicles) Start Act and Self Drive Act, which would affect Google’s self-driving car projects.Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Institute, cautions against seeing Google’s reduction in lobbying spending as the company minimising its political activity, but rather just targeting it more tactically.“Google has actually had an extremely sophisticated operation ever since they built it,” Lynn says. “It’s not just aimed at Washington, it’s aimed at states, it’s aimed at localities, it’s aimed at companies, and it’s aimed at academics.”Looking ahead to Biden’s term in office, experts anticipate that the relationship between Big Tech and the White House will be more fractious than it was under Barack Obama.“They’re afraid of what these corporations are doing to American politics, to American society, to the American commercial system,” says Lynn. “Unlike a Warren or Sanders team where this was top of mind, that’s not the case with Biden. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not on their mind in a very big way.”Obama had a close relationship with many major players in Big Tech, not leastGoogle’s executive chairman Eric Schmidt. Whilethere are some names from Facebook and Google among the Biden transition team, experts say the shift of public and political opinion makes it unlikely Biden’s administration would want to be seen as having the same Big Tech links that Obama did.“There is almost zero per cent chance that they would try and slow down what’s already happening,” says Lynn. “It’d be seen as taking the side of Google or Facebook, it just wouldn’t be politically smart. And these are smart political people.”The data is just part of a much bigger picture and on its own can only tell us so much. The spending amounts show staffing costs for lobbyists, both in-house and through external lobbying firms, who meet with legislators and executive branch agencies to advocate on behalf of the corporation. But it does not show which members of Congress or committees firms met with or when the meetings occurred.Lobbying is a complex web, as the DC lobbyist Edda Collins Coleman explains. “It’s about getting that face time with [members of Congress] so they know who you are, their staffer knows you and letting them know that you’re that subject matter expert they need,” she says.Spending more money can get companies more lobbyist time, expertise and connections, but it doesn’t necessarily guarantee results. Instead, Chung says spending figures can be used as an indicator of the importance the company places on the piece of legislation, and how it will affect them.While the lobbying register requires companies to disclose which legislation they are lobbying on, it does not require them to reveal the specifics of their meetings, or even whether they are for or against the bill.Big Tech’s most lobbied bills of 2020 included the National Defense Authorization Act, which authorised over $700bn in spending for the US military, and the Cares and Heroes Acts. Among these enormous bills, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to figure out a company’s vested interest.Another important caveat is that this data shows federal lobbying, not state-level spending. Experts say that on some issues, state lobbying is even more important. In recent years, Uber and Lyft mounted ahuge lobbying effort in Californiaagainst legislation that would have given their drivers employee benefits, for example. Companies also buy influence through trade organisations and the funding of political campaigns.Lynn’sOpen Markets Institutefocuses on the threat corporate power and monopolies pose to democracy and society. He says the discussion needs to broaden beyond lobbying and political spending, to include all the different ways corporations wield power: through think tank and academic funding, investing in the media and content moderation, which allows them to control the public conversation itself.“If you become the dominant employer within a congressional district, the Congressperson from that district is going to become less likely to attack you, even if they believe that you are bad for democracy, that you’re bad for the nation,” says Lynn. “They have such incredible wealth and power already. And, if anything, they’re becoming more sophisticated, using this kind of indirect exercise of power to achieve political ends.”This article was co-commissioned with our sister siteTech Monitoras part of a new series on the Big Tech backlash."

Will Sen. Manchin’s Focus on Moderation Come at the Expense of His Catholic Principles?,14.0,24.0,https://www.ncregister.com/news/will-sen-manchin-s-focus-on-moderation-come-at-the-expense-of-his-catholic-principles,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,16,"Given the 50-50 split in the U.S. Senate, the centrist West Virginia Democrat will wield incredible influence — and likely face extraordinary pressure.“Catholic” means universal. So perhaps it’s a product of his faith that Sen. Joe Manchin tries to be all things to all men, bridging the gap between two increasingly divided parties.The son of a dedicated Italian Catholic family long involved in West Virginia political life, the Democrat senator’s politics are something of a throwback, blending pro-labor economic policy with a mild dose of social conservatism. As a youth,Manchin met members of John F. Kennedy’s family when they came to his hometown of Farmington to campaign for Kennedy and pay their respects to the Manchin family. Kennedy inspired the young Manchin then, and a picture of the nation’s first Catholic president, as well as a quote — “Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer” — hangs in his office today.Manchin’s centrism and political pragmatism have allowed him to not only survive but thrive in a state that has swung hard from Democrat to Republican in recent decades. His political career spans nearly 40 years — including a term as West Virginia’s first Catholic governor in the 2000s and an odds-defying 2018 reelection to the U.S. Senate after Republican Donald Trump won the state by 40% two years earlier. As of this year, Manchin is the only Democrat holding statewide office in West Virginia.And now, with the U.S. Senate split 50-50 between the parties, Manchin’s middle-of-the-road ways have put him in position to exercise significant influence. With Democrats holding a mere Kamala Harris tiebreaker as their only advantage, any legislation they hope to pass will likely have to pass through Manchin, giving him a voice and a stature rarely held by a moderate in today’s climate of entrenched partisanship.“When you see him on theMorning Joeshow or you see him being interviewed, he’s kind of the belle of the ball right now,” said John Kilwein, a professor of political science at West Virginia University. “And I don’t think he minds it.”Manchin has already gone on record saying he’ll oppose elements of the “crazy socialist agenda” being prioritized by his party’s progressive wing, includingending the filibuster,packing the Supreme Court, and defunding the police. A member of the bipartisan “Problem Solvers Caucus,” Manchin has long demonstrated a willingness to cross party lines when he believes a commonsense solution is attainable — or when the political pressure is high enough.With his reelection bid on the horizon, he supported most of President Trump’s cabinet appointments in 2017 and was the only Democrat to cast a favorable vote for Brett Kavanaugh during the Supreme Court justice’s volatile confirmation hearings in the summer of 2018.During his 15 years at the West Virginia Catholic Conference (WVCC), Jesuit Father Brian O’Donnell says he was impressed with Manchin’s “concern for those who are hurting,” adding that, as governor, he was “pretty darned effective” at helping people. Father O’Donnell also noted Manchin’s efforts to build bridges between opponents and described the senator as “authentically in the middle.”“Joe Manchin really does try to find ways to get people to work together,” said Father O’Donnell, who stepped down as WVCC’s director earlier this year and now serves at a parish in Baltimore. “I was very impressed with him.”Manchin’s bona fides as a commonsense problem solver and uniter are beyond question, and they’re needed today more than ever. But in his insistence on finding the middle ground, some worry that Manchin may be in danger of making moderation an end in its own right, liable to sacrifice what matters most: his principles, especially those regarding his commitment to the unborn and other controversial social issues.A self-described pro-lifer, Manchin often talks about how his Catholic faith informs him on the issue and tells the story of when his mother took in a pregnant teenager in need as a moment of great inspiration. In recent years, he has voted “Yea” for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and supported the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act anddrew the ireof some members of his party whenhe stood to applaud Trump’s condemnationof late-term abortion during the 2019 State of the Union address.“Late-term abortions are just horrific,” Manchin isreported to have saidregarding his decision to applaud Trump’s words. “Totally just wrong.”But, if the scorecards ofboth pro-lifeandabortion-rights groupsare any indication, Manchin has something of a mixed record on the issue. In particular, he has zigged and zagged when it has come to funding for the nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood.Manchinvoted against funding Planned Parenthood in 2015when undercover videos showing one of the abortion provider’s employees discussing the sale of fetal remains surfaced. But for the most part, he has justified his votes in support of the abortion giant on the grounds that federal law prevents public funding from going directly toward abortion and that Planned Parenthood provides critical services other than abortion, such as mammograms and STD testing. The lone Planned Parenthood in West Virginia, for instance, doesn’t even provide abortions.Pro-life advocates generally criticize such logic, arguing that any support for Planned Parenthood is, in some way, facilitating the organization’s ability to perform abortions.Manchin’sback-and-forthwas captured visibly in 2017, when, in the span of a month, he was seen in separate photographs, one in which he was helping a supporter hold a sign that read, “We don’t need Planned Parenthood” and the other in which he was helping a supporter hold a sign stating, “I stand with Planned Parenthood.” The strange juxtaposition highlights the political calculus of a man whose electability depends on both appealing to West Virginian conservatives while also not alienating his Democratic base.Manchin, whose office did not return comment before this piece was published, has also made other questionable moves on abortion, such aswarning Trump to avoid picking a judicial nominee who would overturnRoe v. Wadein 2018. The same year, when West Virginians were considering a ballot measure that would add language to the state constitution effectively denying any right to or funding for abortion, Manchin declined to support the amendment on the grounds that itdidn’t include exceptionsfor scenarios involving rape, incest or when the mother’s life was in danger.Pro-lifers pounced on the declaration as an indication of Manchin’s unreliability on abortion, though others, like Father O’Donnell, say it wasn’t a measure that Manchin had any direct control over anyway and was likely used by Republican lawmakers in an attempt to both drive up conservative turnout and create a wedge between Manchin and progressives. Kilwein, however, said it was an instance of “classic Joe Manchin.”“I mean, he’s not a flamethrower. Even if Joe Manchin were the dictator of the world, I think there are certain circumstances where he would say [abortion] has to be available,” speculated the WVU political scientist.Now, with the post-2020 election landscape potentially offering opportunities for abortion-rights activists to strike down regulations and expand access, pro-life advocatesare expressing mixed viewson Manchin’s reliability on the issue. Of particular concern is the status of the Hyde Amendment — a longtime measure that prevents federal funding of elective abortions in Medicaid. On Dec. 30, Manchintold theNational Reviewthat repealing the Hyde Amendment would be “foolish.”“As a lifelong Catholic, I have always been pro-life …” said Manchin. “If this legislation is brought before the Senate, I will vote against repealing the Hyde Amendment.”Some pro-life advocates like Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, are convinced by Manchin’s stance. Day recentlytold Catholic News Agencythat Manchin “doesn’t give in to pressure,” adding that the pro-life community “needs to stand with him.”Others in the movement, like the Susan B. Anthony List’s Mallory Quigley, caution that Manchin “hasn’t always been consistent.” Several point out that many of Manchin’s pro-life votes as a senator have been largely inconsequential, supporting legislation that had no chance of passing, raising doubts that he could be a reliable deciding vote on a pro-life measure.If there’s any concern that Manchin might compromise when it comes to abortion, it might be because there’s concern that he already has.Wanda Franz has known Manchin since he was a freshman delegate to the statehouse in 1982. The president of West Virginians for Life recalls with fondness how the young politician, only 35 at the time, was eager to collaborate with the movement to advance pro-life legislation, even in the face of pressure and criticism from his party and the labor unions, which took a strong stance in favor of abortion rights at the time.Manchin, however, was undeterred, and West Virginians for Life endorsed him throughout his 28 years in state politics.When Manchin ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012, there were concerns that, as a Democrat in Congress, he would face inordinate pressure to compromise his pro-life positions. West Virginians for Life considered the factors and ultimately decided to endorse both Manchin and his pro-life, Republican challenger.Manchin won, but as soon as he got to Washington, Franz says something changed. In one of his first votes as a senator, he voted in favor of funding Planned Parenthood, a move that Franz describes as “a signal for us that this was going to be much harder than he had thought.”Father O’Donnell, although far more confident in Manchin’s authenticity, said Franz was “probably on to something” in her assessment that pressure from national Democratic leadership may be constraining Manchin in ways he wasn’t while in Charleston.“I mean, God only knows what happens behind closed doors,” he said.As a result, a man who Franz once considered a pro-life champion has become something of a question mark.“Over the years, it has been hard for us to know what he would do from one bill to another,” said Franz, whose organization did not endorse Manchin in his 2018 Senate bid. She says she has now come to expect “doublespeak” and noncommittal language from the senator when it comes to abortion legislation.Franz insists that she still considers Manchin a friend, but it saddens her that West Virginians for Life feel like they can’t continue to endorse him.“When it really matters, when it really counts, when there’s really a political stake involved, that’s when we lose him.”Another concern for Catholics is the so-called Equality Act, a measure the U.S. bishopswarn would harm women and childrenby imposing errant frameworks of sexuality and gender via federal law, while also threatening the religious convictions of health-care workers and faith-based charitable services and schools.Last session, Manchin was one of only two congressional Democrats (the other being Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, who was defeated in a primary last year) tospeak out against the measure, saying that he would not vote for it “as written,” given insufficient control for local authorities, especially regarding schools and students identifying as transgender.Manchin may have made a stand then, but with the incoming Biden administration identifying passage of the Equality Act as a top priority, the pressure will be on the West Virginia Democrat.No one, Franz included, questions the sincerity of Manchin’s Catholic faith, nor his personal pro-life convictions. Manchin, for instance, is on good terms with the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston andrecently took part in a discussionon integrating ecology, economy and human dignity with Bishop Mark Brennan. And at his childhood parish of St. Peter’s in Farmington, where Manchin once served as an altar boy, Father Vincy Illickal says “Joe” is a fixture in the pews when he visits over the holidays and speaks deeply and sincerely about the importance of his Catholic faith and his gratitude to God.Instead, the concern of critics like Franz is that Manchin’s personal views run the risk of not translating into his public life. President Biden, after all, styles himself as “personally pro-life” and a devout Catholic, but recently capped off what has been a gradual, decades-long erosion of his once-pro-life commitments bycompromisinghis long-standing support for the Hyde Amendment to help him secure his party’s nomination andcommittingto legislatingRoe v. Wadeinto federal law if the landmark pro-abortion decision is overturned by the current U.S. Supreme Court.As Kilwein points out, Manchin isn’t anywhere near as liberal as Biden is, and the 73-year-old’s senior status might make a dramatic shift leftward unlikely. However, when it comes to repealing the Hyde Amendment and what Manchin might do, there seems to be a variance of opinions, or at least levels of confidence.Kilwein says the issue is “just teed up for Joe Manchin,” in the sense that it would be an easy effort for the moderate to resist his party on the issue.Father O’Donnell, hesitant to offer too much speculation, simply said he would “not be surprised” if the senator continues to support the Hyde Amendment. Franz, meanwhile, says she believes Manchin would maintain his support for the measure, but she would “have to wait until I know for sure.”One thing she does know: Political moderation has its place, but not when it comes to protecting the unborn.“You can’t have it both ways. There are some issues where you can cut a deal and walk a fine line, but when it comes to the pro-life issue, you’re either there or you’re not.”With a mixed record up to this point, time will tell where Manchin stands.Jonathan LiedlJonathan Liedl is senior editor for the Register.

Newsom recall challenged in California appeals court,0.0,45.67,https://capitolweekly.net/newsom-recall-challenged-in-california-appeals-court/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-10,15,"A Sacramento-area resident has challenged the legitimacy of the recall drive against Gov. Gavin Newsom, telling a state appellate court that a Superior Court judge violated the California constitution when he gave recall proponents more time to gather voter signatures.The appeal, filed Monday with the 3rd District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, said Sacramento County Superior Court Judge James Arguelles violated a voter-approved constitutional amendment that limits signature gathering to 160 days to qualify an initiative for the ballot.The filing asks the justices to block the recall until the court rules on the issue.The law has been on the books for nearly 45 years as Proposition 14 of 1976.In November, Arguelles gave recall proponents a 120-day extension to gather the necessary 1,495,709 valid signatures to get the measure on the statewide ballot. At the time of his ruling, recall backers had collected only about 700,000 valid signatures. Citing the COVID-19 pandemic, they told Arguelles that they couldn’t meet the 160-day deadline set in state law.In March, they reported gathering sufficient signatures to make the ballot.On April 26, Secretary of State Shirley Weber said the recall proponents had gathered 1,626,042 signatures — which would be enough to qualify the recall for the ballot if other reviews and analyses are completed by state and local authorities. If it survives those reviews, the recall election could take place in November.But altering the signature-gathering time requires an amendment to the state constitution and can’t be decided by a court, the appeal alleges.“The 160-day provision enacted by the voters in June 1976 by Proposition 14 remains thelaw of the land …,” wrote Carmichael resident Karen Fletcher, who urged the appellate court to  block the recall election. Fletcher, a legal activist, is the long-time companion of Howard Herships, who waged a lengthy fight against the fees and penalties of California’s red-light camera laws.‘It is only by a ballot measure that the 160-day provision can be enlarged or changed,” Fletcher added.She noted that Newsom’s opponents had tried five times previously — all before the onset of the pandemic — but failed to gather a sufficient number of signatures to make the ballot for a recall election.There was no immediate comment from the recall campaign.Arguelles, appointed to the bench by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, was named by former President Donald Trump in June 2020 to the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District in Sacramento. The U.S. Senate adjourned, however, before taking up the appointment; Arguelles remains on the county Superior Court bench.Want to see more stories like this? Sign up forThe Roundup,

Sen. Wyden urges government to boost broadband speed targets,0.0,48.0,https://www.engadget.com/senator-ron-wyden-broadband-stimulus-funding-speed-targets-180345407.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/engadget-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,15,"Although the government has pledged to help expand high-speed broadband access in communities that need it, officials need to expand the eligibility criteria, according to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). President Joe Bidensignedthe American Rescue Plan Act into law in March. It directs the Treasury Department to distribute billions of dollars in stimulus funding to local and state governments.Those funds can be used to improve broadband access, but the bill severely limits the eligibility criteria for such projects. The bill says that only unserved or underserved communities can use the federal funding to improve broadband access, asThe Vergenotes. According to the Federal Communications Commission, communities with internet speedsof under 25 Mbps downand 3 Mbps up are underserved. That definition has remained the same since 2015.Wyden says those speeds are not nearly fast enough for current needs, calling that benchmark ""woefully outdated."" He wants communities where speeds are less than 100 Mbps up and down to be classed as underserved and to be eligible for upgraded internet infrastructure under this plan.“The mass adoption of video calling, streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive apps by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that miserly speeds and data caps are holding back telework, remote education and telehealth capacity,” Wyden wrote ina letterto Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to telework and engage in remote schooling while sharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”Wyden went on to argue that a failure to address concerns “will further expand the digital divide and jeopardize our ability as a nation to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as you finalize the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Final Rule, I urge [Yellen] to clarify that underserved locations include anywhere affordable, reliable broadband of at least 100 Mbps symmetric is not available."" Wyden added that ""to be accessible, broadband must also be affordable.""Other lawmakers have been pushing the FCC to upgrade the definition of high-speed broadband to 100 Mbps up and down. Earlier this month, California announced a budget plan thatearmarked $9 billion for internet infrastructure, noting that ""service at speeds below 100 Mbps is not enough for households who are juggling the demands of distance learning, telework, and accessing health care online."""
New Reports Indicate AOC Was Not in Capitol At Time of Attack,22.0,25.33,https://thelibertyloft.com/new-reports-indicate-aoc-was-not-in-capitol-at-time-of-attack/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,15,"Washington, DC — New reports are that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was not in the Capitol at the time of the attack on January 6. AOC was in her office in the Cannon building, which is adjacent to the Capitol. While the complex is connected, it is not the area where the breach actually occurred.https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1357047129911492619?s=20AOChas claimed that the eventthat she experienced was a “near-death” experience. In her recount of the events, she said she felt she was mere moments away from dying. She shared she had security concerns while she was in a room with other members of Congress.Except none of that appears to be true. She appears to have been in her office, away from the events entirely.AOC was quick to respond to the new reports. She made statements about the reports on Twitter.People were trying to rush and infiltrate our office buildings – that’s why we had to get evacuated in the first place.The attempts of attackers & publicly available communications show how they tried to gain access and share location info on finding members for physical harm.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)February 3, 2021She states that the reports are examples of the manipulative right and that no one understands the layout of the Capitol complex. You can see the layout above and see that the is clearly not near the Capitol building that was breached. Rioters never breached the Cannon building.She also claims that Trump supporters planted bombs around her offices. While those bombs were relocated outside the RNC and DNC offices, neither of those are located in the Cannon building. The closest is the RNC, which is in an adjacent block.It looks more like AOC is the one manipulating here. She appears to be manipulating her story to create an emotional response.

You Can Now Order Abortion Pills Before You're Pregnant in All 50 States,-13.67,35.0,https://jezebel.com/you-can-now-order-abortion-pills-before-youre-pregnant-1847910143,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,15,"Just beforeTexas’ 6-week abortion bantook effect on September 1, onlinemedication abortionproviderAid Accessbegan tolet Texans who aren’t pregnant order the pillsto prepare for a future unwanted pregnancy. This is a concept known as “advance provision,” and it’s akin to having emergency contraception waiting in your medicine cabinet before you actually need it. It’s especially helpful for people living in rural areas or in places hostile to birth control and abortion.Now,Aid Accesshas quietly rolled out advance provision ofabortion pillsto people capable of pregnancy in all 50 states—a move that could revolutionize how people obtain and think about early abortion care in the US.Dr. Daniel Grossman, professor of gynecology at University of California, San Francisco, and the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), told Jezebel that this model could help people access abortion earlier in pregnancy than they would otherwise if navigating layered state barriers. In 2018, Grossmanpublished datashowing that 45 percent of 7,000 people surveyed are interested in advance provision, even moreso than they are in getting the pills over the counter or online without interacting with a clinician.“I’ve been talking about it for a few years and it’s been hard to get any traction, either among researchers or among providers,” Dr. Grossman said. “My hope is that this will spark a conversation among mainstream healthcare providers to think about how should this model be integrated and how should it be tested and be part of mainstream medicine, where we could also then advocate for insurance coverage.” He also noted that it could help familiarize more people with medication abortion. “I’m still amazed how many people don’t even know about this option or areconfused between that and Plan B.”The medications mifepristone and misoprostol have been available in the US for more than 20 years, and the combination of meds, which essentially induce a miscarriage, is FDA-approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy. But they are highly regulated—you can only be handed the pills in a doctor’s office, not a pharmacy, and you typically have to be pregnant in order to get them. Plus, until the pandemic hit, theFDA didn’t allow the pills to be mailedoutside of a sanctioned clinical study. A Dutch physician, Rebecca Gomperts,launched Aid Access in 2018as a humanitarian effort to help people seeking abortions in highly restrictive areas of the US, like the South and Midwest. During the pandemic, they started working with US-based providers who were newly able to mail the pills. And now they’ve expanded their services to include nationwide advance provision.In 18 states that bothpermit medication abortion to be prescribed via telemedicineand where Aid Access has providers, a US-based provider will review the web consult and write the script, thepatient will pay $150, and the package will arrive in a few days. In other states, an overseas provider will write the script, patients willpay $110, and get the pills from a pharmacy in India in two to four weeks. (Financial help is available for either option.)Aid Access notes that people should contact them immediately if they become pregnant in the future so they can guide them through the process. They advise checking the expiration dates when you receive the medicines and note that most pills can be kept up to two years after receiving them.Dr. Grossman said that, ideally, a provider prescribing these medications in advance would counsel people on how to track their period as well as on the early signs of pregnancy, and offer support to people when they plan to use the pills. It would also be beneficial to study the practice as he noted that the FDA considered data on advance provision of emergency contraception (brand name Plan B) when evaluating whether to make it available over the counter,another model he’s studiedfor abortion pills.As for the inevitable criticism from anti-abortion lawmakers and activists (and some pro-choice ones) that services like this will lead to people giving pills to others seeking to terminate a pregnancy, aka “diversion”—this could be happening now. Since FDA labeling changes in 2016, patients are no longer required to take the first pill in the office; they can start the process at a time of their choosing. Since people take the pills at home, it’s possible that diversion occurs, though there’s no scientific evidence of that happening, Dr. Grossman said. And some health providers are already writing prescriptions for people who aren’t pregnant because they’re going to a country or region with limited abortion access for an extended period of time, like the Peace Corps, he said.While one site prescribing pills in advance of pregnancy will help some people, it’s important to emphasize thatabortion pills alone will not solve the access problem in the U.S.First, Aid Access isn’t covered by insurance and some might pay out of pocket for care that would be covered in a clinic. Other patients won’t learn they’re pregnant or know they need an abortion until they’re beyond the medication abortion window. For some, it’s not safe to have a miscarriage at home because of abusive partners or religious family members. And many pregnant people will still prefer in-clinic procedures because they’re over faster and allow them to get back to their jobs, schooling, or families the next day. Plus, managing your own abortion isexplicitly criminalized in three states(Oklahoma, South Carolina, and, after 22 weeks, Nevada) and could be legally risky inmany more.Robin Marty, journalist and author of theHandbook for a Post-Roe Americaand head of operations for West Alabama Women’s Center, an abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa, offered some advice to mitigate those risks. Whether ordering on your phone or a computer, use private browsers and clear your cache afterward. Since the pills are good for about two years, people could run into trouble even for a future wanted pregnancy that ends in miscarriage or stillbirth if someone remembers you talking about ordering pills. If people want to tell trusted friends, doing so in person or over the phone are the safest options, followed by encrypted, disappearing messages on an app like Signal, Marty told Jezebel.Overall, this move by Aid Access is a good thing, Marty said, but it will have consequences. “I have always been a huge proponent of people being able to access medication abortion as quickly as possible and before they actually need it, and Aid Access appears to be the first one who is able to make this occur [on a broader scale],” she said.“I would definitely encourage people who are interested in this in doing this while they can,” she said. “The response to this is going to be a far more aggressive stance and [states] starting to criminalize directly any person who performs their own abortion.”If you or someone you know needs assistance self-managing a miscarriage or abortion, you can call theMiscarriage + Abortion Hotlineat (833) 246-2632 for confidential medical support, or theRepro Legal Helplineat (844) 868-2812 for confidential legal information and advice."
Almost all CU Boulder students suspended this year violated campus or local coronavirus mandates,-0.67,43.67,https://www.coloradodaily.com/2020/11/07/almost-all-cu-boulder-students-suspended-this-year-violated-campus-or-local-coronavirus-mandates/,https://adfontesmedia.com/colorado-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,15,"Nearly every student suspended from the University of Colorado Boulder so far this year was suspended for violating local or campus coronavirus mandates, according to university leaders.CU Boulder hassuspended 24 studentsfor not following coronavirus public health measures as of Wednesday, and those students must reapply for admission next semester.The campus has seen “very little, if any” suspensions outside of coronavirus violations, said Devin Cramer, assistant dean of students.Cramer declined to give an exact number, citing concerns about student privacy.CU Boulder sees approximately 25 to 30 suspensions during a typical academic year, Cramer said, most of those in the fall semester.“That’s not comparing apples to apples this year. Outside of COVID-19 related suspensions, we’re seeing a lot less concerning behavior from students, a lot less concerning behaviors regarding alcohol,” Cramer said. “We’re not seeing many felony-type behavior or repeat behavior that we would in a regular semester.”Every suspension for coronavirus has been related to either hosting a party or for breaking isolation, Cramer said. There have been no suspensions for repeated smaller infractions, like not wearing a mask.The vast majority of students referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution are sent there for small violations, Cramer said, like students having too many guests in their dorm rooms or not wearing face coverings while going to the bathroom down the hall. Most of those students are not repeat offenders.Some of the referrals stem from confusion among students about changing coronavirus rules or not reading their housing contracts to see what’s required, Cramer said. For students who host parties, Cramer said he’s heard from several students this week that gatherings grew larger than they intended.“They’ll invite friends over and while that violates the public health order if it’s 12 or 15 people, those friends then invite 10 friends who invite 10 friends,” Cramer said.If a student is hosting a party that grows too large, they can contact police to help break it up and not be disciplined by the university, Cramer said.On-campus students who are not taking their weekly coronavirus monitoring tests are also referred to the conduct office, as that’s a requirement of living on campus.Most off-campus students are referred to the conduct office through the Boulder Police Department, as well as some reports from students and community members. On-campus students are mostly referred by student employees in residence halls or residential service officers who work for campus police.Resident advisors have always been tasked with enforcing campus policies, though that took on an extra layer of responsibility this year with new coronavirus rules.RAs received coronavirus training over the summer, said Director of Residence Life Crystal Lay, and are in regular contact with hall directors to ask questions or follow up.What’s been difficult is that the job has become much more about enforcement than about building community, Lay said. Community building is one aspect university leaders have pledged to improve during the spring semester.“The heartburn that I’ve heard directly is that they feel a little isolated and lonely, because it wasn’t as evenly balanced as in the past,” Lay said. “There wasn’t this large, in-person community feel and fun pieces that they were hoping for.”Departments across campus are collaborating to improve the student experience, Lay said, as well as asking students what they want to see more of while “balancing that community with safety.”“RAs have a really hard job. They are student leaders, they’re taking on this wonderful opportunity to really engage their peers, and I hope their peers see that and see them as leaders and helpers instead of solely enforcers,” Lay said."
Former Olympic Gymnastics Coach Found Dead After Trafficking Charges,0.0,52.33,https://www.comicsands.com/olympic-gymnastics-coach-geddert-suicide-2650813322.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/comic-sands-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-26,15,"Former USA Gymnastics coach John Geddert was found dead by suicide on Thursday afternoon, less than a day after Michigan prosecutors announced criminal charges of human trafficking and sexual assault against him,Huffington Postreported.Geddertfoundedthe Twistars USA Gymnastics Club in Diamondale, Michigan. He coached hundreds of female teenage gymnasts eager to compete on the world stage at the Olympics.He went on to coach the gold-medal winning 2012 U.S. women's Olympic team. Geddert was known by many to embody a hot-tempered, strict, often physically abusive coaching style.But in 2018, Geddert faced a new level of scrutiny following the highly publicized trial of Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics team doctor who sexually abused over 500 girls over the course of decades.During Nassar's trial, which effectively landed him in prison for life, dozens of the doctor's victims read impact statements outlining all Nassar did to them.Throughout the trial, it became clear Nassar abused many girls in a back room at Twistars gym and Geddert was complicit in a systemic campaign allowing Nassar's physical, sexual and emotional abuse to continue unabated.Those claims led USA Gymnastics to suspend Geddert. The claims also initiated a separate criminal investigation into allegations Geddert physically abused gymnasts, theLansing State Journalannounced at the time.That investigation eventually culminated in the 24 charges against Geddert announced less than a day before his suicide.Those charges included 20 counts of human trafficking of a minor, first-degree criminal sexual assault, second-degree criminal sexual assault involving a minor, and racketeering, theDetroit Newsreported. Only one charge of lying to an officer directly related to Larry Nassar, however.TheDetroit Newswent on to report Geddert's body was found at 3:24 pm, about an hour after he was expected to turn himself in to authorities. Following Geddert's death, several of his victims came forward to share their responses to the news.With Geddert now deceased and Nassar behind bars, the last place focus will remain is on USA Gymnastics.Time will tell if the organization can revive the trust of athletes, families, and fans in the wake of so many unsafe years.*If you or someone you know is struggling, you can contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).To find help outside the United States, the International Association for Suicide Prevention has resources available athttps://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/"
Kentucky AG Admits Homicide Charges Were Never Presented Shortly After Agreeing to Release Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Recordings,-7.33,48.0,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/09/29/kentucky-ag-admits-homicide-charges-were-never-presented-shortly-after-agreeing-to-release-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-recordings,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-29,15,"On the same day Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron agreed to release grand jury recording for theBreonna Taylorcase after an anonymous grand juror filed a motion in court, he quietly dropped a bombshell: he never recommended a homicide charge to the grand jurors to consider against the Louisville Metro Police Department policemen involved in Taylor’s slaying.Cameron agreed to release the recordings on Monday, hours after the grand juror requested all recordings and transcripts from the proceedings be released so “the truth may prevail,” asreportedby The Louisville Courier Journal.“The full story and absolute truth of how this matter was handled from beginning to end is now an issue of great public interest and has become a large part of the discussion of public trust throughout the country,” wrote Kevin Glogower, a lawyer representing the juror, wrote in court documents.The juror, who wishes to remain anonymous, also wants jurors to be allowed to give up their confidentiality so they can speak freely about the proceedings. The request includes any talk about “any potential charges and defendants presented or not presented.”Cameron, likely anticipating that the grand jury proceedings would reveal which charges were not recommended, said in a statement about the grand jury recordings emailed to news outlets on Monday that homicide charges against the three LMPD officers were never on the table.“Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker,” Cameronstated, referring to Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, two other officers who participated in the shooting. Neither of them were charged.“For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.”In last week’s news conference announcing the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, Cameron never mentioned whether that body was presented with homicide charges to consider. In Kentucky, like in many other states, a prosecutor does not have to wait for a grand jury indictment to bring charges against a defendant, nor is a prosecutor precluded from presenting charges to a second or subsequent grand juries if the initial one fails to indict on charges presented.The grand juror’s motion accused Cameron of using the grand jury “as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for those decisions” which planted “more seeds of doubt in the process.”The motion added that Cameron has tried to lay the grand jury’s decision solely “at the feet of the grand jury while failing to answer specific questions regarding the charges presented.”The “Attorney General Cameron attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to them.“The only exception to the responsibility he foisted upon the grand jurors was in his statement that they ‘agreed’ with his team’s investigation that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their actions.”Last week, outrage spread across the nation afterthe grand jury indictedformer Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison on one count of wanton endangerment for shots that hit an apartment next door to Taylor’s home. Taylor died on March 13 after Hankison and two other officers fired shots into her apartment while executing a narcotics warrant related to her ex-boyfriend.Cameron previously had refused to release details related to the grand jury session due to supposed concerns about confidentiality and tainting of a potential jury pool.“We stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool,” Cameronsaid in Monday’s statement.Despite his misgivings, he agreed to release the recordings on Wednesday to comply with an order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who ordered Monday: “The recording of the grand jury proceedings shall be filed in the court file by noon of Wednesday this week.”Cameron, faced with the judge’s order, complied. “The Grand Jury is meant to be a secretive body,” his statement said. “It’s apparent that the public interest in this case isn’t going to allow that to happen. As the special prosecutor, our team has an ethical obligation not to release the recording from the Grand Jury proceedings, and we stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool.”In a statement provided to Atlanta Black Star, Taylor family attorneys Ben Crump, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker called for the release of all transcripts for the proceedings.“Since the grand jury decision was announced, we’ve been saying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case that supported justice for Breonna. That conclusion is supported by the grand juror who came forward to say that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury’s deliberations,” the statement read.“We fully support the call to release the entire proceeding transcript as the only way to know what evidence was presented and how the grand jury instructions led to this outcome. In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect themselves and their property from intruders,” the statement continued.“The police cannot claim their use of force was justified when they wrongly broke into Breonna’s apartment in the first place. We urge the Attorney General to release a COMPLETE and UNEDITED copy of the recording, along with any and all evidence in Bre’s case.”"
How To Stop Cops From Killing People Suffering From Mental Illness,-7.33,45.33,https://newsone.com/4009086/how-to-stop-cops-from-killing-people-suffering-from-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsone-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-05,15,"Two years prior, in 2018,Shukri Ali Saidof Georgia also wound up dead after leaving her house during a mental health crisis on April 23, 2018. Police, called in to help, found Said standing at an intersection holding a knife. Officers shot her five times in the neck and chest, killing her.That same month, in New York, officers answered a 911 call about a black man waving something that looked like a gun. In fact, it was a pipe. But whenSaheed Vassell, a 34-year-old father with mental illness who was well known in his Brooklyn community, pointed it at police, they shot him dead.Prude, Vassell and Said are among the hundreds of people with intellectual disabilities ormental illnessesin the United Stateskilled by policeevery year. According toThe Washington Post, 197 of the 999 people shot by police last year had a mental illness.Police are almost always the first responders in cases of mental health crises in the United States, as they are in criminal and medical emergencies.But the police – who aretrainedto give orders and useforcewhen they feel endangered – are generally ill-equipped to handle people with mental health challenges.As adisability and ethics scholarwho focuses on criminal justice, I know this country has long failed to justly and humanely care for people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities.For most of American history, people with mental health disabilities were locked away in hospital-like institutions, many of them state-run. Starting in the 1950s, the physical and sexual abuse common in these facilities, as well asother inhumane practices, spurred a decades-long effort to close them down and return residents to the community.This process, calleddeinstitutionalization, was meant to replace institutions with localmental health centersthat would provide community-based mental health treatment and assistance for those recently released from institutions.However, in 1981Ronald Reagancut most funding for these centers. And sinceother existing community services– like schools, housing and health services – were not adapted to meet the needs of these new community members, many were left jobless, homeless and unable to get a good education.Today, the 15% ofAmericanswiththesedisabilitiesstill have very little support.Some people are fortunate enough to live with their families or in one of the United States’ roughly500 private residential facilities– places that can cost up toUS$60,000 a year. Others end uphomeless, in poorly run facilities or even in jails.But everyone with these disabilities is at high risk of interacting with police. Too often, theseinteractions go poorly.In hopes of identifying practices that prevent avoidable deaths, I’ve been interviewing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities about their experiences with the criminal justice system. Under the terms of the academic ethics boards overseeing my research, the names of all my interview subjects are protected.One reason police encounters can go wrong, I’ve learned, is that people with intellectual disabilities often struggle to comprehend spoken instructions – particularly in a high-stress situation.“People who don’t have [an intellectual disability] don’t have a hard time understanding what the police are asking them to do,” one man told me. “It’s different for me.”Being overwhelmed can cause people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities toshut down. If this behavior is interpreted asobstinate, it can lead to arrest, detention or police aggression.People with these disabilities are also oftendisbelieved by the police. A woman I interviewed – who communicated slowly due to her disabilities – said she called 911 on her boyfriend for hitting her. But the police believed the boyfriend’s story that she was the violent one and arrested her instead.“When they find out that you’re not capable of understanding what’s going on, it’s a free-for-all,” another interview subject told me.People with intellectual disabilities may struggle in court, too. When one interviewee didn’t understand a judge’s question, he told me, he was sentenced to three months in county jail for disorderly conduct.Judges and lawyers “need to listen to people that’s on disability,” said the woman arrested after calling 911 on her abusive partner, urging patience.Recognizing that they struggle to handle people in mental crisis, many U.S. cities are making efforts to improve outcomes.New York Citytrains some officers incrisis interventionand recently mandated that a social worker must accompany officers to such cases.Denver is looking to adoptamobile crisis intervention programstarted in Oregon that ensures medics and crisis workers, not police, respond to mental health calls.These andsimilar efforts nationwideare a step in the right direction. But my research indicates they may not go far enough.Police frequently encounter people with psychiatric disabilities when someone calls 911 about a person acting unusually in public. If police perceive that person as potentially violent, thesituation can quickly escalate.That’s howAnthony Hill, a black veteran found wandering around his Atlanta apartment complex naked, died in 2015. Hill, who had gone off his medication, ran toward Officer Robert Olsen, who shot him. Olsen was sentenced to12 years in prisonon Nov. 1, 2019, for aggravated assault and violating his oath of office.Nor do laws targeting police violence address the factors that lead people with mental health disabilities to need emergency assistance in the first place.Despite growingrecognitionof thestigma around mental illness, people with mental health disabilities are often stillfeared, pitiedandassociated withviolencein TV and movies. This social stigma can lead to societal rejection and isolation. And the difficulties people with mental health challenges face findingadequate housing, health care and employmentall increase their risk ofinvolvement with the criminal justice system.One lesson from the history of American mental health care is that reforming just one problematic aspect of the systemdoesn’t work. To serve this population’s needs, other institutions – from education to housing – must also be made more flexible, responsive and accessible.Just as shuttering institutions 60 years ago solved little, simplytargeting police responseswon’t suffice now, either.This story has been updated to reflect the latest developments.Jennifer Sarrett, Lecturer, Center for Study of Human Health,Emory UniversityThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

But that didn’t stop him from becoming the butt of the internet when he recently suggested an alternative to vaccines in an absurd tweet.“What if instead of a vaccine we just were able to get exposed to a weak version of the virus that enabled us to build the antibodies we need to fight the real thing,” Posobiec asked.As a plethora of Twitter users pointed out, that’s exactly what a vaccine is.(Except, weirdly, in this instance, where the coronavirus vaccine doesn’t use a version of the virus, but rather mRNA, which acts like a version of the virus yada yada yada.)bruh,,,,,what do u think a vaccine is???https://t.co/E8OsLHazPoIf only there was a name for something like that.https://t.co/5GV1AvrT8Ywhat if instead of a vaccine we made a vaccineWhat if instead of food we found some sort of substance we could chew up – maybe from an animal or a vegetable – that could make us less hungry instead?https://t.co/yATAtS9YFhWhile Posobiec later claimed people completely missed that he wastrolling, it’s unclear what exactly the troll might be.

History Shows Americans Have Always Been Wary of Vaccines,0.0,43.33,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/history-shows-americans-have-always-been-wary-vaccines-180976828/,https://adfontesmedia.com/smithsonian-magazine-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,15,"As long as vaccines have existed, humans have been suspicious of both the shots and those who administer them. The first inoculation deployed in America, against smallpox in the 1720s, was decried as antithetical to God’s will. An outraged citizentosseda bomb through the window of a house where pro-vaccination Boston minister Cotton Mather lived to dissuade him from his mission.It did not stop Mather’s campaign.After British physicianEdward Jennerdeveloped a more effective smallpox vaccine in the late 1700s—using a related cowpox virus as the inoculant—fear of the unknown continued despite its success in preventing transmission. An 1802 cartoon, entitledThe Cow Pock—or—the Wonderful Effects of the New Innoculation,depictsa startled crowd of vaccinees who have seemingly morphed into a cow-human chimera, with the front ends of cattle leaping out of their mouths, eyes, ears and behinds.Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says the outlandish fiction of the cartoon continues to reverberate with false claims that vaccines cause autism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, or that the messenger RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna lead to infertility.“People are just frightened whenever you inject them with a biological, so their imaginations run wild,” Offit recently told attendees of“Racing for Vaccines,”a webinar organized by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.“The birth of the first anti-vaccine movement was with the first vaccine,” says Offit. People don’t want to be compelled to take a vaccine, so “they create these images, many of which obviously are based on false notions.”“There’s a history of the question of how you balance individual liberty—the right to refuse—versus the policing of the public health,” agreesKeith Wailoo, a medical historian at Princeton University and another panelist at the event.Because vaccines are given to otherwise healthy people that always brings an element of fear into the picture, saysDiane Wendt, a curator in the museum’s division of medicine and science.Wendt and her colleagues have been holding webinars under the moniker “Pandemic Perspectives.” The online panel discussions provide a vehicle to show off some of the museum’s images and artifacts while the building remains closed in Washington, D.C., during the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts provide context to the various topics, saysArthur Daemmrich, director of the museum’sLemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. “Racing for Vaccines” highlighted centuries of scientific progress and technological innovation, which has persisted even in the face of vaccine hesitancy. Of all the diseases for which humans have developed vaccines, only smallpox has been almost fully vanquished on Earth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says14 other diseasesthat used to be prevalent in the U.S. have been quashed by vaccination.After smallpox, vaccine efforts around the globe focused on diseases that were decimating livestock—the lifeblood of many economies. The French scientist and physicianLouis Pasteurhad by the late 1870s come up with a method to vaccinate chickens against cholera. He then moved on to help develop an anthrax vaccine for sheep, goats and cows in 1881. A few years later, Pasteur had come up with the first vaccine to protect humans against rabies, which by 1920 required one shot a day for 21 days.Early vaccines relied on developing science. When the influenza pandemic of 1918 crashed down on the world, no one had the ability to visualize viruses. Bacteria cultured from victims’ lungs was erroneously thought by leading scientists to be the cause of the illness, saysJohn Grabenstein, the founder of Vaccine Dynamics and a previous director of U.S. Department of Defense Military Vaccine Agency.Researchers created flu vaccines that failed because they targeted bacteria, not the true viral cause. The viruses weren’tisolateduntil the 1930s and the first inactivated flu virus for widespread use was not approved until 1945. By contrast, the Covid-19 vaccine went from genetic sequence to near-complete clinical trials, full scale production and delivery to Americans within eight or nine months.The technology has come a long way. Early smallpox inoculation required scraping out material from a pustule or a scab of someone who had been vaccinated and then scratching it into someone else’s arm, using a hollowed-out needle or something like the spring-loaded vaccinator device from the 1850s that can be found in the museum’s collections. A bifurcated needle that delivers a tiny amount of vaccine subcutaneously is still used today.In the 1890s, the development of an antitoxin to treat diphtheria gave rise to the pharmaceutical industry and to a regulatory infrastructure to help ensure the safety of drugs. Diphtheria led to sickness and death when toxins emitted by theCorynebacterium diphtheriaebacteria coated the lungs and throat, giving rise to its common name, the “strangling angel.” Between 100,000 to 200,000 American children contracted the illness each year, and 15,000 died.The New York City Health Department was aleaderin diphtheria antitoxin production in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Scientists gave horses ever-increasing doses of toxins; the animals in turn produced antitoxins, which wereharvestedby bleeding the horses. The horse serum was purified and then administered to children. It helped prevent disease progression and conferred some short-term immunity, says Wendt.“The impact of this particular product, the antitoxin, in the 1890s was huge,” she says.Several drug companies—including H.K. Mulford Co., which also manufactured a smallpox vaccine, and Lederle, founded in 1906 by a former New York health commissioner who had been active in the agency’s diphtheria efforts—commercializedthe antitoxin. But tragedy struck. The St. Louis health departmentallowedcontaminated antitoxin serum from one of its horses—who had died of tetanus—to be distributed. Twenty-two children died.That led to the Biologics Control Act of 1902, which set the stage for federal regulation of vaccines with the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration.However, as seen through history, “getting vaccines to their destination is a continuing challenge,” says Wailoo. In 1925, Nome, Alaska, experienced a diphtheria outbreak. The town was snowbound. Twenty mushers and 150 sled dogs, including the famous lead dog Balto, relayed antitoxin across the state to Nome, helping to end the epidemic.“We don’t have dog sleds to deal with today,” says Grabenstein, but theultra-cold temperaturesof -70 degrees Celsius/-94 degrees Fahrenheit required for transport and storage of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is a high hurdle.Before Covid-19, the largest nationwide emergency effort to eradicate a disease came in the 1950s, when the polio virus reached apeakof almost 60,000 cases, fomenting anxiety across America. Children experienced paralysis, disability and death.Jonas Salk—who helped develop the influenza vaccine—created a new, equally important vaccine for polio. It was tested in one of the largest-ever trials, involving 1.8 million children, who were known as the Polio Pioneers, says Offit.When Salk announced on April 12, 1955, that it was “safe, potent and effective,” the vaccine was approved within hours and rolled out immediately, Offit says. “This was Warp Speed One,” he says, playing off the Operation Warp Speed program that aided development of the Covid-19 vaccines.Ultimately, for vaccines to work, they have to be administered. Public health officials in 1970 encouraged rubella vaccination for children with posters that stated that “Today’s little people protect tomorrow’s little people.” That’s because pregnant women who contract rubella are at risk for miscarriage or stillbirth. “This speaks to communal responsibility,” says Wendt, noting that many campaigns have aimed to motivate Americans to accept vaccines to protect not just themselves, but society at large.In the past, some pharmaceutical companies—such as Mulford—have produced stickers and buttons that allow the wearer to declare they’ve been vaccinated. The CDC has createdstickersthat lets Covid-19 recipients tell the world they got their shot.But many Americans—especially people of color—are still skeptical.“The African American community, for good reason, unfortunately, has seen a legacy of disparate care, of lack of care, including several high-profile incidents like Tuskegee and others where they feel the medical system abandoned them,” says Daemmrich. In theTuskegee experiment, government researchers studied black men with syphilis and told them they were being treated, but they were not receiving any therapies. The men were never offered proper treatment, either.“There’s a lot of distrust,” Daemmrich says, adding, “it’s not entirely clear how you overcome that distrust,” but that, “just showing up now in the midst of the pandemic and saying ok trust us now isn’t the way to do it.”The Kaiser Family Foundationhas been trackinghesitancy around the Covid-19 vaccine. In December, before the two vaccines had been distributed, 35 percent of black adults said they would definitely or probably not get vaccinated, compared to 27 percent of the public overall. About half of those black adults said they didn’t trust vaccines in general or that worried they would get Covid-19 from the vaccine. By January this year, Kaiserfoundthat while about 60 percent of black respondents said they thought vaccines were being distributed fairly, half said they were not confident that the efforts were taking the needs of black people into account.Early data on the vaccine rollout confirms some of those fears. Kaiserfoundthat in more than a dozen states, vaccinations in black Americans were far lower than for white Americans and not proportionate to black people’s share of case counts and deaths.And, few people alive now have seen anything comparable in terms of the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic, says Wailoo. “Maybe the scale of this is enough of an incentive,” he says.Offit isn’t as certain. “We saw polio as a shared national tragedy—it pulled us all together,” he says. “It’s harder to watch what goes on today, where it feels like we’re not getting together, rather just more finger-pointing.”"

‘Last responders’ brace for COVID deaths,-3.67,45.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/24/last-responders-brace-for-covid-deaths/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-12,15,"Funeral director Kevin Spitzer has been overwhelmed with COVID-related deaths in the small city of Aberdeen, South Dakota.He and his two colleagues at the Spitzer-Miller Funeral Home are working 12-15 hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with the demand in the community of 26,000. The funerals are sparsely attended, which would have been unthinkable before the pandemic.“We had a funeral for a younger man one recent Saturday, and not 20 people came, because most everyone was just afraid,” he said.As COVID-19 has spread from big cities to rural communities, it has stressed not only hospitals, but also what some euphemistically call “last responders.” The crush has overwhelmed morgues, funeral homes and religious leaders, required ingenuity and even changed the rituals of honoring the dead.Officials in many smaller cities and towns learned from seeing the overflow of bodies during this spring’s first wave of COVID deaths in places such as Detroit, where nurses at Detroit Medical Center Sinai-Grace Hospital alerted the mediato bodies accumulating in hospital storage rooms. They watched as New York hospitals and funeral homes marshaled refrigerated trucks to store bodies. More than 600 bodies of people who died in the spring COVID surgeremain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfrontbecause officials can’t find next of kin, or relatives are also sick or unable to pay for burial.People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana’s chief medical examiner, took heed. Last spring, he worked with funeral directors and others to study the state’s morgue capacity. After looking at COVID projections, the state arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigerated semitrucks ready to dispatch anywhere in the state.“We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present a scary proposition,” he said. “We need to be ready for worst-case scenarios.”Chad Towner, CEO of St. Joseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigerated semitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit.“I told a friend who was a COVID doubter that if my wife needed a bed today, I could not arrange one. That’s the dire situation we face here,” Towner said. “All our competitors in the area are in the same boat, and we’re working together instead of competing.”“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people. Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that the sharp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary.“We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,” said Towner. “A priest approached me to say he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.”Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is a slower process than usual, he said. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that are sick or quarantined at the time of the loved one’s death often can’t work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entire system is stressed to the tipping point,” said Towner.Private enterprise has created a solution for smaller communities. In Bozeman, Montana, a specialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup.Acela Truck Co. has already sold hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We’re very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48 states,” said CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsy supply company, to help sell and deliver the new product.Billings Clinic in Montana also anticipated a flood of deaths last spring by reserving a semitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morgue spaces, has dealt with 80 COVID deaths, including seven on the weekend after Thanksgiving.Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smith said the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting office space and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds, so far has handled the additional deaths through what she calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannot store.The hospital does its best to allow relatives to say goodbye, but that often involves family members standing at an interior window outside the patient’s room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words.That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID.Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs.“We are using mostly recordings, sometimes a soloist,” said Spitzer.Funeral home directors who pride themselves on spending time comforting grieving families say they are so busy that some days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one.“Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing the support of having friends and family around them,” said Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota.Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the most seriously disrupted.“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,” said Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”COVID has even affected body disposal. Asurveyby the National Funeral Directors Association found that more than half of their members reported increased cremation rates due to COVID. The NFDA also found that half its members have clients who have postponed services to hold a memorial later.In the largely impoverished Hidalgo County, a Texas border area, county officials began using COVID funds to help cover the burial costs for struggling families. Then they begin hearing of the emotional costs, including the anguish of videoconferenced funerals, such as for a family that had lost a husband, a mother and an aunt in one month. They wondered if there would be interest in an alternative way to honor the dead.“We sent out a social media post asking if anyone wanted to post a photograph of a relative who died of COVID if we created a county memorial page,” said county spokesperson Carlos Sanchez, who himself barely survived a bout with COVID in July. “Within minutes, we got more than 20 emails. Several sent photos of multiple relatives. They want them to be remembered.”KHN(Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues. It is an editorially independent program ofKFF(Kaiser Family Foundation) that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.The Montana GOP uninvited a planned convention speaker amid U.S. Senate drama.The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new fire station and additional police officers and firefighters.Health care providers, patient advocates and state lawmakers continue to hammer the administration of Gov.

A Bipartisan Push for War Powers Reform,0.0,42.67,https://thedispatch.com/p/a-bipartisan-push-for-war-powers,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-dispatch-bias-reliability/,2021-10-12,15,"The U.S. Constitution grants the power to declare war and “raise and support” an army and navy to the legislative branch, not the executive. But in recent decades, war powers have shifted more and more to the president, leaving some of the most important decisions the country’s leaders face to the White House, sometimes without consultation with members of Congress.Even when Congress tries to reassert its war powers or legislate against a president’s decision to engage in hostilities, rarely are lawmakers able to mount a veto-proof majority in either chamber, meaning the president ultimately gets what he wants. Just look to the Trump years: AsSoren Dayton of Protect Democracy points out, Congress tried to rebuke decisions by the former president several times in 2019 and 2020, but members were thwarted by a veto each time such legislation passed.Theserebukesincluded, among other measures, legislation to prohibit unauthorized hostilities against Iran, to end American involvement in the war in Yemen, and to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia.“These are not powers that Congress is writing for itself, they’re powers Congress is taking back that had been fundamentally eroded and ceded to the executive over the last several decades,” Meijer, an Iraq war veteran, toldThe Dispatchin an interview last week.TheNational Security Reforms and Accountability Act(NSRAA) addresses three distinct areas the bill’s supporters argue are ripe for abuse by presidents: war powers, arms exports, and national emergencies.The war powers portion focuses on limiting the president’s power to declare war and send troops to different parts of the world. For example, it shortens the termination clock under the original War Powers Resolution of 1973 from 60 days to 20 days. This deadline is the amount of time a president can conduct hostilities without congressional approval. If Congress never approves hostilities a president has already commenced, the president would be legally required to terminate the military actions in question after 20 days under McGovern and Meijer’s proposal.Speaking of “hostilities”—that somewhat vague term is actually given a definition in this legislation. In the War Powers Resolution, the term was given no real parameters, rendering many parts of the resolution ineffective. Thelegislationdefines hostilities as “any situation involving any continuous or intermittent use of lethal or potentially lethal force” by or against U.S. forces and, in some cases, other forces involved with the U.S. military. The definition includes hostilities carried out on “land, sea, air, space, or cyber operations, or through any other domain, including whether or not such force is deployed remotely.”The expansive definition was designed to block the White House from using loopholes or narrow definitions to circumvent the law.“Both bills define hostilities clearly and with enough breadth to include virtually all military actions, removing one of the ways presidents have routinely dodged congressional authorization,” Dayton, a war powers expert,wrote.The legislation also takes aim at authorizations for the use of military force. Presidents from both parties have relied on authorizations for military force that were passed in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001, to conduct anti-terror wars and operations around the world for nearly two decades. Lawmakers have long debated how to replace those outdated authorizations, but disagreements over how to define geographic boundaries and which adversaries to name have hampered various bills over the years. Members of Congress have also shied away from having to take new unpopular votes on whether to send American troops to war. The war powers reform bill requires all authorizations to have clearly stated objectives and targets, and it would require a two-year expiration date—meaning lawmakers would continually have to weigh in on wars instead of dodging uncomfortable votes.“I’m sure there are some who don’t want to cast a hard vote,” Meijer said. He added that some lawmakers would prefer for wars to be on autopilot “so that they can be blameless with however it turns out. But, that’s not how I view my role.”The legislation would also automatically cut funding for military operations if a president does not receive proper congressional authorization.Another goal of the legislation is to give Congress more authority over arms sales. All arms sales are currently approved automatically unless lawmakers pass a resolution with veto-proof majorities to block a given sale. This bill would flip that around, requiring Congress to approve of sales of certain weapons over a certain amount.The bill would require authorization for sales of air-to-ground munitions, tanks, armored vehicles, fixed and rotary manned and unmanned aircraft, or services and training worth $14 million or more. It would also require approval for sales of firearms and ammunition worth $1 million or more.The legislation would also curb presidential powers related to national emergencies. There are39 national emergenciescurrently on the books. When he was in office, former President Donald Trump used national emergency powers to divert military funds to the construction of a wall along the southern border.Lawmakers from both parties decried this use of presidential authority, but an effort to block it failed to gain enough support to override Trump’sveto.Under the bill, Congress would have to affirmatively approve a national emergency declaration, or it would terminate in 30 days. Emergencies would also have to be renewed each year and max out after five years.Proponents of the legislation are hoping the United States’ painful withdrawal from Afghanistan will emphasize the need for war powers reform despite lawmakers’ reluctance to address the problem.“It’s evidently clear from what’s happened in the last few months that the apparatus is broken,” Meijer said of the coalition departure from Afghanistan. “The oversight and accountability is broken.”If the bill’s reforms had already been in place, he said, “Frankly, I don’t think we would have arrived at where we are these last few months.”When asked why the American people should trust a seemingly broken Congress with these powers, Meijer answered: “I am in no way shape or form sanguine on Congress acting responsibility, but I think the place where we are right now is congressional incompetence is excused, it’s accepted, and it’s given a pass.”“That is an unsatisfactory position,” Meijer said. “The way you force somebody to improve isn’t to take more things off their plate if you think they can’t handle it. It’s to give them the responsibility that they should have, and when they fail to live up to them, hold them to account.”I seriously hope this goes through. Finally Congress takes back some of its power. I’m not hopeful though.I find it amusing that members of Congress believe this will have any lasting impact. The language and power structure is already there. The fact is, Presidents or their operatives in the Defense Department will do what they want, when they want, and face the criticism later. Furthermore, recent partisan logjams suggest that Congress would be woefully slow or completely paralyzed by political fear if faced with the decision of whether or not to go to war. Ask yourself this; when the leaders who preside over nations that could truly pose a threat to the USA are faced with this situation, do you think they will pause to seek approval from their respective legislature before acting? Doubtful. We need to be as agile as possible should we face this awful situation again.Thanks for this, Ryan: the type of reporting worth paying for.I wish there were more attention payed to people working for system reform without the extra layers of agitprop meant to rile the base and open small-donor wallets...And while I'm wishing, I'd like to see more calm reporting on pols like Meijer doing their jobs responsibly. I know it's hard to overcome all the shouting of the attention economy, but elevating the extremes by reporting on the loudest folks shouldn't drive out coverage of people behaving like what you'd expect mature humans to behave...If you're looking for less extremism, you've come to the right place at The Dispatch!If any past Congress had been serious about trying to enforce the War Powers Resolution, there would be court precedent on really important topics such as (1) whether the federal courts can weigh in at all; (2) who exactly has standing to seek court enforcement; (3) whether the then-existing circumstances established a ripe and non-hypothetical ""case or controversy"" to support federal court jurisdiction; and lastly but most importantly, depending on the answers to the earlier questions, (4) whether the whole damn thing, or even some of its constituent parts, are a constitutional exercise of power by Congress.It was passed, of course, over presidential veto, which is why the punctilious call it the War Powers Resolution and the presumptuous call it the War Powers Act. And although I haven't updated my research to offer you a link, my reasonably confident recollection is that every POTUS since, of both parties, has carefully avoided any concession that it is indeed constitutional, while mostly trying to pantomime superficial compliance ""without waiver"" and ""subject to all future objections.""As I wrote in 2011 during a particularly egregious charade of presidential compliance during the Obama Administration's ""kinetic actions"" in Libya:===begin quote===The War Powers Resolution is the equivalent of Congress stamping its feet and shouting, ""I'm Congress, dammit!""

It just announced that this handful of Congressmen lacked standing ""either in their capacity as Members of the House of Representatives or because of their status as taxpayers"" to challenge Obama's actions in federal court, even if the court assumed that all the facts they alleged were absolutely true.This exact result was a predictable outcome, one that I (and many others) had in fact predicted — so predictable that the federal district judge who first heard it became rather grumpy about having to waste his time on it. (Indeed, one of the prior precedents on which Judge Walton relied was a 2002 case in which this same lead plaintiff, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, had tried to sue President George W. Bush over the U.S. withdrawal from the 1972 ABM Treaty without Congressional approval.) But is either today's court result or Kadafi's death likely to result in a new extra-legal precedent, an unenforceable but nevertheless notable practical precedent in the grand interplay of constitutional checks and balances in the 21st Century?Naw, not so much. The mild and short-lived court scuffle between Obama and a handful of Congressmen here was just an isolated example of something we already knew:If Congress, acting as Congress (as opposed to acting through its individual members who're trying to be litigants in court), declines to exercise the express powers granted Congress by the Constitution — chief among them, the power of the purse — to protect other express privileges and responsibilities also conferred upon Congress by the Constitution, including the exclusive power to ""declare war,"" then we're not seeing an actual constitutional confrontation.===end quote===https://www.beldar.org/beldarblog/2011/10/federal-courts-refuse.htmlDistrict court opinion dismissing case:https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3534879000866786215Sure… we should give power to Congress with a powerful nasty liberal queen elected by a single Uber liberal district that has as much in common with the rest of the nation as does Cuba.Sounds good. Maybe it’s not too late to rein in the imperial presidency.

Great minds. . .All of this looks good; but there is one thing that sticks out in particular:What was the original reasoning for giving the President 60 Days on the clock?My follow up would then be why 20 Days instead?

It was virtually impossible to eliminate an imminent threat without forward deploying some number of troops back then. A little easier to do so remotely today.This does kind of make you wonder what will happen to smaller more tactical missions though. Some of those I would imagine will likely take more than 20 days and some of them might be sensitive enough that bringing them to Congress is risky.In that case I’d like to see how fast we could deploy in 1973 vs today. I get that 60 days may seem lengthy compared to the speed at which information travels today, but we’re talking about deploying meat, leather and machinery and potentially having to pull that back out in a very short span of time and I think the bit about taking our time and thinking things through gets lost in all the bits.Congress is supposed to work deliberatively. Snap decision making is for the Executive branch.I like thisThis is a good, constitutional supporting, idea that has been required for decades (i.e., it makes sense). Thus, the outcome of this bill in a dysfunctional blame shifting congress is predetermined.I applaud representative Meijer for trying though. Even with a 10% chance of success (I’m sure that is too high), I hope it gets lots of press and discussion, if only to divert/replace what ever nonsense that would be otherwise spewing about (stolen elections, disgraced former presidents, border agent whips, Dr. Seuss, etc.).Mostly support this, but I do have a question: why 20 days? Seems a very arbitrary amount of time. I know politicians like round numbers. Did anyone on the Hill give a thought that 20 days does not align to how the military does planning?!?  I'm guessing no, it was probably a compromise number that sounded nice. Even if you look at emergent or short term planning the number is not 20 days. Pick a realistic number that actually aligns with practice.Any number will be arbitrary. How about 20 minutes, or 18 hours? This is lawyer-speak for dumping on something: ""It's too arbitrary.""I’m guessing it’s to prevent us from being dug in or, a la Gulf War, finished already, assuming start of hostilities doesn’t count build-up.Feb 2, 2024February 2, 2024Nick CatoggioFeb 2, 2024February 3, 2024Jonah GoldbergFeb 2, 2024February 2, 2024Alex DemasFeb 2, 2024February 2, 2024Andrew EggerandDavid M.

Snap decision making is for the Executive branch.I like thisThis is a good, constitutional supporting, idea that has been required for decades (i.e., it makes sense). Thus, the outcome of this bill in a dysfunctional blame shifting congress is predetermined.I applaud representative Meijer for trying though. Even with a 10% chance of success (I’m sure that is too high), I hope it gets lots of press and discussion, if only to divert/replace what ever nonsense that would be otherwise spewing about (stolen elections, disgraced former presidents, border agent whips, Dr. Seuss, etc.).Mostly support this, but I do have a question: why 20 days? Seems a very arbitrary amount of time. I know politicians like round numbers. Did anyone on the Hill give a thought that 20 days does not align to how the military does planning?!?  I'm guessing no, it was probably a compromise number that sounded nice. Even if you look at emergent or short term planning the number is not 20 days. Pick a realistic number that actually aligns with practice.Any number will be arbitrary. How about 20 minutes, or 18 hours? This is lawyer-speak for dumping on something: ""It's too arbitrary.""I’m guessing it’s to prevent us from being dug in or, a la Gulf War, finished already, assuming start of hostilities doesn’t count build-up."
Inside The Illegal Immigration Crisis Just North Of The Border You Haven’t Heard About,12.67,44.0,https://www.conservativereview.com/inside-the-illegal-immigration-crisis-just-north-of-the-border-you-havent-heard-about-2653123825.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/conservative-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,12,
"Texas Just Passed Its Terrifying, Extreme Anti-Abortion Bill",-16.33,30.0,https://theslot.jezebel.com/texas-just-passed-its-terrifying-extreme-anti-abortion-1846926411,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,9,"On Wednesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbottsigned into lawaterrifying anti-abortion billthat not only seeks to ban almost all abortions, but also includes a provision that would allow someone who, in the words of the bill, “aided and abetted” an abortion seeker to be sued. By empowering private citizens to enforce cruel abortion bans that the state cannot, Texas Republicans have not only found a way to circumvent the Constitution, they have essentially given anti-abortion activists a green light to harass clinics, abortion funds, abortion advocates, and even friends and family members of abortion seekers.Like other bans on early abortion passed in Republican-led states, the unconstitutional ban will likely be challenged in the courts and blocked, but it’s the latter provision that has most worried abortion providers and abortion advocates. They expect they will likely be the target of lawsuits by anti-abortion activists seeking to make them close their doors. As the Guttmacher Institute’s Elizabeth Nash put it in a statement on the bill’s private enforcement mechanism, “By allowing anyone, anywhere to sue people involved in providing or obtaining an abortion, this ban would open the floodgates for lawsuits, bury clinics under frivolous court cases and legal fees, and make it difficult for providers to remain open.”And while the ban on early abortion can and will almost assuredly be sued, the state’s abortion providers and advocates will have to, as constitutional law professor Josh Blackmantoldthe Texas Tribune, “sit and wait to be sued” in order to challenge the private enforcement mechanism. As Blackman put it, organizations like Planned Parenthood “can’t go to court and sue Attorney General [Ken] Paxton like they usually would because he has no role in enforcing the statute.”That Abbott’s signing comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s announcement that itwill take up an abortion case that is a direct challenge toRoe v. Wadeis yet another sign that the ever-more radical and emboldened anti-abortion movement is winning, and that activists have become more honest about their end goal.And get ready for these kinds of bills to be introduced in your state. As Kamyon Conner, the executive director of the TEA Fund, a Texas abortion fund, told Jezebel in a previous interview, “If it happens here, it will happen in other places, because Texas is a place to watch when it comes to abortion access and abortion restrictions.”If there’s ever been a good time todonate to your local abortion fund, it’s now."

The videofrom May 28 showed a black SUV honking its horn at a group of demonstrators around it.Before the start of the video, a protester was on the hood of the car,Insiderreported. The car then started moving, the protester jumped off, and people can be heard screaming watch out.The car then swerved, hit the protester, and drove off.Watson's attorney, Ryan Brackley, said Watson was scared for her safety, KUSA reported.""Ms. Watson should not have been charged.

He suffered some swelling and bruising following the incident.Protests erupted across the country last summer after Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.

It lasted nine interminable minutes. It ignited our righteous indignation—an oil fire floating on an ocean of grief.Mostpeople felt this way about the video of the murder—yes, murder—of George Floyd last year. The officer responsible, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of three counts on Tuesday for snuffing out a man’s life over the course of those nine excruciating minutes.Some observers, though, seem less concerned about the murder of George Floyd and more concerned about—well, it’s hard to say what they are concerned about. Some of them are claiming that the trial was a set-up. Rigged. That the jury had it in for Chauvin. Or that Chauvin didn’t really matter because therealvillains were Joe Biden and Maxine Waters and Don Lemon, who somehow managed to pressure the jury into convicting Chauvin on all counts. Probably because they were afraid of cancel culture.It is possible to stipulate all sorts of things here:Yes, President Biden and Rep. Waters both made statements they shouldn’t have. Watersencourageddemonstrators to get “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin weren’t convicted, which wasn’t an explicit call to violence but was at least unwise. Bidensaidthat the evidence was “overwhelming” in his view and encouraged the jury to reach “the right verdict” without making explicit what the right verdict was. Neither should have said what they said. Political leaders should be circumspect when offering public commentary about ongoing trials—or better yet, should altogether refrain from commenting. Still, as violations of norms go, these seem more like misdemeanors than felonies. And most importantly: There is no evidence that they swayed the jury.Yet by fixating on all of this, the Extremely Online right has been doing something interesting in the hours since the verdict was announced. They’re not willing to be pro-Chauvin, exactly. Well, most of them, anyway. You don’t see a lot of affirmative defenses of Chauvin being mounted, or a lot of folks proclaiming his innocence.But there is an awful lot of anti-anti-Chauvinism. So much so that it might well become the latest article of faith for conservatives in good standing.Who is always right? Sarah? JVL? Or do you Beg to Differ? Show your support with Bulwark merchandise. Whichever side you choose, we’ll be back tomorrow, and we’ll do this all over again."
Add San Francisco to the List of Ultra-Left Wing Cities Experiencing a Wave of Police Departures,24.67,20.67,https://www.redstate.com/shipwreckedcrew/2020/08/18/add-san-francisco-to-the-list-of-ultra-left-wing-cities-experiencing-a-wave-of-police-departures/,https://adfontesmedia.com/redstate-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,4,"Recently, I ranthis storyconfirming that approximately 20% of the Minneapolis Police Department had entered the process of seeking medical retirement on the basis of a PTSD diagnosis.  It takes a finding of two separate doctors that an officer is suffering PTSD just to start the process towards retirement, and as of late July, 200 Minneapolis officers had begun that process — up from 150 earlier in the month.Several weeks ago, it was reported that Atlanta had begun to experience an increased level of retirements or resignations following the indictment of two Atlanta Police Officers — one charged with felony murder — in the clear self-defense shooting death of Rayshard Brooks after he fought with officers in the parking lot of a Wendy’s fast-food restaurant in Atlanta.Today, wehave a reportfrom the City by the Bay that the San Francisco Police Department is suffering departures from the ranks of is sworn officers at unprecedented rates — and not for medical or stress reasons like in other cities.In the first six months of the year, 23 sworn officers resigned, Police Department records show. Of those, 19 took jobs at other law enforcement agencies, both in California and elsewhere.By comparison, 26 officers resigned in all of 2019. And only 12 officers resigned in 2018.“This is just the beginning. Dozens are actively in the hiring process with other agencies,” said Tony Montoya, president of the Police Officers Association.“Members have gone to places like the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, Pleasant Hill, Beverly Hills, Petaluma, Palm Springs, Placerville, Long Beach, Idaho, Texas, Arizona,” Montoya said.Let me break open my brain to that buried math processor there inside and cogitate over the year-after-year doubling of losses on an exponential basis.According to its website, SFPD currently has 2100 officers.  If their losses double each year, losing 26 last year and 52 this year, with an expectation of losing 100+ next year ……  by my calculations they will run out of officers to lose soon.  I think that is accurate.So, what then?The pathetic reality is that San Franciso, with its tax base, should be one of the most successful and safest cities in the world, and a dream location to want to be a police officer.But San Francisco is a sh!thole of a city.  Two decades ago, I had to step over human excrement on the sidewalk while walking a block from the federal courthouse.  Entire blocks of downtown, with gleaming high-rise office towers on nearly every street corner, reeked of urine and vomit.This is common knowledge to people who know the City well, but enterprising entrepreneurs have created interactive“crapmaps”for San Franciso, showing pinpoint locations of human feces on the streets and sidewalks of the city.The demand for people to do “policing” is one of those necessities of civilized life that is never going to go away.  But police officers get a vote when it comes to where they want to live and work.  It is becoming more and more clear that fewer and fewer of them are willing to remain in the US’s biggest cities operated by liberal Democrats who don’t value their service.This is a self-perpetuating cycle.  The problem will grow worse until those political leaders decide changes are needed.  If not, those cities will eventually descend into chaos."
Democrats just subpoenaed Trump’s favorite bank,-16.75,37.0,https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/8xz9p4/democrats-just-subpoenaed-trumps-favorite-bank,https://adfontesmedia.com/vice-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,4,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats may be waiting to see Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report like the rest of us, but that hasn’t stopped them from pursuing other investigations into President Trump’s finances.Two House committees sent a subpoena for records on Monday to Trump’s longtime lender of choice, the German financial giant Deutsche Bank, along with multiple other financial institutions as part of an investigation into foreign influence on U.S. politics, Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intel committee, told VICE News Tuesday morning.Investigators are seeking documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe,The New York Times reported, citing three unidentified people with knowledge of the requests.The subpoenas mark a new front in the investigations into Trump’s money, which are being led by multiple House committees and investigative bodies based in New York State. Collectively, investigators are now seeking a wide range of documents related to Trump’s finances, including banking records, personal and business tax returns and corporate insurance records. The German lender has already been subpoenaed by New York’s Attorney General’s office.Schiff said Deutsche has been “cooperative” with the probe being run by the House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee.“Deutsche Bank is engaged in a productive dialogue with the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees,” Deutsche spokesperson Kerrie McHugh told VICE News in an emailed statement Tuesday morning. “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations.”That could pose problems for the president. The firm is believed to hold a vast and detailed trove of information about Trump’s business empire, thanks to its longstanding lending relationship with his family business. The bank hasreportedly lentTrump a total of more than $2 billion over the years, even after other big Wall Street firms labeled him too risky to touch after a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s.Congressional investigators are also seeking records from JP Morgan and Citigroup,CNN reported Tuesday morning, citing unidentified people familiar with the requests.President Trump’s son Eric slammed the bank subpoenas as an “unprecedented abuse of power,” motivated by politics.“Instead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father’s administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments,” Eric Trump said in a statement to VICE News. “This incompetence is the exact reason why the American people have such disdain for politicians and why my father was elected president.”But House Democrats say they’re worried about the national security implications of Trump’s potential ties to foreign money.“We want to know if the president or anyone in his family is financially compromised,” Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California on the House Intelligence Committee, said onCNN late Monday. “Not just to the Russians, because we shouldn’t assume he’s faithful to them. He has worked with the Saudis, with other countries, in ways that are certainly, I think, below the standard of conduct that we would accept.”Deutsche has had its own controversial history with helping to move Russian money around the world. In January 2017, the bank was fined $630 million by regulators in New York and London for allowing clients of its Moscow office to launder $10 billion out of Russia through questionable stock trades.Deutsche isn’t the only aspect of Trump’s finances facing scrutiny. The New York State Department of Financial Services, has sought records from Trump’s longtime insurance broker, Aon. The House Oversight Committee is seeking years worth of records from Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA,according to Politico. And the House Ways & Means Committee submitted a formal request to the IRS for Trump’s tax returns, with a deadline of April 23.Cover:President Donald Trump speaks at Nuss Truck and Equipment in Burnsville, Minn., Monday, April 15, 2019.

5 of the Best Stocks to Buy for December,0.0,32.33,https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/best-stocks-to-buy,https://adfontesmedia.com/u-s-news-and-world-report-bias-reliability/,2021-11-01,3,"The stock market has been on a major winning streak over the past quarter. With theFederal Reservepossibly starting interest rate cuts in 2024, investors are bidding up equities across the board. Several major stock indexes have reached new record highs and excitement is in the air.These sorts of cheerful conditions can cause investors to overpay for stocks. Thankfully, there are still some great bargains out there heading into February 2024. All five of these names dropped 10% or more over the past month, making them relative bargains in an otherwise frothy market. Here are five of the best stocks to buy now at fire sale prices:3M is a massive industrial conglomerate. Its products run the gamut from auto body repair to adhesives, power distribution, industrial abrasives, dental equipment and countless other categories. 3M has long relied on its research and development and constant product innovation to drive organic growth.In recent years, however, 3M has gotten tripped up. Between a series of product liability lawsuits and stagnation in several parts of the core business, it has been a decade to forget for 3M investors. However, the company is now engaged in a credible turnaround plan that should unlock considerable shareholder value going forward. Shares go for around 10 times forward earnings and offer a greater than 6%dividend yieldtoday. The company sold off following its most recent earnings report, and that gives investors an opportunity. While 2024 may be a soft year for 3M given the current economic headwinds, the future should be bright as the company's turnaround gains momentum.Rockwell Automation is an industrial company focused on helping firms bolster their automation capabilities. It runs across three categories: intelligent devices, software and control, and lifecycle services. Most competitors are strong in one or two of these categories. Where Rockwell stands out is that it offers the most complete automation ecosystem that can incorporate all three of these functions into an integrated package.Rockwell shares recently sold off sharply on a disappointing earnings report. The firm serves clients in the automotive and chemicals industries, which are currently in a weak part of their cycles. The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases have curtailed demand in areas of the economy such as consumer discretionary, leading to cutbacks in corporate capital expenditure programs. However, automation remains a strong long-term theme, and that should be doubly true given the surge in labor costs over the past few years. Rockwell Automation often sells at a fairly high price-to-earnings ratio, but after the recent sell-off, shares now go for a reasonable 20 times forward earnings.Yum China is the Chinese division of multinational fast food company Yum Brands Inc. (YUM). The Chinese subsidiary operates KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, along with some other brands that are local to the Chinese market. Yum China also runs ane-commerceplatform that sells prepared food in addition to home and kitchen accessories. The company is a massive operation within China, as it currently has about 400,000 employees. The KFC brand, in particular, has had resounding success within the Chinese market.However, theChinese economy has stagnatedsince the onset of COVID-19. Between a softening export market, weak consumer sentiment and a struggling real estate sector, China is not awash with disposable income right now. All sorts of multinational companies have reported slowing sales out of the region over the past year, and, unsurprisingly, investors have dumped restaurant stocks as well. To that point, YUMC stock is down more than 40% over the past year. That leads to a solid entry point with shares now at 17 times forward earnings for this traditionally fast-growing consumer company.Unity Software runs a leading graphics engine primarily used for powering video games. The company has approximately 70% market share for powering mobile games, and it has a significant, though smaller, position in other platforms including PC, console, and virtual and augmented reality.Unity ran into problems from overexpansion. The gaming industry boomed during the pandemic when people were stuck at home and looking for new entertainment options. As the economy reopened, gaming growth slowed. 2023 was a record year for layoffs across the gaming industry, and Unity slashed its employee base as part of this industry rightsizing. Between the layoffs and some questions around Unity's revenue model, U stock has suffered. But the firm's cost-cutting should help it reach robust profitability in 2024. Meanwhile, Unity is helping build apps for Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) new Vision Pro augmented reality system. If spatial computing takes off with Apple's help, that should be a huge growth lever for Unity going forward.Intel is one of the world's leadingsemiconductor companies. The chip giant spends about $16 billion annually in research and development, and this massive investment has yielded Intel numerous technological breakthroughs and market-leading chip designs. In recent years, however, Intel has lost ground to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA).Intel spun off its automotive technology division, Mobileye Global Inc. (MBLY), in 2022, but it retains a majority stake in that firm. Mobileye stock recently plunged following weak earnings as the auto market continues to lose steam. That, combined with weakness in Intel's core markets, has led to a recent correction in the share price.In the bigger picture, Intel is investing heavily in new capacity, aided by the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act which provides support to the domestic semiconductor industry. Intel is also building out its foundry business, which could attract substantial interest from other semiconductor firms looking to diversify their vendors and supply chains."
Supreme Court sides with cheerleader who wrote profane social media post slamming her school,0.0,47.33,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/23/supreme-court-backs-cheerleader-first-amendment-case/5271055001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,3,"WASHINGTON – TheSupreme Court on Wednesday sided with a former cheerleaderwho excoriated her school in a profanity-laced post on social media, holding that the punishment of her off-campus speech violated the First Amendment.The 8-1 ruling left unresolved the broader question of when schools may regulate off-campus speech and when such punishment is off-limits.""It might be tempting to dismiss [the student's] words as unworthy of the robust First Amendment protections discussed herein,""Associate Justice Stephen Breyerwrote for the majority. ""But sometimes it is necessary to protect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary.""Associate Justice Clarence Thomasdissented, asserting that the court's opinion left an unworkable standard for schools to try to follow.When Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time, failed to make the varsity cheer team in 2017, she and one of her friends posted a vulgar message on Snapchat, exhorting her followers to ""F––– school f––– softball f––– cheer f––– everything.""The message made it back to her coaches, whocut her from the junior varsity squad. After appealing to school authorities, her parents sued the school district in federal court.Levy's attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union argued that allowing principals to punish students for their off-campus speech, including on social media, would give schools far too much power to police innocuous interactions with their friends. School officials said theyneed to be able to discipline bullyingand cheating that can begin off-campus or online before working its way into the school building.Several of the justices said during oral arguments that they were wary of setting a hard-and-fast standard for when schools could regulate off-campus speech, and that hesitancy was reflected in the majority opinion. The court held that schools can sometimes punish a student for something said at home but that their power to do so is more limited than at school.""The school’s regulatory interests remain significant in some off-campus circumstances,"" Breyer wrote.""Thus, we do not now set forth a broad, highly general First Amendment rule stating just what counts as 'off campus' speech and whether or how ordinary First Amendment standards must give way off campus,"" Breyer wrote.Breyer said the court would leave that question to ""future cases.""Thomastook issue with that approach in his dissent. Hewrote that historical factors suggest schools could regulate off-campus speech that could harm the school, its faculty or other students. Thomas said he believes that standard was met in Levy's case.""The court’s foundation is untethered from anything stable, and courts (and schools) will almost certainly be at a loss as to what exactly the court’s opinion today means,"" Thomas wrote.The standard for on-campus speech is more clear. In 1969, a landmark Supreme Court decision, Tinker v. Des Moines, reaffirmed students' First Amendment rights at school, but the court said teachers and principals may regulate student speechin situationswhen it ""materially disrupts"" the operation of the school. That case involved a group of students who wore black armbands toprotest the war in Vietnam.In Levy's case, the Mahanoy Area School District in Pennsylvania asserted that the standard developed in the Tinker case should apply to off-campus speech.Both sides claimed a measure of victory in the outcome.""The school went too far, and I’m glad that the Supreme Court agrees,” Levy said in a statementafter the court handed down its opinion. ""I was frustrated, I was 14 years old, and I expressed my frustration the way teenagers do today.""The school district said it was ""pleased with and vindicated by"" the fact that the court did not block schools from regulating off-campus speech altogether.""The Supreme Court instead enumerated many examples of situations when school districts can regulate off-campus speech and made it clear that its list was not exclusive,"" the school district said in a statement.Thejustices struggledwith the questions involved at oral arguments in April, and several signaled a desire to craft as narrow a ruling as possible.Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has two school-age children, repeatedly questioned whether the school district hadn't just overreacted to Levy's post.A federal district court ruled for Levy in 2019, finding that – even if the Tinker standard applied off campus – the speech she used wasn't disruptive enough to trigger disciplinary action. The Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit went a step further, holding that Tinker does not apply to off-campus speech.That created a split with other appeals courts, setting up a different legal standard depending on where students live.During nearly two hours of oral arguments, several justices said they were concerned about drawing bright lines in the case.Breyer, whose father worked for decades as a lawyer for the school board in San Francisco, said he was ""frightened to death"" of trying to write a legal standard for when schools may regulate off-campus speech, particularly when students increasingly communicate with each other – and their teachers – online from home.Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has seven children, said during arguments that although there might be good ""policy reasons"" for extending a school's authority beyond campus, such as bullying or cheating, she questioned what precedent the court could rely on to rule in favor of the school district."

Rush Limbaugh and the Right’s Generational Despair,4.0,38.0,https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/rush-limbaugh-and-the-rights-generational,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-dispatch-bias-reliability/,2021-02-19,3,"If you’re reading this and you’re younger than I am (I was born in 1969 and came of age politically during the Reagan era), it’s almost impossible to conceive of the pre-Rush Limbaugh media environment. It was as if we lived on a different planet. You read your morning paper, you watched the evening news, and if you were really a political hobbyist (I was!), you subscribed toTime,Newsweek, or both. The smallest micro-slice of Americans was exposed to intellectual journals likeNational RevieworThe New Republic.My exposure to conservative commentary was the library’s copy of NR, combined with a few syndicated conservative columnists. In those days, George Will was a lifeline. And even if you were a political hobbyist, it was virtually impossible to marinate in politics. The content just wasn’t available—even when CNN debuted. Hardly anyone watched.Rush blew up this world. He nuked it from orbit. It wasn’t just that his show was popular (and it was phenomenally popular): He created an industry, and that industry created a lifestyle. It’s the lifestyle we see now, where a person comes home from work, turns on Fox News, and doesn’t turn it off until they sleep, or where a person never flips the dial from their favorite talk radio station, or rolls from podcast to podcast, all while the phone is in their hands, scrolling through Facebook and Twitter.Is there a Roger Ailes and Fox News without Rush? Perhaps. Is it the same? Absolutely not.But many of the obituaries and analyses of Rush’s undeniable impact miss that he didn’t just lead and shape a generation of political commentary—he also in many ways reflected and followed his own audience. Rush’s trajectory both shaped and mirrored the trajectory of tens of millions of Americans. It’s the path from Dan’s Bake Sale in 1993 to conspiracy, deep paranoia, andmusings about secessionin 2020.I experienced Rush in two distinct snapshots: his beginning and his end. And the differences are disturbing. I first listened to Rush in the early 1990s, when friends told me I “had” to hear him. There was no Google then. You couldn’t immediately research anyone. There was no catalogue of outrageous statements online. To find out what somebody was about, you just listened to what they had to say.When I listened to Rush, I thought I was hearing a happy warrior. Imagine a Ronald Reagan/William F. Buckley ideology in the hands of a bombastic, WWE-style entertainer. He built a bond with his audience, and if you liked him, even when he was mean, you were tempted to excuse him. You thought he was “trying to be funny.”(Jonah’scomparison of Rush to Jon Stewartis fascinating. I’d never thought of it before, but the partisan reaction to Stewart does mirror the reaction to Rush. Progressives thought Stewart was funny, not mean. Conservatives thought he was mean, not funny.)The peak moment of early Rush—the Rush Limbaugh who I liked and listened to—happened in May 1993. A listener named Dan Kay had called in and complained that his wife wouldn’t let him pay for a subscription to the Limbaugh Letter. Rush suggested that he hold a bake sale to raise the money, and thus “Dan’s Bake Sale” was born.It personified the substance and fun of listening to Rush. He advocated self-reliance.Don’t whine, Dan, use the free enterprise system to make the money. He built a community. Once people knew that Dan’s Bake Sale was a thing, they drove from miles around to meet and greet fellow “dittoheads.” And there was always this sense of over-the-top absurdity. A bake sale? Really? But thousands showed up for “Rushstock,” and a great time was had by all.I largely stopped listening to Rush after law school. When you’re trying to make your way in large firm litigation, you don’t have much spare time in the middle of the day. Besides, in the new world that Rush built, there was no lack of immediately available conservative infotainment.To the extent I still followed Rush, he frustrated me. I’m not going to catalogue all his controversies, but I felt that something was changing—he seemed to be losing the “happy” aspect of the happy warrior.In 2016, I tuned in again. I wanted to hear what Rush was saying about Donald Trump. Rush, after all, had been an advocate for Reaganism and a guardian of “true conservatism.” He was bombastic in service of a particular, coherent ideology. What would he think of Trump?What I heard surprised me. Rush seemed slightly afraid of his own audience. He was offering a very mild critique of a Trump primary debate performance, and it was obvious he was worried about pushback. He wasn’t in command. He seemed defensive.This isn’t the Rush I remember, I thought.Soon enough, he was all-in with Trump and all-out with Never Trump. He embraced Michael Anton’s famous “Flight 93” essay with both arms. His rhetoric grew increasingly catastrophic. He minimized the coronavirus. He spread election conspiracies. His anger was palpable. As for his ideology? He moved. The one-time tenacious guardian of the Reagan/Buckley ideological legacy had becomeextremely flexible. It was clear what he was fighting against—elitists, the Republican establishment, the left—and much less apparent what he was fighting for, aside from Trump.My friend Rod Dreher has written about the right and left’s inverse generational problem. On the left, there’s a rise in grassroots demands for censorship and cancel culture, coming often from students and young employees, that has deeply influenced a number of leading center-left cultural institutions. This Bari Weiss thread describes her perception of the culture at theNew York Times, and it’s worth your time:The civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young) wokes the (mostly 40+) liberals is the same one raging inside other publications and companies across the country. The dynamic is always the same. (Thread.)On the right, however, the intolerance and anger tends to come from older voters—from Rush’s generation, from my parents’ generation. As the 2020 election approached, there was a palpable sense of panic that America itself was at stake. Yes, there are the young Charlie Kirk-style firebrands. But the audience and energy for Trump was much older, and many of them attacked dissenters with every bit as much energy as the most enraged campus progressive.I don’t put all or most of this in Rush’s lap. He broke open American media, but soon enough he was but one (admittedly important) voice of many. He was both an architectandproduct of his political generation, and like so many millions of his fellow citizens, he lost his political way.The conservative side of the internet is full of stories of Rush’s personal kindness and his generosity to his friends. I did not know Rush, and I didn’t see that side of him. But in that way he also mirrors his generation. I know countless good and kind older Americans—folks who would give you the shirt off their back and show up first to help you in a personal emergency—who switch almost immediately to a posture of bitterness and anger the instant they face a political challenge.It’s sad to see this rage. It’s sad to see this fear. After all, Rush’s conservative generation did much to leave America a better place than they found it. This is the generation that brought America back from defeat in Vietnam and corruption at Watergate. It’s the generation that gave us “Morning in America” in 1984 and helped defeat a communist superpower without the catastrophe of world war.America is more prosperous than it was when Rush launched his career. It’s more free. Crime is down from its highs. Abortion is down. Divorce is down. Protections for individual liberty are more robust than they’ve been in decades. But tribalism is worse. Polarization is more profound.In such a circumstance, the ideas that helped improve our republic have taken a back seat to the attitudes that help us confront our opponents. The ideology is malleable. The confrontation is mandatory. That’s the migration Rush made. That’s a migration millions made. Rush was a symbol of a generation’s despair.I’m not a UFO conspiracy theorist. I promise I’m not. But I had great fun readingthis story in theNew Yorkerabout Harvard Avi Loeb and his theory about a recent interstellar visitor. It begins:On October 19, 2017, a Canadian astronomer named Robert Weryk was reviewing images captured by a telescope known as Pan-starrs1 when he noticed something strange. The telescope is situated atop Haleakalā, a ten-thousand-foot volcanic peak on the island of Maui, and it scans the sky each night, recording the results with the world’s highest-definition camera. It’s designed to hunt for “near-Earth objects,” which are mostly asteroids whose paths bring them into our planet’s astronomical neighborhood and which travel at an average velocity of some forty thousand miles an hour. The dot of light that caught Weryk’s attention was moving more than four times that speed, at almost two hundred thousand miles per hour.More:As astronomers pored over the data, they excluded one theory after another. ‘Oumuamua’s weird motion couldn’t be accounted for by a collision with another object, or by interactions with the solar wind, or by a phenomenon that’s known, after a nineteenth-century Polish engineer, as the Yarkovsky effect. One group of researchers decided that the best explanation was that 1I/2017 U1 was a “miniature comet” whose tail had gone undetected because of its “unusual chemical composition.” Another group argued that ‘Oumuamua was composed mostly of frozen hydrogen. This hypothesis—a variation on the mini-comet idea—had the advantage of explaining the object’s peculiar shape. By the time it reached our solar system, it had mostly melted away, like an ice cube on the sidewalk.By far the most spectacular account of 1I/2017 U1 came fromAvi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist. ‘Oumuamua didn’t behave as an interstellar object would be expected to, Loeb argued, because it wasn’t one. It was the handiwork of an alien civilization.Read the whole thing. It’s fascinating.Ok, I freely admit to being obsessed with the PBS Space Time YouTube channel. I just discovered it, I can’t stop watching it, and it finally answered my questions about warp drive—questions we should all be asking. Watch and learn:David has made a good point about some of Rush Limbaugh's audience.  People hear what they want to hear.  In the early 90's we had an employee who listened to Rush the entire day, it seemed.  His work suffered and when I pointed this out to him, in the form of incomplete and shoddy work, he accused me of being a feminazi.  He was ultimately fired and spent the next several years telling anyone who would listen what a feminazi I was.  (and my hubby was the one who fired him)Then there was the 90's April Fool's Day episode where Rush went on a rant about poor people being a drag on the economy and how they should pay more taxes, not less.  Many dittoheads, including our employee,  called in to agree and Rush had to enlighten them that it was a joke.  He actually felt it was counterproductive for the poor to pay any taxes at all, that they should be saving that money for necessities or a better car or education.But the effect of words like ""rino"", feminazi and dumbocrat, was no joke.  Any real discussion ofissues was ended, any real respect for someone of different views or any religion other than Protestant Christian was over.  Rush had given permission, many believed, to be rude and unyielding.My father, who had never allowed any racial or ethnic slurs to be used in his house or in the presence of his family, became resentful of all people of color, citing Mr. Limbaugh, perhaps inaccurately.I don't wish to imply that I blame Mr. Limbaugh entirely for his listener's reactions or their embrace of anger and hate, and sometimes racism.  I know lifelong Rush listeners who never embraced hate in any form.For my part, I had so much trouble listening to him and feeling the rage just under the surface, that I took to just reading his books.  He was more entertaining as a speaker, but his books wereworthwhile.  Given his success as an entertainer, it's a wonder he even bothered with books.While much of his prescriptions for a better America just seemed like the plain common sense I had grown up with,  there were more unchained ideas I didn't feel so sure about.And while I am grateful that he created a sound stage for conservative thought, I wish there had been less anger and more joy.Did it bother anyone else that Rush never permitted callers & didn't actively open himself up to engage in genuinely oppositional viewpoints? Was he even capable of actual debate... give & take, being openly challenged & dealing with it constructively? Because otherwise...yeah, okay, he was a ""refreshing"" voice in bashing the Left but... isn't ""bashing"" a little more impressive if you do it to the face of the person/group you're bashing? Otherwise, I could bash people all day long from my bedroom with all the bravado in the world. For me, nothing matters unless you open yourself up to be disagreed with. Proven wrong. This, to me, is not a minor point. When you study the personalities of constructive, humble leadership versus tyrannical rule... you notice right away that this is a cardinal issue:  does the leader tolerate opposition? Does he surround himself with a ""team of rivals"" or otherwise make sure he has people who WILL say no to him, challenge him, hold him to account?  Einstein demanded that his Theory of Relativity be tested. And tested again. If I'm not mistaken, he asked that it be run through 3 vigorous tests, & if it failed those tests, he said it should be wholly disregarded. Marx, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler - all enraged by opposition. Banned, exiled or killed dissenters. This is a test, to me, of actual leadership - whether political, ideological or cultural. I guess this is another reason why it doesn't sit well with me to have rosy feelings about this guy. (Sorry, I'm having trouble letting go of this conversation. The whole thing really troubles me. Thanks for putting up w/ all my comments, all. I appreciate your patience).Reactionaries think conflict is a disease rather than a useful method of knowledge.  They detest dissent and complaint as unjust challenges to authority. Limbaugh’s listeners adored him because he shut out contrary voices, not because they were starving for supply-side economics, family values, God, guns, and military glory.  He gave them a safe space, not an improved marketplace of ideas.  Rush hanging up on callers was the precursor of Trump ejecting protesters from his rallies.Not the most erudite point, but can we stop praising Rush for merely being able to bloviate self-indulgently for 3 straight hours. Can we stop the fiction that that is even difficult for many people who are Massive, Insensitive Talkers who like to self-indulgently monologue? Every one of us has an uncle somewhere who could do that in his sleep. For a big-mouthed, highly opinionated & egotistical Talker, this isn't an impressive skill b/c its their favorite thing to do.(...And thanks to sonofasailor35 on here for beautifully reviving the word ""bloviate"" for me).David touched on it a bit but somewhere along the line the whole talk radio audience changed. Yes it has always been older but back when I listened to Boortz in the morning and Rush in the afternoon the ads were pitching Mercedes, jewelry, vacations and real estate. Now you turn it on and its Ron Paul's 'survival food"", hyperinflation Gold hedging, Bible cures for cancer, herbal miracle pain relievers, etc. That's marketing to totally different people.It's totally depressing. I only tune in AM radio when I'm in a parking garage and my satellite radio goes out. I can't imagine listening to that crap hours on end. Thank goodness for podcasts.I agree completely about rush changing.  I think i posted this in the TMD but my mother was obsessed with rush.  I remember at the time feeling that it was weird to see someone so openly conservative.  Anyway we taped an episode of Donahue when he had rush on and they had a very real debate about issues like abortion, the B1 bomber, and environmentalism.  This episode I believe was recorded just after the 92 election because Donahue rubs the election in Rush's face.The thing I most remember is that Rush was always smiling and almost giggling in reponse to both Phil and his audience.  Then fast forward to any interview i have seen him in and he is almost deathly serious with (it seems to me) almost a clenched jaw.  I know that he went though a great deal in recent years with losing his hearing, pain pill addiction, and cancer.  But he became a very mean spirited person.    (even while losing all his weight)I was in college back then so I struggled with squaring ""rushism"" with a lot of the information I was getting in my classes.  (this was the closest I came to a liberal phase)Looking back I never imagined that the Rush Limbaugh movement would morph into where we are.  HOWEVER...........as an aside my liberal history professor at the time compared Limbaugh to Father Coughlin in the 1930's who was openly fascist.  It was only years later that I discovered that Father Coughlin was more in line with the new deal and would better be compared to Huey Long.  Discovering this made me an easy sell when I read Liberal FascismThe bitterness, resentment and anger DF is talking about is real. I cannot speak to the anger Progressives feel that has led them to fight racism with racism. I cannot fathom nor will I ever think a biological male who has gone thru puberty would want to, nor be allowed to compete against women. I cannot imagine in what world any American leader would open our borders allowing thousands of untested, unvaccinated economic refugees loose in our country. Nor can I fathom that African Americans looking for vaccines would be just fine with a President vaccinating illegals over his own citizens. I cannot fathom a President suggesting oh well China is just is different, has a different view about genocide and saying we have to do something about it but unable to articulate what that something is?It is inexplicable that the greatest financial and political sponsor of Middle East death and destruction who's goal is the elimination of the US, Israel and every Sunni country would be wooed by a supplicant US President let alone two of them.Angry? How about not being able to hold a funeral for one of your parents while the man who ordered that dines at the French Laundry? How about your son who hold promise as a possible recruit to a Big Ten school for a full ride scholarship.....doesn't get one because playing an outdoor sport was forbidden?Maybe watching your city burn, you business burn and your livelihood trashed in the name of systemic racism when you black yourself might make you a tad angry. Maybe the women who leads one of our branches of government and who called a wall on our border ""immoral"" but is just fine with one around the Capitol because she needs protection from angry Trump voters makes you angry about the hypocrisy....Nope, their is a lot of anger these days....but some of it might be justified.Sounds like a lot of your anger stems from the reality of this virus. Standing 22 people face to face to smash into each other relentlessly for two hours during a pandemic with a disease that can kill seems like really bad idea. Some of the things you say are truly frustrating as Newsom as well as many, many Republicans have shown hypocrisy during this crisis, maskless garden parties for Supreme Court judges or rallies for an orange God. But people, even (especially?) politicians, are flawed and will let you down, as we all let ourselves at times. I am really sorry for the year you and your family have had to go through as so far the consequences have been relatively minor. The worst has been my bp going to 184/124 while taking 3 bp medications. I hope I am alive this time next year. I would really like to see my soon to be 5 year old son grow up. It's just us and I hope to be there for him. He missed a year of the best teacher he is likely to ever have and routinely says he hates school now bur life goes on. He has special needs and is bi-racial too, in a place that doesn't understand him very well, so I fear the potential real world consequences of his attitude, should we not be able to change it.In all, there has been a lot of loss, a good amount of hypocrisy by everyone, and a world that will be forever changed by this virus in an almost Biblical way. Good luck and hang onto your faith or whatever guides you, to everyone here and around the world who are suffering.I do hear some countries such as Germany have done well by listening to the science from the start and those places are significantly better off now. Tragic that we could not have been a country who took the virus seriously from the start.Everyone gets angry, and anger should spur one to action.But if your brand of anger leads to an insurrection against the government based on a mountain of lies about a democratic election, that's a 'you' problem.David, this piece really resonates with me, as I too am of your generation and had a similar experience with Rush.  I became disappointed in how he went from fighting for conservative principles, to fighting against ""them"".  I began to feel left out, until I stumbled on a refreshing podcase by James Lileks, Rob Long and Peter Robinson, and now includes The Dispatch.  I am no longer left out, and I hope you all realize how much The Dispatch fills the void of highlighting conservative values, and calling truths, even if they don't support ""the team"" that day.Back in the late ‘90’s and early 2000’s, I spent a lot of time driving.  I listened to all the talk radio guys.  And one thing I noticed was, Michael Savage would throw an idea out there, it would flow through the ether gathering adherents, and about four weeks later, if it made it (like Oumuamua), El Rushbo would grant it his imprimatur and broadcast it to a much larger audience.  And the ideas were getting more extreme and more aggressive even back then.  Trump’s takeover of the Party and the destruction of state Republican apparatuses was a long time coming, and Limbaugh paved the way.I am never surprised when one of your eloquent and intelligent pieces causes an explosion in the sewer, as this one did. Even so, I am still always disappointed.Once again David you are right on the money.  As a former fan of Limbaugh from the 90's it crushed me to find out he embraced Trumpism full tilt boogey...including the election fraud hoax.  I prefer to remember the Rush who made me question the liberal orthodoxies of the early 1990s...and did so in a very entertaining manner.  RIP Rush."
How Impeachment Could Hinder Biden’s Agenda,1.0,48.67,https://uphill.thedispatch.com/p/impeachment-biden-agenda-delay,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-dispatch-bias-reliability/,2021-01-15,2,"Good morning. We’re still coping with the fallout of last week’s attack on the Capitol. Here in D.C., many of the roads around the building are being closed ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. Thousands of members of theNational Guardhave been tasked with protecting the Capitol, and fencing has been erected around government buildings in the area.A presidential impeachment trial is a weighty affair, so it’s not surprising therulesthat govern how the Senate tackles one are constructed to ensure it gets lawmakers’ full attention. The body is compelled to drop almost everything to consider the matter: From the day after the article (or articles) are presented to them, senators must attend to them six days a week “until final judgment shall be rendered, and so much longer as may, in [their] judgment, be needful.” If other business is pressing, the Senate must find ways to wedge it in around the time demanded by the trial.These exacting requirements can sometimes create logistical difficulties. During President Trump’s first impeachment, several Senate Democrats who were running for president found themselveschained to their desks in Washingtonrather than storming around the campaign trail in the weeks prior to the Iowa caucuses.That was a headache for only a few presidential hopefuls; this time, the schedule threatens to create a mess for the new Biden administration. The earliest date the House can present the Senate with its article of impeachment is next Tuesday, January 19, when the Senate comes back into session. If the House moves as quickly as possible, the trial would begin on January 20: Biden’s inauguration day.This is more than just a PR frustration for Biden’s team. The opening weeks of a presidential administration are usually a flurry of activity in the Senate, which is tasked with confirming the new president’s nominees for top posts around his government. Having to work that in around a demanding impeachment schedule threatens to create a significant congressional logjam—and that’s before you factor in a fight over the massive new COVID stimulus Biden wants to pass.According to Senate rules, calling senators back from their recess early to begin proceedings would require one of two things: either unanimous consent of the entire body, or an emergency agreement between Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Their roles will soon reverse when the two Democrats elected in Georgia are sworn in.)Unanimous consent is a non-starter: GOP senators who opposed impeachment in the first place aren’t about to help speed it along. And although Schumer called on McConnell to agree to reconvene under emergency circumstances, McConnell declined to do so, saying a trial will last longer than Trump is in office anyway.It’s one thing to fire off a lightspeed impeachment in the House, which is an inherently political process. But a Senate trial is, well, atrial—although politics undeniably plays a large role here as well, justice requires that those sitting in judgment take time to consider the evidence for and against the charges, and that the accused have time to assemble and then make his defense. President Trump’s first trial, the shortest presidential impeachment trial in history, lasted three full weeks—and would have gone longer had Senate Republicans not barred Democrats from calling new witnesses.House Democrats have considered the possibility of withholding the article of impeachment until the Senate has gotten a good jump on its confirmation work. But that decision would stand awkwardly beside the decision to proceed so speedily with impeachment in the first place, and it would risk making the trial seem like an afterthought as Trump leaves office and recedes from view. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has repeatedly said he would prefer to send the article to the Senate immediately, although the final decision is up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She may address the question of timing at a press conference later this morning.Biden hascalled on the Senateto “bifurcate” its schedule, taking care of the trial and regular business each in turn. Because by rule trial proceedings start every day at noon, that would mean attending to confirmation and legislation in morning sessions.“I hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,” Biden said this week.According to theNew York Times, McConnellhas told Bidenthat whether such a move is possible must be determined by Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, the official whose role it is to advise the Senate on such procedural matters. Even if McConnell is on board, the path to a bifurcated schedule isn’t clear. Some have suggested that this move, too, would requireanother unanimous consent approval, which could prove difficult to obtain.This sort of procedural talk might make your eyes glaze over, but this question is actually very important. If the parliamentarian rules that the two-track system requires unanimous consent, then any single senator with an axe to grind against the trial would have the ability to gum up all the rest of the Senate’s business in protest against the proceedings. If she rules otherwise, McConnell and Schumer would be able to strike a deal that would lead to an extremely busy February in the Senate—but one that will avoid leaving Biden’s Cabinet nominees congealing on the back burner.Biden announced details of an ambitious coronavirus relief proposal on Thursday night, saying he hopes it can win support from congressional Republicans.But with most GOP senators wary of new federal spending on another round of economic aid, and with an impeachment trial pending, quickly passing Biden’s stimulus package is expected to prove a challenge. The plan also includes items Republicans are certain to balk at, such as raising the federalminimum wageto $15 per hour.The $1.9 trillion framework touts funding for COVID-19 testing, schools, and vaccine distribution. It also directs $350 billion to state and local governments, a long-held Democratic priority. It would boost federal unemployment benefits from $300 to $400 per week and extend them through September. It would also increase thechild tax creditfrom $2,000 to $3,000 per child this year, with an additional $600 for children under the age of 6.The plan comes as many Americans continue to suffer from the economic impacts of the raging pandemic. Nearly1 millionpeople filed for unemployment last week.“I know what I just described does not come cheaply,” he said while outlining his priorities Thursday evening. “But failure to do so will cost us dearly.”Biden’s proposal would also send direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans. This aspect of the package has some Republican support; earlier this week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called for Biden to prioritize boosting the $600 direct payments when he takes office.“It would send a powerful message to the American people if, on the first day of your presidency, you called on the House and Senate to send you legislation to increase the direct economic impact payments to Americans struggling due to the pandemic from $600 to $2,000,” Rubio wrote in a letter.He added that he has concerns about “the long-term effects of this additional spending,” but “we simply cannot ignore the fact that millions of working class families across the nation are still in desperate need of relief.”Rubio poured cold water on the nearly $2 trillion proposal Thursday night, though, writing that it won’t be able to pass Congress quickly. He made the case for a more targeted approach.President-Elect Biden served in he Senate for over 35 years. So he knows the plan he outlined tonight can’t pass “quickly” & will delay the 2k for hard hit Americans.Let’s get the extra money to people first.Some progressives, meanwhile, have taken issue with the effort for their own reasons, calling for the bill to advance new full payments of $2,000 to most Americans instead of checks totaling $1,400.Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) says Dems should pass $2K on top of the $600 from December, rather than add $1,400 to get $600 to $2K.""$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400,″@AOCtells ushttps://t.co/mww4nQ470FA sizable number of Democrats also want to see legislation that ensures recurring monthly $2,000 checks until the pandemic ends, not just a one-off payment.“Let’s not just give ordinary Americans a one-time $2,000 check,” Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat,saidThursday afternoon. “With our new majority and a worsening crisis, let’s meet the need: $2,000/month, every month, until this crisis is over.”Biden promised a more sweeping proposal will follow, which Democrats could try to pass through budgetreconciliation. Reconciliation allows the party that controls the Senate to approve legislation with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. There are rules that limit the kinds of policies that can be included in reconciliation bills, though, complicating any such attempt.Biden has said he hopes to pass his initial $1.9 trillion plan under regular order instead of reconciliation, meaning he would need support from at least 10 Republicans in the Senate. Unless this package changes substantially in the coming weeks—cutting items like the minimum wage hike and funding for state and local governments—it’s difficult to imagine that happening.Many GOP senators are likely to recoil at the price tag of the proposal. Republicans resisted Democratic calls for more than $2 trillion in relief for months leading up to the November election. In December, Congress passed a $900 billion compromise package.Democrats at the time said it was only a short-term measure to keep the economy afloat until more relief could be approved under the Biden administration.“As I said when it passed in December, a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package was a very important first step. I’m grateful for the Democrats, Republicans, and independent members of Congress who came together to get it done,” Biden said Thursday. “But I said at the time it’s just a down payment. We need more action, more bipartisanship, and we need to move quickly. We need to move fast.”Correction of the daypic.twitter.com/UyvQmRCNXlTo ensure that you receive Uphill in your inbox, be sure to opt-in on youraccount page.these insights into the nature of legislation are among the best things about the dispatch2016 will never end!NEVER!Re: ""chained to their desks in Washington . . .""

Wonderful example, Victor. Thank you!Great article.And Officer Goodman should receive a commendation for his quick thinking and bravery.  I hope this is made a priority.  As Mr. Rogers was quoted in your other link, when the news is scary ""look for the helpers.""Great article. This analysis makes a lot of sense to me.One has to generally assume both sets of party leaders are operating primarily to advance their own agenda items and electoral prospects. In that respect, a prolonged impeachment/conviction spectacle is not in the interests of the Democrats. They got what they needed from Trump in the short-term: Democratic control of the Senate and a fractious demoralized Republican base angry at its own elites. They would know McConnell will try to bog the Senate trial down in procedurals and technicalities (as opposed to allowing the narrative to focus on the substance of the president’s offenses) and portray it is as overreach and a witch hunt against Republicans. And not without some merit—at least a few Democrats won’t be able to help themselves but to go full Kavanaugh and take the bait.Plus with Trump’s potential run for 2024 re-election hanging like a sword of Damocles over the heads of the GOP for the next few years, it guarantees GOP dysfunction and internecine division for some time and allows Democrats to keep campaigning against Trump even after he’s out of office. That’s a gift that keeps giving. If Trump were convicted in the Senate quickly and (in addition) made to be no longer eligible for federal public office, he’d likely just lose interest in the whole affair and slink off to a golf course somewhere out of the limelight.""If other business is pressing, the Senate must find ways to wedge it in around the time demanded by the trial."" I'm pretty much over hearing about how hard the members of Congress have it when they are asked to work more than 174 or so days a year and, sometimes (Oh, the horror) as much as 8 or 10 hours 5 days a week. It is inconceivable to me, absent some specific evidence, that the Senate could not, by majority, super majority, supercalifragalisticexpialidocious majority, change the rules to allow them to work on both the trial and the essential activity of government on the same day. The added advantage would be that each member would have to go on public record as either supporting rational activity and the proper determination of the president's responsibility for the events of Jan. 6 and preceding related actions or not.While I understand that publicly taking responsibility for anything goes against the grain for most contemporary politicians, this issue has the American people sufficiently engaged on both sides that Senators might want to consider thinking, at least a little, out of the ""business as usual"" box.Words and actions have consequences, and from that it follows there must be a political consequence for Trump.  Although the impeachment itself will have no practical short run effect in terms of removing a discraced political leader from office, it sends the message that some acts and some speech from our elected leaders is simply too antithetical to democracy.The mechanics of the second Trump impeachment will be unique in history because there will be no rush to remove a dangerous zealot from a position of power.  The electorate has accomplished this heavy lifting through the recent election. The timing, therefore, for sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate is less critical.Seems to me the Dems can move forward with their plan to quickly address the deficiencies of the former administration's failed Covid-19 vaccine roll out without the baggage of a simultaneous Senate trial.  Whatever the outcome, focus must be directed to helping our nation past the viral scourge.  Both parties must temporarily make difficult choices for the immediate betterment of the health and welfare of our entire population.  Only then can we refocus on next steps toward a better America for all.The amount of unnecessary spending being proposed is sickening. I do not need $2,000/month (>$4,000/month with my wife and child) from the government for the foreseeable future. Targeted unemployment insurance makes sense. Paycheck protection makes sense. Vaccine rollout spending makes sense. Maybe even funding for state/local gov’t makes sense. But a monthly stipend for those of us who are doing just fine is dumb.Oh, one more thing: funding for state/local gov't makes sense because under the Trump admin many of the responsibilities for COVID response were devolved upon state & local governments. Which is fine, to a point, but it's overstretched many of their budgets, and they, unlike the federal government, can't run a deficit. We don't want states to be declaring bankruptcy.I agree that $2k/mo. makes no sense. It is a way to get UBI into circulation under the pretext of COVID. Unlike some here probably, I actually am in favor of the stimulus checks to date, because they reached people who would not be reached by unemployed insurance since they are not working (the elderly & others on fixed incomes, ""discouraged workers"" who don't show up in unemployment figures). I might even be up for more in stimulus checks, as is Rubio. But not $2k/mo.Then give it back. Clearly others need it. It won't happen in America, because we prefer suffering to helping.  Meanwhile, ranking 30th in COVID response, at best, we rank like 15th in aid to citizens.This is called anti-ExceptionalismThis is a horrible (and horribly lazy) governing posture. If I’m in a position to give it back, why would they send it to me in the first place? If I don’t need it, how many other individuals/families don’t need it?This (even the further $1400 cash payout) is an example of government misjudging the size of the tool they need. You don’t use a sledgehammer to drive in a drywall nail (even if there are hundreds of nails to hammer home). In fact, if the nail is already securely in place, you don’t need the hammer at all!I can assure, that the SBA's PPP process had more stupidity in it, than just giving the $1400 cash.  Like how many FTE does and sole Proprietership have ?Seems better to get money to the vast majority of Americans who need it now, than to punish them with ""process"".  Ergo, my honest suggestion, if you dont' need it, return it. Seems simple to me.At the beginning of the pandemic, sure. Same goes for infection mitigation methods. By this point in the process, we’ve got to have a better understanding of what is actually needed, what makes an actual difference.Also, if you’re so cynical about the generosity of Americans, then this policy makes even less sense. Why send cash to a bunch of greedy people who are only going to use it for selfish gain (or let it sit in their savings account) when it could be used to improve the lives of people who truly need it?I was actually not cynical. How ?   I just said that in fact, the generosity and honesty of Americans who do not need the extra money, could/should/might give it back.Otherwise, what means test would you suggest to parse the needy from the clearly not needy ?  And I'm on the side of giving more to upper than less to lower here?PPP used AGI. Probably half of the Americans who need the money, have no idea what AGI means.  Further, Income level alone is only good to sort at the extremes of income. Very wealthy obviously, but some wealthy folks just report zero income and a loss with all the tax-loops.How would you sort it ?2k a month is one of those wild eye pipe dreams people suggest that has zero chance of becoming reality. It’s never gonna happen.It's an especially bad idea that deserves whatever public mockery it gets. I'll be hard-pressed to take anything seriously from a proponent of this idea.So was overturning the election, and those who tried to do that deserved every bit of criticism they got. Bad ideas should be critiqued accordingly.Oh I wasn’t saying don’t be critical. Just saying we don’t have to worry about it happening.Sorry but I need something else to keep me up late at night.I shall worry about it because you said not too.Take that, Ms. S S M!This is the downside of ""being moderate"".  Some things require full effort.  This is why I also desire the filibuster to go away.  It's obstructionist.  We have elections.Then let us war against each other till the other side is pounded into the dust of oblivion!*takes off glove and throws it at you*I challenge you to whatever next policy fight we get into in these comment sections!Sorry my mood is lighter today than it was last week.Victor!! I hope we can discuss policy instead of Sedition and Insurrection. Doubts it tho l..😔Nothing really to discuss. I don't mind the impeachment effort this second time (I think the incitement standard is setting the bar too high just impeach him for his conduct on Jan. 6th) or the arresting of those who hit the capital.Unless....you're on the side of.....*plays dramatic music* the invaders!Agreed. Congress has had 10 months to figure out how to target the relief to those who are on  the financial brink; one has to believe that the will to do so just isn't there.It’s so much easier to paint with a broad brush. That’s why I can paint my living room, but I’d never try to recreate a Rembrandt.And, unfortunately, what we need right now are some economic artists and what we have are a bunch of apprentice paperhangers.Arguably for the people MOST in need, it is likely a month or two.Your newsletter is a great addition.  Hard to find this quality of writing in today's frantic news stream.  Thank you!I want to share with y'all my fantasy. Biden and McConnell are secretly in cahoots. They both love and will defend to the death, the constitution and our country. They BOTH need help to tamp down the crazy wing nuts within their own parties. Clogging up the legislative wing with an impeachment trial (I favor conviction, by the way) is a way to hold up any crazy legislation, and the divisive fights that would entail, until tempers cool. At a point in the future, when tempers are cooler, Biden and McConnell can work together on COMPROMISES that will actually SOLVE PROBLEMS that only the federal government can address. I can dream, can't I?If you lie down for a while this will probably pass. The good news is that it's a group fantasy, you're not the only one who feels this way.Legislation is already chilled by the overrepresentation of the right in government. Also, minority power is only one of the checks that are built into our system.Believe it or not, the Founders also hoped that governance would be guided by consequences.  They wanted  majorities to be able to pass laws that affect people’s lives. To that end, representatives are elected every two years. The most important “check” on governance should be the consent of the governed who affirm or reject the results of legislation. But in order for there to be a virtuous feedback loop, majorities first have to pass laws. For that to happen, moderates need to get past their infatuation with political paralysis.  Paradoxically, moderates’ aversion to legislative majorities causes the polarization and paralysis they claim to deplore.Who says  compromises solve problems that cogent policy alternatives can’t?""Legislation is already chilled by the overrepresentation of the right in government. Also, minority power is only one of the checks that are built into our system.""Correct me if I am wrong, but even when democrats had all three branches of government back in 2008-2010, they only passed the Affordable Care Act. And then got wiped out in the mid terms.The Clinton administration did the same thing in 1992-1994, they got wiped out then during the mid terms by the Gingerich Revolution. Which, by the way, Clinton worked with and still got policies passed, but he had to comprise.So, I mean, why should democrats trust that now that they have all three branches again (slimmest majority in a long time), they are going to pass serious policies? Because to many democrats (people can correct me if I am taking their views out of context), they see getting senators and house members to pass policies like wrangling cats.And the cats have claws!I don't think it's honestly the republicans that are the problems sometimes for democrats, I think democrats do a lot of damage to themselves, overreach, then get crushed in midterms after they hold the executive branch.But hey, maybe it'll be different this time. I mean, bro, republicans did have some crazies invade the capital. But yeah, lotsa democrats don't have too much faith in the institutions these days from what I gather. Bill Maher complains about this a lot.Well, because both parties have decided the easy way to keep their seats is to do NOTHING and keep the wounds open to raise money off the pain and throw in a little gerrymandering. They need to sit down and think about how to get to a slightly better place where nobody gets everything they want, but everybody gets a little bit. Remember what those dreamers in Philadelphia in the 1700’s came up with? THAT was a totally insane compromise, but it created the best way of life in the history of the planet!""Remember what those dreamers in Philadelphia in the 1700’s came up with?""""A Republic, if you can keep it?"" Was it that? :)Or was it sliced bread. I do loved freshly baked, sliced bread. With Jam.But compromise can be a good thing, and essential for government.I hear you. I would suggest one example. If both sides came to the table with a desire to compromise, I am 100% certain we could get to a MUCH better place on immigration. It cannot be ""my way or the highway""- extreme right - no immigration, no work visas versus extreme left - open borders, no enforcement, allow citizenship for all, unlimited work visas... I expect there would be other examples where piece meal progress may not be optimum, but puts us in a better place and is a step *towards* optimum.If not citizenship, at least legal residency, you're still dreaming but it would be nice to find out how many in Congress share this dream. Sounds almost American.See, we are proposing solutions already!That's never been a problem with this group, it's getting them listened to in DC."

Has Donald Trump Invoked the Insurrection Act?,1.67,47.33,https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/trump-insurrection-act-false,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-dispatch-bias-reliability/,2021-01-14,2,"After a violent mob stormed the Capitol on January 6 to protest Joe Biden’s electoral victory severalsocial media postsclaiming that President Donald Trump had invoked the Insurrection Act, began circulating online.Insurrection Act was signed last night by Pres Trump according to multiple sources. Reliable source is Michael Jaco, a former Navy Seal, who announced it just now on his YouTube channel. Vatican, Italy, Germany, Pakistan all linked to foreign interference:https://t.co/WEorGuIz1kOneviral Facebook post shows a screenshot of a Parler account identified as @TeamTrumpNews that claims that President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act in response to what is described as a “treasonous rebellion by Democrat & Republican lawmakers.” Part of thewidely shared postreads as follows: “I have invoked the The Insurrection Act of 1807, to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat & Republican lawmakers, CCP agents, the FBI, DOJ, CIA & others to undermine, corrode, and dismantle the United States of America and its constitution.”The claim that Trump has invoked the Insurrection Act is false.Michel Paradis, who teaches military and constitutional law at Columbia Law School, says the Insurrection Act gives the president the power to use the military in situations of “extreme civil disturbance.” The act, said Paradis, “is literally designed to give the government, the president specifically, the power to use the military to protect the continuity of constitutional government in America.”In order to use the Insurrection Act, continued Paradis, the president needs to issue a proclamation, which he said is “the equivalent of a cease and desist order.” The fact that Trump hasn’t issued a proclamation is evidence that the Insurrection Act hasn’t been invoked.“Unlike almost any other federal statute, invocation of the Insurrection Actrequires the presidentto issue a formal,publicproclamation that he has activated his authority. Indeed, the whole point is that he has to notify those against whom force is to be used that the troops are on their way,” he said. “And even if the president does invoke that statute, it does not bring with it the imposition of martial law. All the Insurrection Act does is allow the president to use the federal military tosupplementcivilian law enforcement, not to supplant it.”“Just as a simple straightforward legal matter, the Insurrection Act has not been invoked because the president has not invoked it,” explained Paradis. “It has to be publicly invoked …… there’s no ambiguity, it doesn’t lend itself to conspiracy theories.”Feb 2, 2024February 2, 2024Nick CatoggioFeb 2, 2024February 3, 2024Jonah GoldbergFeb 2, 2024February 2, 2024Alex DemasFeb 2, 2024February 2, 2024Andrew EggerandDavid M.

House losses all have come on Democratic side so far,1.33,48.67,https://rollcall.com/2020/11/04/house-losses-all-have-come-on-democratic-side-so-far/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,2,"With more than 50 races still uncalled as of early Wednesday afternoon, House Democrats hoping to grow their majority had failed to defeat a single Republican incumbent, while they lost a handful of seats in Trump-friendly districts and two in a part of Florida considered central to President Donald Trump’s victory in the state.The losses served as a reality check for Democrats, who entered the election expecting that the president would do worse than he did in 2016 in many districts, potentially allowing them to flip seats in districts Trump previously won by double digits.But in the end, the historic 43 seats they flipped in the 2018 midterms left them vulnerable. Six of the seven seats they lost were by freshmen members in those districts. Five were in the 30 districts Democrats held that Trump won in 2016, which Republicans had tagged as obvious targets.And two, in Florida’s 26th and 27th districts, were southern Florida districts where Hispanic voters responded to Republicans’ attempts to paint Democrats as aligned with socialist regimes in Cuba and Latin America.Here are the incumbents who have lost their races so far:Freshman DemocratDebbie Mucarsel-Powelllost her south Florida House seat to Carlos Gimenez, a popular Miami-Dade County mayor who was one of two candidates on the federal ballot who had led their communities during the COVID crisis. Gimenez, who is Cuban-American, tied Mucarsel-Powell to Democratic socialist Sen.Bernie Sanders, and Republicans attacked her for her husband’s work for firms associated with a Ukranian “warlord.” Inside Elections rated the race Tilt Democratic.Cuban American television journalist Maria Elvira Salazar defeated freshman DemocratDonna E. Shalalain South Florida’s majority Hispanic 27th District. Salazar tied Shalala to “Democratic socialists” on the left and attacked her for failing to disclose stock trades while in office. She also focused on extensive outreach to the Hispanic community, gaining an edge over Shalala, who does not speak Spanish. Salazar was leading 51 to 49 percent when The Associated Press called the race at 10:58 p.m. Tuesday. Trump lost the district by 20 points in 2016. The race had not attracted any outside spending, a sign that neither party saw it as among the most competitive of the cycle. Inside Elections rated the race Solid Democrat.After several cycles of ticket-splitting wins, Peterson lost his bid for a 16th term, and the district lost his clout as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. Fischbach raised more money than Peterson and was likely aided in her support for Trump, who carried the district by 31 points in 2016. Peterson, an anti-abortion conservative Democrat, largely avoided crossing Trump — he voted against the House impeachment charges — but ultimately endorsed BidenHorn, a surprise winner in 2018, lost to Biden in a suburban Oklahoma City district where Trump has maintained steady support. Bice, a  moderate who has touted her record defending conservative values such as fiscal responsibility, abortion opposition and gun rights, emerged from a bruising late-August primary to outraise Horn in the third quarter of this year. Republicans painted Horn, who has a moderate record, as a Pelosi liberal who threatened oil and gas industry jobs. In conceding, Horn said her campaign “changed minds and built a movement of support in a district that pundits thought was unwinnable. When many voters in this district had lost faith that their vote counted for something, we gave them hope. That’s a victory in itself.”Cunningham entered the 2020 cycle as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in Congress after flipping a Charleston-area district by a single point. He had managed to build a strong local profile and amass a sizable fundraising advantage by avoiding partisan disputes and focusing instead on opposition to offshore drilling. But Mace, the first female graduate of the Citadel military college, was able to counter that she had sponsored legislation opposing it.Torres Small lost a rematch to Herrell in the rural district after being portrayed as a  Pelosi-aligned liberal working to end oil and gas production and kill jobs. Torres Small, a former water rights attorney, countered with her own ads promoting work to support the industry.Republicans touted Hinson, a former broadcast journalist who was well known in Cedar Rapids, as a top recruit against Finkenauer, who had flipped the district from red to blue in 2018. Hinson previously won a competitive state House seat that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.Bridget Bowman, Lindsey McPherson and Chris Marquette contributed to this report."

Pornhub, which has 42 billion visits per year, is currently under fire for its apparent lack of safeguarding checks. Six million videos a year are posted on the site; some, according to anti-porn campaigners, depicting rape and sexual abuse. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) hasfoundmore than 100 cases of child abuse on the site between 2017 and 2019.Inspired by theTraffickinghubpetition which recently hit two million signatures, campaigners are taking the fight against pornography directly to MindGeek’s doorstep. Today, a demonstration, with facemasks and social distancing, of course, is taking place outside its UK HQ in Uxbridge, Greater London, in the hope that this public display will put pressure on the Government to expedite theOnline Harms Regulationand hold porn sites accountable for their complicity in sexual exploitation.MindGeek is the parent company to almost 100 websites that collectively consume more bandwidth than Facebook, Twitter and Amazon combined. It has become the largest multinational porn conglomerate in the world, controlling most of the major free porn sites. Pornhub entices traffic by offering free access but then users get bombarded with advertisements for pay-sites.According toGail Dines, a leading authority on the porn industry, ‘rather than take responsibility for content uploaded to their sites, MindGeek pushes the line that they are not the creators but merely the hosts, and that the performers are all engaging in porn consensually’.I have spent many hours combing through the content on Pornhub and can confirm that it is vile in the extreme. Pornhub hosts videos including ‘sleep forced abuse drunk passed out’. There is also overt racism, such as ‘Ebony slave girl porn’ and ‘the most racist porn video ever created.’"

My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation,” he said. “And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning.”A series of high-ranking Trump administration officials—including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, former chief of staff and current special envoy to Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney, deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, and acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Tyler Goodspeed—announced their resignationon Thursday. Many specifically cited President Trump’s incitement of Wednesday’s siege of the Capitol as their rationale.U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknickdied on Thursday eveningafter sustaining injuries in the riots at the Capitol one day earlier. The insurrection’s total death toll now stands at five. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellsaid Thursdayhe has “requested and received” the resignation of Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving gave his resignation notice as well.

Chuck Schumer on Thursdaycalled on Vice President Mike Penceto invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Trump from office following his role in Wednesday’s siege of the Capitol. Pelosi said Democrats in the House are prepared to impeach Trump a second time if Pence does not work to remove him. Republican Rep. Adam Kinzingeralso came out in favorof invoking the 25th amendment yesterday, and John Kelly—Trump’s former chief—said he wouldvote to removethe president were he still in the White House.Initial jobless claims decreased by 3,000 week-over-week to 787,000 last week, the Labor Departmentreportedon Thursday. About 19.2 million people were on some form of unemployment insurance during the week ending December 19, compared to 1.8 million people during the comparable week in 2019.The U.S. trade deficithit a 14-year highin November, according to anew reportfrom the Commerce Department.The United States confirmed 279,951 new cases of COVID-19 yesterdayper the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard, with 14.7 percent of the 1,902,436 tests reported coming back positive. An additional 4,136 deaths were attributed to the virus on Thursday, bringing the pandemic’s American death toll to 365,208. According to theCOVID Tracking Project, 132,370 Americans are currently hospitalized with COVID-19. Accordingto the Centers for Disease Control, 21,419,800 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been distributed nationwide, and 5,919,418 have been administered.In the day and half since Trump supporters—incited by the president and his baseless claims about electoral fraud—stormed and occupied the U.S. Capitol building, lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have been contemplating how to minimize further damage between now and President-elect Biden’s inauguration on January 20.Many elected officials have called on the Cabinet and Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the president from his post immediately. Others—includingThe Dispatchin ourfirst ever staff editorial—have pushed for the fast-tracked impeachment, conviction, and removal of President Trump from his office for posing an immediate threat to national security.Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Islandsaid yesterdaythat more than 110 of his colleagues signed on to the articles of impeachment he, Rep. Ted Lieu, and Rep. Jamie Raskin authored. “Incited by President Trump, a mob unlawfully breached the Capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress and the Vice President, interfered with the Joint Session’s solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results, and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,” thearticles read. “President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government.”Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, meanwhile,wrote a letterto Vice President Pence imploring him to exercise the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office. “Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides the Vice President and a majority of sitting Cabinet secretaries with the authority to determine a president as unfit if he ‘is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,’” the letter reads. “President Trump’s willingness to incite violence and social unrest to overturn the election results by force clearly [meets] this standard.”One House Republican—Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois—echoed this call. “Sadly, yesterday it became evident that not only has the president abdicated his duty to protect the American people and the people’s house, he invoked and inflamed passions that only gave fuel to the insurrection that we saw here,” Kinzingersaid. “It’s time to invoke the 25th Amendment and to end this nightmare.”When asked byCNN’sJake Tapper if he would vote to remove the president if he were still in the White House, former Trump Chief of StaffJohn Kelly responded, “Yes, I would.”Democratic leadership made clear yesterday that, given these two options, they’d prefer the latter. “I joined the Senate Democratic Leader in calling on the vice president to remove this President by immediately invoking the 25th Amendment,” House Speaker Nancy Pelositold reporterson Thursday. “If the vice president and Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment. That is the overwhelming sentiment of my caucus—and the American people, by the way.”Pelosi’s comments followeda statementfrom Sen. Chuck Schumer. “The quickest and most effective way—it can be done today—to remove this president from office would be for the vice president to immediately invoke the 25th amendment,” he wrote. “If the vice president and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president.”After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the 25th Amendment—ratified in 1967—established the process by which the president can be stripped of his office in the event of death, removal, resignation, or incapacitation. To invoke it, the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet would need to vote to remove the president, thereby deeming him unable to discharge the duties of office.You’d assume that over 100 Democrats—including all four members of The Squad—calling for the Republican president’s removal would gin up a reaction on the GOP side of the aisle. But there was nary a peep yesterday. In fact, Rep. Steve Stivers, a Republican from Ohio,toldSpectrum Newsthat he “would not oppose it” if the Cabinet voted to invoke the 25th Amendment. Stivers and Kinzinger remain outliers on the Republican front, but very few GOP members spoke up on Thursday to oppose these measures, either.There werereports on Wednesday nightthat Trump administration officials—including top Cabinet officials—were having serious conversations about the 25th Amendment. ButBusiness Insiderand theNew York Timesboth reported yesterday that Pence does not plan to invoke it, believing that doing so would “add to the current chaos in Washington rather than deter it.” In aThursday afternoon press conference, Sen. Lindsey Graham sent a message to Trump through the TV screen. “I don’t support invoking the 25th Amendment now,” he said. “If something else happens, all options would be on the table.”Trump appears to have—for now—gotten the message. Not only will one more reckless tweet result in himbeing bannedfrom his favorite communications platform for good—it could also lead to his term being artificially cut short. We did not hear from the president at all yesterday, other than atwo-and-a-half minute videotweeted just after 7 p.m. ET that would have been a fine concession speech had it been it delivered two months ago.“We have just been through an intense election and emotions are high. But now, tempers must be cooled and calm restored,” he said. “My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results; my only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections.”“Now, Congress has certified the results,” Trump continued. “A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”The speech got a passing grade from Graham. “President @realDonaldTrump’s statement tonight urging the country to move forward and heal was much-needed and hit the mark,” hetweeted. “Well done, Mr. President.” We’ll see if he can keep it up for 12 more days.For much of America, Wednesday’s occupation of the Capitol was a reckoning—leading to a renewed effort to impeach the president, a rash of resignations from his administration, and a sudden and wholly unexpected acknowledgment of Biden’s victory from Trump himself.Yet one group at least seems to be unshaken by the shocking events: The core Trump base. How has the Trump movement avoided soul-searching following a day on which some of its most committed members stormed Congress by force? Simply by rewriting the facts of the event into something consistent with their worldview, in which America’s only violent political insurrectionists come from the radical left.Mere minutes after the motley crew of Proud Boys, militia members, and other MAGA faithful were evicted from the Capitol Wednesday, a false narrative had already begun going viral among Trump supporters on social media. The people who stormed police barricades by force at the Capitol, the story ran, had actually been Antifa interlopers posing as supporters of the president.Never mind that the crowd had come to D.C. and marched to Congress at Trump’s explicit request; never mind that some of those filmed trashing the place werewell-known alt-right personalities; never mind that others interviewed inside wereperfectly chatty about who they were and why they were there; never mind that the only “evidence” provided for this theory wasa couple screenshots of misidentified faces and tattoos. Boosted bycredulous and sloppy right-wing web media,loose-cannon MAGA celebrities,Fox News hosts “just asking questions,”and evenmembers of Congress, the theory that the Capitol insurrection had been instigated by false-flag leftists almost immediately took over the pro-Trump internet.“The whole thing was set up,” said one South Carolina woman who declined to give her name. “They wanted the people to get pumped up and do that. … The picture of the guy sitting on Pelosi’s desk or whatever? I guarantee you he was working for Antifa—or whoever it is, whatever organization.” (It was, in fact,Richard Barnettfrom Gravette, Arkansas. The FBI reportedly visited his house yesterday.)“There was, you know, a window was broken,” said Christian, a protester who had driven up from Texas earlier this week and said he had witnessed the break-in but not entered the Capitol himself. “Some people were kind of doing it—either they were overzealous or there were some agitators within. It looks like some people have identified a few likely Antifa members based on their tattoos and stuff … For the people who were genuine Trump supporters, which there probably were a few, I don’t know if they were the first in—maybe they just tagged along.”On Thursday, we published ourfirst editorialcalling for the immediate impeachment and removal of Donald Trump from office. But some others warn that removing Trump from office could do more harm than good at this point in his presidency.  While acknowledging that Trump “effectively incited a violent insurrection against a joint session of Congress” and that he “should not be the president for an instant longer,”National Review’s Dan McLaughlinarguesthat “removing him now could cause more problems than it solves.” McLaughlin walks us through three possible avenues: Letting the election process work, invoking the 25th Amendment, and impeachment, and discusses whether any of these remedies are appropriate at this time.Following Trump’s speech on November 5—in which he alleged that the election was stolen—reporter Tim Alberta tweeted: “November 5, 2020. A dark day in American history.” He was met with skepticism from GOP operatives and pundits. Could Trump’s baseless election conspiracy theoriesreallylead to a violent insurrection? Alberta has been closely following the paranoia and conspiratorial thinking of American voters for years, and has thought for months something like Wednesday was all but inevitable: “Nobody knew exactly how that belief would manifest itself; I certainly never expected to see platoons of insurrectionists scaling the walls of the U.S. Capitol and sacking the place in broad daylight,” hewrites in his latest piece. “Still, shocking as this was, it wasn’t a bit surprising. The attempted coup d’état had been unfolding in slow motion over the previous nine weeks. Anyone who couldn’t see this comingchosenot to see it coming. And that goes for much of the Republican Party.”WhileThe Dispatchhad reporters on the ground for the insurrection at the Capitol, none of them were inside the building when it was breached by the president’s supporters. POLITICO did, and they put together agripping oral history of the daythat does a great job encapsulating just how chaotic the situation was on Wednesday. “There was an announcement the building wasn’t secure,” Marianne LeVine remembered. “We decided to barricade the doors with couches and chairs. We turned off the lights and we hid behind the desks.” Olivia Beavers recalled that “there was a moment when a reporter asked me: ‘Do you think we should take off our press badges?’”Josh Hawley has condemned me more forcefully for disagreeing with him on Section 230.https://t.co/dGALlzVEXhHeader: Rep.

What is your (realistic) hope for a post-Trump Republican Party and a post-Trump conservative movement? And how do you hope to engage in these debates?Reporting by Declan Garvey (@declanpgarvey), Andrew Egger (@EggerDC), Haley Byrd Wilt (@byrdinator), Audrey Fahlberg (@FahlOutBerg), Charlotte Lawson (@charlotteUVA), and Steve Hayes (@stephenfhayes).My comments are not specifically related to the above but i cant see any other way to get a message to your site. I am life long republican. have always referred to myself as a ""congenital republican"" as a daughter of a long deceased Republican judge in the city and county of Philadelphia. On my bulletin board above this desk is a clipping from he New York Times---12/24/13---""the Cry of the True Republican ""by John G. Taft. Unfortunately I cant scan it and forward it but I urge you to look it up iin the archives and publish it with your take on it. It could have been written yesterday. Both Cruz and McCarthy are cited. The party of Taft and my father is no more!I have trouble seeing how we can continue to function as a democracy when the Left pushes so hard, and, often, successfully, to squelch mainstream conservative thought as hate speech and/or ipso facto overt racism. On the Right?  I am stunned that just 3 months ago 75 MILLION people voted for a rank, transparent demagogue.I am 63 years old, so I have seen a decent amount of strife, demagoguery, and venality in American politics in my life. In their own ways, hiwever, each major party has become virulently anti-democratic. I don't know how this plays out, but I don't think it plays out well :-(Warning, the following started out pithy by evolved into an exercise in self-indulgence.Trump is the same desperately flawed man now that he always was.  Despite countless episodes that have demonstrated the severity of these flaws over the last 4 years, his lock on Trump loyalists within the Republican Party (seemingly the vast majority of Republicans in office) has been unbreakable ... until this. The writers of this series took the plot line several orders of magnitude beyond credulity and on a continual and accelerating basis.  And their twist[ed] ending stayed true to the formula.The President loses the election, but only because of a once-in-a-century (or two or three) pandemic and the hundreds of thousands of deaths wrought substantively from his calculated, negligent response to it.  But he still has roughly half the nation / half the Congress in his grip and the promise of continued, and potentially greater, dark times ahead for the country looks very likely.  His election challenge lies and the ease of their spread and their power over his cult-like loyalists confirm truly the worst fears.  It all builds up (with a plot line that really gets milked through way more episodes than the writers should have allowed themselves) to a protest of thousands of the President's supporters, incited directly by the President himself to march to the Capitol building, morphing into a mob that storms the building WHILE the final/official election vote tally is being taken, presided over by the man who has arguably been the most loyal to Tthe President over the course of his term in office (I have it on good authority that 2 of the lead writers and 1 producer walked out in protest when they learned the series was going to be concluded so preposterously).Hours previously, the Senate Majority Leader, one of the President's chief abettors and apologists over 4 years, gives an impassioned speech foretelling of the doom the Democracy faces if the course the President's lies have set is followed--a message that is tragically too late for him and he is the first to die in the bloody assault of Congress in which even the members pull out various obscure weaponry against each other in a scene chock full of allusions to Game of Thrones and Anchorman.  At this point even a loyal, young intern writer feels she has to interject and musters the courage to suggest maybe they're laying in a little heavy on the mixing of genres--time is short and they're all getting a little tired, but they really are trying to make this have a meaningful conclusion, so a small group is sent off with the task of coming up with something that can mesh in to somehow make the tragedy of the Majority Leader a little less obvious.  They're in a room scribbling down some ideas on a whiteboard ... all of them ending with some ridiculous huge death toll.  In the growing frustration one of them gets up and writes in big bold letters, ""EITHER WE STAY ON A PATH TO A SENSIBLE CONCLUSION OR LET WAR KNOCK US OFF!!!""  Suffice to say they developed an elaborate subplot that took the degree of the Senate Majority Leader's tragedy down a few notches, though the intern did meekly voice some concerns over the plausibility of setting it in Georgia before she was let go.Anyway. Back to the mob's assault on the Capitol.It's undertaken as a show of the strength, the fight, the power of those who have been made to feel so wronged.  It is meant not as a threat but as a promise of the war that will be waged if Congress and the Vice President go forward to sustain the votes of the electorate.  There's strong suspicion that the President and his people have purposefully delayed and thwarted the ability of national guard forces to get on the scene and restore order.  Lives are lost.   Eventually, the supports arrive.  The smoke clears.   Congress resumes the tally.Then, what had been planned as a surgical bombing of electoral vote challenges gets reduced to a couple dim embers just bright enough to identify those whose legacy will be the corruption of power and lies over principle.  Hours before the dawn of the next day the Vice President abides by his legal duty to the Constitution in defiance of the President and the mob.  The country awakens to the new day shaken and uncertain.  Yes, the disastrously flawed man appears to have lost the battle.  But what of the war.  Will he be emboldened?  Will his loyalists be? Is there even a remote chance that this will be the point where influential loyalists have the courage to say enough is enough and make some desperate attempt to break the grip that so many of them quietly suffered as an oppression.  But there were so many hints/hopes of such through so many episodes that never amounted to anything and did, in fact serve just to embolden the man and the followers ... could there really be any reasonable expectation this would be different.  But this time it was different.  It started as a trickle, but then reports became more widespread of more and more loyalists finding their courage to speak out against the flaws of the man and his despicable incitement of the crowd toward violence.  Even, in some cases, of his being unfit to continue even just a short time more in office and his threat to national security.The last scene is a funeral on a beautiful warm sunny day in South Carolina.  Lindsay Graham has died at the age of 95 after retiring from the Senate at 83 and enjoying 12 happy, peaceful final years.  Elder senators Ossoff and Rubio are friends walking together to the graveside ceremony.  Ossoff is expressing his admiration for the change that overcame Graham as the epitome of conciliatory statesmanship in those last 20 years in the Senate as a leader of the minority.  Ossoff remarks with wonder at Graham's courage in giving clear voice in 2022 to the need to move beyond the darkness and division of the Trump years.  Rubio, 80 now, listens placidly to the younger colleague who has always had tendencies towards the effusive.  When the younger man finishes, the elder turns with a kind smile to face him, puts his hand on his shoulder and says, ""Courage was as non-existent as it was irrelevant ... a powerful man became a weak man ...  a weak man was no longer any threat to us ... more importantly a weak man was no longer any use to us.""Close-ups of the younger man smirking with a resigned acceptance and then the elder smiling more broadly and apologetically.  Rising pan out on the two men and the lovely day as they resume their walk to the graveside.I'm not hopeful about the prospects for a post-Trump Republican party. I think the biggest factor will be what Trump himself chooses to do. He still has enough die-hard support to attempt to maintain control of the party. If he does that, the party will split and end up in disarray. If he decides to bow out gracefully (hard to imagine), then the party has some strengths to build upon, though the factions will have to lay aside grievances and recriminations in favor of unity. A tall order.Listen to this 15 minute interview Ben Sasse gave to Hugh Hewitt. It was fantastic. He answered every question thoughtfully and was never tripped up. I especially liked his last answer about whataboutism when he said we don’t abandon our principles because the other side is unprincipled. He also went after the RNC very hard. The people that really need to listen to this are GOP Senators and House members who engaged in that political stunt on Wednesday.https://hughhewitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-08-HEWITT-BEN-SASSE-635-1.mp3And let me just add it’s pretty clear from this interview that Sasse does not subscribe to the Flight 93 essay. Unfortunately many elected Republicans do as does a sizable portion of the base.Yes, agreed!As a Trump supporter who is very upset by the Capitol Building events of last Wednesday, I will stick my neck out.  I will first say I do not support what eventually happened in any way shape or form.  I will say that we feel frustrated and unheard.  We really do have questions about the elections due to the at least the 1,000 affidavits of irregularities.  This is not because Donald told me to, and is where a majority of the comments I read fall short.  They lump us in to a group of people who can’t think for ourselves, who only listen to talking heads and the almighty Donald, and focus solely on religion and abortion.  There is so much more to me and others like me.  Why do we feel this way?  If anyone cares to ask I will share.  Furthermore, all of the violence, destruction and death that took place throughout the entire summer didn’t receive the swift end that it should have.  Don’t you think violence begets violence?  Doesn’t it make sense that very few of those people faced any repercussions for their actions doesn’t start to infiltrate the culture at large?  There are tens of thousands of solid Americans who were at that rally(I know some, I chose not to go) who did not engage in these reprehensible acts.  Oddly enough, it helps me understand those people who peacefully protested this summer and their frustration about black community relationships with police.  I get their frustration so much deeper but actions that bleed in to violence, death and yes even looting are wrong.  On a personal note, at this point a change is necessary—-I am just quite honestly not confident in it.Welcome to the Dispatch.If your question is about the affidavits, then please take comfort in the fact that the very conservative court saw no evidence and nothing to rule on.On your personal note, I completely sympathize. I’m a centrist, but a right-leaning one. I did not vote for Trump, but desperately want a respectable Conservative party. In my eyes, there isn’t one right now. That leaves me with the Democratic Party, which I am also not confident in.Also thank you for welcoming me!  I have been here a little before and I find the people very cordial and willing to exchange ideas.Yes, most people here are very cordial. I’m sorry if you’ve been around for awhile and I missed it. I don’t comment a lot and cannot really keep track of who is a “regular” in the comments section. 😅That’s ok, I appreciate your kind words and weighing in on the comments.  We are all busy people and can’t keep track of these things and I am not commenting often.  It is entirely understandable.I am not so sure the affidavit part is over.  I also have concerns with the rules being changed in the middle of the election.  Here, in Pennsylvania the league of women voters brought about a lawsuit that poll workers are not handwriting experts and could not solely dismiss a ballot on that criteria.  I worked as a poll worker on Election Day this year and we were encouraged to challenge signatures and I did.  I didn’t notice if anyone was a R or a D, I worked non-stop for 16 hours.  My husband brought me food, but I needed him to chew it for me(just kidding—-I didn’t get to it for hours later).  I think the standards for in person voting mail in were different.  Thank you for relating with me and we will “hope” for the best.Hey! I've worked as the signature-checking election judge before, and boy, could I tell you stories! (Shortest version: the signatures we were given to check against often had been mangled by computer by the time they got to us.)I realize I'm just someone in the comments on the internet, and I certainly have not had the time to look into all the affidavits. But I have looked into some of them, especially affidavits connected to Matt Braynard, who runs the ""Voter Integrity Project"", because he has a particular specialty:He launders unreliable or irrelevant data through data science experts.For example, he conducts shady phone surveys, then gives the unrepresentative data collected from them to mathematicians, withholding important information on how the data was collected, and telling the mathematicians to assume his sample is representative and work from there. Then he has them submit their analyses as affidavits. It amounts to mathematical fraud.You tell a mathematician to assume a sample is representative of what you say it's representative of, and the mathematician can do it — even if the assumption is entirely unwarranted. It is not mathematical dishonesty to reason from false assumptions as long as the reasoning itself is correct, so a mathematician risks no guilt of perjury by submitting such an affidavit. Nonetheless, such an affidavit submits false evidence, and a prudent judge *should* throw it out.In two cases, I combed through all the survey data Braynard provided to the mathematician swearing the affidavit (I have a masters in math) myself, and just a little bit of familiarity with state election laws gave ample reason to question that Braynard's survey showed what he told the mathematicians to assume it did. Much of Braynard's data is even more flagrantly flawed, claiming that voters have ""moved out of state"" simply because someone in another state shares their name, or votes ""fraudulently"" went to PO boxes, not real people, when the PO boxes *were* the addresses of real people living in apartments using PO boxes for their mail. Easy stuff to check. But Braynard didn't check: it was in his interest *not* to check, in order to raise unwarranted suspicion of fraud.In short, Mother Jones was right about Braynard:https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/12/a-pro-trump-voting-expert-was-questioned-about-his-data-it-did-not-go-well-for-him/In saying that, I'm hardly blindly trusting Mother Jones. Instead, I know what I have seen for myself, and it matches what Mother Jones reports on.It's unrealistic for any of us to be some sort of omnicompetent citizen-researcher, and none of us should feel burdened to analyze all the affidavits ourselves. But when you do have pre-existing knowledge, or you're willing to dig into local reporting on the issue, you may catch a glimpse, yourself, of why so many affidavits were thrown out. I did.And for all the affidavits you can't check yourself, the Dispatch Fact Check is excellent!Millie!  I love your summation about being an omnicompetent citizen-researcher.  I do believe local news is better issues, and the catching a of a glimpse of yourself—-important.  Self-awareness is a something that makes anyone a better person if they use it appropriately.  My signature polling experience was not the same as yours.  About this “Braynard guy”, he doesn’t represent the information I am after, I am after the accounts of real people.  I have not yet watched the recommended podcast but I promise I will.  Busy Saturday and I want to to absorb what I am hearing, not doing other things while I am listening.  Still, I(and many of my friends) feel unheard.  I would love to see these allegations be investigated publicly for all to hear and make up their minds(the French Press not withstanding).  I remember looking on snopes about Hunter Biden and his many nefarious dealings—-snopes said debunked, so early!  I want fairness from our media and something we can all use as a baseline, that just really no longer exists.Yes, I’m hoping with you. As for the election laws that were changed, David French and Sarah Isgur did several episodes covering that on their Advisory Opinions podcast here at the Dispatch. They were fantastic episodes and covered them way better than I could personally here. I highly recommend them if you are really interested in answers to your questions.I will be watching that tomorrow!  It is something I need to see.So, I don’t listen to media as much anymore, I don’t have faith.  We all need unbiased media we can trust.  Therefore, with these cases have not gone forward, I don’t think things have been thoroughly investigated.  As I recall, “standing”, aka timeliness was the reason for not going forth in several instances.  As I said, I will be communicating with my local state representative, who I happen know—-he lives near me.  That’s nice, kind of the way it should be.  I will ask about this as well as other issues regarding this election that raise red flags.  I will be doing this professionally, as a constituent, through his office.So I know him, it wasn’t a plan.  I still have a right as a constituent to voice my concerns.  As I said, it will be professional.  What recourse do you suggest for my concerns?I will, promise!Thank you for hearing me and saying others did too.  In addition to affidavits, I have concerns about how voting standards were changed within states without the legislature’s approval.  I will be writing to my local representative here in Pennsylvania and we need to do a better job with elections.  No flash drives pulled out of drawers, newly found ballots, or lax signature verification.  There was not enough advance preparation this time and there should have been.  That being said, we are moving forth and we will see what happens.  I want people to know that those of us who supported the President all have reasons within us that caused us to.  Being heard is so important, we shouldn’t be lumped into a category—-no one should.Because people marginalize us.  They seem to say in this thread somewhat, mainstream media and social media things like we are racist, anti-gay, anti working people and ignorant.  I am not on social media anymore and I am happier.  The people I know who support him do not fit in to these categories.  They are educated and believe in equality for all. This is my mission, to tell people what we believe in.  When politics was made personal it became personal.One other thing, marginalizing or “not hearing” all of the Trump voters is dismissing  a large segment of society.  It is not feasible with the continuation of US!  We will continue to be divided until we can address our wounds and heal.My dear James, I hope you realize I can be reasoned with.  I know we don’t know each other but I am giving an honest conversation.  I have questions about the past election, I think we didn’t insure enough safeguards and I will address it to the extent I can.  Now we have the results we do. Once shame on you, twice, shame on me.  I don’t mean that to you personally I mean that about these elections.The hope for the Republican Party (and certainly for conservatism in general) is to get rid of the. posers who think the path to the White House relies on Neo-populism of the sort that got Trump elected.  No more inflammatory talk about immigrants.  No more silly talk about why trade deficits are bad.  No more talk about US jobs going to China.  Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, et. al., know better; they're smarter than that.  But they believe their political future relies on picking up where Trump left off -- getting his core voters and then broadening, somehow, that base.  Especially after the events of last Wednesday, that gig is up.Oh, and perhaps learn to be respectful of those with whom we disagree.  Biden didn't get elected because of his vision for the future, or for his clearly-state political philosophy.  He got elected because he's (relatively) normal.Conservatives still have a compelling story to tell.  It will become more compelling after we experience the next round of tax increases, increased regulation and more wokeness that is sure to come.  The message has to be that limited government can work (with a safety net that is appropriate); that international trade is good for US workers and consumers; that over-regulation stifles innovation.And finally, conservatives (and the GOP) need to be able to answer two questions:  What is your position on health care?  and How do we fix our educational system?  Without good answers to those two questions, we will continue to be beaten up by those who simply promise more government.I saw this video on CNN yesterday and it provided some of the best insight I have seen in any media regarding the Trumpists' point of view.  The people are visibly angry and appear to believe they are doing what is right, rather than something cynical.  It made me think of US and other Western nationals who were convinced to join ISIS by reading material on the internet.https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2021/01/08/robert-moore-itn-news-inside-us-capitol-riots-ebof-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/erin-burnett-outfront/Beyond trump: for republicans to stop screaming about socialism.

"The Rise and Fall of Joss Whedon, and the Myth of the Hollywood Feminist Hero",-11.33,40.33,https://theattic.jezebel.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-joss-whedon-and-the-myth-of-the-h-1846288271,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-25,1,"In July 2020, actor Ray Fisher accused Whedon of being “gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable” on theJustice Leagueset when Whedon took over for Zach Synder as director tofinish the project. Earlier this month, Charisma Carpenter described her own experiences with Whedon in along postto Twitter, hashtagged #IStandWithRayFisher. OnBuffy the Vampire SlayerandAngelCarpenter played Cordelia, a popular character who morphed from snob to hero—one of those strong female characters that made Whedon’s feminist reputation—before being unceremoniously written off the show in a plot that saw her thrust into a coma after getting pregnant with a demon. For years, fans have suspected that her disappearance was related to her real-life pregnancy. In her statement, Carpenter appeared to confirm the rumors. “Joss Whedon abused his power on numerous occasions while working on the sets of ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ and ‘Angel,’” she wrote,  describing Fisher’s firing as the last straw that inspired her to go public.Buffywas a landmark of late 1990s popular culture, beloved by many a burgeoning feminist, grad student, gender studies professor, and television critic for the heroine at the heart of the show, the beautiful blonde girl who balanced monster-killing with high school homework alongside ancillary characters like the shy, geeky Willow. Buffy was very nearly one of a kind, an icon of her era who spawned a generation of leather-pants-wearing urban fantasy badasses and women action heroes.Buffy the Vampire Slayerpremiered March 1997, midseason, on The WB, a two-year-old network targeting teens with shows like7th Heaven.Its beginnings were not necessarily auspicious; it was a reboot of a not-particularly-blockbuster 1992 movie written by third-generation screenwriter Joss Whedon. (His grandfather wrote forThe Donna Reed Show; his father wrote forGolden Girls.) The show followed the trials of a stereotypical teenage California girl who moved to a new town and a new school after her parents’ divorce—only, in a deliberate inversion of horror tropes, the entire town sat on top of the entrance to Hell and hence was overrun with demons. Buffy was a slayer, a young woman with the power and immense responsibility to fight them.  After the movie turned out very differently than Whedon had originally envisioned, the show was a chance for a do-over, more of a Valley girl comedy than serious horror.It was layered, it was campy, it was ironic and self-aware. Itlookedlike it belonged on the WB rather than one of the bigger broadcast networks, unlike the slickly produced prestige TV that would follow a few years later.Buffydidn’t fixate on the gory glory of killing vampires—really, the monsters were metaphors for the entire experience of adolescence, in all its complicated misery. Almost immediately, a broad cross-section of viewers responded enthusiastically. Critics loved it, and it would be hugely influential on Whedon’s colleagues in television; manyarguethat it broke ground in terms of what you could do with a television show in terms of serialized storytelling, setting the stage for the modern TV era. Academics took it up, with the show attracting a tremendous amount of attention and discussion. In 2002, theNew York Timescoveredthe first academic conference dedicated to the show. The organizer calledBuffy“a tremendously rich text,” hence the flood of papers with titles like “Pain as Bright as Steel: The Monomyth and Light in ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer,’” which only gathered speed as the years passed. And while it was never the highest-rated show on television, it attracted an ardent core of fans.But what stood out the most was the show’s protagonist: a young woman who stereotypically would have been a monster movie victim, with the script flipped: instead of screaming and swooning, she staked the vampires. This was deliberate, the core conceit of the concept, as Whedon said in many, many interviews. The helpless horror movie girl killed in the dark alley instead walks out victorious. He toldTimein 1997 that the concept was born from the thought, “I would love to see a movie in which a blond wanders into a dark alley, takes care of herself and deploys her powers.” In Whedon’s framing, it was particularly important that it was a woman who walked out of that alley. He toldanother publicationin 2002 that “the very first mission statement of the show” was “the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.”That fact became intricately intertwined with Whedon himself. Seemingly every interview involved a discussion of his fondness for stories about strong women. “I’ve always found strong women interesting, because they are not overly represented in the cinema,” he toldNew Yorkfora 1997 piecethat notes he studied both filmand“gender and feminist issues” at Wesleyan; “I seem to be the guy for strong action women,’’ he told theNew York Timesin 1997 with an aw-shucks sort of shrug. ‘’A lot of writers are just terrible when it comes to writing female characters. They forget that they are people.’’ He often cited the influence of his strong, “hardcore feminist” mother, and even suggested that his protagonists served feminist ends in and of themselves: “If I can make teenage boys comfortable with a girl who takes charge of a situation without their knowing that’s what’s happening, it’s better than sitting down and selling them on feminism,” hetoldTimein 1997.When he was honored by the organization Equality Now in 2006 for his “outstanding contribution to equality in film and television,” Whedon  made his speech an extended riff on the fact that people just kept asking him about it, concluding with the ultimate answer: “Because you’re still asking me that question.” He presented strong women as a simple no-brainer, and he was seemingly always happy to say so, at a time when the entertainment business still seemed ruled by unapologetic misogynists.But Whedon’s real fall from grace began in 2017, right before MeToo spurred a cultural reckoning. His ex-wife, Kai Cole, published a piece inThe Wrapaccusing him of cheating off and on throughout their relationship and calling him a hypocrite:Despite understanding, on some level, that what he was doing was wrong, he never conceded the hypocrisy of being out in the world preaching feminist ideals, while at the same time, taking away my right to make choices for my life and my body based on the truth. He deceived me for 15 years, so he could have everything he wanted. I believed, everyone believed, that he was one of the good guys, committed to fighting for women’s rights, committed to our marriage, and to the women he worked with. But I now see how he used his relationship with me as a shield, both during and after our marriage, so no one would question his relationships with other women or scrutinize his writing as anything other than feminist.But his reputation was just too strong; the accusation that he didn’t practice what he preached didn’t quite stick. (A spokesperson for Whedon told theWrap: “While this account includes inaccuracies and misrepresentations which can be harmful to their family, Joss is not commenting, out of concern for his children and out of respect for his ex-wife.”) Many minimized the essay on the basis that adultery doesn’t necessarily make you a bad feminist or erase a legacy. Whedon similarly seemed to shrug off Ray Fisher’s accusations of creating a toxic workplace; instead, Warner Media fired Fisher.“I think Joss was, honestly, mad. I think he was mad at me and I say that in a loving way, which is—it’s a very complicated dynamic working for somebody for so many years, and expectations, and also being on a show for eight years, you gotta live your life. And sometimes living your life gets in the way of maybe the creator’s vision for the future. And that becomes conflict, and that was my experience.”In her statement on Twitter, Carpenter alleged that after Whedon was informed of her pregnancy, he called her into a closed-door meeting and “asked me if I was ‘going to keep it,’ and manipulatively weaponized my womanhood and faith against me.” She added that “he proceeded to attack my character, mock my religious beliefs, accuse me of sabotaging the show, and then unceremoniously fired me following the season once I gave birth.” Carpenter said that he called her fat while she was four months pregnant and scheduled her to work at 1 a.m. while six months pregnant after her doctor had recommended shortening her hours, a move she describes as retaliatory. What Carpenter describes, in other words, is an absolutely textbook case of pregnancy discrimination in the workplace, the type of bullshit the feminist movement exists to fight—at the hands of the man who was for years lauded as a Hollywood feminist for his work onBuffy the Vampire SlayerandAngel.Many of Carpenter’s colleagues fromBuffyandAngelspoke out in support, including Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar. “While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don’t want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon,” she saidin a statement. Just shy of a decade after that 2013 speech, many of the cast members on the show that put him on that stage are cutting ties.Whedon garnered a reputation as pop culture’s ultimate feminist man because Buffy did stand out so much, an oasis in a wasteland. But in 2021, the idea of a lone man being responsible for creating women’s stories—one who told theNew York Times, “I seem to be the guy for strong action women”—seems like a relic. It’s depressing to consider how many years Hollywood’s first instinct for “strong action women” wasn’t a woman, and to think about what other people could have done with those resources.  WhenWonder Womanfinally reached the screen, to great acclaim, it was with a woman as director.2/25/21: This post has been updated with a more accurate definition of Equality Now and the nature of the organization’s work.

The Sweep: Explaining the Biden Slump,0.0,38.0,https://sweep.thedispatch.com/p/the-sweep-explaining-the-biden-slump,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-dispatch-bias-reliability/,2021-10-12,1,"Democrats’ biggest pick up opportunity: Maryland.Republicans biggest pick up opportunity: Kansas.Open seat with the biggest fight: Arizona.Pennsylvania: “Democrats now lead Republicans in voter registration by about 632,000 people, down from 813,885 two years ago.”North Carolina: “Democrats’ advantage has shrunk by more than 140,000 since October 2019.”Florida: Democrats’ advantage over Republicans “has shrunk by more than 200,000 over the past two years.”The dramatic decline of ticket-splitting is disproportionately hurting Senate Democrats:“As recently as 2008, the correlation between how a state voted for president and how it voted in Senate elections was about 71 percent. Close, but plenty of room for candidates to outperform their party. In 2020, it was 95.6 percent.”Democrats may be at their high water mark:In 2022, Shor believes Democrats have a 50-50 shot at holding the Senate majority (I personally put it quite a bit higher than that). But if 2022 is a good map for Democrats and they still may not hold the Senate, 2024 is a disaster. “If 2024 is simply a normal year, in which Democrats win 51 percent of the two-party vote, Shor’s model projects a seven-seat loss, compared with where they are now.” Seven!The wokesters are pushing out the traditional base:According to Shor, the math is simple. “If you look inside the Democratic Party, there are three times more moderate or conservative nonwhite people than very liberal white people, but very liberal white people are infinitely more represented,” he says, “That’s morally bad, but it also means eventually they’ll leave.”Bad political slogans have bigger consequences:Schor points to Latino voters who moved to Trump in 2020 in the wake of the ‘defund the police’ slogan. As Shor tells it, the issue pushed voters to recalculate their voting behavior. “We raised the salience of an ideologically charged issue that millions of nonwhite voters disagreed with us on. And then, as a result, these conservative Hispanic voters who’d been voting for us despite their ideological inclinations started voting more like conservative whites.”Now here’s Chris to do a little soothsaying about why Biden’s approval numbers have been slumping lately.The world of political jibber-jabber isfrothywith talk about the dire poll numbers for President Biden. “Alarming,”saysPolitico. “Doomed,”saysReal Clear Politics. “Brutal,”saidCNN. And with good cause. Biden’s numbers are stinkeroo for sure. The currentFiveThirtyEightaverageputs Biden 4.6 points underwater: 49.2 percent disapprove, 44.6 approve.It’s not as bad as Biden’s predecessor at this point in his term; Donald Trump was 18 points underwater in the same average at this point in 2017. But given that Biden was 10 points on the plus side three months ago, it’s reasonable cause for alarm among Democrats. Unlike Trump, who was underwater less than a month into his term, Biden had been steadily popular until late July.There’s astrong correlationbetween presidential job approval and midterm election performance. Biden can certainly attest to that, having watched then-President Obama take a similar job-approval rating into the 2010 midterms and get absolutely shellacked. Biden didn’t have any coattails in 2020, so there are fewer easy targets for Republicans this time around. But Republicans only need five House seats to take control of the lower chamber. Margins matter in defeat, too. If Republicans gain two dozen or more seats, mostly adding moderates from swing districts, it would make it easier for GOP leadership to control their right-wing wackadoodles. Left-wing wackadoodles, meanwhile, would be stronger in a substantially reduced Democratic conference.Democrats are long shots at this point to hold the House, but Biden and other party leaders would much rather have Kevin McCarthy as a foil if he is doing do-si-dos for Jim Jordan and the House Freedom Caucus. A win would be better than a loss for Democrats, but a small loss would be better than a big one.That’s a long way of saying that the frothiness about Biden’s saggy numbers is not unwarranted, but should come with a little perspective. First, it’sveryearly. There is still time for at least two full cycles of Biden “the comeback kid” and Democrats “doomed” in the next twelve months. Republicans ought to be concerned that the malaise has come too soon and that Biden can recover.But the most important questions to ask about Biden’s six weeks swimming underwater are: Who and why?First, who are the voters dunking the president?This surveyfrom Pew Research captured the shank of Biden’s decline, from June to September. The groups with the sharpest downturns driving the 11-point overall decline: Women, black voters, voters under 30, voters who didn’t attend college, and weak Democrats. That last group is especially scary for Biden. The “lean Democratic” category are the ones he has to worry about staying home, and their estimate of his performance dropped by 21 points in two months.Or consider the most recent Quinnipiac Universitypollthat put Biden at a seasick 38 percent job approval rating—the one that drove some of the “alarming” kind of coverage. It showed a 4-point overall decline from September’ssurvey. While Biden did lose two points with independents, it was Democrats really driving him down—a decline of 8 points in a month.  The same outfit had Biden at 93 percent approval among Democratsin August. Biden lost 12 points with independents and 13 points with Democrats in two months. These are those “lean Democratic” voters Pew was talking about. While Biden can thank weakly affiliated Republicans and right-leaning independents in the suburbs for his 2020 victory, they’re not the ones driving his current doldrums. Self-identified Republicans were already at 6 percent approval for Bidenback in April. Their slide to 4 percent in the current poll is no big whoop.The second key question: Why are these Democrats and independents unhappy with Biden? If we think back to the Pew list of groups again. Women, minorities, voters with high school diplomas or less. These groups are all overrepresentedamong the working poorand among service sector workers. We are certainly talking about lots of folks who have struggled the most with the ups and downs of the pandemic economy and the mid-summer resurgence of coronavirus. In the Quinnipiac surveys, Biden lost 12 points with independents on handling of the virus and 8 points on his handling of the economy.This all tells us something not a bit surprising: The most lightly attached Democrats and Independents are frustrated with the state of things: high prices, a sluggish recovery, and continued restrictions. Less educated, poorer Republicans and Republican leaners were opposed to Biden from the start. Biden is in the dumps with the working class of the center-left, including a lot of black and Hispanic voters—typically the hardest voters to mobilize for midterms. Trump had his problems with the right-side version in 2018, and certainly Obama felt the pain in 2010.What that means is Biden needs the virus in retreat and the economy on the rise. Democrats will live or die next fall by public sentiment on those issues.This is why progressive Democrats holding hostage popular infrastructure spending legislation is such bad news for Biden. If the radical lefties sink the next round of spending in the name of fighting climate change, not only will the free money go away, but Biden will look weak and Democrats will look out of touch. This is also why clickbait Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz who are trying tostoke outrageover vaccine mandates that arequite popularare hurting GOP chances. Biden’s problem isn’t with being left or right. It’s in not being able to deliver on the basics of controlling the virus and boosting the recovery.Sarah, I wish I could find an easier way to find your email. A little late Halloween costume suggestion: 3 peas in a pod. The Brisket being the pod, of course!“  There is still time for at least two full cycles of Biden “the comeback kid” and Democrats “doomed” in the next twelve months. Republicans ought to be concerned that the malaise has come too soon and that Biden can recover. ”At least. Maybe a good 4 cycles.Great item but I have a nit to pick. I find the initial items about how I’d laws and mail in ballot measures have very little effect on turn out but differ with your final conclusion: “And, of course, if there’s no effect on turnout that also means there’s no discernible amount of fraud being prevented either.” I am not sure the facts, as stated, support this. If we assume that part of the motivation to commit fraud is the accumulation of power, wouldn’t they be just as inspired as a determined voter?Ok but then all these laws that are intended to prevent fraud are just ineffective. Which isn’t what their advocates are saying. So either all of their efforts have been pointless or all of their efforts have been pointless if you see what I mean:)And now I woke up in the middle of the night with your voice in my head saying, ”But are there enough of these to make a difference?” Lol!Yes, I see it.  I also see your point in general.  I am just having difficulty shaking it.  I used to work in a local government department.  During elections, we provided staff to do tech support for the polling places, connectivity, fixing printers, that sort of stuff, I volunteered over about 4 cycles. The shear number of out of state license plates (California) in the parking lots, of the 4 or 5 polling places I covered was just amazing.  I guess I am holding out hope that something that has or will be done in the near future reduces the spectre of fraud for enough of the public to ease the anxiety..Ugh! I need that bloody edit button, ID laws not I’d laws. 😔Oh... I would panic.  Especially given no more mail in ballots in swing states.We have more job openings than employees. A whole slew have dropped out of the labor market. Many have dropped out of the travel and leisure employment....Low paying being the likely culprit...So where are these people going to work once they re-enter? I diverge with Chris...A Left wing wackadoodle ""Green New Deal"" that raises gasoline, heating fuel prices even higher than they are now. Forcing people in to electric cars they cannot charge at their apt. complex and makes vacations arduous isn't going to endear anyone to Biden. I don't see warehouse workers demanding ""equity for the planet"" by their desire to give up their F-150's for a midsize e vehicle that costs $45,000. Biden ending of the Keystone Pipeline was not lost on people. Chaos in Afghanistan, chaos on the border, chaos in Wash. DC is not lost. His ducking of questions by the Press...and controlled appearances makes his competence come in to question. It is not as simple as the economy and virus.Thanks, another great analysis.We should also remember that hardly anyone actually voted *for* Joe Biden in the last election. Near as I can tell, the three biggest voting blocks in 2020 were 1) voting againt Trump, 2) voting for Trump, 3) voting against Kamala & the progs. I don't know if 1 in 10 voters had Joe as the primary reason they put the X in his box. Hell, I wouldn't be shocked to learn more Dems wanted Kamala than Biden. All of which means that voters have little buy-in when it comes to the man and his presidency, and are less likely to feel the psychological need to defend their decision by making excuses for him.If more Dems had wanted Kamala she would have been the nominee. I think Dems generally are more moderate than you seem to think they are.I don’t really comprehend not voting in a mid term. I tend to see most elections as choices that I need to make. However not everyone is like me and that’s okay.On the Wisconsin state story- “once-purple battleground into two states in one — deeply red vs. deeply blue”. Is there any state this doesn’t apply to?  Every city is blue. Every rural area is red.  There are no red or blue states. Just states where the urban population has eclipsed the rest of the population and states where the cities are too small and they don’t.That was my thought regarding Wisconsin, too.  I can come up with a few small exceptions, but  its certainly the general rule.I can't think of another source of political insights with writing this good. It's a pleasure reading your work, Sarah & Chris. Thanks!“wackadoodle” - is this a new kind of doodle that I’m not familiar with???Do they shed?"
The Worth of a Girl: ‘It is what it is’,-0.67,47.67,https://projects.voanews.com/child-marriage/english/region/usa.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2019-07-29,1,"Dyersburg, Tennessee, USAA few years ago, a gas explosion destroyed Katie Burns’ house. Gone were her wedding photos, although they would have been hard to distinguish from others of her at age 16. She wore a shirt and jeans rather than a wedding dress. There were no flowers.She was marrying Ben Burns, who at 30 was almost twice her age. She was what is commonly called a child bride.A few years after the wedding, Katie still doesn’t have physical proof of her marriage to Ben because, she says, “my sister stole my wedding ring.”To the United Nations and the U.S. State Department, Katie is a victim of human rights abuse. But what she did was perfectly legal and not uncommon in the Midwestern state of Missouri, where the marriage took place, just over the border from Dyersburg in northwest Tennessee, where she lives.More than 78,000 children in the United States are, or have been, married, according toa new report by the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.Missouri was then a common destination for child marriages because the state had no minimum age requirement. Only those younger than 14 needed a judge’s approval. In 2018, the state raised the minimum marriage age to 16. Tennessee still does not permit 16-year-olds to marry.Katie’s mother, Evelyn Montgomery, signed the marriage license only because Katie was pregnant with Ben’s child. Since she was younger than 18, Ben could have been charged with statutory rape of a minor.“I told my mom, ‘What am I going to do with a baby, and he’s in jail and I have no job?’” she explains.To Evelyn, marriage wasn’t the best solution.“But I felt at the time, it was the only option,” she says.“I don’t care what anybody thinks.  I love him,” Katie declares. The marriage has lasted for eight years. “It is what it is.”Katie kiddingly admits her husband is nearly as old as her father.  And she’s only five years older than his son from a previous marriage, who lives with them in a yellow frame bungalow along the railroad tracks on the outskirts of town.Fifteen-year-old Ashley Duncan was in her first year of high school in rural Steele, Missouri, and sitting on a school bus when her aunt came on board and told her, “Get off, Ashley, you’re getting married today.” Like Burns, she was pregnant.But she did not want to marry the 18-year-old father.“When the preacher was talking, and I’m supposed to say ‘I do,’ I said ‘I guess,’” Ashley says.Neither she nor her husband finished high school. They fought a lot and eventually separated.“When you’re young, you tend to believe people when they say they love you. And you tend to listen to people when they tell you to do things,” she says.Ashley loves her two sons, ages 8 and 9, and is raising them along with her boyfriend’s two sons, ages 5 and 6. She’s been separated from her husband for years but isn’t able to afford a divorce until he agrees to pay half the cost. Ashley wishes someone would have warned her about the consequences of underage marriage.“Now, I feel like I wasted so much of my life, and it really didn’t have to happen,” she laments.Both girls lost their childhoods. Katie says she misses playing softball and not having a care in the world. Ashley misses sleepovers with her friends.“After I got married, friends didn’t really come around anymore,” she says.Both Katie and Ashley were married at the Pemiscot County Courthouse in Caruthersville, Missouri, a city of fewer than 7,000 people. Caruthersville is located in an area of southernmost Missouri called the Bootheel because of its shape. The Bootheel, one of the poorer parts of Missouri, borders on three states, making it a destination for child weddings.Before they passed a tougher law in 2018 (the minimum age is now 16), Missouri had no conditions on 15-year-olds getting married, and required anyone younger than 14 to get a judge’s permission. Now, if one person is younger than 18 and the other is 21 or older, the state won’t issue the couple a license.County recorder Pam Strawbridge signed many marriage licenses in her 40-year career and hated to sign the ones she said were for “babies.” Strawbridge says her signature is on the union of at least one 13-year-old who came to Missouri to be married.“I just don’t think they are experienced enough. And they just don’t know marriage is supposed to be a lifetime thing,” she says.Katie and Ben Burns have a house filled with dogs, cats and even a potbellied pig. The couple’s spirited daughter, Zena, is now in first grade. Early marriage is not among the Burns’ dreams for her.“I should have waited,” Katie says. “You really do need to be 18, in my opinion. You need to be grown up.”The number of children married per 1,000, ages 15-17 years oldResearchers at the University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health found that approximately 78,400 children in the United States are or have been married. Their findings appear in the June 2018 issue ofPerspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Healthand attempt to highlight the full scale of child marriage in the U.S., and make U.S. estimates more comparable with those from other countries.Alissa Koski and Jody Heymann used data from 2010 to 2014 collected by the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey to estimate the average national and state‐level rates of children who had ever been married. The Census Bureau conducts the household survey annually, asking about the marital status of teens ages 15 to 17. The researchers found that an average of 6.8 of every 1,000 girls, and 5.7 of every 1,000 boys had been or were married at the time they were surveyed. Koski, the study’s lead, emphasized: “These estimates are based on survey data and come with some uncertainty.”"
How a Florida Sheriff harasses families: Watch the body-cam video,-12.67,48.0,https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2020/investigations/police-pasco-sheriff-targeted/body-cam-footage,https://adfontesmedia.com/tampa-bay-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,1,"Warning: Some of the videos contain explicit languageOver the past five years, nearly 1,000 Pasco County residents have been swept up in the Pasco Sheriff’s Office’s data-driven policing program. The program aims to use analytics to identify people who the department thinks are most likely to commit future crimes.Deputies create a list and “check on” anyone whose name appears. They knock on doors at all hours of the day and night. They look for reasons to write code enforcement citations or arrest the targets and their friends and family.“We’re bothering criminals,” Sheriff Chris Nocco said in 2011. “That’s what we do.”At least 1 in 10 of the program’s targets have been 17 years old or younger. Some had been arrested only once or twice. And the people deputies are bothering are often friends and family members.[Click to read the fullTampa Bay Timesinvestigation]Many of the interactions were captured on body-camera footage, obtained by theTampa Bay Timesthrough public records requests. Here’s what the video shows.This presentation is better with audio.Click tounmutemuteRio and his family didn’t understand why. Even the deputies conceded he only had one charge on his record, from when he and some friends stole two motorized bikes. He already had a probation officer checking on him for that.The deputies told him to stop hanging out with his “bad” friends. The department has told theTimesthat Rio was in a gang. Rio says he was not.When Rio was doing homework at his mother’s office in September 2019, the deputies hassled two of his sisters, who were 19 and 22 at the time. They threatened to write unrelated code citation fines unless the sisters let the deputies search the house for Rio.Deputies also visited the car dealership where Rio’s mom worked. They even checked his gym. During the coronavirus pandemic, deputies continued to visit and question Rio.Each time, Smith calmly explained that her son had moved away.They came again after that, department records show. Smith said there were more checks that weren’t recorded. Once, deputies handcuffed Smith’s husband and put him in the back of their squad car. After some time, they released him. They said they mistook him for his brother.Families who did not react so patiently could face life-changing consequences.Heilman was charged with resisting arrest and battery on an officer. She also was charged with providing false information about her son. Deputies told her family that she was arrested for driving away with the seatbelt violation. On the ride to jail, a deputy said she was arrested because she didn’t stop to speak with him.Heilman was released on bail. But two years later, while Heilman was fighting the charges in court, the deputies were back at her house.They charged her with felony battery on a law enforcement officer for hitting the deputy with the screen door. Because she was on probation for the previous arrest, she was ineligible for bail. She stayed in jail for 76 days before finally agreeing to a plea deal so she could be home for Christmas.Deputies arrested Dotson and two other family members who tried to help. One was a 20-year-old relative, who tried to move a decorative vase out of the way. Deputies said they were worried the woman was going to attack them with the vase. The other was Dotson’s son, who deputies said tried pulling them off her. None of them had been arrested before, they said. They all deny the allegations.Multiple deputies detained Da’Marion, even as Dotson explained that he is sensitive to touch. The teenager had a meltdown.The Sheriff’s Office called an ambulance for Da’Marion and had him taken for a psychiatric evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act. He was later arrested on auto theft charges.Months later, Dotson still feels unsafe. “Everywhere we go, they follow us around,” she said. “They sit here on the corner in unmarked cars like we don’t know their faces.”In the last five years, Pasco County sheriff’s deputies checked on people on the list and their families more than 12,500 times."

Elizabeth Warren: Senator From Massachusetts—or the Roman Empire?,10.0,31.33,https://gfile.thedispatch.com/p/elizabeth-warren-senator-from-massachusettsor,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-dispatch-bias-reliability/,2021-03-26,1,"Dear Reader (not including the guy in the Corolla who won’t get out of the left lane),Let’s start with something easy.Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted something really stupid.I didn’t write the loopholes you exploit,@amazon– your armies of lawyers and lobbyists did. But you bet I’ll fight to make you pay your fair share. And fight your union-busting. And fight to break up Big Tech so you’re not powerful enough to heckle senators with snotty tweets.https://t.co/3vCAI93MSTA U.S. senator says she wants to break up Amazon so that it won’t be “powerful enough to heckle senators with snotty tweets.”That would require alotof breaking up. Amazon could still heckle Warren at half its size—even at one-100th its size. Jeff Bezos could give away all his shares and open a frozen banana stand and he could still heckle Elizabeth Warren. You see, as Milton Berle never said, size doesn’t matter.Pretty much anyone can heckle senators on Twitter—and in person! It happens, like, 10,000 times a day. Businesses can heckle them too, and not just big ones. The owners of the Love Muffin Café or Four Seasons Landscaping are welcome to get involved.The interesting—and disturbing—thing about Warren’s far snottier rejoinder is that she seems to think this shouldn’t be the case. Indeed, she seems to think mere disagreement amounts to heckling. Still worse, she thinks businesses—nay, whole sectors—should be broken up so that they won’t have the temerity to disagree with a bloviating and demagogic senator. I wonder if Warren is offended when NARAL “heckles” Ted Cruz. I’m kidding of course—I don’t wonder about that at all.I’m sure Warren has lots of reasons for wanting to break up Big Tech, but she didn’t list them here. By her account she thinks insufficient fear of Elizabeth Warren, the Cambridge Slay Queen, is justification alone for swinging her scythe. That disturbs me far more than literally anything Amazon or Jeff Bezos have ever said or done.I don’t want to dwell on a tweet, but since I’ve been talking and writing about patriotism all week, I’ll use it to make a broader point.I’ve been rewatching the BBC/HBO TV seriesRome, and it strikes me how Warren’s reasoning is more fitting of a Roman senator than an American one. In Rome, being a senator didn’t so much confer power and status as confirm and maybe compound it (attention antiquity nerds: I know the Senate changed over time, work with me here). Talking back to a senator could definitely get you broken up—and I’m not talking about antitrust.Of course, in the grand sweep of history, Rome represented a great leap forward in civilization. The Romans regulated power to a much greater extent than many of the civilizations that came before them. Still, a lowborn butcher or stable owner would be advised to speak respectfully to a senator.In many ways, regulating power—political, not electrical—is what civilization is all about. For instance, the president of the United States is in one sense the most powerful person in the world. But while he can deploy staggering military might halfway around the globe, he can’t tell me to do a damn thing. At least not without a lot of paperwork, and even then it would be hard.Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Xi Jinping’s China don’t have presidents with defined powers, and neither do nations under the Divine Right of Kings—they haverulers. Now, Putin and Xi can’t necessarily do whatever they want, but what constraints there are on them aren’t legal or constitutional. They’re purely political. The calculation isn’t, “Do I have the power to do this?” It’s, “If I do this, can I get away with it?” Putin and Xi can have citizens killed. American presidents can’t. Yeah, sure, if they join a foreign terrorist organization and are hiding out on foreign soil, the president can get some paper moving and order a drone strike. But the president can’t at any time say, “That Goldberg guy sucks, take him out.”And United States senators? They make the president look like aninfinity gauntlet-equipped Thanos snapping his fingers by comparison. They have almost no formal power outside of the Senate. And when I say “almost,” I’m being extremely generous in case there’s something I’m not thinking of beyond special license plates, the power to nominate candidates to the service academies, and the ability to send out a lot of mail.Beyond that, a senator can’t do jack without the help of a bunch of other senators.I mean, yeah, in the actual Senate building they get to use special elevators and eat in an overrated dining room. But except for that stuff, they can’t dobupkis—and that’s in the Senate. Outside the institution, they’re just, well, people. If you ever meet a senator who says, “By the power of the Senate and the Constitution, I command you to give me that pizza!” you have every right to respond with, “Get out of my way, jackass.” While I’m sure the moment Ted Kennedy sawBravehearthe tried to invoke the right ofprima noctis, that’s not how it works here.Sure, they can be pests. They can slow things down. They can filibuster and ask for a reading of the bill.But think about that: The only way an individual senator can exert actual power in the Senate is bypreventingor delaying the institution from using its power more broadly. A lone senator can’t do anything to your way of life, but a lone senator can prevent—or at least delay—the Senate as a whole from doing something that affects your way of life. Everything else requires building coalitions with other senators, and even then, you still need the other chamber to agree and a president not to veto your scheme.That is a great and glorious thing. And it is just one more point thatAntony Blinken could have madeto the Chinese last week. In our country, we are citizens and not subjects. The government works for us, we don’t work for it.Which brings us back to regulating power: The best version of America revolves around the idea that everyone is equal before the law. Nobody by virtue of the circumstances of their birth gets better treatment under the law than anybody else. That’s why the Founders got rid of titles of nobility. That’s why slavery and Jim Crow had to be destroyed if America was going to live up to its ideals. Within institutions, there can be ranks and hierarchies. In fact, therehaveto be ranks and hierarchies for institutions to work. But your boss at work isn’t the boss of you outside work. In fact, your boss at work can be your subordinate in your bowling league, your church food drive, or yourWorld of Warcraftexpedition.Societies where power is transferable across institutions tend to be unfree and unjust. Think of it this way: If generals can give orders to soldiers and civilians alike, then the distinction between soldier and civilian is a fiction. If senators have power outside of the Senate, then they aren’t our servants—we are their subjects. The same thing applies for CEOs, celebrities, and everybody else. Parents have powers inside their families that vanish utterly outside the family. I can tell my kid to clean her room. I can’t tell your kid to do jack.There are lots of people who think their power and status should be transferable to every situation. Senators are sometimes famous for this. When John Kerry was a senator, he was a legendary practitioner of “DYKWIA” (“Do You Know Who I Am?”). Maybe there’s something in the Massachusetts water.Which leads me to one last point: The diffusion of power allows for the multiplication of identity, and having multiple identities is the secret to leading a fulfilling and fully realized life.When I say multiple identities, I don’t mean having a lot of aliases, different driver’s licenses, and fake mustaches. I mean defining yourself in many different ways and therefore having different sources of satisfaction. This an old hobby horse of mine, so I won’t rehash it all here again. Suffice it to say, you can simultaneously be the boss of a huge company and a servant to your church. You can be a low-level cog in a big company and the star of your motorcycle club or open mic night. I play a game on my iPad where there are dudes who have blue-collar jobs telling prosperous professionals what to do. It’s all good.But granting people real power outside their institutions and roles means denying power to others. If you’re powerful in every walk of life, that means someone else isn’t. That’s how aristocracies and caste systems work. It’s also how countries with single-party dictatorships work. That’s not America, that’snot even Canada.“Just now there was some buzzing in the back of the car, so Zoë immediately jumped back there to make quick work of whatever offending bug it was.

It Is What It Is,-30.33,18.0,https://institute.theroot.com/it-is-what-it-is-1844623551,https://adfontesmedia.com/root-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,1,"Tommy expected applause.Even though it was just a first draft, Tommy thought it was brilliant. Before reading his new piece of writing aloud to his captive audience, he believed his eloquent breakup letter could possibly change the future of everyone he knew. Of course, he also knew that he was smarter than all of the Black servants heconvened to hear him read his new political document, so he understood the confused looks. He was nervous about how his letter would be received but he still couldn’t understand why they weren’t clapping.Tommy noticed nearly everyone in the assembled audience stealing furtive, questioning glances at Sally, knowing she was the absolute favorite of the people Tommy called “his Blacks.” Sally raised her hand, asking for permission to speak.“When you say ‘all men’ does that include women,” Sally asked.“It is meant to encompass all human beings,” Tommy responded, confident in his brilliance.“So, do you consider Black people to be human?”“Of course,” Tommy explained. “My argument is an extension of the philosophy of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes, who believed that it is the natural state of man, as he said, ‘to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own nature; that is to say…’”“Yeah, yeah, I get all that,” interrupted Sally as the others shook their heads in affirmation. “So does that mean we are free?”“Not quite. What I was trying to say is...” Thomas began before Sally interrupted him again.“Does it mean I can say no when you drag me out of the basement tonight?” Sally asked.“Oh, hell no!” Tommy yelled as the others murmured among themselves. “First of all, I am the master; you are the slave. Secondly, what do you mean ‘drag?’ You come to my bed because you love me, right? I know you don’t have a choice in the matter because you can’t say no but I wouldn’t call it ‘dragging. I wish there was a phrase for that.”“Nigga please,” erupted Sally, to the shock and delight of her fellow enslaved Africans. “First off, the creator ain’t endowed you with very much at all. Secondly, you just said: ‘All men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’ So how you gon’ tell me I can’t say ‘no?’ Either you’re being a hypocrite or you think white people are superior to Black people. I wish there was a phrase forthat.”The awkward silence wafted through the warm Virginia night and pressed against the walls of the slave quarters as Tommy’s all-Black audience waited for a reply. Frazzled, Tommy glanced around the room where he had gathered a select few of his more than100 enslaved Africansto test the reaction to his new writing before sharing it with his fellow aristocrats. He placed his declaration on the podium, paused for a second and—bereft of words, a reasonable reply or any legitimate argument to contradict the impeccable logic Sally hadobviouslyabsorbed from him—Tommy improvised a response on the spot.“Well, Sally,” Tommy began, before condensing the callous haughtiness of a slave master, a rapist and political genius into five words. On July 3, 1776, Thomas Jefferson responded to the critique of Sally Hemings, his human sex slave, by offering the only excuse he could muster:“It is what it is.”Donald Trump expected applause.Privileged men always do.As the country under his control closes in on5 million infections and 157,000 deaths, Trump sat down for an interview with Axios’ Jonathan Swan (No relation toT.J.or “Black”) that aired on HBO. Trump appeared to assume Swan would congratulate him for bungling the worst American pandemic since Ashton Kutcher infected the country with the trucker hat outbreak in the early 2000s. But, when confronted about COVID-19’s rising infections and death toll, Trump seemed frazzled that Swan (no relation to thelake) didn’t just swallow the president’s dim-witted explanation like the fair and balanced journalists at Fox News.To acquit himself, in this specific case, the president didn’t pull out a bald-faced lie. After declaring that he was handling the pandemic very well, Trump instead pulled out a few charts that were apparently printed on the presidential inkjet printer because heobviouslycan’t be bothered with actually studying and memorizing the data on what has literally become the most important issue in the world.CNN reports:“I’ve gone to your rallies. I’ve talked to your people. They love you. They listen to you. They listen to every word you say. They hang on your every word,” Swan said. “And so when they hear you say, ‘everything’s under control. Don’t worry about wearing masks,’ I mean, these are people — many of them are older people.”“Well, what’s your definition of control?” Trump replied, adding: “I think it’s under control.”“How? A thousand Americans are dying a day,” Swan said.“They are dying. That’s true. And you — it is what it is,” Trump said emphatically. “But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we can. It’s under control as much as you can control it.”“It is what it is.”Dictionary.com says the phrase first appeared in a 1949 article in the Nebraska State Journal and came into popularity around the early 2000s, which is, coincidentally, smack dab in the middle of the trucker hat craze (I’m not accusing Kutcher of anything. I’m just saying). But, as a professional translator ofBlackanese,I contend that “It is what it is” is white people’s version of a phrase created in 1936 by beloved mother and usher board member Viola Rosa Johnson. When asked by her son, Lamont, why he had to take off his school clothes before he went outside, Viola created the precursor to “it is what it is” long before that white man from Nebraska when she answered:“Because I said so.”The phrase later evolved into a simpler form—“because ” and, eventually, “cuz”—before white people elongated it to a five-word collection of mouth sounds. However, this is not the first time Trump has shrugged off human death with the hollow phrase “it is what it is” as a reply to questions about the coronavirus.This vapid display of dimwittery is not Trump’s response to the problem that has killed more Americans in six months than the entire global conflict that was once referred to as “the Great War.” (More than156,000 Americanshave died from COVID-19 sinceFeb. 6.116,516 Americansdied in World War I.) “It is what it is”wasn’t justTrump’s riposteto U.S. intelligence reports that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia: “It is what it is” is Trump’s response toeverything.Immediately after he became president, he claimed thebiggest electoral landslide in American history, the biggest inauguration crowd and that voters had illegally cast ballots for Hilary Clinton, until he had toadmit that his electoral mathwas actually notwhat “it is.” He denied that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections to help him. When confronted withevidence to the contrary, Trump’s only retort to foreign actors manipulating the American democracy, was, in essence, “It is what it is.”Trump insisted there was no quid pro quo during aphone call with Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelensky, which eventually led to his impeachment. During his impeachment trial, Trump conceded that he made the call. He didn’t even try to argue that he wasn’t caught soliciting foreign interference in a U.S electionfor the second time. Instead, he insisted that the allegations may have been true, but they didn’t warrant him being removed from office. His entire legal defense was essentially a version of: “It is what it is”Writing forPsychology Today, Dr. Liana Gabora explained that she assumed the phrase was “an indication that the speaker is letting the thing exist in all its rich uniqueness without having to categorize it or analyze it.”The increased use of the phrase,” Gabora wrote “seemed to be a sign that people are increasingly comfortable with ‘states of potentiality,’ which are states that could ‘collapse’ to different actual states depending on the context” before she eventually concluded that: “[i]n some contexts, it can indicate acceptance of complexity and ambiguity. In other contexts, it can indicateacceptance of limitations. It’s a phrase that may well have yet other shades or meaning, or be evolving new shades of meaning.”I don’t know what the fuck she is talking about. But then again, neither did a certain psychology professor from the University of British Columbia named Liane Gabora.To be clear, “it is what it is” isnot an answer.It’s not an empty response or an insincere deflection.It’s not even a lie.The oft-used phrase is just a collection of sounds that come out of a person’s mouth when he or she doesn’t have a logical answer to a valid question. Anyone who says “it is what it is” is not smart enough to refute an assertion or guilty of the thing for which they are being accused. It explains everything and nothing at the same time, which is why “it is what it is” may also be the most American sentence of all time.How could a man proclaim “all men are created equal” while owning other men? Why is Terry Crews like this? How can racism still exist if every white person claims they aren’t racist? If numbers were invented to count things, why are there imaginary numbers? If America was created to “establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,” then why are police like this? Why isPost Malone? How can people vote for a racist as President of the United States and still say America is not racist?“It is what it is” are not just empty words used by our dotard president to whitesplain death. The phrase is America’s version of Shakespeare. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.Thomas Jefferson explained this nation’s foundational hypocrisy the same way America has historically whitesplained away the existence of inequality, which is also how Donald Trump believes he should be applauded for the current incompetence-fueled pestilence that continues to ravage this country:Because white people said so."
24-year-old White Mother Killed by BLM Thugs — Mainstream Media Silent,23.67,34.0,https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/36357-24-year-old-white-mother-killed-by-blm-thugs-mainstream-media-silent,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-13,1,"Copyright © 2024 The New AmericanThe mainstream media in the United States has almost completely ignored the story of 24-year-old Jessica Doty-Whitaker, who was shot in the head and killed by Black Lives Matter supporters in Indianapolis on July 5. What had young Ms. Whitaker done to incur the wrath of the “largely peaceful” BLM supporters? Allegedly, she was heard uttering the phrase “All Lives Matter” to a group of BLM supporters who, apparently, disagreed with her.On July 5, Doty-Whitaker and her fiancé, Jose Ramirez, were strolling with friends along the Indianapolis Canal Walk after a Fourth of July celebration when she and her friends ran into the BLM group. Allegedly, the BLM group heard someone in Doty-Whitaker’s group utter a racially-charged word — a slang term that supposedly means roughly the same as the “N-word.” The BLM supporters took umbrage and confronted Doty-Whitaker’s group. An argument ensued, and both sides drew firearms. When the two groups realized that the other was armed, the situation deescalated — seemingly. It was reported that the groups fist-bumped and separated.But minutes later, Ramirez reported that a member of the BLM group opened fire from a nearby bridge, striking Doty-Whitaker in the head and killing her. Ramirez admitted to returning fire but says he didn’t hit anyone.“[The situation] was squashed and they went up the hill and left, but they were sitting up on St. Clair waiting for us to come under the bridge and that’s when she got shot,” Ramirez said.The victim leaves behind a three-year-old son who doesn’t understand where his mother is.“She shouldn’t have lost her life. She’s got a three-year-old son she loved dearly,” Ramirez said. “It’s hard to tell him his mom is in heaven and if you want to talk to her you have to look up and say, ‘I love you mom.’”The victim’s father, Robert Doty, said that the confrontation occurred when the BLM group said, “Black Lives Matter,” to Doty-Whitaker’s group and that the young mother responded, “All Lives Matter.”“An argument started and guns came out, but they worked things out. Unfortunately, they didn’t drop it and waited for them to walk back through and she was shot in the head,” Doty told The Gateway Pundit.Surveillance videoshows a group running away from the bridge area at the exact time when Doty-Whitaker was shot.The victim’s grandfather posted on Facebook that “multiple black assailants” shot his granddaughter in the head, then lamented, “Why isn’t anybody outraged about this?… Is it that BLM was involved or that it was young, white adults [who were] the victims?Why, indeed. Local Indianapolis news has covered the story, of course, but national media has curiously ignored the incident. Fox Newseventuallyreported on the shooting, but only after being called out as one of the mainstream media outlets ignoring the story byThe Gateway Pundit.Doty told The Gateway Pundit that neither CNN nor Fox News has reached out to him for any comment on the killing of his daughter.On its surface, this story would seem to have everything the mainstream media could ask for: A racially-charged killing of an innocent young woman; grieving family to interview; the killer or killers still on the loose. They even have video of the aftermath of the incident, which they can run on a loop as a talking head blathers on about the senseless nature of such violence.Everything is still under investigation, and portions of the story seem incomplete and a little sketchy, but since when has that stopped the media from breathlessly reporting on a killing involving race? If you want examples, look at the George Floyd death or the Rayshard Brooks death or the Trayvon Martin death or the Michael Brown death. Media set up camp in Minneapolis; Atlanta; Sanford, Florida; and Ferguson, Missouri, while those cases were being investigated.So, why isn’t Anderson Cooper on the ground in Indianapolis giving us up-to-the-moment details of this case as it unfolds?Obviously, because the victim was white and the perpetrators are black. That said, the mainstream media want no part of this story. It doesn’t fit the narrative that they’ve created, that BLM activists are always in the right and are “largely peaceful,” and that white people are the cause of these incidents — never the victim.In 2020 America, national news outlets no longer report news — they manufacture it. AsProject Veritas’ exposeon CNN last year proved, network leaders such as Jeff Zucker set the narrative the network wishes to portray. Any incident that doesn’t fit with that narrative is brushed aside, ignored, and buried.Image: screenshot fromYouTube videoJames Murphy is a freelance journalist who writes on a variety of subjects.
