1,"'Imminent' Collapse at Florida Phosphate Plant Wastewater Pond Threatens Tampa Bay, Surrounding Neighborhoods",0.0,49.67,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-04-03-leak-at-florida-phosphate-plant-tampa-bay-manatee-county-piney-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-05,weather,25,"click here.A 20-foot-tall wall of water could be unleashed in minutes if the wall surrounding a phosphate wastewater pond breaches, a Manatee County government official said Sunday.About 306 million gallons of polluted saltwater remain in the reservoir that began leaking last week, Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said.At a news conference on Sunday morning, Hope said up to a 20-foot wall of water could form in less than an hour, based on models, if the pond breached.The pond was once used to store waste from a plant at the site that turned phosphate into fertilizer. Officials in Manatee County on Florida's Gulf Coast ordered residents of more than 300 homes near the site to evacuate immediately Saturday.""What we're looking at now is trying to prevent — and respond to if need be — a catastrophic flood issue,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at the Sunday morning briefing.DeSantis said the water is not radioactive, even though the gypsum stack that the pond sits on is mildly radioactive. The governor said the water is mostly saltwater from a dredging project years ago and the ""process water"" from the old fertilizer plant. That process water is high in phosphorus and nitrogen, nutrients that can cause algae blooms in rivers and bays.Much of the water has already been drained into Port Manatee, which sits at the mouth of Tampa Bay. DeSantis said pumps are sending 33 million gallons a day from the pond to the bay. He also said the Florida National Guard is flying more pumps to the top of the gypsum berm around the pond to pump more water.DeSantis and Noah Valenstein, the secretary of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection, said flooding is the biggest danger to the public now. Valenstein the primary focus is on directing a controlled discharge to an area where it will have the least impact.At a county news conference at 2 p.m. Sunday, Vanessa Baugh, chairman of the Manatee County Commission, said, ""Steady draw down of the process water has continued at Piney Point, and we have thankfully avoided uncontrolled breach that would have endangered people and property in the evacuation zone around the stacks.""Baugh also said drinking water in Manatee County and the town of Palmetto remained unaffected by the breach at the pond. She said the county utility system was a closed system and water from the pond could not enter it. She also said the county's main source of drinking water, Lake Manatee, was not affected. She added that private wells near Piney Point also should remain safe.Hopes, the county administrator, said at the afternoon news conference that the additional pumps should double the amount of water that can be pumped from the pond. He said if the work continues as it's going now, the danger might be over by Tuesday.On Saturday, Hopes said attempts to plug the breach overnight with dirt and stone failed.""Evacuate area NOW. Collapse of Piney Point Stack Imminent!"" read the alert from county officials about 11 a.m. Saturday.“There has beenfurther motion with the wall,” Manatee County Public Safety Director Jacob Saur told the Bradenton Herald. “We’ve ordered further evacuations and closed U.S. 41.”2020 Hurricane Season Had One Fewer Landfall Than Previously Thought)Hopes said officials think the water would flow to the north of the pond across low-lying areas and down into Tampa Bay. The collapse could also threaten other retention ponds on the site, Hopes said.DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Manatee County about 1:45 p.m. Saturday. He later expanded it to include neighboring Hillsborough and Pinellas counties.Officials first discovered a tear Thursday in the reservoir, which contained about 800 million gallons of water and waste productsfrom the manufacture of fertilizer from phosphate, according to the Bradenton Herald.The pond breached about 4 p.m. Friday, leaking water that contains phosphorus and nitrogen. Residents within a half mile of the reservoir, which is owned by HRK Holdings, were warned to evacuate. The evacuation order was expanded to residents living within 1 mile of the old plant about 7:20 p.m. Friday.Saturday evening, officialsadded another 316 homes and several more businessesto the evacuation area, according to WTVT.“What has been occurring in the past 12 hours is there are a number of small breaches in addition to what we believe is a significant leak at the bottom of the retention pond,” Hopes said earlier in the day.Officials tried to reduce the risk of a collapse by draining the wastewater. DeSantis said Sunday those pumps were pumping 23,500 gallons a minute, into nearby Tampa Bay. Hopes said additional pumps were pumping about 1,500 gallons a minute into the bay.The pond sits in large mound that is known as a gypsum stack that is made of phosphogypsum, a byproduct of the fertilizer made at the plant from the 1966 until 2001. Most of the naturally occurring radioactive uranium, thorium and radium in phosphate rockends up in the phosphogypsum, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The uranium and thorium decay to radium, and radium decays to radon, a radioactive gas.The wastewater inside the pond at the top of the stack is a mixture of seawater from an old dredging project, rainwater and the leftovers from fertilizer manufacturingthat can carry phosphorus and nitrogen, according to the Tampa Bay Times.Hopes said Saturday afternoon that snook live in the pond that is in danger of collapsing and he has seen ducks swimming on top of it. Two other ponds on the site have higher levels of the byproducts, he said.""The risk factor is the potential release of nearly 1 billion gallons of water,"" Hopes said.Wastewater from previous leaks at other gypsum stacks have caused fish kills and algae blooms. Phosphorus and nitrogen are nutrients that feed algae blooms and red tide.Matthew Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida, told Axios that releasing the water would affect Tampa Bay.""Algae blooms followed byfish killsare the most likely thing,"" Pasek said. ""It’s going to impact the food chain further down the line too. It’s unlikely to cause human damage, but there’s going to be a pretty stinky bay for a while.""The old Piney Point phosphate plant has threatened Tampa Bay before when polluted discharges flowed from the property, the Times reported.“We’ve certainly had similar concerns in the past but I think that this one is magnified because now we have the owners of the stack admitting that there’s a real possibility of a total collapse,” Glenn Compton, who leads the local environmental advocacy organization ManaSota-88, told the Times. “Hopefully they’ll be able to contain as much of the wastewater coming off the site as possible.”Florida has about 25 gypsum stacks that altogether hold about1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, according to E&E News.In 2016, a sinkhole opened in a stack in Mulberry, Florida, dumping 215 million gallons of wastewater into the Floridan Aquifer, a source of much of the state's drinking water.Mosaic, the owner of the gypsum stack, pumped as much of the wastewater back out of the ground as possible. After taking thousands of samples, the company declared there was no off-site contamination.In 2004, Hurricane Frances ripped open a gypsum stack in Riverview, Florida, and 65 million gallons of wastewater flowed into a creek leading to Tampa Bay.In 1997, a heavy rainstorm unleashed a spill at a gypsum stack near Mulberry, Florida, that spilled 56 million gallon of wastewater into the Alafia River,killing everything in its path for 42 miles, according to the Florida Phoenix. More than 1 million baitfish and shellfish, 72,900 gamefish and a number of alligators were killed.",2

As a result, I write about him more than most police chiefs in the country. Considering this is the same country with Portland and Chicago, that’s actually saying something kind of impressive.However, I also believe in giving credit where credit is due. Every now and then, a blind squirrel finds a nut or what have you and this time, it was Acevado who found it.In particular,he touches on a stark realityon why Democrats failed to flip Texas despite all the money spent on doing just that.Houston police chief Art Acevedo, who was previously the police chief in Austin, offered some ideas on Twitter for why Texas wasn’t won over by Democrats this time. In response to a statement about there being more Republicans than Democrats in Texas, Acevedo wrote: “Texas Democrats can thank ‘socialist democrats and defund the police crowd’ led by@GregCasar,@JimmyFlanniganand the rest of the AustinCity Council. Fact, Americans and Texans want better policing, not de-policing, and they don’t want anything to do with any form of socialism.”Texas Democrats can thank “socialist democrats and defund the police crowd” led by@GregCasar,@JimmyFlanniganand the rest of the AustinCity Council. Fact, Americans and Texans want better policing, not de-policing, and they don’t want anything to do with any form of socialism.— Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo)November 4, 2020Come ride with me in a marked police car and we can ask folks.— Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo)November 4, 2020Acevedo is not a conservative or a Trump supporter. On the contrary, he made news back in June when he appeared on CNN andtold the presidentto, basically, shut up about how to deal with protesters. And last year, Jazz wrote about Acevedogoing on a gun control rantafter four of his officers were shot. He definitely leans left and would probably be happy to see Texas turn blue.But even he considers Austin’s socialist city council members a bridge too far for Texas. And that’s not an exaggeration in this case. If you’re not familiar with Greg Casar, who Acevedo mentioned in his tweet, he’s a Democratic Socialist on the Austin City Council:It’s important we remember that there are divisions in the liberal ranks. The only thing they all agree on is how much they despise President Trump. That includes some like Acevedo who lean fairly far to the left but still aren’t going to support outright socialism and damn sure don’t want to see their police defunded.That might work in New York, California, or Massachusetts, but it’s never going to fly in Texas.Now, there are a lot of people who look at Texas as being more conservative and pro-gun than Texas really is. Oh, it’s both of those things, but there are states that are much more conservative and much more pro-gun. Despite that, though, Texas has a reputation.Another part of that reputation is a love of law and order. They like their lawmen there. Lawmen are part of the mystique of the Old West, a mystique that Texas has embraced completely.Defunding the police is never going to fly there.Of course, that’s not to say that Democrats would have fared any better without socialism or “defund the police” rhetoric. I’m not convinced that would have made a lot of difference, but it certainly wouldn’t have hurt their chances to at least appeal to more moderate centrist independents.Not that it matters, though. They did and it backfired on them spectacularly.",1

He also has a curfew and the government monitors his computer use.However, Pollard’s parole comes up for review by the U.S. Department of Justice every five years, and his five-year anniversary is on Nov. 21, saidDavid Schoen,a defense attorney not connected to the Pollard case who practices nationwide and has worked on cases involving government security clearance.Eliot Lauer, Pollard’s lawyer, could not be reached for comment.Pollard and his wife are eager to learn the government’s plans, especially because he longs to move to Israel and has already become an Israeli citizen, but they haven’t an inkling of what the Justice Department might do, said a friend of the family who talked with them Thursday morning but spoke on condition of anonymity.If the Justice Department makes no changes to his parole arrangements, Pollard could appeal to Trump for a commutation of his sentence, or a pardon. He could also appeal to the department itself, but going to Trump is the stronger strategy, Schoen said.Pollard’s allies are already trying to involve Trump, beloved by many Jews for moves he’s made related to Israel, such as moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.In 2017, Trump commuted the 27-year sentence of another high-profile Jewish prisoner, Sholom Rubashkin, the former CEO of the largest kosher meat-processing plant.“I think there is a good chance – based on his track record – that Trump may do something,” said Farley Weiss, president of the National Council of Young Israel. “There is no question that he has been the best president for Israel of any president in history.”Weiss asked deceased Sen. John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, to help Pollard leave prison on parole after he had served 30 years of his life prison sentence. Now he’s tapping his contacts again on Pollard’s behalf.Jewish supporters of both Rubashkin and Pollard claimed that their sentences were excessive. Farley called Pollard’s sentence a “miscarriage of justice.”Just before he was sentenced, Pollard tried to cast himself as a kind of Jewish patriot, the Forward reported, trying to help Israel by compensating for the American intelligence community’s failings.Others, includingthe Forward,have argued against leniency for Pollard.“Jonathan Pollard is not a Jewish martyr,”wroteNew Republic editor Martin Peretz.“He is a convicted espionage agent who spied on his country for both Israel and Pakistan (!) — a spy, moreover, who got paid for his work. His professional career, then, reeks of infamy and is suffused with depravity.”Stewart Ain, an award-winning veteran journalist, covers the Jewish community.

5,Deficits Likely to Be Bigger Than Biden’s Budget Projects,2.0,45.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/06/02/Deficits-Likely-Be-Bigger-Biden-s-Budget-Projects,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,thefiscaltimes,25,"President Biden’s budget request for fiscal year 2020 projects a $1.8 trillion deficit next year and annual shortfalls of more than $1.3 trillion over the rest of the next decade. Actual deficits could be even larger, writes Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center — and not because of some extraordinarily rosy economic assumptions, as has often been the case in the past. “Instead, Biden masked what likely will be the true increases in deficits simply by using standard Washington budget accounting and by assuming that all of his proposed tax increases will become law, when they almost surely will not,” Gleckman writes.He explains that Biden’s budget “makes two big assumptions.” One, as we noted last week, is that individual tax cuts in the 2017 Republican tax law will be allowed to expire as currently scheduled at the end of 2025. Biden has pledged not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year and he may not ultimately want all of those 2017 individual tax cuts to expire. Even if he does, many in Congress won’t. “In reality, Congress may allow some to expire but surely will extend many others,” Gleckman says. “And there is a lot of money at stake. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on theJoint Committee on Taxation’s 2017 TCJA revenue estimates, which assume the individual provisions do expire after 2025, suggests extending them could add close to another $800 billion to the debt by 2031.”The other questionable tax assumption in Biden’s budget involves corporate taxes. The budget assumes that his proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% gets enacted — even as some Democrats have pushed back on that hike and said they’d prefer a 25% rate. “Rough rule of thumb: That three percentage point difference would reduce projected revenue by about $300 billion,” Gleckman says. “Similarly, Biden’s budget assumes about $500 billion from changes to the taxation of US-based multinational corporations. The biggest single provision would effectively increase the global minimum tax on multinationals from 10.5 percent to 21 percent.” But the minimum rate is tied to the base corporate rate, and could ultimately drop to about 18% or lower. “Add it all up and that $2 trillion in new corporate tax revenue is likely to look more like $1.5 trillion or less,” Gleckman says.His conclusion: The 2031 deficit of 4.7% of GDP projected in the Biden budget is more likely to stay closer to 5% of GDP through the decade because revenues would be lower than forecast in the White House blueprint. Of course, Congress could still change that outlook by scaling back Biden’s spending plans or enacting some unanticipated revenue measures.Read the full piece at the Tax Policy Center.",2
6,Virginia’s radical Dems pass despicable bill that makes assaulting a police officer no longer a felony!,25.33,25.67,https://therightscoop.com/virginias-radical-dems-pass-despicable-bill-that-makes-assaulting-a-police-officer-no-longer-a-felony/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-right-scoop-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,therightscoop,25,"Virginia Democrats are making their mark on this anti-cop Black Lives Matter movement with an attack on police of their own:– The Virginia Senate passed a bill this week that would downgrade assaulting a police officer in the commonwealth from a felony to a misdemeanor.Senate Bill 5032 would eliminate the mandatory minimum term of confinement for “an assault and battery committed against a judge; magistrate; law-enforcement officer; correctional officer; person directly involved in the care, treatment, or supervision of inmates; firefighter; or volunteer firefighter or any emergency medical services personnel and provides that such crime can no longer be committed as a simple assault and must result in a bodily injury.”The measure to defelonize assaulting an officer was introduced by Virginia Democrats in July, following nationwide calls for police reform in the wake of George Floyd’s death.“Our constituents want change,” state Sen. Mamie Locke, a Democrat, said when introducing the bill. “We hear that loud and clear from them. They want policy change. They’re pretty much done with thoughts and prayers. They’re done with ‘one more discussion’ and hearing us say, ‘We’ll get it done.’ … They want policy change.”Currently, assaulting a police officer in Virginia is a felony punishable by a minimum of six months in jail.The bill will need to be approved by the House in the General Assembly before it goes to Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, for signature.Attacking police officers is their answer to so-called police brutality? Wake up Virginians, this is the horror show you voted for!This bill isn’t going to do anything but increase the attacks on police officers by Black Lives Matter/Antifa thugs! It will also create a loophole that can be used to claim thatorthat assaultisn’t really bodily injury. And if Virginia’s corrupt prosecutors, like the one in Portland, suddenly claim they aren’t going to prosecute misdemeanors, then it’s OPEN SEASON on cops for every to bit thug on the streets!Those in Virginia who still respect police officers need to pressure the GA not to pass this monstrous bill. And they should dare governor blackface to sign it. Because if they don’t and this bill passes, there’s going to be a huge police officer exodus in Virginia like they’ve never seen before.",0
7,The horror of the Confederate flag in the US Capitol,-4.0,36.67,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/07/opinion/horror-confederate-flag-us-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,bostonglobe,25,"As white supremacists stormed our nation’s Capitol on Wednesday, the text messages and e-mails were coming so quickly that it was just easier to copy and paste a form response to nervous friends, family, and loved ones: “I’m home safe. Thank you for checking on me. This is horrifying.”Like the rest of America, I watched the chaos unfold on TV. Although I was about a mile away from the Capitolbuilding, I feared for the safety of my colleagues and friends who were in the complex, as well as the thousands of staff — especially the Black and brown support workers — who dutifully keep the sprawling Capitol complex humming every day.AdvertisementWe never pass without a smile and sometimes a gentle nod that signals, “I see you, brother, I see you, sister.” This exchange is spiritually familiar to every Black Hill staffer who is accustomed to going long stretches without seeing another Black face in their workday. I feared for them on Wednesday.I’ve had the honor of working in the Senate for Senator Elizabeth Warren for over six years. I’m proud to be on her team. I’m proud to be Black in this space and in these halls of power. It carries a profound sense of duty and responsibility to my community. One that I carry close to my chest, because that’s how we work.One of the core philosophies of being a Hill staffer is to do the work quietly, in the wings of history. We are not in the spotlight. We support our bosses, whom the people elected, and help advance their priorities for the country and, in my case, for Massachusetts.The action is on the House and Senate floor. We are the supporting players, and most of us prefer it that way. But seeing staff fleeing a violent mob, hiding in barricaded offices, calling and texting loved ones to say “I love you,” just in case — the tragedy had moved to the wings. It was almost too much to watch.AdvertisementThis is the image I can’t forget.I’ve walked this hall 100s maybe 1000s of times w/pride & sense of duty around being a Black staffer in this space.But this message is loud & clear.Spent yesterday texting friends & fam I’m ok. Seeing this picture I realize. No, I’m not.pic.twitter.com/x7hGazMkHQThe image that shook me was the Confederate flag being carried confidently and brazenly through the halls of Congress. Historians have noted that not even during the Civil War did this violent symbol of white power and oppression penetrate the halls of our Capitol. And yet, a white mob had successfully and violently ushered this hate into the bowels of Congress. The chilling contrast between these images and the images of violence used against mostlypeaceful protesters for Black lives last summer was profound.Growing up in Georgia, I saw that flag several times a week in front of homes, restaurants, and stores as a symbol of hate that carried a simple message:Youare not welcomed here.But this was the first time I’d seen that message on display at my place of work. I’ve walked the halls of Congress so often that I probably take for granted how my very presence in the building is a miracle — the result of years of hard-fought civil rights victories and justice work. And consequently, a threat to racists and white nationalists who wish to take us back to whenever they perceived America was “great.”I spent most of the afternoon letting friends know I was OK and safe, but this photo made me realize, no, I’m not. And the rioters in that mob did not intend for me or my colleagues to feel safe.AdvertisementMy native state of Georgia proved this week what our civil rights giants, including fellow Georgians the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Representative John Lewis, told us: Progress is not inevitable, but it’s possible with lots of hard work. And this week’s historic and momentous elections of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to represent Georgia in the Senate allow me to carry a well of hope that it’s darkest before dawn.But Jan. 6 was an ugly day for our democracy and for our nation. It was also traumatic for the countless public servants who proudly serve without recognition or glory to keep our country moving forward.We are resilient. We will heal from this trauma together. We will get back to the quiet, important work of the nation. We will keep marching forward. But for now, it’s OK to acknowledge that no, we are not OK.Josh Delaney is deputy legislative director for Senator Elizabeth Warren.",1
8,A Utah inmate with COVID-19 has died as the virus spreads through the prison,-3.33,49.33,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/11/04/utah-inmate-with-covid/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,sltrib,25,"Editor’s note:The Salt Lake Tribune is providing free access to critical stories about the coronavirus. Sign up forour Top Stories newsletter, sent to your inbox every weekday morning. To support journalism like this, pleasedonateor become asubscriber.An 82-year-old inmate who had tested positive for the coronavirus died at the Draper prison Wednesday morning, prison officials said.He is the first incarcerated person in Utah to die after testing positive for the virus.Prison officials noted that the man had other “complicating comorbidities” that likely contributed to his death, and said a medical examiner will determine his cause of death.The inmate tested positive Friday, as part of mass testing after aninmate in the Oquirrh 5 unit complained of symptomsand subsequently was determined to have the virus.Prison officials said the man was found dead in the Oquirrh 5 unit early Wednesday. They said he reported no symptoms prior to his death.[Tell The Tribune:Do you know someone at the Utah State Prison affected by the coronavirus outbreak?]The Oquirrh area, prison officials have said, is where the “most medically vulnerable” inmates live, and where they have taken the greatest precautions to keep the virus out. Officials said Wednesday that medical officials will continue to “heavily monitor” this area as they react to the virus spreading within the facility.Prison officials did not release the name of the man who died, but said family members had been notified.The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, which sued prison officials in April over their coronavirus response, expressed frustration Wednesday, saying the prison and parole board still haven’t been doing enough to keep inmates safe, or release those that are medically vulnerable.“This was preventable,” said Sara Wolovick, an ACLU Equal Justice Works fellow. “This is precisely why we sued back in April. This is what we were trying to prevent.”The ACLU’s lawsuit didn’t go far, however. The Utah Supreme Court dismissed the litigation, saying the group didn’t have proper legal standing to bring it to court. Wolovick didn’t rule out the possibility that the ACLU will sue again, saying the prison still hasn’t taken the proper steps to respond appropriately to an outbreak that has spread throughout both its facilities.Wolovick said she didn’t know if the man who died had sought an early release, but said there are still elderly inmates and medically vulnerably people incarcerated who should be considered for release. She said the ACLU tried to ask prison officials to release some inmates on medical furlough so they would not be housed in communal living facilities, but the Department of Corrections didn’t respond to that request.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases have exploded at the Utah State Prison over the past few weeks. There have now been 572 confirmed cases at the Draper facility, according to the prison, and 22 at the Gunnison facility.The initial outbreak at the prison began in October, and was believed to be tied toa medic who treated several inmateswho later tested positive. While that outbreak was contained to one area, the virus has spread to almost every other housing unit — including Oquirrh 5, Promontory, Lone Peak and in at least three blocks of the Wasatch facility. Positive cases have also been reported in at least two housing units at the Gunnison facility.Family members of those incarcerated told The Salt Lake Tribune that their loved ones have been calling them in tears, saying they feel sick and haven’t been able to get any medication to ease their pain.Haylee Powell’s husband, who is in the Promontory section, tested positive Tuesday. She said he told her that he’s quickly become weak and has had pain in his chest and racking coughs. His bunkmate, he told her, had been curled up in a ball crying in their shared space.“He’s been in there a really long time, 13 years,” she said. “He’s a pretty tough dude. For him to cry to me, it’s pretty serious. I’ve never heard him cry. If they’re all just breaking down, it really says something to me.”",2
9,It’s Fight Night on Capitol Hill,-2.0,43.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/infrastructure-biden-agenda-fight-night-on-capitol-hill.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-10-01,nymag,25,"The conventional wisdom about House Democrats has long been that the left would fold in a fight with moderates over the size of social programs, making concessions to get half a loaf instead of nothing, as they have before. That’s not the case anymore.In the fight over Joe Biden’s agenda on Capitol Hill, the progressive caucus has stood their ground, with roughly four dozen members who are ready to vote down the moderates’ prizedinfrastructure billuntil abroader reconciliation billpasses. On Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders punted the infrastructure over the progressive holdouts. In particular, they do not trust Senate moderatesJoe ManchinandKyrsten Sinemato support a reconciliation bill and its $3.5 trillion price tag and see the bipartisan bill, which both support, as leverage.Leadership just made it official: no votes tonight. Have a good one, everybodypic.twitter.com/GE1LM5qtELThe House stayed in session late Thursday night as frantic negotiations were underway to find a formula that would allow Manchin and Sinema to support the reconciliation bill and thus free progressives to vote for the infrastructure legislation by Pelosi’s deadline of that same night. Negotiations continued Friday, with White House staff joining in, with the hopes of a deal being cut before the week is out.The left’s distrust of Manchin and Sinema had been fueled by the duo playing coy about what provisions, if any, they wanted to see in a reconciliation bill. On Manchin, at least, progressives have made some incremental progress. He made his preconditions for a reconciliation bill public on Thursday, saying he wanted $1.5 trillion in spending. Sinema has not made her demands public, although a spokesman for her said in a statement that she “continues to engage directly in good-faith discussions” with Biden and Schumer to “find common ground.”In recent days, members of the media have swarmedPramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, with the same intensity once reserved for a key moderate like Manchin. “Love it or hate it, Jayapal is the first Progressive Caucus chair to make the position relevant in shaping the debate in years,” one veteran Democratic aide observed with admiration.Their increased clout is a shift from the Obama years, which conditioned Democrats to expect the left to crumble under Biden during debates over Obamacare and the 2009 stimulus. “Some of our progressive values have become quite mainstream,” said Jared Huffman, a five-term Democrat from California. “I also think that sometimes in the past, our progressive community/caucus might have been treated as, or assumed to be, adversaries and outsiders and not had a seat at the table. And I think we’ve been treated as allies by the administration and by everyone else.”Progressives are also buoyed by the sense of fatalism in so many Democrats about their party’s chances in midterm elections and see the reconciliation bill they want as a rare chance to pass transformative social legislation before Republicans return to power.“For 40 years before Joe Biden took office, I think Democrats controlled the presidency, the House, and the Senate for four total years, two with Clinton and two with Obama,” explained Andy Levin of Michigan on Wednesday. “And, despite those four little years — and even during them — the working people of the country have gotten the short end of the stick, so that they don’t even believe in government. They are like, ‘What is government doing for me?’ This, the Build Back Better Act, does so much more for the people.”The situation in the Democratic caucus bears a resemblance to the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which notoriously tried to drag every key bill to the right and fueled government shutdowns and debt-limit standoffs in the process, against the wishes of Republican leadership. “The knock on the Freedom Caucus is they know how to start a fight but not how to end one,”Matt Gaetzof Florida, a member of that group, told Intelligencer. “The current energy from progressives seems to suggest that they will end it, they will bring down the infrastructure bill if it doesn’t pave the way to their spending ambitions.”The lessons from the right go both ways, according to Gaetz. “The progressives trying to get their way now have observed the flaws that the Freedom Caucus used to try to get their way on health care,” he said. “The Freedom Caucus fundamentally ended up empowering McCain in the end to kill [Obamacare repeal] and I don’t think progressives want to do that with Manchin and Sinema.”By submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us.",1

12,NOLA Public Schools offers guidance to parents preparing for 'a school year like no other',0.0,55.67,https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_17d6cb5c-d1d1-11ea-a12e-675e0669f94c.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/nola-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,nola,22,"Defending his decision to start the school year remotely, NOLA Public Schools Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr. said in a virtual meeting Wednesday that parents can expect ""high standards"" from local public and charter schools when classes resume starting next week, despite the fact that it would be ""a school year like no other.""The district's schools will be implementing one-to-one, in-person orientations; virtual open houses and a district-wide hotline to call for help to give ""students and families what they need to start the school year off right,"" Lewis said.To make the school year easier on parents, Orleans Parish School Board President Ethan Ashley recommended that families test all technology before school begins and that they stay up to date with the independent charter organizations in charge of implementing remote plans for families.""I can't stress this enough,"" Ashley said. ""Be in close contact with your schools.""Schools are set to begin starting the week of Aug. 3, although specific dates vary by charter.The update was given a week after the district and Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that the roughly 80 charter schools authorized by the district — as well as the now direct-run school, Mary D. Coghill — would have a virtual start amid increasing coronavirus cases in Orleans Parish.The update also came a day after district officials admitted they were still grappling with the fact that about 20% of the district's nearly 45,000 students lack internet access as remote learning looms.Dina Hasiotis, the district's school support and improvement officer, said that works out to about 9,000 students, and officials said they were still also working to get computers in the hands of every student.""Schools are closing that gap daily as they purchase hotspots and other tools,"" Hasiotis told the OPSB in a committee meeting Tuesday.Lewis, Hasiotis and others acknowledged that there had been looming questions after the July release of the district's""Roadmap to Reopening"" plan, which called for a mix of remote and in-person learning when schools resume in-person instruction.This week, they pointed to supplemental resources that offered at least some answers.Among other things, the guidanceoffers a distance learning toolkit for families,including on-demand extracurricular programming from the New Orleans Recreation Department Commission, World Health Organization tips on ""parenting 24/7"" and more.There is alsosupplemental guidancethat includes a screening tool to see if students need extra help to catch up to grade level and resources for English language learners and students with disabilities.The guidance also givesinstructions to schools for when kids do return,which could happen after Labor Day if the city is in Phase 2 and meets certain health requirements, including a sustained period of less than 50 new COVID-19 cases a day.Among the biggest questions, officials noted, was: When schools do return, what happens if someone gets sick or comes into contact with someone who caught the coronavirus?In response, the district is calling on schools to do daily health screenings and to immediately isolate children or staff who exhibit 100.4 fever or above.If a coronavirus case is confirmed, a school should notify the Louisiana Department of Health. Then, all students and staff who have been in a classroom with a confirmed case or had close contact are to quarantine at home for at least 14 days, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, officials said. ""Close contact"" is defined as being within six feet for at least 15 minutes.“We have specific protocols for our schools to follow in those instances that have been vetted by our medical advisors,” Hasiotis said.The safety portion of the guidance also offers tips on how to properly wear face masks, which are required of most students under district rules.It says to provide clear masks for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, and that children shouldn't wear face masks at all if they have trouble breathing with it on, if it gives them anxiety attacks or if they are are likely to increase exposure ""because they are touching their face more frequently.""The guidance also advised that classrooms should be composed of either ""static groups"" of teachers and students that remain together all day or groups of students who stay together as they transition to different teachers.To help implement these rules, the district is holding multiple training sessions for teachers, staff and nurses, officials said, including some in partnership with Children's Hospital.The district was also giving remote therapy and mental health support for students who need it and educating school staff on the legal implications of the virus, Hasiotis said.Earlier in July, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards signed into law H.B. 59, a bill that provides schools with immunity from COVID-19-related litigation.",2

The longer action is delayed, the greater and more drastic the changes will have to be.”The GAO report also said that, while it will take more than executive action to put the country on a more sustainable fiscal path, there are steps that executive branch agencies can take to contribute, including reining in improper payments (about $150 billion in 2018); improving collection of owed taxes (a gap of about $400 billion a year); streamlining government to eliminate fragmentation, overlap and duplication; and improving the government’s financial statements and keeping closer tabs on tax expenditures.Some key details and charts from the new report (there’s also a shortpodcastwith Susan Irving, GAO’s expert on debt and fiscal issues!):The ratio of debt held by the public to GDP is set to surpass its 1946 high of 106 percent within 13 to 20 years, compared to a 14-to-22-year timeframelast year.Health care and net interest costs remain the primary spending-side drivers of the debt, with health care spending projected to continue growing faster than GDP and interest payments on pace to exceed defense spending in less than a decade.",2

15,Ron DeSantis issues executive order banning 'vaccine passports' in Florida,-6.0,47.33,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/florida-vaccine-passports-banned-ron-desantis,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-02,theguardian,25,"Floridagovernor Ron DeSantis on Friday announced an executive order banning “vaccine passports” in the state, which like the rest of the US continues to suffer under theCovid-19pandemic.“Today I issued an executive order prohibiting the use of so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports,” Desantissaidon Twitter. “The legislature is working on making permanent these protections for Floridians and I look forward to signing them into law soon.”Companies around the world areworking to developsuch “passports”, secure records of vaccination against Covid-19 that might be used to help society and businesses return to full operation by managing entry to buildings or events. New York state haslaunchedits own version.But the Florida governor’sorderclaimed “requiring so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life – such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant or going to a movie theater – would create two classes of citizens”.The order says the prohibition is therefore “necessary to protect the fundamental rights and privacies of Floridians and the free flow of commerce within the state”.It also says “noFloridagovernment entity” or its officials “shall be permitted to issue vaccine passports, vaccine passes, or other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying an individual’s Covid-19 vaccination status to a third party, or otherwise publish or share and individual’s Covid-19 vaccination record or similar health information.”Despite the order’s line about protecting the “free flow of commerce”, DeSantis’s order also says business are “prohibited from requiring patrons or customers to provide any documentation certifying Covid-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the business”.Vaccine passports have become the latest flashpoint in increasingly politicized battles over coronavirus policy.Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial far-right Georgia Republican, has said vaccine passports are Joe Biden’s “mark of the beast”, the Hillreported. She has alsointroduceda bill to ban such passports and fire Dr Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser.In the mainstream of the Republican party, DeSantis has emerged in many eyes asthe heir to Donald Trump’s throne, should the former president not run again in 2024.Many observers and proponents of vaccine passports have pointed out that some countries already require documentation of yellow fever vaccination for entry.

18,What the Ben & Jerry’s Decision Reveals About Israel,-12.0,35.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/07/ben-jerrys-decision-israel-settlements/619537/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,theatlantic,25,"Backlash to the ice-cream maker’s decision to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies has shown that, for many Israelis, the distinction no longer exists.No company does progressive politics quite like Ben & Jerry’s. The Vermont-based ice-cream maker has a reputation forcorporate activism, owing to its support for a wide array of left-wing causes, including marriage equality, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter. But when the companyannouncedthis week that it will no longer sell its products in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, it faced an outcome that every ice-cream maker fears most: a meltdown.The matter of Israel’s settlements, which the international community regards as illegal under international law but which the Trump administration said will need to be resolved through a political and not a judicial process, has long been a thorny issue in Israel. (The Biden administration has yet to articulate its own policy on this.) When it comes to ice cream, though, the country’s notoriously fractious political sphere is virtually unanimous. Israel’s right-wing prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said that Ben & Jerry’s has decided to brand itself as an “anti-Israel ice cream.” His centrist coalition partner, Yair Lapid, called the move a “shameful surrender to anti-Semitism.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog of the center-left, who oncecommitted to removingIsraeli settlements in the West Bank, called Ben & Jerry’s decision to shun them “a new kind of terrorism.” The newly minted opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,suggestedthat Israelis should boycott the brand. One centrist cabinet minister dutifully posteda TikTokof herself chucking a pint of what looked like Dulce de Leche into the trash.That an ice-cream maker could cause such an uproar at the highest levels of Israeli politics says a lot about how sensitive Israel is to the very notion of boycotts against it—even those that, like Ben & Jerry’s, are limited in scope. More fundamentally, the dustup reveals a growing divergence between how the world sees Israel and how the country sees itself. While the international community, including the United States, continues to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies, the reaction to the Ben & Jerry’s decision has shown that, as far as many Israeli politicians are concerned, that distinction no longer exists.On its face, Ben & Jerry’s move to end its business in the occupied territories, which the company described as being inconsistent with its values, poses an arguably negligible problem for Israel from a practical standpoint—one that would affect, at most, the roughly 6 percent of the population living in one of the country’s sprawling settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which have been under Israeli control since 1967. Ben & Jerry’shassaidthat it will continue to sell its products in Israel itself. Both Ben & Jerry’s and its parent company,Unilever, declined to comment further, but the implications of the move are clear: While Israeli citizens living in settlements such as Ariel and ​​Ma’ale Adumim may no longer be able to buy Chunky Monkey in their local supermarket, they can find it nearby. (The same cannot be said for Palestinians in the West Bank, who are not afforded the same right to freedom of movement.)In other words, Ben & Jerry’s decision “has no material impact on Israel whatsoever,” Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israel-based pollster and political strategist, told me. But it does have a political one—and, to the Israelis who feel the need to defend their sovereignty, an existential one. By ending its business in the occupied territories, the company has effectively refused to profit from or legitimize the status quo in the region, a status quo that Israel is deeply invested in protecting. It has also made clear that it will recognize Israel only within its democratic borders. “It’s all symbolic,” Scheindlin said, “but symbolism is huge.”Why does Israel care about what an American ice-cream brand thinks of its policies? When I put this question to Scheindlin, she told me that for many Israelis, criticism of Israeli policy is often conflated with an existential threat to Israel itself. To hear many Israeli politicians tell it, “criticism from abroad of our policies is anti-Israel, it’s anti-Zionist, and it’s anti-Jewish, or anti-Semitic,” Scheindlin said. “And that’s really the narrative that we’ve been hearing.” There is also the fear that what started with Ben & Jerry’smight not end there; once one company boycotts Israeli settlements, what’s to stop others from joining it?Not all Israelis subscribe to this view, of course. Those on the left, including members of the Meretz Party, havedefendedBen & Jerry’s. But these voices have largely been drowned out by the uproar of the majority.Read: ​​Why an effort to thwart some boycotts of Israel fails the free-speech testNot doing business in the settlements isn’t a new concept. Indeed, much of the Zionist left—includingMeretz, the left-wing advocacy groupPeace Now, and the prominent American Jewish commentatorPeter Beinart—have advocated settlement boycotts for years. Activists within the Palestinian-ledBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions(BDS) movement, which calls on countries and organizations to sever financial ties with Israel as a means of applying economic and political pressure on the country to end its occupation, have been doing so for even longer. (Unlike BDS, which targets Israel writ large, Ben & Jerry’s decision was limited in scope—a distinction that meant little to theIsraeliandU.S. officialswho erroneously conflated them. Although the BDS movementwelcomed the news, it would have preferred that Ben & Jerry’s end its operations in all of Israel, not just the occupied territories.)Relatively few international corporations have actually followed through with the BDS call, however, which is why when one as high-profile as Ben & Jerry’s finally did, followingpressure from pro-Palestinian activists, it led to such an uproar. (A notable exception is McDonald’s Israel, whose chief executive, Omri Paden, an Israeli citizen and a founding member of Peace Now,refused to open any branchesin the West Bank.) But Israel’s reaction speaks to more than just its particular sensitivity to outside criticism. Not long ago, Israeli politicians would openly say that the country’s settlement policythreatened its long-term security, as well as its prospects for peace with its neighbors. But under the leadership of the country’s recently deposed prime minister, Netanyahu, those voices became quieter as the Israeli government went to great lengths to normalize the occupation and expand the country’s settlement enterprise.Netanyahu is no longer in power, but the fact that lawmakers across the political spectrum are united on this issue is a feat in itself, given thefractious nature of Israeli politics. “It really is very much a reflection that the Israeli consensus is that there is no ‘green line,’ there is no occupation, there is no occupied territory,” Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group, told me. “There’s just one big lump of land that is under Israeli sovereignty, and not doing business in any part of it is somehow anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.”Read: A new word is defining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in WashingtonRegardless of whether Ben & Jerry’s sticks with its decision (or whether it succumbs to pressure to reverse course,as has happened with other companies), it has already revealed the extent to which Israeli leaders across the political spectrum support the de facto,if not de jure, annexation of the occupied territories by Israel. Despite Israel’s newgovernment of change, much remains fundamentally the same.“The right to the left all kind of agree that the facts on the ground are what they are,” Zonszein said, “and they’re not planning on changing.”",1

But with home prices hitting record highs, demand for single-family rental homes is soaring – and so are the rents.Single-family rents were up 5.3% year over year in April, rising from a 2.4% increase in April 2020, according to CoreLogic. That is the largest gain in nearly 15 years.Rents for single-family detached homes (not townhomes), were up an even stronger 7.9% compared with a year ago, as millennials in particular seek more outdoor space. Nearly half of millennials surveyed by Corelogic, and 64% of baby boomers, said they, ""strongly prefer"" to live in a single, stand-alone home.""Single-family rent growth showed a strong rebound in April 2021 with all price tiers back above their pre-pandemic rent growth rate,"" said Molly Boesel, principal economist at CoreLogic. ""While rent growth slowed last April at the start of the pandemic, the rate of rent growth this April was running above pre-pandemic levels even when compared with 2019 and shows no signs of diminishing.""The rent gains are across all price categories, even low end, which exceeded pre-pandemic rent increases for the first time. By category, the gains are as follows:·(75% or less than the regional median): 3.9%, up from 3.2% in April 2020·(75% to 100% of the regional median): 4.8%, up from 2.5% in April 2020·(100% to 125% of the regional median): 5.1%, up from 2.3% inApril 2020·(125% or more than the regional median): 6.1%, up from 2.2% in April 2020Regionally, by top 20 metropolitan markets, rent gains were highest in Phoenix, where single-family rents were 12.2% higher than a year ago. Next, Tucson, Arizona, with a gain of 10.6%. That was followed by Las Vegas at 9.3%. Atlanta, which had the lowest unemployment rate of the 20 metros, came in fourth at 9.1%.On the flip side, Boston saw an annual decline of 5.9% in rent prices and has experienced the largest decrease of the 20 metropolitan market rent prices for nine straight months. Chicago was the only other decliner, at 2.6%.With home prices continuing to gain at a double-digit pace, and more potential buyers being priced out, demand for single-family rentals is unlikely to cool anytime soon.""The inflation that is currently here is slowing the most interest rate sensitive part of the economy, that being housing,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group.",2

22,Aspen-area party businesses warned not to violate health order,-1.0,46.33,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-area-party-businesses-warned-not-to-violate-health-order/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-23,aspentimes,15,"Now that indoor private parties and gatherings have been prohibited through the holiday season, area businesses that service said soirees should take note.Pitkin County public health officials signaled a willingness this week to punish party rental outfits, caterers, parking valets and others who make their living off the Aspen area’s traditionally numerous private holiday parties and events.“It’s something we will be looking at,” Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock told county board members Tuesday. “(But) private gatherings, frankly, are hard to catch.”Markey Butler, chair of the Pitkin County’s health board, said Monday that catering companies that serve private parties this holiday season in violation of public health orders need to be told “we will yank their (business) licenses.”“That’s a tough message,” said the former Snowmass Village mayor. “I’m not real excited about having a lot of indoor events.”Aspen City Councilwoman Ann Mullins, an alternate health board member, said at Monday’s board meeting she’s seen party rental trucks in her neighborhood recently.“One truck asked for directions and I refused to give them,” she said.Pitkin County Commissioner Patti Clapper said Tuesday that parking companies need to be notified of the health order rules and possible consequences for violating them.“Without enforcement, we really are not protecting the public health,” she said.Health board members decided Monday that Pitkin County’s status on the state’s COVID-19, color-coded restriction levels would remain at the Orange level. However, theboard voted to voluntarily implement most Red level restrictionsin the county — with two significant exceptions — starting Tuesday and lasting until at least Jan. 4.Board members agonized over the decision for two-and-a-half hours before deciding that remaining in Orange would allow more local control over restrictions. Moving to Red, they determined, would not provide the wiggle room they wanted when they allowed restaurants to continue at 25% capacity and already-permitted indoor events through Jan. 4 to move forward. In addition, once in Red, the county might find it difficult to get out of it.Board members called the new restrictions “Orange-plus-plus.” They do not allow indoor gatherings at all and require visitors and residents alike to socialize only with members of the same household whether in restaurants, hotels or private residences.Still, COVID-19 infection in Aspen and Pitkin County remained rampant Tuesday, and the state could move the county involuntarily into the Red zone if one of two other metrics — hospitalizations and the positivity rate — rise to Red levels.Pitkin County’s incidence rate— which jumped again Tuesday to 1,509 — is the main concern and the metric that prompted the hand-wringing at Monday’s meeting. The highest rate allowed under Red level restrictions is 350.More than a quarter of the county’s 873 positive COVID-19 cases since March 1 have come in the past two weeks. The positivity rate was at 9% Tuesday, which was increasing but still in the Yellow level.One person with COVID symptoms was admitted to Aspen Valley Hospital on Monday, according to local epidemiology data. That remained in the comfortable level, though if three local residents are hospitalized in a day the state would move the county to Red.The concern over what to do about the county’s growing infection rate — termed both “astronomical” and “exponential” Monday by the interim public health director — triggered a health board discussion about enforcement that spilled over into Tuesday’s Board of County Commissioners meeting.On Monday, Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman, also a board of health member, said he wanted to talk about a letter written by fellow health board member Dr. Tom Kurt on the subject of deputizing local public health order compliance officers. The suggestion prompted a strong reaction from Mullins.“I really do not support the idea of deputizing (compliance officers),” she said, citing the large amount of training police officers and sheriff’s deputies receive. “I have strong reservations about deputizing anybody who wants to come out.”Poschman shot back that he “wasn’t suggesting we just pull people off the street,” and Tuesday at the commissioner meeting groused that his idea had been shut down so quickly.“(Leadership on compliance) will have to come from this board,” he said.Just one business in town has faced serious consequences for defying public health orders during the entire pandemic, and that owner received only “a slap on the wrist,” Poschman said.“I heard he had a party on his rooftop the other night,” he said of the defiant business owner. “We need to make an example of someone before people take this seriously.”Peacock said public health officials have heard similar rumors about a party, though in a subsequent interview said he had no concrete information other than it may have occurred last weekend.Clapper proposed that compliance officers be able to shut down a non-compliant business or restaurant on the spot. Commissioner George Newman, however, said that could put a civilian in a “precarious and possibly harmful situation,” and said police must be called in the case of an immediate shut down.Commissioner Kelly McNicholas Kury asked if rangers working with the county’s Open Space and Trails program could be moved into public health order compliance duties while their ranger jobs are curtailed during winter. Peacock said he’d look into it, though he also pointed out that the county plans to spend $146,000 doubling the number of consumer protection compliance officers in the coming weeks.With the vaccine beginning to be administered, it’s unclear how long those new temporary workers will be needed, Peacock said Tuesday.“But even if we hired 25 new people … we can’t police everyone all the time, and we shouldn’t have to,” he said.Poschman on Monday also proposed a Pitkin County-wide curfew that would apply to everyone, not just businesses. He said he knew such action would be complicated, unfair and unenforceable, but felt it was nonetheless necessary.“I think we have to do this,” he said.Michael Goldberg, owner of Belly Up and Matsuhisa, said the idea had the support of some in the business community. Rather than “dumping people on the streets at 10” with nowhere to go, a full curfew leaves them no alternative but to go home, Goldberg said.Aspen Mayor Torre and Snowmass Village Mayor Bill Madsen wondered how a blanket curfew would be enforced. Madsen said the idea would need “buy-in” from the community because no municipality is going to send police officers chasing people around for curfew violations.Peacock said Tuesday that the county attorney’s office also says a blanket curfew might not be enforceable. Further, in order for one to be implemented, officials must establish direct evidence showing it will bring down the infection risk, he said.One area of voluntary compliance that appears to be catching on is Pitkin County’straveler affidavit program.The effort requires overnight visitors to Aspen and the county to fill out an online form attesting that they have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of traveling here. Residents who have been gone more than 10 days also must fill out the affidavit.Since the program began Dec. 7, more than 9,400 people have submitted the forms as of Tuesday morning, Peacock said.“I’m pleasantly surprised,” he said. “When we were rolling it out, we felt we would achieve a voluntary level of compliance, and I think we are getting that.”Poschman said he’s heard from one traveler who canceled plans here when a member of the traveling group who was asymptomatic tested positive for the virus. He said he expected the person to be angry, and was relieved to find they were grateful.Those canceling reservations because of the affidavit are missing the point that the program is meant to keep everyone healthy, he said.“If that’s the case,” Poschman said, “you’re invited to stay away.”jauslander@aspentimes.comFeb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024",2

The Republican-controlled Senate is auditing the election results in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state and one won by Joe Biden, in spite of its long history of voting for Republican candidates. As part of the process, officials contracted a conspiracy-prone firm called Cyber Ninjas, which started work to “statistically identify voter registrations that did not make sense, and then knock on doors to confirm if valid voters actually lived at the stated address.”But in a letter to Senate President Karen Fann, the DOJ said the process could target minority communities and have “significant intimidating effect” on voters. If the canvassing continued, the DOJ warned it might violate several civil rights laws against voter intimidation, and the DOJ might sue. Fann wrote back on Friday, noting the Senate would “indefinitely defer” that part of the program.",1
24,Is Trump’s Unemployment Benefit Plan Legal?,-5.0,34.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/08/13/Trump-s-Unemployment-Benefit-Plan-Legal,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,thefiscaltimes,25,"The White House scrambled earlier this week to clarify President Trump’s effort to provide extra weekly payments to unemployed workers, settling on the idea that the new program would provide workers with up to $300 per week in enhanced payments, without requiring states to contribute. But The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampellsaysthe plan is anything but clear, with the administration providing “at least five contradictory versions of this parallel benefit system” announced by president.Citing Georgetown law professor David Super, Rampell adds that in addition to being a moving target, the program as currently described is probably illegal. Trump’s original plan required states to contribute 25% of the cost of the new unemployment benefit, or $100, bringing the total to $400 per week – a number that has been cited by numerous White House officials. But following a wave of complaints from cash-strapped states, the White House says it has changed the rules to eliminate that contribution.The problem, Rampell says, is that the 25% cost-sharing payment was part of the plan for a reason. The “state funding match included in Trump’s executive action wasn’t there just for kicks,” Rampell writes. “It was there because it’s required under the law Trump cited as giving him authority to create this benefit program: the Stafford Act.”And that’s not the only legal issue: “Counting existing state spending on jobless benefits, rather than new spending, to meet the state-match requirement would also violate Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87,” Rampell says.Why it matters:Aside from the basic but profound issue of public officials following the law, the suspect legal standing of Trump’s plan could prevent states from participating in the program. “It’s not a matter of whether states are willing to sign on the dotted line,” Super told Rampell. “It’s: What are you actually asking me to sign up for?”",1

Mike DeWine signs a bill that lawmakers passed Tuesday.Senate Bill 33cleared its final vote in the Senate Tuesday afternoon.Over a dozen stateshave passed similar bills since 2018, as environmental and climate demonstrations have centered on energy facilities. Critics say the bill deters free speech and attempts to silence civil protests about important issues of the time.SB 33 defines critical infrastructure as oil and alumina refineries; electric generation facilities, substations, switching stations and transmission lines; chemical, polymer and rubber manufacturing facilities; water intake structure, water treatment or waste water facilities; natural gas company facilities, compressors and pipelines, and about a dozen other projects.Bill sponsor Sen. Frank Hoagland, a Southeast Ohio Republican, cited examples of people tampering with valves and control systems at pipeline facilities, which can create dangerous situations along transport lines or at energy generating facilities. Construction equipment has been set on fire at facilities.“The facilities that are often targeted by such actions provide essential energy, communications and other vital services and products to the entire state of Ohio and, in some cases, the country as several sections of national critical infrastructure cross our state,” he said in remarks introducing his bill.Cheryl Johncox, the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fossil Fuels organizer, argued that a Cincinnati mother who hangs a sign against Duke Energy’s Central Corridor Gas Pipeline Extension Project, concerned about its health effects, could be charged with criminal mischief if SB 33 becomes law. She could face up to a third-degree felony and up to a $10,000 fine.“SB 33′s purpose is to intimidate individuals, communities, and organizations lawfully exercising their First Amendment and other fundamental rights,” she said. “This bill, among other things, is duplicative and amends Ohio’s criminal trespass and criminal mischief statutes by extending potential liability to innocent landowners, passersby, peaceful protesters, and community organizations advocating for stronger safeguards for public health and the environment.”In addition to criminal mischief, there would be new penalties for the following crimes on critical infrastructure facilities: criminal trespass, aggravated trespass, making false alarms, telecommunications harassment, among others. The bill also authorizes companies to pursue people who harm infrastructure in civil court.DeWine has not said whether he’ll sign the bill.Other coverage:Ohio behind on vaccine shipments, but officials say new doses on the wayOhio lawmakers send Gov.

Here is a great compilation of real and unstaged photos taken by Pete Souza from the Situation Room, taken during theraid on Osama bin Laden. The most iconic is this one:Credit: Pete Souza/White HouseThe contrast between these photos and the staged one Trump released are clear.Everyone in the Obama photo is looking at the screen. The photos are taken from the side, not directly in front.  The facial expressions of the subjects in the photos are showing concern, emotion, focus on the magnitude of what they are witnessing.  Subjects are interacting.  The desk is covered with open laptops, photos, pads of paper, writing utensils and drinks.Contrast that with Trump's photo.  The photo is taken from the end of the table, directly in front of the screen they would be watching. The people in the photo do not seem concerned with having their line of sight blocked, suggesting they weren't actually looking at anything.   Second, no one is looking in the same direction. It is as though they are watching different screens or not even engaged. Third, and most notably, no one is interacting with anyone else in the photo. It looks like they all came in to the room and were told to look straight ahead and pretend to be serious for the photo.Finally, look at the cables in the Trump photo.Here's a clearer image of them:Credit: The White HouseDonald Trump,  Reality TV Show President.What an epic failure.",1

29,On New York's White Democratic Party Chair Comparing a Black Woman to a KKK Leader,-23.67,29.33,https://jezebel.com/on-new-yorks-white-democratic-party-chair-comparing-a-b-1847906006,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,jezebel,15,"Jay Jacobs, the weakling leader of the New York State Democratic Party, made the puzzling decision this week tocompare a young Black woman—incidentally (or not) the victor of his party’s mayoral primary in Buffalo—to American neo-Nazi David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, arguably the most infamously, violently racist American organization to ever exist.Asked about his refusal to endorseIndia Walton, the dark-horse socialist candidate in New York’s second-largest city—and his choice instead to endorse her opponent, Byron Brown, the loser of the primary who is mounting a write-in campaign against Walton—Jacobs said, “Let’s take a scenario, very different, where David Duke... the grand wizard of the KKK, he moves to New York, he becomes a Democrat. He runs for mayor in the city of Rochester, which is a low primary turnout, and he wins the Democratic line.“I have to endorse David Duke?” Jacobs went on, unfathomably. “I don’t think so.”When he was correctly called out for this bizarre and offensive analogy, Jacobs took to the Party’s official Twitter account to defend himself, underlining the part where he said the scenario was “very different” (oh, okay) and the part where he continued, “Now of course, India Walton is not in the same category” (as David Duke, founder of the KKK, whose members literally raped and murdered Black women). He added his own little message about “what’s wrong with public discourse today”:“People want to find something to be unhappy about, so they twist statements, or ignore statements, to make their argument,” he wrote.In a separate statement tothe Daily News, Jacobs lamented that “discourse today is like walking in a minefield.” He compared a black woman in politics to David Duke, but he’s the true victim here. Somebody get this man a Substack! Clearly, he’s got some fascinating thoughts on cancel culture he’d like to share with us.Eventually, a full day and dozens of calls for his resignation later, Jacobs apologized and said he’d like to have lunch with India Walton after the election that he hopes she loses. Waltonaccepted his apology, because she is apparently a gracious and generous person.I am not. I don’t give a shit about his day late, dollar short bullshit. Jay Jacobs needs to go. The fish rots from the head down, as the saying goes, and it’s time for a coup in the New York Democratic Party.To be clear, David Duke never won a low-turnout election in Rochester. This is not a real thing that happened in New York, that would maybe make sense as a point of reference for a dark-horse candidate winning an election in this state. (Buffalo, actually, had a Conservative vehemently anti-abortion mayor who was anominal Democrat, and ran as the nominee of the Conservative Party after losing the Democratic primary. Unfortunately, Jay Jacobs wasn’t around at the time to endorse him, but no doubt he wishes he could’ve.) To be even clearer, every time David Duke did run for office, he was publicly condemned by national and state-level Republicans (these were very different times than we live in today, obviously). To be crystal fucking clear, this was objectively one of the most offensive and simultaneously ludicrous statements that a human in Jacobs’ position could make, and it is deeply embarrassing for the leader of the Democratic Party of New York to have not only made it, but then used the Party’s public platform to defend it.It’s long past time for Jay Jacobs to go. But we are inthe post-apology political age, and unfortunately, no one seems to know how to get him out. According to the party’s own rules, “officers may be removed by a vote of a majority of the members of the State Committee at any meeting where notice under Article IV of such business has been given.”Yes, I am now one of what I would guess is maybe a maximum of five people who have read the New York Democratic Party’s rules, which are written in such a way as to be mind-meltingly boring, verging on incomprehensible. Far be it for me to say this is intentional, but I’m pretty fucking sure it’s not accidental.Why? Because this is not an entity that cares for accountability. If it was, it would not place such an unreasonable, undue amount of power in the Chair’s hands. The Chair appoints all the committee members. The Chair controls funding. The Chair is nominally elected, but for as long as anyone I spoke to can remember, was hand-picked by Cuomo, who then ordered his lackeys—who still comprise the majority of the party—to vote for the guy he knew would be in his pocket.Cuomo is technically gone, but the rot of his ways—and the consequences of the power he consolidated—remains. The calls for Jacobs’ resignation may have forced his apology, but they were never going to result in what they actually demanded, and the people making them had to know that. And the vote that could remove him will never happen, because the party remains packed with Cuomo machine cronies who violate the party’s own standards of ethics, which declare “public trust in party leadership.”The two main things the party’s own principles emphasize? To not seek personal gain, and to “attract those citizens best qualified to serve, and not impede unreasonably or unnecessarily their recruitment and retention.”Which leads us to address the little dig at Walton that Jacobs made, with his little “low turnout” remark. It’s a fine time for Jacobs to suddenly care about low voter turnout. Brown did nothing to get out the vote, a tried-and-true strategy by New York’s Democratic establishment, which cares only about maintaining power for those who already have it. Low voter turnout has been a low priority for New York Democrats for a very long time: They’ve done nothing to address its steady decline since the 1980s. If they actually wanted to increase voter turnout, a good strategy might be to welcome newcomers to the party, knowing that those new candidates and the new energy they bring also has the potential to activate new voters.What has Jay Jacobs done instead?He discouraged the candidates who ultimately wallopped the Cuomo machine-enabledIndependent Democratic Conference(IDC), a Democrat-in-Name-Only group that constantly stymied the party’s presumed and even stated goals, effectively giving Republicans—but really, Andrew Cuomo—more power than they ever should have had in a state like New York. He has repeatedly lobbied againstlegislation that would help the state’s most vulnerable, making the Democratic Party barely identifiable as even nominally different from their Republican counterparts. He has devoted energy totrying to eliminate the Working Families Party as part of a Cuomo-driven political vendetta, when he was supposed to be helping to facilitate the state’s public financing system—which is intended to help new candidates get into office, rather than continuing to consolidate power in an Old Guard that only looks out for themselves, rather than their constituents.It’s important to note, though, that despite what Byron Brown and Jay Jacobs and others who seek to maintain the status quo that has 43 percent of children in Buffalo living in poverty, the mayoral primary that India Walton won had a 20 percent turnout—consistent with recent Democratic mayoral primaries in that city, andactually higher than the three other major party primaries held on that day. Undermining Walton’s win is another act of dishonesty by people who have nothing to show for themselves—no actual platform, no actual road to progress or improvement, just lies and smears and desperate grabs at maintaining at status quo that works for them and harms the vast majority of the people they’re supposed to represent.So what is to be done?When I’m disheartened by New York Democratic Party politics, I look to the people who have worked past that disappointment and moved into action, against all odds. So I’ll let one of them have the last word here:",1

Now there’s one more: President Donald Trump.Trumptold Religion News Servicelast week in a written interview mediated by spiritual advisor Paula White-Cain that he doesn’t consider himself to be Presbyterian. He was confirmed in the church and has called himself Presbyterian numerous times over the years. But no more.“I now consider myself to be a non-denominational Christian,” Trumpsaidin the statement. “Melania and I have gotten to visit some amazing churches and meet with great faith leaders from around the world. During the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, I tuned into several virtual church services and know that millions of Americans did the same.”While the mainline denomination has previouslychallengedTrump’s affiliation, his recent departure seems to be the result of the president slowly moving away from his childhood church and toward a more evangelical faith.Trump was not a regular churchgoer before he was elected president. HeattendedNorman Vincent Peale’s church for a while and praises Peale’s bookHe has alsoattendedEpiscopal churches for several Christmas and Easter services. In 2016, he was described by one prominent evangelical supporter as a “baby Christian.”Since moving to the White House, however, he has visited many different churches, mostly evangelical and Pentecostal. He has met with numerous ministers, been prayed over, and sought the advice of spiritual counselorslike White-Cain, a Florida televangelist often associated with the prosperity gospel, who took a position as the Trump administration’s faith outreach coordinator last year. City of Destiny, the church White-Cain founded in Florida, is nondenominational.Most Americans don’t think Trump has strong religious beliefs,accordingto the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute poll. Roughly 40 percent say the president “is mostly using religion for political purposes.” White evangelicals who vote Republican see things differently: Fifty-nine percent say Trump has strong religious beliefs.In some ways, Trump’s decision to disassociate with a mainline denomination is also part of a larger cultural trend. Many Americans have done the same. In 1975, nearly a third of Americans identified with a mainline denomination. Today, that has dropped to alittle more than 10 percent.The Presbyterian Church (USA) has declined from 3.1 million members in 1984 to about 1.3 million today. Membership has dropped by an average of 4.5 percent every year that Trump has been president.Changing religious identification is also common in the United States. Social scientists call this “switching.” This includes dramatic conversions, like when someone has a born-again experience, but also more subtle changes, like when someone moves to a new town and decides to try the local Baptist church instead of another Methodist congregation.Religious switching seems to happen more often when there are a lot of choices—like there are in the United States. And it seems to happen more when people take religion very seriously and think it’s an important and distinctive part of their personal identity—like they do in the US.In the three-wave Cooperative Congressional Election Study—which surveyed the same individuals in 2010, 2012, and 2014—1 out of every 6 Christians changedtheir religious identification over four years. Some stopped identifying as Christians and either called themselves “none” or “nothing in particular.” But about 16 percent changed denomination, including about 20 percent of Presbyterians, who stopped calling themselves Presbyterian and started calling themselves something else—often “nondenominational.”Of course, most Americans are not the president. It is highly unusual for the chief executive to change religious identification in office. The last time it happened, Trump was six years old.Dwight Eisenhower was baptized the second Sunday he was in the White House, in January 1953. He was joining the group that Trump is now leaving: the Presbyterians.Eisenhower, like Trump, was not particularly religious before his election. He was raised in a small Anabaptist denomination, which he left when he went to military school. His parents later joined the Bible Students, a group that became the Jehovah’s Witnesses. When he was running for office in 1952, the World War II hero’s lack of a denomination became an issue. He was called “a man without a church and without a faith.”One of his spiritual advisors, the evangelist Billy Graham, encouraged Eisenhower to set an example for the nation by joining a church, and recommended he become a Presbyterian. Though Graham was a Baptist, he worked across denominational lines, knew the Presbyterian minister in Washington, DC, and thought Eisenhower would feel comfortable at the orderly, formal Sunday service.Eisenhower originally resisted the idea,accordingto historian Gary Scott Smith, thinking the move would just look cynical and political. He felt his faith was private.He was convinced when one of his staff asked him to think about the nation’s children, yanked out of bed every Sunday to go to church, complaining that they shouldn’t have to go if the president of the United States didn’t have to go. The president should set a good religious example.Eisenhower made it a priority in his administration to promote belief in God and religion, in very general terms. He saw religion as a spiritual resource in the Cold War conflict with Communism. He added “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and promoted the National Day of Prayer. He spoke frequently about the importance of “a deeply felt religious faith”—most famously when hesaid, “Our form of government has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I don’t care what it is.”Most Americans came to see Eisenhower as a very religious president, though some critiqued him for being specific about his faith. He seemed to promote a generic American religion, which had nothing to do with Jesus or any particulars about God or any theological content. He seemed to have, one person said, “a very fervent believer in a very vague religion.”Today, when the Cold War struggle has been replaced by culture war conflicts, critics see Trump’s move from Presbyterian to nondenominational Christian in the opposite light: It’s too specific. Instead of trying to represent all Americans with platitudes about “deeply felt faith,” they claim Trump ismakingapoliticalmove,identifyingwith the religious voters he needs at the polls.",2

32,Day Three of the Republican Convention: One Week of Honesty on TV Every Four Years,27.0,28.67,https://spectator.org/rnc-day-three-honesty-media/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,spectator,23,"Preface: A Stream of Consciousness on Media Bias, Mass Brainwashing of College Kids and American Voters, and Cancel CultureOnlyone more dayof truth left for prime-time television, and then we will have to wait four more years. In starklingo,Winter Is Coming, and we soon will resume being lectured onWhite Walkerprivilege.It has been such a wonderful three days. I variously channel-surfed to stations I have not watched for years: CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC. It was so nice. It was like we had a fair and honest media again. Fair is fair, and they gave the Democrats four such nights last week. That is fine. And if we did not know better, we would be thinking that now the media honorably maintain the balance by giving the GOP four nights. But we know it all is an illusion, a mirage. Of the 209 weeks in a Quadrennium, we get one — actually only four of the seven days of that one week. The Democrats get the other 208.We have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it.It is a shame, because that kind of one-sided bias indeed does brainwash people. There is no question but that the lopsided domination of Left Media — the “mainstream” media — not only causes a falsified narrative to be disseminated, but it ultimately intimidates and brainwashes people.Of course it does.A person thinks to himself or herself a certain thought or idea and then finds that “everyone else” disagrees. In time, of course it impacts thinking. That is how the Left has taken over universities and truly brainwashed two generations of their own zombie White Walkers. Of course they have.That is why we heard so much at this GOP convention about Cancel Culture and repression of conservative ideas. Left-wing professors mix their assigned course materials with their own propaganda. They load their syllabi to force students to read only one message, that of the Left. Even 40 years ago, when I majored in political science at Columbia University, I never once heard the name “Ayn Rand” except when I went into the student health clinic one time with an otolaryngological irritation, and the doctor, a closet libertarian, made small talk with me. All I had been reading for four years was Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Karl Marx, Stokely Carmichael, and the Friedrich Engels–Karl Marx Reader. That was then; it is so much worse now. Yes, Ocasio-Hyphen is not super smart, but shealso is not super stupid.If we are honest, not just calling people names, we recognize that she speaks coherently, sat through four years of college, passed her tests, got a graduate degree. We fool ourselves by saying that she simply is “stupid.”Rather, she represents something more egregious: O-Hyphen is what happens when you take an average — that is, a mediocre — intellect, and then force-feed it left-wing pulp for four or six years. That is why she says, in her alternate universe, that the 25thAmendment was passed to stop Franklin Roosevelt from winning a fifth term.That is not “stupid” in the purest sense; rather, that isignorant— abysmal ignorance. That is why she cannot individuate between gas chambers and crematoria in Auschwitz, on the one hand, and ICE compassionately caring for, feeding, and medically treating illegal aliens on the other. And how can she be so ignorant that she does not know the 25th Amendment was passed well after FDR died in office?Because she was force-fed years of leftist pulp. Why is she a “socialist” (the homogenized name for “communist”)? Because that is what she was taught for six years, that is what she was assigned to read and to regurgitate on her exams: pure pulp fiction.Of course the enormous media bias — 208 out of 209 weeks devoted to the Democrat-Left — tilts minds. People get deeply impacted by what they think the people around them think. It is rare to find people strong enough to defy the majority, the “common wisdom,” especially when the majority also can fire you and take away the livelihood you need to feed your family, if you do not conform. That is why so many professors who are conservatives hide their views on campuses, while the leftist professors bellow. That even is why some conservative professors publicly espouse a liberal perspective in the classroom but then privately struggle with their consciences off campus, as they share with others who share their views how deeply frustrated they are. It is a Cancel Culture in which we live. And that is why even “science” cannot be trusted on first blush, because even “science” is politicized. If you publish the right “science,” you get the grants and funding to continue your “research.” If you publish the wrong science, even though the data are unmistakable, your funding dries up, and you are canceled.Thatis the climate that needs to be changed.When CNN fired myAmerican Spectatorcolleague, Jeffrey Lord, for tweeting “Sieg Heil!” to the president of Media Matters, whom Jeffrey was criticizing for being anti-free-speech bigots, employing fascist-style tactics to shut down opposing speech in the tradition of repressive Hitler and Mussolini propaganda machines, Jeffrey was perfectly justified in using that hyperbole. No one thought he was advocating Nazism; that would be as insane an inference as when the Left media went crazy on Laura Ingraham four years ago, manipulating a photo where she waved to the GOP convention crowd with an understandably outstretched arm, and they said she had given a Nazi salute. It all is crazy. But CNN used that tweet as their excuse to drop Jeffrey as a commentator. That is Cancel Culture. It happens all over, in every institution where the Left holds sway. I live with it every single day in academia. I always am one joke away, one adjective, one noun away from being canceled. Take this joke, which is not even all that funny (by my finely honed New York Jewish Catskills humor):“A priest, a pastor, and a rabbit walk into a bar. The rabbit says to the bartender: ‘Don’t look at me. I’m just a typo.’ ”I would notdaretell that joke on a university campus. First of all, as noted, it is below my humor standards. But more than that, which snowflake will be offended? Someone who is a recovering alcoholic? An atheist? Or maybe someone who complains that the professor used an animal that is …White? Why didn’t the professor use a bear? Or a seal? Or a Doberman Pinscher in the joke?  Well,duh, because that doesn’t work in that joke. A Doberman is not a typo of “rabbi.” But that is why JerrySeinfeld no longer will do comedyon campuses:The younger generation “just want to use these words,” Seinfeld said. “‘That’s racist, that’s sexist, that’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re talking about.”So Day Three is an exciting respite, but the oxygen is waning and soon will be gone for 47 months and three weeks.It was a great night, so inspiring that I stopped taking notes and just enjoyed it like a great symphony. OK, a symphony joke — since I am not on campus right now:A guy goes to the cemetery where Beethoven is buried. As he approaches the grave, he sees it is open, and Beethoven actually is sitting up, with pages of music in front of him, vigorously rubbing it all out with an eraser. He is just erasing everything, and the page is titled “Ninth Symphony.” So the guy says: “Beethoven, what in the world are you doing in your grave?” And Beethoven says, “I’m decomposing.”Day Three at the GOP ConventionOK, back to the convention Day Three. It was a wonderful night. An Ode to Joy. And yet it also was somber and about real life. Kayleigh McEnany told her deeply moving story of the double mastectomy she voluntarily underwent because she was diagnosed with the gene that can cause the same fatal breast cancer that killed her close relatives. She assured us that she knows this president, and he will cover pre-existing conditions. She also told us that he showed enormous personal caring, the side the media obscure. Trump deeply cares about people. There are so many stories of this genre that the media cover up. Kellyanne Conway spoke, and we know she is stepping out now to be a Mom after having done masterfully as counselor to the president. She has to focus on the child at home; besides that focus on Husband George, she also wants to devote more time to the kids in this era of remote learning via Zoom. Sister Deirdre Byrne, M.D., of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts, and a former army surgeon, talked forthrightly about the sanctity of life, a very different message and focus than the nun that Joe Biden had at his convention. Lou Holtz, the legendary Notre Dame football coach, gave a fabulous speech for Trump. Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations, spoke about the chaos in the streets of Democrat cities and praised President Trump’s unbridled support for our First Responders.After Rep. Elise Stefanik of upstate New York called out the shame and fiction of last December’s Democrat Debacle, the bogus impeachment that got crushed a few weeks later in the Senate like the spider it was, Jack Brewer spoke. He is a former NFL safety who set special-team records for tackles on teams where he played. He was emphatically pro-Trump, as NFL great Herschel Walker wasthe day before, and — like Walker and so many others speaking at the convention — he is Black. He returned to Joe Biden’s racist theme that, if you don’t vote for Biden, “You ain’t black.” Brewer is Black, as are Vernon Jones, the Georgia state representative; Kim Klacik, the Baltimore congressional candidate; Herschel Walker; U.S. Sen. Tim Scott; and the many other Black figures supporting Trump. Do you know who actuallyain’t Black?Joe Biden.There was Chen Guangcheng, blind since his youth and a self-taught attorney, who was locked up in China for four years and then placed under further house arrest because he opposed the Communists’ one-child policy. He made it to America by escaping house arrest and fleeing to the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Unlike Ocasio and Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and the whole left-tilted Democrat Party, Mr. Guangcheng is fiercely pro-Trump and anti-socialism. Or, as Joe Biden might say, “Man, if you’re for Trump and against socialism,you ain’t Chinese.” New York Rep. Lee Zeldin spoke. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa talked about how Trump raced to support Iowa when it was hit with natural disasters that the media never covered, how Trump’s entire agenda has helped farmers significantly, while the socialist Democrat agenda that has enveloped Joe Biden is the most dangerous anti-farm program ever. Next came another Black former NFL football player, Burgess Owens, who is campaigning in Utah for a congressional seat. Like Jack Brewer, who spoke earlier, Owens also was a safety. Interesting that no one picked up on their field positions at a convention that has a salient theme that President Trump is the law-and-order candidate who will support safety while Biden and his entourage work to defund the police. Owens yet again put the lie to Biden’s “You Ain’t Black” racism.Sam Vigil, whose wife innocently was shot dead while in her garage, praised President Trump’s “Operation Legend,” his crime-enforcement initiative that allows federal agents to work with local police in crime-devastated cities. He told us, “The police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie’s case. In a matter of days, they arrested four men. The fifth — the suspected killer — is in a Texas jail on unrelated charges.” A particularly powerful moment came next when Clarence Henderson, who was among those in the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins, took center stage to endorse Trump mightily. Instead of “If you vote for Trump, you ain’t Black,” Henderson said “If you vote for Biden, you don’t know history.” Henderson reminded us why he rightly is regarded as a civil rights hero and what real history teaches:Walking into the Woolworth Department Store on February 2, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I’d experienced before. My friends had been denied service the day before because of the color of their skin. We knew it wasn’t right. But when we went back the next day, I didn’t know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position, in handcuffs or on a stretcher or even in a body bag….It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. It was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship. And it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote.They don’t teach it that way in college or grad school, and teachers who try to do so get fired or canceled. But that is the truth that sneaks onto the TV screen one week every four years. Henderson tied his message together by saying that “These achievements demonstrate that Donald Trump truly cares about Black lives. His policies show his heart. He has done more for Black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50.”The evening wound down with two wonderful speeches. Richard Grenell, our former ambassador to Germany and then our former Acting Director of National Intelligence, powerfully praised Trump’s foreign policy achievements. Trump had charmed Angela Merkel but also got her to pay more towards NATO. While Obama and Biden flew in hundreds of millions in cash to Iran, Trump flew in the attack craft that evaporated Iran’s master of worldwide terror, Qassem Soleimani. We were reminded that, in a career spanning nearly half a century in Washington, the historical record shows that Biden has been wrong on almost every single issue that ever has come before him. Even on killing Osama bin Laden, Biden advised Obama to wait.Mike Pence finished with a very fine vice presidential speech that touched on all themes of the convention and the Trump–Pence first term. It was wonderful to hear but a bit saddening, too,  because it means we have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. If we want any other truth to get onto the NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, or MSNBC screens between now and November 3, Trump and the GOP will have to buy the minutes. At least Cancel Culture still allows that. Don’t be sure that right will survive four years hence if the Left wins in November and extends their digital-media censorship beyond Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook to permeate into broadcast media.",0
33,“There’s Going to Be a Blowup”: Trump and DeSantis Are on a Collision Course,-9.67,36.33,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/trump-and-desantis-are-on-a-collision-course,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,vanityfair,25,"Florida is the gravitational center of’s MAGA-ified Republican Party, so it’s not surprising that the Sunshine State’s pugnacious Republican governor,Ron DeSantis,wants to be Trump’s rightful heir. Since his 2018 election, DeSantis has thrilled the GOP base by governing like a mini Trump. He defied public health guidelines during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic last year and kept Florida virtually free of a statewide lockdown. In May he perpetuated Trump’s 2020 election lie andsigneda restrictive voting rights bill live on Fox News. And last month hedispatchedFlorida law enforcement agents to Texas to “secure [the] southern border.” According to onerecentconservative poll, DeSantis beat Trump with a 74% approval rating (Trump scored 71%).But in the wake of the Surfside condo collapse, DeSantis’s claim to the MAGA mantle is facing its biggest test, with DeSantis putting management of the tragedy ahead of Trump’s need for blind loyalty. On June 30, the conservativereportedthat DeSantis’s team was furious that Trump intended to hold a MAGA rally in Florida while the search for survivors continued (DeSantis didn’t attend the rally). On July 1, DeSantis appeared alongside Presidentand praised him for the federal government’s response to the tragedy. (The moment recalled the greeting between New Jersey governorChris ChristieandBarack Obamaafter Hurricane Sandy.)In recent days I spoke with a half dozen GOP insiders about the recent flare-ups between DeSantis’s and Trump’s camps. The sources agreed that DeSantis and Trump are on an inevitable collision course as the 2024 GOP field takes shape. “There’s going to be a blowup,” a prominent Republican said. “Trump fucking hates DeSantis. He just resents his popularity,” a Trump confidant told me. Asked for comment, Trump spokespersonsaid: “Governor DeSantis has shown great respect.”Part of Trump’s irritation with DeSantis is that Trump famously claims credit for anyone in his orbit who gains attention. “Trump tells people, ‘I made Ron,’” the prominent Republican said. “Trump says that about a lot of people. But in this case it’s actually true.” According to sources, then congressman DeSantis cultivated Trump’s support during the 2018 gubernatorial primary by hanging out at Trump’s Washington, D.C., hotel. “Ron basically ran his primary campaign out of the hotel. He buttonholed Trump supporters and his friends,” the prominent Republican said.For much of the 2018 gubernatorial primary, DeSantis trailed Florida agriculture commissionerBut after Trump endorsed DeSantis in June, DeSantis zoomed12 points ahead. DeSantis won the primary by nearly 20 points.Once in office, DeSantis irked Trump by demonstrating an ability to push back, albeit in private. Ireportedlast year that DeSantis rejected Trump’s plea to close Florida’s beaches as the pandemic raged. DeSantis has also built an impressive fundraising operation of his own that gives him leverage in his budding rivalry with Trump. According to theDeSantis’s political action committeeraisedalmost $14 million in April 2021, bringing its total to about $31.6 million. Hedge fund billionairemade a $5 million donation.Spokespeople for DeSantis and Griffin declined to comment.DeSantis needs to walk a tightrope as he seeks to position himself for a 2024 run. According to a source, DeSantis has told donors that he won’t openly campaign in Iowa or New Hampshire before his 2022 Florida reelection campaign. But he’s clearly in a strong position. “Heading into 2024, DeSantis is primed to push Trump off the throne,” former Trump advisertold me. “Trump surely sees this coming and will ultimately offer Governor DeSantis a joint ticket.”— InsideJeffrey Epstein’s Decades-Long RelationshipWith Leslie Wexner— Trump’s Deranged Replacement Theory Might’veLost Him the Election—Jeff Bezos and Elon MuskWant to Burn Their Cash in Space— ThreeTexans Bust MythsAbout the Alamo’s Famous “Last Stand”— The Guy Who Could Send Trump to Prison May SoonCooperate With the Feds— Bill and MelindaGates’s Epic Divorce SagaEnters Its Next Phase— Juneteenth, Critical Race Theory, and theWinding Road Toward Reckoning— Trump Is NowUrging People Not to VaccinateTheir Kids Against COVID— From the Archive: Microsoft’s Odd Couple, inthe Words of Paul Allen— Not a subscriber?Jointo receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now.ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin Vanderhoof",1

35,Why the Georgia Senate Runoff Elections Are So Important,-13.67,40.0,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34692385/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-donate-volunteer-vote/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-04,elle,17,"Throughout election week, all eyes were on a handful of swing states that flipped blue and delivered a win for President-elect Joe Biden. One of those essential states? Georgia, where a Democratic presidential nominee hadn't won since 1992. The shift was thanks, in part, tothe tireless work of Black organizers—women like Stacey Abrams andFair Fight, LaTosha Brown andBlack Voters Matter, and Nse Ufot andThe New Georgia Project—who registered, educated, and mobilized voters.But the fight for Georgia is far from over. This January, there will be two critical U.S. Senate runoff elections, one between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other between Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Reverend Raphael Warnock. The elections will not only decide the state's representation, but also which political party will have a majority in the U.S. Senate, which could dramatically alter Biden's upcoming administration.Below, what you need to know about these races, including why they're happening in the first place, and how you can be involved, even if you don't live in the battleground state. And if you do? Read on, and get ready to vote.In Georgia, a candidate has to win a majority of the overall vote to win the election, a rule that was originally created in the 1960s to limit the power of Black politicians in the state. According to the, if no one breaks 50 percent, then the two candidates who got the most votes move onto a runoff election against each other. In the last few decades, Democrats have rarely won these statewide runoffs.Now let’s look at what happened in Georgia in November: There were two U.S. Senate races in the state this year. One was a typical re-election race for Sen. Perdue. The other race featured Sen. Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat in 2019 after Sen. Johnny Isakson retired; Loeffler was running this year in a special election to finish out Isakson’s term. According toCNN, Perdue received 49.7 percent of the vote, while his challenger Ossoff received 48 percent of the vote; Loeffler received 25.9 percent of the vote, while her challenger Warnock received 32.9 percent of the vote. Therefore, there will be two runoffs on Jan. 5th.If you're gearing up to vote on Tuesday, you canfind your polling location here.Also, remember: If you're a Georgia resident that turns 18 years old before the runoff elections, even if you weren't able to vote in the presidential election,you will be able to cast a ballotin these races.Perdue, a former CEO, is finishing up his first year as senator. Hemade headlinesearlier in 2020 for questions around his investments, including stocks purchased in a company that supplies personal protective equipment, which people use to avoid getting COVID-19, on the same day the Senate had a members-only meeting about the pandemic. Loeffler, another former CEO, was similarly scrutinizedfor suspicious stock tradingtied to the pandemic earlier this year. (In May, it was reported the Justice Departmentdroppedits insider trading investigation into Loeffler.) She also co-owns the WNBA team, Atlanta Dream, though she received pushback from players after saying the ""Black Lives Matter political movement"" doesn't align with the league, according to the. In their Senate careers, Perdue and Loeffler have voted in line with President Trump’s position 95 percent and 100 percent of the time, respectively, according toFiveThirtyEight.On the Democratic side,  there's Ossoff, a documentary producer and former media company CEO, who's run for office before; he lost in a special election for the U.S. House in 2017. He also previously worked as a national security aide for Rep. Hank Johnson. Warnock, on the other hand, is a senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. He's also an activist, who was arrested at the state capitol a few years ago after the governor refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, according toIf he won, he'd be thefirstBlack senator from Georgia.Find out more about all of their policy positions, here:PERDUEOSSOFFLOEFFLERWARNOCKAs it stands, following the 2020 election,the new U.S. Senatewill consist of 46 Democrats, two independents who caucus with Democrats, 50 Republicans, and then whoever wins these two races in Georgia. If Democrats win both races, they will have a majority in the Senate (the Senate tie breaker is the Vice President, or in this case, Kamala Harris), giving Biden increased power to pass legislation and move forward on his policy agenda. Otherwise, if even one of the Republican candidates wins in January, the GOP will have majority control. As thereports: “With judicial nominees, a stimulus deal, infrastructure and health care measures, and tax and spending policies all on the line, the Senate races in Georgia are likely to take on an intensity that mirrors the presidential race that just ended.”For Ufot, the CEO ofThe New Georgia Project, a civic engagement organization originally founded by Abrams, it's been critical to create ""super-voters,"" who come out for every election for which they're eligible, including the ones this January. She told ELLE.com, ""That has been a core piece of our organizing, making sure people understand the power of their vote and understand that it’s literally Black people and it’s young people that dragged us across the finish line in November and are going to drag us across the line in January, and they cannot give up faith and they cannot give up hope."" As for the races' importance, she said it's also an opportunity to make Vice President-elect Harris the ""most consequential Vice President in the history of the institution,"" teeing her up to be the tiebreaker on important pieces of legislation that activists have been fighting for for years.When it comes to getting voters out for the election—one that falls shortly after the winter holidays—Ufot noted that Democrats will need to invest aggressively in their base. ""What I mean by that is the multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual progressive majority that we have in Georgia and across the South. If you’re thinking you’re going to just turn white moderates out or you have your white suburban mom strategy, and that alone is going to carry you across the finish line, you’re performing, as opposed to actually doing the things that are necessary in order for you to win.

36,RNC leaders stand by Trump's effort to remake party: 'Nobody's turning on Trump here',9.67,34.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/6/republican-officials-stand-trump-effort-remake-par/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,washingtontimes,23,"Republican Party officials from across the country are not blaming President Trump for the party’s defeats in Georgia’s runoffs but instead are rallying to make election security its top priority in the next cycle.At the Republican National Committee Winter Meeting in Amelia Island, Florida, party officials remained steadfast Wednesday in support of Mr. Trump and his remake of the party, despite the election setbacks that gave Democrats a Senate majority and complete control of the levers of power in Washington.“Nobody’s turning on Trump here,” said Peter Feaman, a national committee member from Florida who is attending the meeting. “I’m talking to members of the RNC from all over the country — from Hawaii to Vermont to Florida to California, from one corner of the country to the other — and there is no anti-Trump sentiment whatsoever here.”Republican Party officials embraced Mr. Trump’s claims that ballot fraud and election irregularities marred the Nov. 3 vote. They are organizing a nationwide effort to prevent a repeat.“Election integrity is going to be the No. 1 priority for the RNC in 2021 and 2022,” Mr. Feaman said. “I hear no recriminations against President Trump concerning Georgia, none whatsoever. It’s all about making sure the process is fair and honest.”In Washington, pundits and Mr. Trump’s Republican critics were quick to blame the president for the Democrats’ wins in the two runoff races Tuesday in Georgia.Throughout the two-month runoff contests, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed claims that ballot tampering cost him the Nov. 3 presidential election in Georgia. He battled the state’s Republican governor and pressured the secretary of state, also a Republican, to help him “find” the votes needed to overturn the win by President-elect Joseph R. Biden.Distrust of the election system likely helped suppress Republican voter turnout Tuesday, especially in rural counties that are crucial for Republican wins in the state.“It turns out that telling the voters that the election was rigged is not a great way to turn out your voters,” said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal Republican detractors.In Georgia, Republican Party officials were less prone to condemn Mr. Trump’s actions.“We can’t place the blame squarely on him, but I think the president was definitely a factor,” said Jason Shepherd, Republican Party chairman in Cobb County, a suburban county of Atlanta.Mr. Shepherd said he counts himself as a Trump Republican.The president’s crusade against what he deemed “stolen elections” in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin also fueled protesters storming the Capitol on Wednesday and delaying Congress from officially accepting election results for Mr. Biden’s win.Ford O’Connell, a Republican Party strategist with close ties to the White House, said the mayhem at the Capitol shouldn’t take away from legitimate concerns about election integrity.“Those issues aren’t going to go away,” he said. “The Democrats do not want to have this discussion.”Mr. Trump and his allies failed in scores of lawsuits challenging the election results in battleground states.Still, courts never fully heard many of the claims of wrongdoing or irregularities, including that ballots were filled out or backdated by poll workers, ballots were driven across state lines, voting deadlines were changed without legislative approval, and accusations that noncitizens, minors and dead people voted.Mr. Feaman said the Republican Party would be hammering the voter integrity issue and pushing election overhauls in state capitals across the country.“We’re going to go to every state legislature in the country to make sure that every legal vote counts and also make sure that the laws are followed, that people who are not qualified to vote are not allowed to vote. This goes to a lot of what happened in 2020,” he said. “The whole process needs to be reexamined to make sure we have fair elections. And it’s not just Georgia. It’s everywhere.”The RNC meeting in Amelia Island, about 40 miles northeast of Jacksonville, was convened under strict COVID-19 precautions. The 168 committee members who attended, as well as guests and staff, all were tested for COVID-19. Masks were required to be worn at all indoor events, according to RNC officials.Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC.Click                            here for reprint permission.Click to Read More and View CommentsClick to Hide",1

38,Film Crew Members Say The Alec Baldwin Prop Gun Shooting Fits A Pattern Of Safety Shortfalls They’ve Had To Work Against,-5.0,37.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/rust-film-prop-safety-protocols,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,buzzfeednews,25,"“The lack of accountability is astronomical. It’s endemic.”BuzzFeed News ReporterThis aerial photo shows a film set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, where Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun, killing the cinematographer, officials said.Producers on the set ofRustin New Mexico,whereAlec Baldwinaccidentally shot and killed director of photography Halyna Hutchins, cut significant corners when it came to safety protocols and working conditions, according to those who were involved and familiar with the project.Interviews with 10 production workers, documents, and emails obtained by BuzzFeed News show that those in charge of producing the Western staffed key roles with less-experienced, nonunion workers and rushed the sourcing of props, such as guns, to save money at the expense of safe and humane working conditions.At least two property masters — who are in charge of acquiring, validating, choreographing, and overseeing all the props and department staff in a production, including weapons and those in charge of them — said that they turned down the opportunity to work onRustbecause of their concerns over how rushed the project was, what they considered to be low-ball pay, and how “flippant” the producers seemed about protocols. In 2019, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union filed a formal complaint against Dave Halls, the assistant director onRustwho handed Baldwin the loaded gun, for violating safety protocols, specifically related to firearms on set. Crew members also walked off one of his more recent projects after he had them shoot “guerrilla”-style on train tracks in the middle of the night.There have been a host of other missteps that workers say exemplify the systemic issues that have long plagued production and jeopardized their safety. Workers in the industry say a culture of ignoring basic standards, outsourcing to less-experienced workers, and paying unlivable wages to churn out content more quickly and cheaply is a big part of why Hutchins, a revered and admired cinematographer who was the film’s director of photography, is now dead.“It’s literally a war zone on some of these films, and no one takes responsibility. No one acknowledges that this culture of sucking it up and dealing with it is a problem,” Maggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician, told BuzzFeed News. “The lack of accountability is astronomical. It’s endemic.”A source close to the production pushed back on allegations that producers cut corners to save money, pointing out that it is an IATSE/Teamsters/SAG DGA union/guild–certified set, and everything was done according to union guidelines. The source also said that they had three full-set safety meetings since the film started earlier this month, including on the day of the accident.In a new letter sent to crew Sunday night, obtained by BuzzFeed News, Rust Movie Productions reiterated that it was ""conducting an internal review of safety protocols"" and cooperating with Sante Fe authorities. The producers said they decided "" to wrap the set at least until the investigations are complete.""Santa Fe sheriff's detectives said the shooting took place as the cast and crew were rehearsing with the equipment, which was set up by one of the film’s production assistants and the armorer.According to court documents, the assistant director picked up one of the prop guns that was sitting on a cart outside, yelled, “Cold gun!” — meaning that the weapon was safe to use — and handed it to Baldwin without knowing it contained live rounds.For months, production workers from across the industry and part of the unionInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) have been threatening to strike, citing exhausting, stressful conditions that were exacerbated by the pandemic.Rustwas no different, they say. Crews on the low-budget, Old West period film were working 14- to 18-hour days, staying in a dilapidated hotel an hour away from the set, and making well below standard rates while at one point waiting three weeks to get paid, according to two people familiar with the situation and reporting by other media outlets.The Los Angeles Timesreported that camera operators also made a complaint about the lack of gun safety and protocol on set last weekend after two other accidental prop gun discharges.The situation was so egregious that in protest, members of Hutchins’ camera crew walked off the set over the working conditions, a rare move that industry veterans told BuzzFeed News was a “huge red flag” that should have immediately halted production.""A handful of members of the camera crew quit the production on Wednesday night,"" a spokesperson for Rust Movie Productions said. ""The camera crew is not involved with props and prop safety protocols and have no interaction with the firearms used in production.""In the culture of Hollywood, you endure and protect your team, especially those who brought you into the gig, industry veterans said. It has to be incredibly dire, they added, for unionized operators to choose to abandon the job and leave their director.Movie industry workers take part in a candlelight vigil to honor cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Oct. 23.Warnings about the production arose in September when Neal Zoromski, a veteran property master, told one of the producers that he had concerns about how and where they were sourcing props and personnel for the film. On Sept. 20, Row Walters, a unit production manager, reached out to Zoromski asking if he would be interested in joining the Tier 1A feature (that classification means it’s a low-budget production), shooting in Santa Fe starting Oct. 6, according to emails obtained by BuzzFeed News. But the low rates, slim staffing, and rushed timeline were red flags, said Zoromski, who has been in the industry since 1989, is a 25-year union member, and has worked on everything from7th HeaventoThe Day After Tomorrow.“They didn’t seem to be playing it right from the beginning,” he said. “It felt slipshod, and the vibe was that this is a very unsafe situation, and I told them as much.”Based on conversations with Walters and a production designer, the prop master realized that they “were behind the eight ball” and trying to prepare a project days before it was about to start. Unfortunately, that has become the trend in Hollywood, he said, to try to throw a production together in 8 to 10 days, when the “bare minimum should be three weeks.”They were “flippant” with details about the weapons that were to be provided and shrugged off his questions about who was going to be on staff, Zoromski added. He also said they insisted they had everything they needed locally — “and that’s a great concern.”As the demand for content has exploded and more companies are jumping into the streaming frenzy, studios have been creating projects in places outsideLos Angeleslike New Mexico, which union workers say is cheaper. Often, as union workers who have worked on New Mexico productions told BuzzFeed News, that means production companies can hire less-experienced people to fill key roles, such asRust’s 24-year-old armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, for less money. In apodcast last month, Gutierrez-Reed — who has not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment — talked about being new to the role after just coming off her first film,The Old Way.The Daily Beast reportedthat filming on that set was allegedly briefly paused because of concerns over how she was handling the weapons.In his discussions withRustproducers last month, Zoromski said he inquired about the armorer, since it’s usually the prop master’s job to hire that role, as well as the weapons. According to emails and the call sheet, obtained by BuzzFeed News, the prop master had two assistants, one of whom was also the armorer. It was concerning, he said, that the film chose to combine those two roles into one. It compressed that person’s ability to “check the functioning guns, test them, and prepare them for use.” The call sheet also showed that most of the crew members were nonunion, meaning they were likely paid below the standard wage.Zoromski and other industry experts also balked at the findings from a Santa Fe sheriff’s search warrant, which stated that Halls, the assistant director, picked up a revolver from a cart and handed the weapon to Baldwin. That goes againstguidelinesfrom the Actors’ Equity Association, which state that “all loading of firearms must be done by the property master, armorer or experienced persons working under their direct supervision.”“It is absolutely beyond the pale that an AD would ever touch or grab a prop weapon off a cart and give it directly to an actor to rehearse or otherwise,” the prop master said.Halls, who could not be reached for comment Sunday, has worked on a slew of films and shows, including blockbusters likeTheMatrix, in various assistant director roles since the 1990s, based on his IMDb profile. And according to the Directors Guild of America, he recently completed a safety training course mandatory for membership eligibility. But two people who worked with him on various past shows said that he has a history of disregarding basic safety protocols and measures, such as not checking weapons, not holding safety meetings, and inappropriately addressing women.Back in February, crew members also walked off the Georgia set of another low-budget production where Halls worked as assistant director,One Way, because of what they said were unsafe working conditions and lack of pay. Angela Schroeder, a set decorator, told BuzzFeed News that the final straw for a few members was the last night, when Halls decided to shoot at an active train yard because she said the production company had not properly secured any locations. The assistant director had all of the crew working within 30 feet of at least eight dark train tracks in the middle of the night, without spotters, she said, adding that “nobody knew what they were doing.”Halls later posted a photo on Facebook of them moving a fake body with a train in the background, calling it “the martini shot” for the last day.The worst part, Schroeder said, was that it was around the anniversary of the death of Sarah Jones, a camera assistant who was fatally struck by a train on another Georgia movie set in 2014.In follow-up interviews with BuzzFeed News, two other people involved with the train scene said that they had planned to shoot near train tracks and it was planned, scouted, and fully vetted, as evidenced by call sheets. Eric Napier, the location manager, said that they had contacted the railroad company about filming on the property next to it.""All filming locations were scouted, vetted, rented, and insured. I do not work on 'guerrilla' projects. I will not work with a company that does not invest the time, resources, and money to do it right,"" he said. ""I have unfortunately worked with producers that cut corners and don't care about the crew, Thomasville Pictures is not one of those teams.""Goll, the pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union, had a similar experience with the assistant director in 2019 while working onInto the Dark, an anthology series. The show, which streamed on Hulu and was made by Blumhouse Productions — whichnotoriously set the standardfor making blockbuster content for little money — was also low budget, with conditions and culture similar toRust's, she said. She ended up submitting a complaint to the DGA.Usually, when there are dangerous elements in a production, such as gunfire, stunts, or pyrotechnics, leaders on set host a meeting every morning to go over the props used and the risks, as well as ensure that there are known fire lanes and usable exits in case something goes wrong. OnInto the DarkandOne Way, those meetings, as well as other basic safety processes, were not happening, and crew members complained, Goll and other staff said.“It was inexcusable that we had to basically demand those universal, common policies every single day,” she said. “It’s like that on many shows now because it’s this culture of 'Shut up, do the job, stop whining, and get it done.' Seconds are money, and the faster they can rush through things, that saves money. But we are asking ourselves now,What is that cost? And it’s our lives, livelihood, and general well-being.”Goll said Halls often complained about and was exasperated by extra safety steps onInto the Dark, like having a gun “cleared” by a professional technician. And contrary to protocol, Halls would not inform workers when there was a weapon present, or distinguish between a real gun and a prop, until the assistant prop master demanded that Halls inform the crew every time.A representative for Blumhouse Productions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We were being dismissed to our faces even though so many people knew it was wrong,” she said. “It’s frustrating because so often this falls on deaf ears, and people have been afraid to speak up, because when you do, you are not there in the days to follow.”That, at least, has changed. Production workers have been speaking out about what they’ve endured on the job en masse, filling social media accounts with stories and organizing rallies. There is a new, sweeping solidarity, Goll said, because they are no longer accepting what is at stake: their lives. “We no longer want to be treated as expendable.”",1
39,"In Trump’s Jan. 6 recast, attackers become martyrs, heroes",-10.33,36.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/trump-jan-6-recast/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,denverpost,25,"WASHINGTON — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of Jan. 6.Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots.Months after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It’s a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed into shouts of “f— the blue.”The fact inversion about the siege is the latest in Trump’s contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the most specious of which is that the election was stolen from him, when it was not.It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud, say it often, say it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Once spread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, now spread by swipe of finger, the result is the same: a passionate, unquestioning following.Trump stokes Jan. 6 conspiracy theoriesTechniques of glorifying your side and demonizing the other with skewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at least since World War I, when the U.S. government roused sentiment for the cause with posters depicting the German soldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany’s terrifying use of propaganda for the slaughter and subjugation of millions.Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president’s ego, some of the methods are the same, like telling the same fabrication over and over until it sticks.Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusations substantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among his supporters.Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate white supremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on both sides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on Jan. 6 were on one side: his.For the other side — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevate Babbitt as a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainline social media platforms where Trump is banned for spreading misinformation but his followers still commiserate. The woman died from a police officer’s bullet fired as she tried to climb through the jagged glass of a smashed window toward the House chamber during the riot.Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy theorists gather to vent. In Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered on street lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of a statue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trump and many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers were said to be leftist antifa followers in disguise. Then they were said to be overexcited tourists. Now they are heralded as foot soldiers for freedom.Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage they saw on their screens, and some lawmakers to ignore that they were among the shocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters.Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vast sea of nonsense,” said Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.That sea’s currents are familiar to historians who study what makes some conspiracy theories and propaganda persuasive.Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they aren’t true, said Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on Jan. 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries to set them straight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracin said.“The belief contains a device that protects it,” she said. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory and signals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. He said that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, including sticking your head in the sand.”Trump, Peterson said, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his core supporters and turn them against other Americans.“That’s where the power of Trump is,” he said. “He’s good at picking up on these threads … that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country’s divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest, Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected.That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s fabrications have stuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the Jan. 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,” said Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That’s what’s pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump, she said: “His method is generally to just create chaos so that people really don’t know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesia seems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though the scenes that were broadcast and streamed in real time are forever.Swarming to the Capitol after a staging rally where Trump told them to “fight like hell,” and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with them, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injuring scores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as the side of his face pressed against the glass of the door.Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump’s vice president, who was there, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted.Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and as some members were still trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doors separating the hallway from the Speaker’s Lobby to try to stave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects.Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the other side of the stacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in, screaming, “F– the blue!” and “Break it down!” One smashed the door glass next to an officer’s head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they didn’t get out of the way.A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackers shouted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. They started to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round.Babbitt was struck in the shoulder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released.Trump now states falsely — and with a stream of repetitions — that she was shot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That’s why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have never seen anything like it.”___Klepper reported from Providence, R.I.",1

Now She’s Telling Her Story,-6.67,38.0,https://www.glamour.com/story/katie-hill-lost-her-job-in-a-flurry-of-leaked-nudes-and-tabloid-headlines-now-shes-telling-her-story,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-10,glamour,18,"If you know about Katie Hill, you know about her nude photos.You wouldn’t say, “Oh, Katie Hill, she’s the one who’s openly bisexual and was the first woman and the youngest person to hold her congressional seat, right?”You wouldn’t say, “I remember Katie Hill! She flipped a deep-red Republican district in California in her first ever race.” Or even, “Katie Hill—she’s probably the only person to hold political office who can quote both Susan B. Anthony and.”You would say, “Yes, Katie Hill—the one who resigned after her pictures were leaked.”If you know of Hill, you know a handful of the most traumatic and personal facts about her life. You don’t know that she identifies with aTamora Pierceprotagonist (Sir Alanna of Trebond, of course) or that she hasendometriosisor that in afreshman classwhich included Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, it was she who was elected to represent the group to leadership. You don’t know that she reports feeling terrified to leave her husband, whom she’s said was abusive (through lawyers, her ex-husband hasdeniedany abuse), that she was suicidal after her scandal, and that a few months after she resigned, her brother, who had struggled with opioid addiction, died.Hill had a meteoric rise and an even faster fall: She was a former community college student who became the leader of a major nonprofit, then launched and won a seemingly impossible run for Congress in a deep-red district by the time she was 31. In Congress she shone for exactly one year. Then a right-wing site published the photos, which promptly spread as only nude photos of a 29-year-old congresswoman can. Hill says the photos, some of which were taken without her knowledge, could have only come from her then husband, who she says threatened to “ruin” her if she left him. Hereportedlysaid that he was hacked. The pictures showed that Hill and her then husband were involved in a relationship with a younger woman, an employee of Hill’s campaign. She resigned, with a resoundinglast stand of a speechon the floor of the House of Representatives.The fact that Hill’s private photos were published is a tremendous act of violation. But the injustice was complicated by the fact that Hill did have a relationship that she knows was outside the bounds of appropriate behavior. It didn’t break congressional rules, but the relationship tainted Hill’s image as a champion of the #MeToo movement. She apologized, but there was no taking it back. She was the boss. The relationship had been with a staffer. There should have been boundaries. There weren’t. That whole whirlwind—the allegedly abusive partner, the violating pictures, the uneven power dynamic, the perceived sordidness of a non-monogamous relationship—was compressed into one world for the public: scandal.Hill was shamed, blamed, and presumed to be out of politics forever. Not so fast, Hill says. The 31-year-old has a political PAC, called HER Time, that’s dedicated to electing women. She has a new book,, that reads like the best possible combination ofSeventeen Magazineand feminist manifesto. She has a new podcast, cheekily namedNaked Politics. And she has a plan to set women free—a legislative project to aid women and girls in demanding a kind of freedom she has never enjoyed.Glamourasked Hill about life after public shame.It was this crucial time in my life, coming out of the trauma that happened with my ex-husband, and with the photos, and with resigning. And then right after, within two months of when I resigned, my brother passed away. So being able to just sit down and tell my story—it was really therapeutic. I feel like it’s something that I needed to do for myself anyway, even if I hadn’t been able to publish a book. I’m glad that writing the book kind of forced me to do that, because I don’t know if I would have been able to do that otherwise.[endometriosis, Hill has spoken openly about hersexuality, hergun ownership, dealing with emergency medical expenses, the fact that she once considered abortion but thenhad a miscarriage, and hersexual assaultand abuse experiences.]Yes! It’s almost too strange, there are these experiences that happen to so many people, but they’re all rolled into one with me. I don’t know why during your life you go through things—and I think there’s got to be a reason behind it, and that’s the only way I’ve been able to cope with it all. But I think part of my job is to tell these stories and hope that some of them have an impact on people. There still aren’t very many people in high-profile positions who talk about these things, so I kind of feel obliged to. I mean, I’ve got the scars from my surgery—it’s one of those weird things where it’s like, “How do I have to prove it to you that this happened?”To me, it feels like you have to be able to own it even more. It’s about taking ownership of your own body and your own choices, and that’s hard! It’s a process for me to figure out—what are self-destructive behaviors that come in the wake of all this trauma, versus what are healthy coping ones? I don’t necessarily have a good sense of what a normal sex life for me should look like. I’m just trying to take my time with it, but I’m 100% in on sex positivity. I do get nervous about any BDSM stuff, because of my own experiences with it as it tied into an abusive relationship—but other people doing that in a healthy and safe way? That’s great for them.ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI tried to put into words our mission as feminists, as warriors, as women, which is to ensure that women are really guaranteed a few basic things—consideration, autonomy, safety, equality, and power. We do need to achieve equal power for any of these things to happen, which means electing women and installing women into positions of power at every level—whether it’s in government, in media, in nonprofits, in the corporate world. And there is a real legislative agenda that can move us in the right direction for all of this. What came out of the book was 10 real legislative goals that have either been composed or passed at the House, or passed at certain state and local levels, but have been blocked at the national level by Republicans. I don’t even think this should be a partisan issue! But it is. With HER Time, the PAC that I started, the overarching goal is to be able to elect women and then push forward this agenda. And I’m hoping we can get that to become a movement.The biggest thing I learned from it is that when I started to campaign, it truly felt like a movement and these people were my friends. That shouldn’t have been the case, because I was paying them. I truly do believe that the #MeToo movement and everything related to the abuse of power is really driven by patriarchy and power over women, so I don’t think the case is the same. But I do think we all have to be taking stock of that, and it’s not something that I did. I didn’t think of myself that way, and that was a mistake. You have to set your clear boundaries from the beginning. More than anything it probably just boils down to: Don’t shit where you eat.Starting three and a half years ago, when I entered the space of becoming a candidate, I really was skyrocketing. I just kept going and going and going up, and then I just fell, like, off a cliff. Now the rebuilding part is slower. It’s like you’re climbing out of a canyon and you’re trying to find the most efficient way out, and also knowing that there’s danger in coming out too fast, but also you’ve got this really strong desire to get out as fast as you can.With the outside parties that were in play, and my ex, I think that I very much came from the mindset of, “I’m not just going to sit here and kind of stew in this and be quiet for any lengthy period of time, I have to get back on my feet.” I’ve been a horseback rider for basically my whole life, and when you fall, the number one thing you’re taught, that’s just drilled into you, is that you have to get right back on. The reasoning behind that is that you get a fear, really quick, it gets instilled in you, and it kind of becomes unbreakable if you don’t immediately get back on. You have to know that youdo it. I think that’s kind of where I am right now—I got back on the horse. I might not ever be at the level where I was before, but I got back on.Samantha and Felicity.Oh, it’s Serena.

43,"The inside story of an alleged victim of ""cancel culture""",-8.75,45.5,https://popular.info/p/the-inside-story-of-an-alleged-victim,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,popular.info,18,"The concept of ""cancel culture"" is a relatively recent phenomenon, appearing in popular usagearound 2017. The idea is that groups of people, sometimes pejoratively referred to as the ""woke mob,"" demand punishment of individuals that offend their sensibilities.Those who decry the existence of ""cancel culture"" do not provide data to prove it is a cultural problem. Instead, they rely on anecdotes of people who are unjustly punished to persuade and outrage the public. These anecdotes have convinced some of the country's most prominent voices — fromSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR)toformer President Barack Obama— that ""cancel culture"" is a real issue.A prototypical anecdote was featured on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News on June 18. Carlson highlighted the plight of Melissa Rolfe, the stepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks.Carlson told millions of viewers that Rolfe was fired from her job as an HR Director at a mortgage broker because her stepson, a police officer, was charged with murder.Until today, his stepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But today, she was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently, she was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Rolfe's stepmother.According to a source familiar with the matter who spoke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job was safe. But today she was told, and we are quoting, ""We have to terminate our relationship with you."" No other explanation was offered, and honestly, no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened.Rolfe has already been scrubbed from the company's website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations.That night, Congressman Doug Collins (R-GA) embraced Rolfe's cause, claiming she was fired for the actions of her stepson. ""The 'Cancel Culture' and political correctness mob must be stopped before it destroys our country,"" Collins said.On June 30, Carlson invited Rolfe to be a guest on the show. She appeared with her lawyer, David Guldenschuh. Carlson asked Rolfe if she knew of any other possible reason for her firing, other than the actions of her stepson:CARLSON: Had you been in trouble with them? Was there any indication that they were going to fire you before you received the message saying you were terminated?ROLFE: No. I had received full support from the President and from my Direct Manager that my job was not in danger.But that does not appear to be the whole story.Adefamation lawsuitfiled this week by Rolfe's former employer, Equity Prime Mortgage (EPM), alleges that Rolfe ""repeatedly violated company policy and created an uncomfortable and hostile working environment."" The complaint accuses Rolfe of making hostile, sexual, and ""blatantly racist"" remarks. All of the conduct allegedly took place prior to Garrett Rolfe's shooting.EPM accuses Rolfe and Congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of organizing a ""smear campaign"" against the company, resulting in ""death threats, a boycott, and enormous reputational and financial harm to EPM.""If the allegations in the complaint are true, it suggests that Rolfe was exploiting the concept of ""cancel culture"" to cover-up actual wrongdoing. Rolfe did not respond to a request for comment sent to her through her attorney. Another attorney representing Rolfe and Green, Lin Wood, called the allegations against Rolfe in the lawsuit ""damnable lies.""Rolfe claims she was fired because she stood up for her stepson, police officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Rashard Brooks. But the complaint alleges misconduct that began well before the June 12 shooting.Rolfe started working for EPM in February 2020. EPM says, less than a month later, on March 19, ""Rolfe was reprimanded because she had made inappropriate jokes via text message about conducting rectal temperature checks in the office."" On April 23, ""Rolfe was reprimanded again, this time for referring to employees as “savages,"" according to the complaint.On June 11, Rolfe was reprimanded a third time by EPM CEO Eddie Perez. According to EPM, ""two employees reported Rolfe for calling employees 'fucking bitches,' saying an employee had only been hired because she had 'big boobs,' and making racist comments.”Popular Information obtained a document from EPM memorializing the meeting between Perez and Rolfe. The ""Employee Warning Notice,"" dated June 11, cites Rolfe for ""gross misconduct."" According to that document Rolfe responded by ""saying that she doesn’t see color, but that some people are 'idiots.'"" EPM says that Perez ended the meeting after Rolfe became upset but told her he would continue investigating.The next day, Garrett Rolfe killed Rashard Brooks, and Melissa Rolfe took a paid leave of absence. But according to EPM, the investigation continued, and employees came forward with claims of ""wildly unprofessional and hostile conduct"" by Rolfe, including:Rolfe told an employee that another employee was a “dumb bitch” and that the only reason a man would be interested in her was because she “must suck dick really good.”Rolfe told a Black woman who dates Black men that she needed “to get outside the box and upgrade [her] standards.”""We terminated Ms. Rolfe because, while in the workplace, she repeatedly made inappropriate and hostile comments to and about other EPM employees, which violated company policy, created an uncomfortable working environment, and resulted in a loss of confidence that she could perform her job as an HR director,"" EPM told Popular Information.The lawsuit filed by EPM also names the campaign of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican running for Congress, as a defendant. Greene won the Republican nomination on Tuesday night. She has gained notoriety for her embrace of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are running an international child sex-trafficking ring, and Trump is the only one who can stop them. Facebook hasremoved several of Greene's advertisementsfor making violent threats against Black Lives Matter protesters.EPM's lawsuit notes that Greene repeatedly claimed that Rolfe was fired because of the actions of her stepson.The lawsuit alleges that Greene ""coordinated the planting of a false story with Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but does not provide evidence to support that allegation. Greene has appeared previously on Carlson's show.On August 6, EPM sent Greene and her campaign a letter demanding a retraction. Greene responded by posting again on social media, claiming Melissa Rolfe was fired because she defended her stepson.Do we know why Rolfe was fired? No. That will be determined in a court of law. But we know enough to say the simple story presented on Tucker Carlson was reductive and misleading.It suggests we should be more cautious making broad conclusions about societal trends based on one-sided anecdotes. Another anecdote that has been widely embraced by critics of cancel culture is the firing of David Shor. We are told that Shor, a 28-year-old political data scientist, was fired from his job at Civis Analytics fortweetinga research paper that concluded race riots reduced Democratic turnout in the 1960s.This claim is repeatedagain, andagain, andagain. If Shor was fired for tweeting an academic paper, that seems unfair.But neither Civis Analytics nor Shor, who signed a non-disclosure agreement, has confirmed he was fired for the tweet. ""These rumors are incorrect and unsubstantiated. Civis was founded on the principles of free speech and the pursuit of truth through objective scientific research, and that has not changed. This is an internal personnel matter, and out of respect for our employees and alumni, we won’t be commenting further,"" Civis Analytics toldThe Atlantic.Do we know why Shor was fired? No. But an unconfirmed anecdote is not evidence that our society has been turned upside down.This is important because the concept of ""cancel culture"" is being used toarguethat ""protests for racial and social justice"" have gone too far because they have created ""a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity."" We are told that ""institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.""Many people are treated unfairly. But there is little evidence that unfair treatment is now disproportionately impacting, for example, supporters of the police rather than minority groups. Free speech is a bedrock principle of American democracy. But free speech is not inconsistent with being held accountable for your words and actions.Support Accountability JournalismGET YOUR UNIQUE LINK TO SHARE",2

I really believe that holding resentments would hurt me ultimately.”Stevens wasarrested after cops said they found a gun in a car in which she was riding with two men in Queens.Her arrest was prominently played in the news media. Stevens went from deputy director of the Office of Criminal Justice — where she worked onimplementing a law to raise the age at which juvenile suspects are treated as adultsin courtrooms — to jobless and without insurance.Her troubles began in Queens, as she rode in the back seat of a 2002 Infiniti that also carried two men on her way to play basketball.When the men, Ceasar Forbes and Montel Hughes, stopped for cigarettes on 106th Ave. near 177th St. in Jamaica, cops approached the car and began searching it.Shortly before the stop — at about 10:20 p.m. — a nearby NYPD ShotSpotter microphone system had picked up the sound of five gunshots, cops said at the time.During their search of the car, officers found a 9mm handgun in a green velvet bag in the glove compartment, as well as a spent shell casing by Stevens’ feet.Cops arrested Forbes, Hughes and Stevens when none of them admitted the gun was theirs, according to a criminal complaint.But Stevens denied the two officers asked her any questions about the weapon and said she didn’t know of the gun’s presence until the charges in the case were read to her in Queens Criminal Court.“I did not know about the gun being in the car,” Stevens said Friday.By that time, the news media had caught wind of the arrest, and Stevens found out from news stories that she was suspended without pay or benefits from her city job, she told The News.A month after her arrest, Stevens gave a DNA sample, which didn’t match DNA on the gun, according to her lawsuit.“There wasn’t any evidence tying her to the gun so the charges were all dismissed,” a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case told The News.Finally, in November 2018 — after Stevens had spent seven months trying to pick up the pieces of her life — the case was dismissed and sealed, according to a certificate of disposition viewed by The News.In December 2018, Stevens sued the NYPD officers on the case in Brooklyn Supreme Court for false arrest and illegal stop and frisk.One of the arresting officers in Stevens’ case, Justin Ellis — a defendant in Stevens’ lawsuit — subsequently lost hisgun and shield after getting arrested in 2020 for shooting his wife’s physical traineroutside the cop’s Seaford home during a fight.Ellis’ criminal case is still pending and his lawyer confirmed he is still a member of the NYPD.Stevens is now working as a temp in a group home for young mothers.“My client is thrilled she was vindicated of all charges and can finally put this event behind her,” said Cary London, Stevens’ lawyer.",1

The identity of Babbitt’s shooter has not been released, but it had been believed to be a Capitol police officer who fired the shot, allegedly to prevent Babbitt and others from breaking through a door. Trump, however, has suggested that it was the“head of security”for a top Democrat who was behind Babbitt’s death.Bartiromo first brought up the“speculation,”and Trump confirmed he’s heard the same things.“I've heard also that it was the head of security for a certain high official, a Democrat,”Trump said.The shooter, the former president added, is being“protected,”but the truth“will come out.”Trump on who shot Ashli Babbitt: ""I've heard also that it was the head of security for a certain high official.

Great interview this morning with@MariaBartiromo.Liberal pundits have not been so suspicious of the death, and many blasted the president’s latest suggestions, claiming it could“inflame”some on the right.1. Trump is, right before our eyes, rewriting Jan. 6 into a stabbed-in-the-back narrative, with Ashli Babbitt as a Horst Wessell style martyr. And Fox, once hesitant, is now on board out of fear they're losing audience to NewsMax and OAN.https://t.co/PgWs0nobGnI've been reporting on the meaning of Ashli Babbitt to the far right for a few months now.

He also recently joined a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Google, and Twitter, seeking to take away those platforms’ ability to discriminate against people based on political opinions. Trump’s political future, however, has been open to speculation, with the president hinting multiple times that a 2024 presidential run could happen.Asked if he will be running by Bartiromo, Trump said he“knows”whether he is running or not and people are“going to be very happy”with his decision.“I absolutely know my answer, and we’re going to do very well and people are going to be very happy,”he said.",1
47,San Francisco Buyback An Absolute Joke,14.67,26.0,https://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2020/12/14/san-francisco-buyback-joke/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,bearingarms,18,"The City of San Francisco is one of the most notoriously anti-gun communities in one of the most anti-gun states in the nation. It’s not a place you’re going to be comfortable in if you’re a gun person. Nor will you enjoy it if you dislike human fecal matter on the sidewalks, but hey, what can you do?San Francisco, like so many other anti-gun cities, recentlyhad a gun buyback.More than 225 guns were returned Saturday during an annual gun buyback program in San Francisco.The event was organized by the San Francisco Mayor’s Office ofViolence Prevention Services, the San Francisco Police Department and the United Playaz, a San Francisco-based violence prevention and youth development organization.United Playaz founder Rudy Corpuz said people turned in 228 guns, including 8 assault rifles during the four-hour event Saturday.Those who brought in handguns got $100 and those who turned in “assault weapons” got $100. I’m sure people feel so much safer now.San Francisco has a population of over 883,000 people, and they only got 228 firearms? Seriously? This is supposed to count as some kind of a big win?Well, it’s not.See, those guns–including the eight “assault weapons” turned in–came from lawful gun owners who simply didn’t want their firearms anymore and didn’t know how to sell them otherwise. That’s about it.After all, if people knew they could take them to a gun store and have them sold on consignment and thus make a lot more, I suspect people would be all over it. They didn’t, though, and thanks to California’s laws, they couldn’t sell them directly to individuals who they knew to be responsible gun owners, they may not have known there were any other choices.But the number of guns is pathetically small when you think of the size of the city of San Francisco.How many people will actually delude themselves to believe that the buyback made their community safer? How many actually think that those guns made any bit of a difference?Far too many.Look, I don’t begrudge people getting rid of guns they don’t want. What I begrudge are communities doing this kind of thing in order to look like they’re making some kind of an effort to combat violent crime without having to actually address violent crime. That’s all this is. It’s theater, a dramatic presentation to make people feel better about their city and the elected officials who need them for reelection.At no point will this benefit anyone else, so let’s not pretend it’s some unmitigated good. They didn’t take guns off the street, they took them from people who represented absolutely no threat whatsoever. The criminals, however, aren’t going to give their guns up nearly so easily, especially for such paltry sums.No, they’ll keep their guns and make as much money from a single holdup as they would turning their guns in.Please, as a society, can we stop kidding ourselves about what we’re doing with these buybacks? You know, just to shake things up.",0

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has been one of the most influential Republicans in Washington. Scion of one of the most powerful families in conservative politics, she served in several positions in the Bush administration and was elected as the House representative from Wyoming in 2016 — the same seat her father held for many years. She then moved up to the third-ranking position in the House Republican caucus, and waswidely assumedto have a bright future.But now her political career is coming to an end. She faces aprimary challenge from the extreme right, and anupcoming votebacked by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to kick her out of her leadership position. She is expected to lose in both cases, but even if she doesn't, it's clear her upward trajectory in Republican politics is over. Completely unscrupulous will to power and toadying fealty to Donald Trump are now mandatory preconditions for participating in conservative politics.It's important to be clear up front that Cheney has had an exceptionally monstrous career thus far. Her domestic policy record is the usual Bush-era mix of social conservatism and total deference to the oligarch class, but her real passion is foreign policy. Just like her father, she is abloodthirsty imperialist warmonger. After working in support of the Bush administration's wars of aggression inside the administration, she founded a think tank to advocate for an invasion of Iran, and was constantly on conservative mediastoking frenzied bigotry against Muslims.Escape your echo chamber.

She has also been apassionate defender of torture. A toll of800,000-plus deadin America's bungling, pointless imperialist crusade in the Middle East is apparently not enough for her.AsJohn Nichols points outat The Nation, prior to January 6 Cheney was a bitter partisan, known for telling hysterical lies about Democrats; while campaigning for Trump in 2019, she said Democrats were ""the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism."" She is more responsible than most for inflaming right-wing extremism.That said, when Trump attempted to overthrow the government and install himself as president-for-life with a putsch, Cheney turned against him. Shevoted to impeach him afterwards, and continued attacking his lie that the election had been stolen. For a brief time after the putsch — when, let us remember, numerous GOPmembers of CongressandVice President Pencewere nearly lynched by the mob — that was an acceptable opinion for a Republican to have.It is no longer. Trump hasreasserted complete controlover the Republican Party, demanding (and receiving) slavish obedience to his will. In this he has the backing of the vast majority of the Republican base, some70 percent of whombelieve his lie that Biden stole the election. Cheney's stubborn refusal to submit to Trump is therefore heresy that must be stamped out.Now as her career goes down in flames, Cheney haswritten an op-edfor The Washington Post urging her fellow Republicans not to abandon democracy. ""Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,"" she writes. ""The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.""The effect of this argument on her fellow Republicans is a foregone conclusion. It will be angrily rejected — indeed, it likely increases the chances she will be purged from the party. One reason is that she is needed as a scapegoat to deflect from other Republicans' betrayal of Trump after the putsch. As she notes, McCarthy himself said on January 13: ""The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding."" What's more, McCarthy isreportedly worriedhe would be called to testify before theproposedJanuary 6 Commission about how he called Trump that day begging him to call off the mob. He would rather that episode be forgotten.Another reason is the character of Republican elites. They are ruthless in their quest for total power, but they can also be counted on to be utter cowards when it comes to confronting Trump or the right's other deranged media personalities. As oneRepublican official toldThe Washington Post in November after Trump refused to concede his loss, ""What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?"" (AskCapitol Police officer Mike Fanoneabout that.) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after briefly criticizing Trump for the putsch, has thereafter clammed up about the former president to the point of studiously pretending not to hear Trump's constant personal insults — herefused to commentThursday on a Trump statement calling him ""gutless and clueless.""There was a moment, probably lasting no more than a few hours after the putsch, when Trump critics might have rounded up enough Republican votes in the Senate to convict Trump and prevent him from holding federal office ever again. This might have even been a smart political move — Cheney is likely calculating that given Trump'sabysmal approval rating, the GOP would be better off ditching him and pretending his whole presidency never happened, as they did with Richard Nixon. But almost all the critics (including Democrats) chose todither and procrastinate, which allowed Republicans to dose themselves up with right-wing propaganda and get back on the low road.Conservative media has gradually pivoted fromdownplayingor denying the Capitol putsch tooutright defending it. The putschist strategy of winning at any cost, regardless of votes, has become theovert GOP plan for upcoming elections. As my colleagueJoel Mathis writes, ""The insurrectionists have taken over the Republican Party.""So the choice Cheney outlines in her article has already been made. Republicans have chosen Trump over the Constitution, which they are plotting to overturn to set up one-party rule. If he runs in 2024, he almost certainly will get the nomination. Previous conservative policy dogma no longer matters in the slightest. As the conservative Club for Growthpoints out, Cheney's probable successor, Elise Stefanik, has a much less orthodox voting record. But when it comes to licking Trump's wingtips, her record (like Trump's shoes)is spotless. Her political future, unlike Cheney's, is bright.",1
50,Biden Struggles on Israeli-Palestinian Flare-Up,-1.67,43.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/14/biden-israeli-palestinian-gaza-crisis-diplomacy-blinken-netanyahu-hamas/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-14,foreignpolicy,25,"In recent days, the Biden administration has dispatched an envoy to the Middle East and engaged in a flurry of back-channel diplomacy to respond to the surge in violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The big question is: Does the United States have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?In recent days, the Biden administration has dispatched an envoy to the Middle East and engaged in a flurry of back-channel diplomacy to respond to the surge in violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The big question is:Does the United States have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?The escalating conflict between Israeli security forces and Palestinian militants has sparked furious debates among Biden administration insiders on whether the United States should play a leading or supporting role in defusing the crisis, even though it has yet to completely fill its own ranks of senior administration posts overseeing the Middle East.The Biden administration, pushing to shift U.S. foreign policy toward confronting China, showed little interest in diving into the Middle East peace process before the latest explosion of violence, which has culminated in deadly rocket barrages fired into Israel from Gaza and Israeli counterstrikes targeting Hamas militants. But due to the urgency of the crisis, and mounting pressure from U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to respond more forcefully, that may no longer be an option, experts and former officials said.“This was not on their policy priority list at all,” said Kirsten Fontenrose, the director of the Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council. “Now, they’re going to be forced to take it on as a primary priority, and I don’t think they’re ready for that.”Israel’s military said on Thursday that it began operations to fight against Hamas militants in Gaza.“I’ve never seen Gaza in my three and a half years here so empty. It’s like a ghost town. You know, people really were terrified to move onto the street,” said Matthias Schmale, the Gaza-based operations director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid and services to Palestinian refugees. “There’s not really been a lull in the fighting,” he said in a phone interview that was interrupted by the sound of an explosion. “There’s constant rockets from here and really very heavy violent responses from the other side.”Meanwhile, a surge in intercommunal violence between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel has further escalated the crisis, along with widespread Palestinian protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. On Friday, protesters on theJordanian borderwith the occupied West Bank were able to breach Jordanian security forces, while Lebanese demonstrators haveattempted the sameon Israel’s northern border. There are also reports of Syrians gathering in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Demonstrations could only intensify this weekend, as Palestinians commemorate the anniversary of theNakba—the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what would become Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War—on May 15.Some analysts and U.N. officials voiced fears that if a truce isn’t brokered in the next several days, the violence could escalate into a protracted conflict for weeks or even longer. Political paralysis in Israel, which was on the cusp of a fifth round of elections in less than two years, and a delay in Palestinian elections to resolve fractious political lines across the occupied territories could further complicate any potential peace talks.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday that he was dispatching an envoy to the region to try to de-escalate the crisis. Hady Amr, a deputy assistant secretary of state, worked on Middle East peace initiatives in the Obama administration. Amr is viewed in Washington as the best interlocutor to engage with the Palestinians, according to several former officials. Other current and former officials said the Biden administration should work to coordinate truce talks with other regional powers that have close contacts with Palestinian political leaders and Hamas. This includes Egypt, which has outsized influence in the occupied Palestinian territories and helped broker a cease-fire in the 2014 Gaza war, and Qatar, which is seen to have close ties to Hamas.Schmale said his agency has been providing Israel with location data on U.N. facilities to ensure they don’t get bombed and that he has received assurances from Hamas that it will not use UNRWA schools and other facilities for military purposes. “They said the same in 2014, and we still found weapons … and we ensured those weapons were removed.”Current and former U.S. and U.N. officials say Egypt and Qatar are quietly coordinating with the U.N. to try to carve out a path for cease-fire talks. Egyptian mediators traveled to Israel this week but so far to no avail. One additional complicating factor for President Joe Biden is that the United States does not yet have senior envoys permanently stationed on the ground to address the crisis nor a more senior confirmed diplomat in place in Washington. Biden named veteran diplomat Barbara Leaf as his nominee to be top envoy for the Middle East last month, but she has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.Former U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler and Thomas Nides, a banker and former State Department official, are front-runners to be Biden’s ambassador to Israel, according to several people familiar with the matter. But four months into office, Biden has yet to formally name a nominee for the post. The Biden administration also has yet toreopenits consulate in Jerusalem, a de facto diplomatic mission to the Palestinians, due in part to pushback from the Israelis. The Trump administration shut it down in 2019, a year after it moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“We’ve got to reopen the consulate,” said Ilan Goldenberg, an expert at the Center for a New American Security and a former diplomat who worked on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. “It’s in [Israel’s] interest and our interest for the U.S. to have the ability to engage with Palestinians on the ground, as we’re seeing right now. So in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, I really hope that reopening the consulate becomes a priority.”In Washington, Biden is facing conflicting pressures from both the progressive flank of the Democratic Party—which has become sharply critical of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians—and centrist Democrats and Republicans urging him to do more to support Israel. On Thursday night, members of the House Progressive Caucus took the House floor to voice their support for Palestinian rights and concerns about the escalating situation in Gaza, in statements that reflected the sharp and growing splits among Democrats over U.S. ties to Israel.Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, joined other progressives in urging Biden to pare back support for Israel and condition or restrict U.S. military aid to Israel as the violence continued. The United States provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually.“The truth is that this is not a conflict between two states. This is not a civil war. It is a conflict where one country—funded and supported by the United States government—continues an illegal military occupation over another group of people,” Omar said. She later lashed out at the Biden administration’s responseon Twitter.Administration insiders say pressure from the progressive caucus is unlikely to sway Biden’s position on U.S. support for Israel, at least in the short term. Both Biden and Blinken have voiced support for Israel’s right to defend itself in statements this week, though Blinken on Wednesday stressed that Israel “has an extra burden” to avert civilian casualties in its retaliatory strikes in Gaza.is a diplomacy and national security reporter at.

52,Trump's Save America leadership PAC hasn’t spent the $75 million it raised on “election integrity.”,-13.67,37.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/trump-save-america-leadership-pac-keeping-usd75-million.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,slate,25,"The rub was always in the fine print. Even after Donald Trump, the actual president of the United States, lost the 2020 election, he cranked up the outrage machine claiming election fraud, hinting at grand conspiracies, and sending Rudy Giuliani barnstorming to provide visuals, footage, new cautious news stories, that could be used to help spin the many, many yarns he was spinning on the fly. Meanwhile, Trump and his associated PACsraked in hundreds of millionson the chaos, confusion, and destruction. Their fundraising emails shouted things like “We MUST defend the Election from the Left!” as theysoaked upcash from low-dollar donors who believed the president. The small print at the bottom whispered something very different: The first 75 percent of these #StoptheSteal donations to the Trump fundraising apparatus were redirected to Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, which was for Trump to spend more or less as he wished.The entirety of Donald Trump’s life so far has been, essentially, a string of grifts, and so it’s unsurprising that his presidential (and post-presidential) life has been no different. The election outrage that Trump fomented in pockets of deep-red Trump country has shaken the democratic foundations of the country and, once again, allowed Trump to pull off a sleight of hand and pocket tens of millions of dollars. The Washington Postreportsthat Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, which raised some $75 million in the first half of 2021 on the back of his barrage of lies about the 2020 election, has yet to spend any of that money in support the recounts, ballot reviews, and other shenanigans he inspired in Republican-run statehouses across the country. Ahead of the July 31 filing date for how the organization has spent its money, Trump confidantes explained to the Post that Trump was “uninterested in personally bankrolling the efforts, relying on other entities and supporters to fund the endeavors.”Instead, Trump’s keeping the money to play around with—though a Trump adviser dutifully clung to the Trump election racket, telling the Post that Trump had not ruled out spending the money on state ballot review efforts “at some point down the road.” Uh-huh. Instead, the money has gone to funding Trump’s professional lifestyle, which is inextricably intertwined with Trump’s personal existence and the ecosystem of Trump’s long grift. That long play may involve running for president again, though it may not, but either way it requires relevance and a platform, both of which are made possible by those large wads of cash. The money demands attention from candidates, voters, and therefore media; the attention, in turn, produces more cash. So Donald Trump isn’t going anywhere because he has finally found a swindle in American politics where he can quite literally just ask people for money and they simply give it to him by the millions. It’s not complicated. It never is with Trump. He’s just doing the thing he telegraphed he would do from the very beginning and stated explicitly in the smallprint.",1

With millions expected to vote by mail in November due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some worry DeJoy’s cuts to the service he oversees could affect the 2020 election.Trump has beenunderminingthe U.S. Postal Service since he took office. He has mocked the agency as a “joke,” refused to back a pandemic-relatedbailout for the agency, proposedcuts to its budget, exploredprivatizating it, andinsistedthat it raise the rates it charges Amazon for shipping. The online retail company’s founder, Jeff Bezos,ownsthe Washington Post, a news outlet Trumpfrequentlyderides for publishing unflattering stories.DeJoy is a wealthybusinessmanandfinance chairfor the 2020 Republican National Convention who hadgivenhundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump’s reelection campaign and other GOP lawmakers before he was appointed.The website Sludgereportedlast week that DeJoy also gave $114,500 to a special Republican National Committee legal fund dedicated to filing lawsuits to prevent states from expanding voting access.At the time of his appointment, criticsnotedDeJoy had millions invested in U.S. Postal Service competitors and contractors and that he is the first person in decades tapped to lead the Postal Service without prior experience working directly for the agency.In acolumn published by NBC News in July, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington deputy director Donald K. Sherman and Common Cause director of voting and elections Sylvia Albert raised these conflicts of interest and warned that DeJoy’s selection “threatens to corrupt one of America’s most trusted institutions at a key moment.”Since DeJoy took over, their fears appear to have beenborne out.Fortunereportedlast month that DeJoy planned to slow mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. It cited a recent internal Postal Service memo that warned that “one aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that—temporarily—we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks, which is not typical.”DeJoydefendedthe elimination of overtime pay for postal workers as designed to “ensure that we meet our service standards.”The agency is also considering closing multiple local post offices in upcoming months, according to a MarketWatchreportlast week. And many locations have alreadyreducedtheir hours of operation.Even beyond these cuts, some communities have been experiencing major delivery delays. The Philadelphia Inquirerreportedthis week that delays in the Philadelphia region were leaving some waiting more than three weeks to receive letters and packages. The article noted that coronavirus cases among postal workers have been a contributing factor, leaving many routes without a regular or substitute carrier.With elections coming up and more people planning to vote by mail due to the pandemic, advocatesworrythe delays could mean ballots will not get to voters or polling places on time. And some have suggested this could be intentional.“We have an underfunded state and local election system and a deliberate slowdown in the Postal Service,” Wendy Fields, the executive director of the Democracy Initiative,toldthe New York Times last week. Trump, she claimed, was “deliberately orchestrating suppression and using the post office as a tool to do it.”For his part, Trump has seized on the challenges the Postal Service is facing as anargumentagainst allowing voting by mail at all.Last week, Trumptweeteda video from a Georgia television station showing an experiment in which a reporter mailed hundreds of ballot-shaped envelopes to a post office box to see how long it took them to arrive. Most, but not all, had arrived within several days. The reporter observed that the small percentage that did not immediately arrive could represent an important portion of the vote in a close election.Trump thencitedthis “testing” as an example of why voting by mail in the 2020 elections would not work. “Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster,” he claimed.On Monday, he argued against Nevada’s new law mandating that every registered voter automatically receive a ballot in the mail for the November election,tweetingthat the “Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation.”This week, House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn MaloneyaskedDeJoy to testify next month about “recent changes to U.S. Postal Service operations and standards and the need for on-time mail delivery during the ongoing pandemic and upcoming election.” Hereportedlyagreed to do so.In an email, a U.S. Postal Service spokesperson wrote that the agency is in financial trouble and that “Congress and the Postal Regulatory Commission must enact legislative and regulatory reforms to help address the situation. At the same time, it is imperative for the Postal Service to operate efficiently and effectively, while continuing to provide service that meets the needs of our customers.”The statement noted that “the Postal Service remains fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when public policy makers choose to utilize the mail as a part of their election system, and to delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.“To be clear however, and despite any assertions to the contrary, we are not slowing down Election Mail or any other mail,” the statement continued. “Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with our standards.”It concluded by noting that “the notion that the Postmaster General makes decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the President is wholly misplaced and off-base.”Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation.On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris called on Georgia voting rights advocates and elected officials to continue to fight for expanded access to the ballot box as the election cycle gears up for this November’s presidential election.The 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as electors for President Donald Trump in 2020 even though he had lost the election settled a lawsuit against them Wednesday, acknowledging their actions were part of an effort to overturn the election results.Last week, New Hampshire’s Supreme Court followed suit. In a 3-2 decision, the court found that the state’s courts also do not have the authority to overturn legislative maps accused of partisan gerrymandering.",1
54,Op-Ed: Don’t exempt religious objectors from vaccine mandates,-5.67,35.0,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-23/religious-exemption-mandatory-vaccination-policies-constitution,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,latimes,25,"Policies requiring vaccination against COVID-19 need not include, and should not include, exceptions for those who have religious objections to vaccinations.Many universities, including the University of California, are requiring vaccination for all students, staff and faculty returning to campus. Many employers, public and private, are doing so as well. These policies are essential to protect public health. The virulent Delta variant of the coronavirus has made it imperative to ensure vaccination of as many people as possible.Unfortunately, though, many of these policies have an exception for those who have a religious objection to vaccination. These are neither required by the law nor are they desirable as a matter of policy because they make it possible for anyone to circumvent the vaccine mandate.The UC’s mandatory vaccination policy, for example, has an exception for those who object on religious grounds. It states that this is because the law requires such an exemption,declaring:“The University is required by law to offer reasonable accommodations to ... employees who object to vaccination based on their sincerely-held religious belief, practice, or observance.”This is simply wrong as a matter of law. No law requires such a religious exemption. In terms of free exercise of religion under the 1st Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled more than 30 years ago in Employment Division vs. Smith that the Constitution does not require exceptions to general laws for religious beliefs. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court said that as long as a law is neutral, not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion and of general applicability to all individuals, it cannot be challenged based on free exercise of religion. In June, in Fulton vs. City of Philadelphia, the court reaffirmed this legal test.Laws that require vaccination are the epitome of a neutral law of general applicability: a requirement that applies to everyone and that was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. Even if this were not so, the government can infringe on religious freedom if its action is necessary to achieve a compelling interest.Stopping the spread of a deadly communicable disease is obviously a compelling interest and vaccinations are the best way to reach that goal. No one, in practicing his or her religion, has a constitutional right to endanger others.Indeed, a number of states, before COVID-19, created mandates for children to be vaccinated against other communicable diseases without making exemptions for religious beliefs. Without exception, the lower courts have upheld these mandates as constitutional.Nor do federal employment discrimination laws require a religious exception for employees. In the 1977 case Trans World Airlines vs. Hardison, the Supreme Court said that employers do not have to bear more than a “de minimus” cost in accommodating employees’ religious beliefs. Vaccine exemptions could impose a significant cost on employers in terms of illness and therefore clearly are not required.Religious exemptions, like in the University of California policy, are for those with “sincerely held religious beliefs.” But how can this possibly be determined?The Supreme Court has said that religious beliefs are personal and it does not matter whether they are in accord with the teachings and dictates of a particular faith. Under this broad principle, any person could get a vaccination exemption merely by stating that he or she has a religious objection against it.Such an easy opt-out could make the mandate illusory. That is why the only way to have a meaningful vaccination requirement is to apply it to everyone — except those for whom vaccination is not medically advisable.As people return to the workplace and to campuses the spread of COVID-19 remains a great danger, especially with the highly transmissible Delta variant circulating. The unvaccinated not only endanger themselves and other unvaccinated people, but also those who cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons. And now, there are growing reports of breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated individuals.Universities and employers have the legal right to make sure that everyone is vaccinated. And they have the moral duty to protect health and lives.Erwin Chemerinsky is dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and a contributing writer to Opinion.

He mentioned NYU communications to his students and a department email urging him to stop teaching the course, and claimed he was acting in self-defense.The professor toldthat NYU Steinhardt School Dean Jack Knott told him the investigation would conclude by the end of the semester, but gave him no other details.Miller, who has spent more than 20 years on the NYU faculty, filed alawsuitin New York State court Nov. 30 after his colleagues did not retract their statements and apologize as he demanded.He shared several NYU communications withto illustrate his legal claims. Miller explained in a phone interview that he wasn’t suing any of the junior professors who signed the letter: “Whether they signed it, willingly or not, I’m sure they had no choice.”According to the suit, Miller’s colleagues intended to “disgrace and humiliate” the professor “under the guise of phony and uninformed political and cultural correctness and orthodoxy.” He’s seeking $750,000 in damages, saying their letter led to loss of professional standing and the worsening of his Lyme disease.The faculty letter “takes every conceivable opportunity to cast me in a bad light,” Miller told. He also said in a separate email that the charges from his colleagues are “so false as to seem downright psychotic.”:Judge tells NYU it can’t punish students for breaking after-the-fact COVID rulesIf Miller is a right-wing conspiracy theorist, he’s an unconventional one. The professor isnamedon Turning Point USA’s Professor Watchlist, which identifies faculty who allegedly promote “leftist propaganda in the classroom.”He also helped lead a movement in 2012 tohalt NYU’s redevelopment plansfor the Greenwich Village campus. The resulting lawsuitsuccessfully challengednearly half of the university’s expansion plan, though Miller toldthe experience also convinced him not to sue NYU itself this time.Politically, Miller considers himself a leftist: “I’m anti-war, I believe in empowering the working class, cutting back corporate power – I could go on and on.” He said progressive luminaries such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Oliver Stone signed his petition, and Ralph Nader provided a separate statement of support.The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, whopublicly accused NYUof forcing him out of a fellowship because of pressure from Beijing, also signed Miller’s petition, the professor said.:NYU declines to testify in Congress about its China campusBut Miller also believes the left has “changed radically over the years. I don’t really recognize it anymore.” The left today wants “censorship and government authority to be accepted without question—except if it’s Trump,” he said.Some of the professor’s colleagues have long despised him for his course content and extramural statements on subjects including the Sandy Hook massacre and transgender ideology.But a civil liberties group told NYU that Miller’s alleged conduct is expressly protected by its own policies, and cited court rulings against private universities including New York City’s Fordham.One group is not weighing in on the dispute: the American Association of University Professors. A representative toldin an email that AAUP’s department of academic freedom and tenure confirmed “we haven’t been involved with this case,” and declined to comment further.Student Julia Jackson tagged NYU in atweet threadSept. 20 to complain that Miller had “spent an entire class period telling students that wearing masks doesn’t prevent the spread of COVID-19.” She also claimed that he said “hydroxychloroquine trials were made to fail so more people would be given the vaccine and have their DNA changed.”She linked to articles and videos shared by Miller, including atwo–partinterview of Canadian physicist Denis Rancourt on One America News Network (), describing them as conspiratorial and “far-right.”Jacksoncalled onNYU to “relieve him” of educating and advising students. MCC Chair Rodney Benson thanked her for reporting the issue and said the department had “made this a priority.”MillerrespondedOct. 6 on his News From Underground blog, explaining that his pedagogical style is to teach students how to identify propaganda drives and seek out alternative claims.He urged his students to read studies that conclude masks and ventilators are ineffective at preventing transmission of the novel coronavirus and saving lives, “with due attention to the scientific reviews thereof.” Miller cited “possible financial links between” researchers and interests such as “Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation.”The blog post embedded Jackson’s tweet thread and mentioned a Sept. 21 email to Miller’s students from Knott and Carlo Ciotoli, who leads NYU’s COVID-19 Prevention and Response Team.:Miller’s student tries to get him firedMiller providedwith this email (below), which he said a student forwarded to him. Prefaced by the claim that NYU has the “utmost respect for the principles of academic freedom,” it referred students to “the most authoritative public health guidance” – CDCrecommendations.“The evidence backs it up,” the email continued, linking sources. “And we remind you thatwearing a mask is required at NYU.” The NYU leaders said “we do not feel we have a choice” in pushing back on Miller’s alleged comments.Miller said he didn’t tell students to break the university’s mask mandate, which he actively observes – a point emphasized in his lawsuit.The blog post alleged that NYU had urged Miller to cancel his propaganda course because it would be “better for the department” if he instead chose to teach two sections on cinema. (Miller toldSunday that the quoted phrase was from an email sent by the department’s administrative assistant, while a later phone call with Benson, the MCC chair, claimed the change would be better for enrollment.)It linked to apetitionto back Miller’s cause, which as of Monday night has been signed by more than 20,000 people. Miller toldlast week that the blind Chinese lawyer Guangcheng, who memorably escaped house arrest in China, was among them.Guangchengclaimedto have been forced out by NYU following “great, unrelenting pressure” from Chinese communists, at a time when the university was building a campus in Shanghai.NYU stated that Guangcheng’s stay was based on a one-year fellowship and that his claims were “both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,” including that the foreign campus was approved to be built before the dissident’s arrival at NYU.The Oct. 21 faculty letter to Steinhardt Dean Knott and Provost Katherine Fleming criticized the views that “Miller has espoused on his highly visible website” over the years.While it doesn’t say what is “highly visible” about Miller’s blog, the letter complains that “he prominently displays his title as a full tenured professor in our department.”Miller has characterized “transgender surgery as a eugenic form of sterilization,” mocked transgender people and denied “the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting,” they alleged.While Miller has a right to his views, his colleagues object to “discrimination, attacks against students and others in our community, or advocacy for an unsafe learning environment.” Students have complained about his discussion of controversial viewpoints and “non-evidence based arguments” for years, yet frequent complaints to bias review offices and administrators have not “improved” the situation. (The letter does not mention any specific complaints.)Miller’s post that linked Jackson’s public tweets opened an opportunity for “cyberbullying and threatening communication directed toward the student,” which “subsequently occurred and continues,” the letter claimed.I hope@nyuniversity,@nyusteinhardt, and@mccNYUagree that this professor should not be trusted with educating and advising students, and I hope they take immediate steps to relieve him of these duties. 8/— Julia Jackson (@julia_jacks)September 21, 2020:Cornell vaccine mandate only applies to white studentsIt called for an “expedited review” of Miller’s “intimidation tactics, abuses of authority, aggressions and microaggressions, and explicit hate speech,” to be followed by “whatever further disciplinary measures are deemed appropriate.”In an email provided by Miller, Dean Knott told the professor Oct. 29 that an investigation had been opened that day. “I will ask Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs LaRue Allen to begin this review immediately” and decide, based on the collected information, whether to proceed “with next steps as outlined in the Faculty Handbook,” Knott wrote.Miller conveyed his shock at receiving the email in a Thursday phone call with. “I was completely surprised that he hadn’t talked to me first,” he said. In a Zoom meeting requested by Miller, Knott said that NYU “lawyers and provost told him that they had to” investigate.Knott wouldn’t give him the scope of the investigation except that “they would talk to people,” according to Miller. “And I said what people? And he said, faculty and students. And I said, what faculty? None of them have seen me teach. And he said: well yeah, so the students.”Miller then told the dean that he would solicit and send testimonials from current and former students, “maybe 40 letters” so far that “make abundantly clear that there is not a shred of truth” in the colleagues’ letter. He excerpted several in his blog post.A few days after this meeting, Miller confronted his colleagues’ charges in arebuttalhe shared with.He called “nearly all” their claims “demonstrably untrue,” and the letter “misleading in its various insinuations.” Miller did not launch an email campaign against the department, as they claimed, but rather highlighted “NYU’s violation of my academic freedom.”Miller reiterated his public assertion that he simply encouraged students to read “scientific studies—eight randomized, controlled trials, conducted among health professionals over the last 15 years or so—finding that masks are ineffective against transmission of respiratory viruses.”On Sunday he pointedto his Sept. 5essay“Masking Ourselves to Death” for sources:researchfrom Rancourt, the Canadian physicist, as well asJoshua Jacobs,B. J. Cowling,Faisal bin-Reza,Jeffrey Smith,Vittoria Offeddu,Lewis RadonovichandYoulin Long.The essay mentions the two-part interview with Rancourt and adebatehe had with “another COVID-19 dissident,” physician Joseph Mercola, whose videos “have been banned on YouTube and Spotify since mid-June.” Miller also provided alinkto Mercola’s website pertaining to the censorship.Miller emphasized that he “very clearly” told students that he was “telling you not to wear masks,” but simply engaging in an intellectual exercise. Responding to the email from Knott and Ciotoli, he noted the CDC guidelines “that you regard as gospel truth abruptly changed in early April.” Previously they had “echoed the consensus of the [randomized controlled trials] that I encouraged my students to examine.”It is “wholly false” that he “attacked” Jackson, when in fact “the student attacked, on Twitter, demanding that NYU fire me.” She didn’t speak up during that class and did not “bother reading any of those studies,” he claimed. “How, and where, and when,I‘attacked’ her your letter fails to specify—as it could not, because I never did.”NYU professor who questions COVID orthodoxy demands colleagues retract false claims about himbyThe College Fixon Scribd:Stanford lockdown skeptic disinvited from academic conferenceBy publicly writing under her own name, Jackson tweets “provoked attacks by others, which had nothing to do with me,” Miller continued, adding that he had received similar attacks spurred by Jackson’s tweets. (While he mentioned “three media hit-pieces” against him, Miller did not identify the articles.)He only identified Jackson by name once, in the petition defending himself, to show that she demanded his firing. “To cast me as the aggressor in this case is as perverse as your accusing me of having attacked” the department, he said.His website does not have “a single mention of Sandy Hook” and he only mentioned the school massacre in a class discussion on gun control. Miller recommended “some troublingly compelling scholarship on Sandy Hook” to students, because “we cannot simply rule out any argument that deviates from the official story.” (He exempted speculation about child-sex-slave colonies on Mars, whichsaid was shared by a guest on theAlex Jones Show.)Regarding the alleged transgender mockery, Miller said the university “quickly exculpated” him from secondhand claims by a colleague, defendant Nicole Starosielski, based on “three brief online writings.”His writing on the subject is “highly critical of transgender” because of its “troubling real-world consequences” in sports and prisons and the “radical medical intervention in the sexual development of children.” The ideology has also been aggressively promoted throughout the corporate media with the backing of “multibillionaires with large investments in Big Pharma,” which might have “eugenic purposes.”Miller cited his own “pleasant” email exchange with a transgender colleague at NYU. Though this person signed the letter against him, he understands “why she may have felt obliged” to sign it.The professor said he could make his own allegations about a “hostile work environment” going back “some time, but especially this semester,” citing comments from students about faculty disparaging him.The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education told NYU President Andrew Hamilton in a Nov. 13letterthat the university’s ownstated commitmentto academic freedom meant it must end the investigation into Miller.The civil liberties group noted a New York court ruled in 2019 thatFordham violated its contractual commitmentsby refusing to recognize a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.In a 2018 case closely paralleling the factual allegations in Miller’s dispute, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled thatMarquette University could not punisha professor’s extramural expressions because of its contractual promises on academic freedom.NYU did not respond toqueries on how its Miller investigation was any different from the rulings cited by FIRE.When the university ignored FIRE’s Nov. 20 deadline to respond, the grouppublicly condemnedNYU’s investigation. A spokesperson for the civil liberties group toldlast week that NYU has still not responded.Miller has long been a bee in NYU’s bonnet. He’s one of several named plaintiffs in anongoing class action suitagainst its “mismanagement of our retirement funds,” he told. Having seen the university’s lawyers in action, Miller said they are “extraordinarily aggressive when it comes to legal action.”He’s more surprised by criticism from colleagues – “people whom I did everything I could to serve in trying to halt the real estate plan” and protecting pension funds. Some of them “wrote letters of recommendation” when Miller was “nominated for a distinguished teaching award in 2012.”He emphasized that “I’m not saying this to brag. I’m saying this to demonstrate how egregious this attack is.” Only one faculty member – untenured, from the School of Professional Studies – went to bat for him.Miller is the one person “above all” that the instructor recommends to her students, she wrote to President Hamilton and Provost Fleming Dec. 6. (Miller removed the colleague’s name from the email he showed.):Trump advisor blasts Stanford colleagues for shutting down COVID-19 debateHis propaganda course is the “best” to make students “critical thinkers, a person who can question mass delusions whether they be scientific or political.” She compared Miller to Galileo and Copernicus, who were “condemned for exploring unpopular truths.”The colleague asked rhetorically, whether “Christopher Columbus was a hero or whether masks do prevent the spread of a virus, don’t we want to encourage one and all to look at all the material out there?”Miller toldhe doesn’t attribute the hostility to his political views, but rather to the “discomfiture” his work causes colleagues. He closely studies “official narratives to determine whether they are true or false and to try to figure out what purpose they serve and what interests are behind them.”The political right doesn’t have a monopoly on critiquing the “echo chambers” of academia, he said: “I think it’s also possible to make the same critique from a left-perspective.”Miller sees something similar occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Just for urging the study on the scientific literature on masking as a barrier against respiratory viruses is like a high crime now; that’s killing grandma.”:Prof says anti-maskers support white supremacy, policy brutalityIMAGE: Renegade Inc./YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1

The day had come for him to leave his house for hospice.But it was tough going. Havron’s wife, son and stepson kept asking him — how do you feel? Are you ready to go? Is it time?Confused and slightly disoriented, Havron could only say, “OK.”“Dad was struggling. He was out of it,” his son, Todd Havron, said about that day in 2018. “He couldn’t really vocalize. It was hard to see somebody so strong be so scared.”After about an hour, someone said, “Do we want to call Felice?”Felice Apolinsky — longtime program director of Nashville cancer support organization Gilda’s Club — became close friends with John Havron nine years earlier. That’s when Havron showed up at Gilda’s Club because his first wife had been diagnosed with cancer.With kindness and love, Apolinsky walked him through his wife’s illness and death in 2010. About eight years later, Havron himself got cancer. And Apolinsky walked beside Havron and his relatives again.She showed up to his house just 15 minutes after she got the call. Everyone inside relaxed as soon as she walked in.“It took about two minutes,” Todd Havron said. “He looked at her, said her name, and said, ‘Yeah, I’m ready to go.’”Apolinsky has been building that kind of trust with people since arriving at Gilda’s Club 22 years ago.In June, Apolinsky, 56, announced her retirement to spend more time with her 87-year-old father, who died July 29.But the curly-haired, pint-sized “angel on earth” will retire anyway. Apolinsky will be honored Sept. 3 at Gilda’s Club’sannual Red Door Bash fundraiser, a virtual event this year.She leaves behind a legacy of helping thousands of people with cancer — and loved ones of people with cancer — with big hugs, a quick smile, an open heart and quiet competence.Of those thousands, Apolinsky perhaps grew closest to Havron, who entrusted her with a sacred duty just before he died two years ago.The roots of that relationship started two decades ago when Apolinsky, then a 34-year-old social worker, practically forced herself onto the staff of a brand new Gilda’s Club.She’d been working with Nashville adolescents and others. In 1996, Apolinsky — just months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer — found herself at an organizational meeting for a Nashville chapter of New York-based Gilda’s Club, named for comedian Gilda Radner, who died of cancer in 1989.“I immediately fell in love with the mission,” said Apolinsky, who connected strongly with the group's emphasis on building a community of those dealing with cancer.She sent Nashville Gilda’s Club founder Sandy Towers a 14-page pitch and convinced Towers to go to lunch with her.“She had a better handle on the mission that I even did,” Towers said. “I sat there in utter amazement.”For “minimal pay,” Apolinsky enthusiastically started support groups for those with cancer and for relatives and friends of those with cancer. She also launched nutrition and cooking classes, grief groups, programming for children of people with cancer and more; they're free for participants, supported by donations.Apolinsky and other staffers help Gilda's Club members walk through the sadness of death, but they are quick to point out there is much joy celebrated as well. Much of the club's programming teaches members how to live life after battling cancer.Apolinsky has gone to hundreds of cancer-free anniversary celebrations, birthday parties, baby showers, weddings and parties.Her friends say her sense of humor sometimes is downright goofy. Michael Dinwiddie, Havron's stepson, called Apolinsky “this wonderfully strong yet kooky person.""The real gift, friends and club members say, is her ability to balance those parts of her personality and to walk through endless days of super-charged emotions.“I’m always amazed at the resilience she has to get up every morning and put herself out there,” Towers said.And, Apolinsky has a way of making deep connections with members from their first interactions, several participants say.Katherine Sjoblom, 54, of East Nashville, said she called the club 10 years ago, distraught, after finding out she had bone marrow cancer.""What do I tell my young kids?"" she remembered asking.A staff member put the call through to Apolinsky, who calmly and kindly answered Sjoblom’s questions.“I felt heard, and I felt like someone understood this is a really horrible moment in my life,” Sjoblom said, voice cracking as tears spill from her eyes.“How many times has she given this advice, and yet she still made me feel important?”Apolinsky shows the same compassion and respect to volunteers and fellow staff members.“Felice is genuine, caring, supportive, inclusive and authentic, and what she shows you is from the heart,” said volunteer Dana Davis, 53, a social worker who runs support groups at Gilda’s Club. “I consider Felice a warm hug. And I don’t say that about many people.”Apolinsky remembered that John Havron came into Gilda’s Club for the first time in 2009, devastated that his wife of 40 years, his childhood sweetheart, had brain cancer. Havron stood out to her.“He had sparkly eyes and a beautiful smile, even when he was weeping when he introduced himself,” she said.Havron’s wife died eight months or so after that, and Havron kept coming back for grief groups and for support.“It was a really dark time for him,” Apolinsky said. “His biggest cheerleader had died, and he was going home to an empty house. The nights were very long and very lonely.”Apolinsky started to call Havron regularly. She saw him in her office for informal one-on-ones and encouraged him to do volunteer work.The two formed a strong bond, and eventually Havron emerged from the darkness. He started to date again. Havron brought his girlfriend, and eventual wife, Belinda Dinwiddie Havron, to Gilda’s Club to meet Apolinsky.“I was absolutely terrified to meet her, much more so than I was to meet his children,” Dinwiddie Havron said. “I knew she was a very important part of his life. He knows Felicia and trusts her. What if she says it’s too soon or she doesn’t approve?”Apolinsky approved, and she helped Havron walk through feelings of guilt and disloyalty toward his first wife.Two years ago, Havron called Apolinsky in her office to tell her he had cancer. The prognosis was bleak.She sat in stunned silence for a few minutes before the tears came.“My heart literally hurt,” she said.After Havron went to Alive Hospice, Apolinsky checked in or visited every day until he died three weeks later. During one visit, Havron asked his family to leave the room so he could speak to Apolinsky privately. No one hesitated.Havron then dictated affirmations for each of his children, grandchildren and stepchildren, while Apolinsky clumsily typed into her iPhone notes app.He spoke of one grandchild’s spunk and personality, another’s grace, another’s tenacity. He pointed out one child’s sense of humor, another’s reliability. Havron’s message for his wife: “You are my everything.”Days later, Apolinsky read the affirmations aloud during Havron’s funeral, looking each of his loved ones in the eyes as she read his final messages to them.“It went from honoring my stepfather to him honoring us,” Havron’s stepson Michael Dinwiddie said. “I realized then even more how dear Felice was to my stepfather. Her giving that speech was probably the most appropriate thing.”Apolinsky called it “one of the most important things I had ever done.""“What a gift for each person to know what they meant to him and what he loved most about them and what he wished for them.”:gildasclubmiddletn.org:e.givesmart.com:gildasclubmiddletn.org/ways-to-give/volunteer",2

U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman minced no words in a 113-page takedown of the law.Acknowledging that his was not the last word in a case that is likely headed to the Supreme Court, Pitman basically said he didn’t care—he wasn’t going to stay his judgment. That’s going to be up to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. For Pitman’s part, “The State has forfeited the right to any such accommodation by pursuing an unprecedented and aggressive scheme to deprive its citizens of a significant and well-established constitutional right. From the moment S.B. 8 went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution. That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.”As predicted, Texas is appealing.“Though the court’s ruling offers a sigh of relief, the threat of Texas’ abortion ban still looms over the state as cases continue to move through the courts. We already know the politicians behind this law will stop at nothing until they’ve banned abortion entirely,” the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) Brigitte Amirisaid in a statement. “This fight is far from over, and we’re ready to do everything we can to make sure every person can get the abortion care they need regardless of where they live or how much they make.”The lawsuit was brought by the Biden administration, and in a Twitter thread analyzing Pitman’s decision, Imani Gandyhighlights Pitman's rebuttalto Texas’ argument that the United States government has not suffered harm from the abortion ban, which allowsto sue any person who “aids or abets” an abortion performed after six weeks for $10,000 and attorneys’ fees. Pitman offers a list of federal agencies that “aid or abet” abortions, exposing the agencies or their employees to vigilante claims under the Texas law.But the next courts to hear the case are dominated by partisan Republicans who … don’t really care about the law, let alone women’s right to self-determination or privacy or medical care. Pitman methodically answered many of the outs Texas was trying to use, but the higher courts may still embrace those, dismissing precedent and logic and common f’ing sense.Texas isn’t even the main game in far-right efforts to overturn, though. That’s coming on Dec. 1 in Supreme Court arguments abouta Mississippi lawbanning abortions after 15 weeks, with Mississippi officials making clear that yes, this is an effort to overturnRoe.It’s all too likely that the Trump Supreme Court will jump on this chance to gut women’s reproductive rights.In response to that imminent threat, a group of reproductive rights groups haveshifted their stanceon the filibuster, coming out in favor of filibuster reform or abolition for the first time. “We won’t stand for senators hiding behind the abortion issue and opposing reform in our name,” said Shaunna Thomas of UltraViolet. “We cannot rely on the courts right now, so we’re working with what we have, which is a Dem majority which has promised two things to the women of color who put them in office—the right to vote and the right to control when they have children.”",1

A woman was shot and killed by police, and three others died in apparent medical emergencies. A Trump flag hung on the Capitol. The graceful Rotunda reeked of tear gas. Glass shattered.On Wednesday, hallowed spaces of American democracy, one after another, yielded to the occupation of Congress.The pro-Trump mob took over the presiding officer’s chair in the Senate, the offices of the House speaker and the Senate dais, where one yelled, “Trump won that election.”They mocked its leaders, posing for photos in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one with his feet propped on a desk in her office, another sitting in the same seat Vice President Mike Pence had occupied only moments before duringthe proceedings to certify the Electoral College vote. That certification would eventually take place, but not until well after midnight.This began as a day of reckoning for President Donald Trump’s futile attempt to cling to power as Congress took up the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. It devolved into scenes of fear and agony that left a prime ritual of American democracy in tatters.Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he didn’t. Instead he sent them off with incendiary rhetoric.“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said. “Let the weak ones get out,” he went on. “This is a time for strength.”His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd, “Let’s have trial by combat.”What happened Wednesday was nothing less than an attempted coup, said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic, said, “Today, the United States Capitol — the world’s greatest symbol of self-government — was ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard.”Sasse went on: “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president’s addiction to constantly stoking division.”Police said they recovered two pipe bombs, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee and a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds.Yet Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated, told the insurrectionists “We love you. You’re very special,” while asking them to go home.Authorities eventually regained control as night fell.Heavily armed officers brought in as reinforcements started using tear gas in a coordinated effort to get people moving toward the door, then combed the halls for stragglers, pushing the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, in clouds of tear gas, flash-bangs and percussion grenades.Video footage also showed officers letting people calmly walk out the doors of the Capitol despite the rioting and vandalism. Only about a dozen arrests were made in the hours after authorities regained control. They said a woman was shot earlier as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door in the Capitol where police were armed on the other side.She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died.Early on, some inside the Capitol saw the trouble coming outside the windows. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota surveyed the growing crowd on the grounds not long after Trump had addressed his supporters by the Ellipse, fueling their grievances over an election that he and they say he won, against all evidence.“I looked out the windows and could see how outmanned the Capitol Police were,” Phillips said. Under the very risers set up for Biden’s inauguration, Trump supporters clashed with police who blasted pepper spray in an attempt to hold them back.It didn’t work. Throngs of maskless MAGA-hatted demonstrators tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’s steps. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back. They broke into the building.Announcements blared: Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said. A loud bang sounded as officials detonated a suspicious package to make sure it was not dangerous.It was about 1:15 p.m. when New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat, said Capitol Police banged on his door and “told us to drop everything, get out as quickly as we could.”“It was breathtaking how quickly law enforcement got overwhelmed by these protesters,” he told The Associated Press.Shortly after 2 p.m., Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated from the Senate as protesters and police shouted outside the doors.With the Washington Monument in the background, people attend a rally in support of President Donald Trump near the White House on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington.“Protesters are in the building,” were the last words picked up by a microphone carrying a live feed of the Senate before it shut off.Police evacuated the chamber at 2:30 p.m., grabbing boxes of Electoral College certificates as they left.Phillips yelled at Republicans, “This is because of you!”Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when protesters began storming it. He said security officers urged lawmakers to put gas masks on and herded them into a corner of the massive room.“When we got over to other side of the gallery, the Republican side, they made us all get down, you could see that they were fending off some sort of assault, it looked like,” he said. “They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled.” The officers eventually escorted the lawmakers out of the chamber.Shortly after being told to put on gas masks, most members were quickly escorted out of the chamber. But some members remained in the upper gallery seats, where they had been seated due to distancing requirements.Smoke fills the walkway outside the Senate Chamber as supporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by U.S. Capitol Police officers inside the Capitol Wednesday.Along with a group of reporters who had been escorted from the press area and Capitol workers who act as ushers, the members ducked on the floor as police secured a door to the chamber down below with guns pointed. After making sure the hallways were clear, police swiftly escorted the members and others down a series of hallways and tunnels to a cafeteria in one of the House office buildings.Describing the scene, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said “there was a point there where officers had their guns and weapons pointed at the door, they were obviously expecting a breach through the door. It was clear that there were pretty close to pulling the trigger so they asked us all to get down in the chamber.”As he walked out of the Capitol, Himes said he had lived in Latin America and “always assumed it could never happen here.“We’ve known for years that our democracy was in peril and this is hopefully the worst and final moment of it,” Himes said. “But with a president egging these people on, with the Republicans doing all they can to try to make people feel like their democracy has been taken away from them even though they’re the ones doing the taking, it’s really hard, really sad. I spent my entire political career reaching out to the other side. And it’s really hard to see this.”Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley was also in the balcony. “It’s not good to be around terrified colleagues, with guns drawn toward people who have a barricade ... people crying. Not what you want to see,” he said.“This is how a coup is started,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif. “This is how democracy dies.”",2

65,Anxious Democrats float Plan B: Raise debt ceiling on party-line vote,-5.0,44.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/democrats-reaction-debt-ceiling/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,cnn,24,"A number of key Democrats say that their party should take matters into its own hands and raise the national debt limit by itselfonce Republicans block their plans as expected in the Senate, underscoring the lack of options facing the White House and Democratic leaders in the face ofstiff GOP resistance.But going it alone would force Democrats to employ a time-consuming budget maneuver that would bog down both chambers – especially the Senate – and subject their members toa parade of politically charged voteswith the national debt approaching $29 trillion.And on Wednesday, the chairman of the House Budget Committee insisted that the procedural obstacles and time constraints would prevent the party from using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default, a bid aimed at pressuring top Republicans to agree to suspend the nation’s borrowing limit in a bipartisan vote.Yet rank-and-file Democrats are growing increasingly worriedabout the mid-October deadline, nervous aboutthe impact on consumersof a first-ever default on the national debt as well as the political backlash that members of both parties would almost certainly endure. And they say that party leaders should indeed take steps to raise the debt ceiling through the budget process, regardless of the obstacles they encounter along the way.“Oh, yeah,” said Rep. Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat from Tennessee, when asked if he’d support using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling if Republicans don’t give them the votes in the Senate.“It’s a top national priority to avoid default – it’s no excuse,” Cooper told CNN on Wednesday. “So you got to do whatever it takes to avoid default. You cannot let America default. Period.”The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, told CNN he’d support taking steps to raise the debt ceiling with just Democratic votes through the budget process.“If we had to do it I would do that,” said Neal, who’s a Massachusetts Democrat. “I mean that the idea that America would default on debt is so far removed from everything I’ve ever entertained or thought of since I’ve been here. I mean, I’m stunned that we even have these moments.”The clock is ticking for Congress to get things done. Here's what to knowAsked again if he’d favor Democrats raising the debt ceiling themselves if the GOP posture doesn’t change, Neal reiterated: “I’d favor paying our debts, yes.”And Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens, whose Michigan district has been targeted by Republicans for 2022, said when asked about raising the debt limit with just Democratic votes: “We’ve got to do what it takes to avoid a default.”The comments — echoed by a number of other House and Senate Democrats – could undercut the stiff position among Democratic leaders,who have so far refused to publicly consider using the budget processto raise the debt ceiling on a straight party-line vote.Instead, they have tied a suspension of the debt limit to a must-pass bill to fund the government by the September 30 deadline, daring Republicans to block it and risk a potentially catastrophic default and shutdown of federal agencies.Yet Republicans aren’t blinking, and only a handful have left open the possibility that they may support the stopgap measure – namely because the package includes billions in aid for communities hit hard by natural disasters,like in Louisiana.“Not 10, no,” said Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota when asked Wednesday if there would be enough Republicansto break a filibusteron the package.Pointing to roughly trillions more in taxes and spending that Democrats want to pass along straight party lines through the budget process, Thune said: “If they’re going to do all that with 51 votes, they’ll be raising the debt ceiling with 51 votes.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California – and many other Democrats – have been furious at the GOP position, saying their party helped Republicans suspend the debt ceiling three times underthen-President Donald Trump, including after the 2017 approval of the GOP tax lawthrough the same partisan budget process. And Democrats are quick to note that raising the debt ceiling allows the US to pay bills thathave already been racked up.Democrats face GOP blockage on raising debt ceiling as time is running out“Are we hostage to Republicans who are threatening to blow up a part of the economic system because they want to do that for politics?” asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Massachusetts Democrat who’s a member of Schumer’s leadership team. “That’s just not where we should be as a nation.”Failure to raise the debt ceiling in time could halt payments that millions of Americans rely on, including paychecks to federal workers, Medicare benefits, military salaries, tax refunds, Social Security checks and payments to federal contractors. A memo circulated by the White House last week for state and local officials listed several programs that would be halted if Congress fails, including for disaster relief, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, infrastructure, education, public health and child nutrition.Six former treasury secretaries urged congressional leadership to raise the debt limit on Wednesday, saying that an “unprecedented default” could “cause serious economic and national security harm” and “threaten economic growth.”On Tuesday, Schumer didn’t answer a question directly when asked if Democrats would raise the debt ceiling by themselves if they had to, saying instead that it was imperative to do it along bipartisan lines, asTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen has sought.Rep. John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who’s the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Wednesday that he and his staff have studied the possibility that they could go through the reconciliation process to raise the debt limit – and he insisted that it’s not possible to pull it off.“You can’t do it,” Yarmuth said Wednesday. “The problems are almost insurmountable. And you certainly couldn’t do it in time to stave off a default.”Yarmuth also made clear the resistance from Pelosi.“I have rarely heard the speaker and leadership more adamant about anything that they are not going to do this through reconciliation,” Yarmuth said, referring to the budget process.Democratic leaders, moderates and progressives headed to the White House at critical moment for the Biden agendaDemocrats have largely resisted talking about what would come next if Republicans blocked their bill to increase the debt limit and fund the government through mid-December, arguing that Republicans have no other choice but to change their minds.“I have every confidence that the Republican Party – at least some of them– will come to their senses and not allow us to default,” Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters.Without GOP support, Democrats have two main options. One would allow them to revise their current budget resolution, a process that is rife with procedural hurdles. The other option would be to deploy a little-used part of the Budget Act, which allows them to increase the debt ceiling after approving a separate budget resolution in both chambers. It would take time to pursue and require Democrats to engage intwo more rounds of so-called vote-a-ramas in the Senate, a marathon series of amendment votes on the floor that occurs only during the budget process.That route, however, would require Democrats to take some tough votes.Part of the resistance to increasing the debt ceiling has been that, unlike suspending the debt ceiling or pausing it, raising it would require Democrats to include an exact dollar figure of how much they want to increase the country’s debt by. For Democrats running for reelection, that is a ready-made campaign ad that leadership is fully aware could be politically damaging.Still, some are arguing that raising the debt ceiling may not be as controversial as it used to be.Top Biden economic aides join Senate Democrat call in push before debt ceiling fightSen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat on the Budget Committee, told reporters that he doesn’t have a strong feeling about how the debt ceiling gets raised, he just wants to make sure it happens.Other Democrats were hoping their leadership would repeatedly force Republicans to vote on legislation to increase the ceiling, and that included keeping the increase tied to the government funding bill.“It looks like we are going to have to give Republicans multiple chances to not terrorize the American economy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut.But if Republicans block the bill in the Senate, as expected, what exactly Democrats do remains to be seen – and many on Capitol Hill have little idea what’s next.“We will sh*t little bricks,” said Rep. John Garamendi, a California Democrat, when asked what Democrats would do if the GOP blocks the debt ceiling hike.He let out a laugh, then walked onto the House floor.",2

(Leader was not present for his lawyer’s brief court appearance.)Waiving a preliminary hearing is standard procedure in major felony cases because nothing related to trial can happen before an indictment. And it’s extremely rare for someone charged with such a major crime to plead guilty before indictment because there’s no chance to challenge the prosecution’s evidence.The only purpose for a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there was probable cause to arrest Leader and keep him jailed. That’s a much lower burden than finding him guilty of crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.In this case, Leader, 33, is facing two felonies: vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene of a fatal crash in the 12:26 a.m. death ofMaida Brkanovic, 25.Under law, each of those crimes is punishable by up to 7 years in prison. If convicted at trial, a judge could add up those punishments at sentencing.The grand jury can also consider charges beyond what Leader was initially arrested on. Other charges often considered in fatal crash cases include manslaughter or, in the worst cases, second-degree murder (The drugged-up driver, Anthony Saccone, who killed three young people near Onondaga Community College in 2018, for example, was indicted on a murder charge. Helater pleaded guilty to lesser charges.)Brkanovic’s friends say that the two had just met that evening in Syracuse. Leader was offering free rides to women outside the Alpine Gentlemen’s Club on Butternut Street. Brkanovic loved motorcycles and took a ride, they said.RELATED:Fierce loyalty, outgoing spirit: Friends recall woman killed in I-81 motorcycle crashLeader got on the interstate nearby after running two stop signs, police say. He lost control going northbound and crashed into the center median near Destiny USA, causing both him and Brkanovic to fly off the Suzuki motorcycle.Leader was stopped by police as he walked away from the crash up the Court Street on-ramp. He is accused of lying to them, saying he was riding alone, and is also accused of removing Brkanovic’s helmet from the scene.It wasn’t until 45 minutes later that an Uber driver, going the opposite direction, saw the victim face-down on the shoulder after being thrown over the center median.RELATED:Man discovers I-81 crash victim after fleeing driver lied to Syracuse cops: ‘It cooked my soul’Assuming a grand jury indicts Leader, he’ll then be arraigned again in trial court. That’s when his case will begin to move forward in earnest.For now, Leader is jailed on $250,000 bail.

(World Travel and Tourism Council / Flickr)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today.Last week, Mississippi’s Republican-controlled government cut off$500 millionof COVID-19 jobless aid for nearly a hundred thousand of its citizens, joining a national GOP campaign to portray jobless workers as lazy layabouts who don’t need assistance. At the same time, it was reported that the same Republican-run Mississippi government allowed$1.1 million worthof welfare cash to flow to Brett Favre for speeches he never gave — and he has yet to return $600,000 of it.But now, the Lone Star State is living up to the saying that everything is bigger in Texas, even greed and hypocrisy. In the last week and a half, Texas Republicansmoved to block$8 billion worth of pandemic unemployment benefits for 1.3 million people just days after voting toextenda corporate subsidy program that isenrichingfossil fuel companies and has already cost the state$10 billion.Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the end of the federal unemployment benefits on Monday. With his state facing a6.9 percent unemployment rate, Abbott said he wants the government “helping unemployed Texans connect with the more than a million job openings, rather than paying unemployment benefits to remain off the employment rolls.”The move follows Abbott’s officespearheadingthe GOP’s fight against a $15 minimum wage, saying it “would put a boot on the neck of small businesses.” Abbott alsopushedlegislationto shield corporations from liability if their workers get COVID on the job.Nine days before Abbott publicly decried benefits for the jobless and suggested Texans don’t need the help, his fellow Texas Republicans in the state House advanced abillto extend the state’sChapter 313 program, which subsidizes massive property tax breaks for corporations.The situation represents a big win for lobby groups such as the Texas Association of Business, which has been simultaneouslydemandingan end to aid for jobless workers andcalling forthe preservation of Chapter 313’s giant taxpayer handouts to its corporate members. The latter is also a win for the fossil fuel industry, whose donors have poured more than$58 millioninto Texas elections in the last five years.“The lion’s share of the program’s tax bounty —60 percent— goes to refineries, chemical plants, liquified natural gas facilities, and other fossil-fuel projectsconcentrated along the Gulf Coast,” therecently reported. “Oil and gas giants that have long bossed Texas, like Exxon Mobil, Chevron Phillips, Dow Chemical, and Enterprise Products Partners, have each saved hundreds of millions in property taxes thanks to Chapter 313.”The fossil fuel industry is not the only beneficiary of the program: Chapter 313 is slated to funneltens of millions of dollars to Tesla, which is owned by the world’s second wealthiest man, Elon Musk.Proponents of the tax subsidy program have argued that it creates jobs.

Does JOE BIDEN?No, the media and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not understand that. But most of the American people do, and that’s why Trump’s response was not just brilliant and correct, but savvy, when responding to the call by his opponent’s for top-down centralized control.“While Joe Biden will allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens, wants the President of the United States with the mere stroke of a pen to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months,” said Trump on Thursday. “I guess he thinks it’s good politics.”That last rebuke about politics was perfect. I hope whoever wrote it for him gets some kudos.“Different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the Corona problem.

If you support the President, you support that.”Garrison made those comments following Donald Trump’sattackon the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented Baltimore, Maryland. Trump had tweeted of the majority-Black city, “No human being would want to live there” and called it “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”But now, years later, the right, including GOP lawmakers, have latched on to those tweets, after they resurfaced in a right-wing hit piece published in an outlet called Revolver on May 5. The outlet called Garrison a “critical race theory loving, Trump Derangement Syndrome suffering, fake news spreading, 100% partisan hack,” citing his 2019 tweets as evidence. The report did not note the context of Garrison’s commentary concerning Trump’s racism.Fox News host Pete HegsethattackedGarrison the day after the piece came out, describing him as the Pentagon’s “MAGA purge man” while discussing the Pentagon’s anti-extremism efforts.And days later, another Fox News host, Tucker Carlson,described Garrisonas a “lunatic” for his criticism of Trump’s racism.On May 19, during a House Armed Services Committeehearinginvolving recommendations from the National Commission Military, National, and Public ServiceRep.

Gaetz claimed he was “deeply troubled” by a tweet Harrisonwrotein January of 2020, as Trump’s impeachment trial was underway, which stated, “Calls for civility, rather than shouting down falsehoods and misinformation, shall be the death of this nation.”Then, onMay 26,30 Republican members of the House signed a letter complaining of “creeping left-wing extremism” in the military, citing the “report” from Revolver that singled out Garrison’s tweets.The letter, which was led by Rep. Matt Rosendale and co-signed by members like Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Greg Steube (R-FL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and others, called on Sec. Austin to “fight back” against extremism from the left.That same day, Gosar (R-AZ)complainedon Twitter that, “Biden and Bishop Garrison are prioritizing bigotry and anti-white hatred over national security,” sharing the Revolver piece. Notably, just two months earlier, Gosar wasa featured speakerat a conference of extremists alongside white supremacists.The attacks directed at both Garrison and the efforts by the Biden administration to combat military extremism follow years of the rightdownplayingthe threat posed in military ranks.

The... [+]P4 epidemiological laboratory, part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is one of the world's leading research centers on coronaviruses. (Johannes Eisele / AFP via Getty Images)At the very end of 2019, a new disease began to emerge in humans: COVID-19. Originally described as a set of pneumonia-like symptoms with a hitherto unseen cause, a set of alarming facts soon came to light. A novel virus — now known to be SARS-CoV-2 — had begun infecting humans, with the first major outbreak stemming from a wet market in Wuhan: the largest city by far in the Chinese province of Hubei. The next pandemic, just as virologists and disease ecologists had been predicting for years, emerged from the continued encroachment of human civilization on territory previously inhabited solely by wild animals. Human-animal contact, responsible for pandemics ranging from SARS to MERS to Ebola to HIV, was almost certainly the culprit in bringing this novel coronavirus into the human population as well.But this explanation for SARS-CoV-2, claiming that it had a zoonotic origin, has been disputed by some, despite the lack of any publicly available scientific evidence to the contrary. Instead, according to recent claims, the virus may not have originated and spread from the wild, but could have escaped, in a lab leak, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. From the point of view of the virus’s genome, there’s no way to rule such a possibility out, so long as the virus was never characterized or reported in the lab before its escape. But is this lab leak hypothesis a legitimate scientific theory, on equal or even superior footing with the zoonotic origin theory? Or is it a conspiracy theory, without the scientific evidence to back up these wild assertions? Let’s takea comprehensive lookto try and unpack everything that’s been going on.The Apollo 14 landing site is still intact, and our images of it in modern times still carry the... [+]legacy of this nearly-50-years-old event. The lunar surface changes very slowly over time, and the changes we made in 1971 are still perceptible, virtually unchanged, today.Practically every time there’s a revolutionary new phenomenon or happenstance that significantly alters the course of human society, there are a number of ideas that arise to challenge the mainstream narrative. While these can be scientifically motivated by a subset of the evidence, more often these challenges take the form of a conspiracy theory: where a number of people involved allegedly know the real, full truth behind an issue, but are covering it up, presenting an alternative narrative instead. When you mix conspiracies with science, certain people are inevitably drawn to those ideas, which include:There arecertain identifiable hallmarksof these theories. They always include alarge number of lines of circumstantial evidencesuggesting that the full truth isn’t being told. Each claim, on its own, doesn’t carry any compelling weight, but many put a variety of (possibly unrelated) puzzle pieces together to compose a suggestive picture. Many demonstrably false claims are always included as well, and as those are debunked one-by-one, supporters of the conspiracy will move the goalposts once again, claiming something like, “well, these parts of the idea aren’t true, and those are conspiracies, but (whatever aspects remain) must be the real truth!”A new conspiracy theory, promoted by Sen. Rand Paul, vilifies Dr. Fauci and attempts to tie him to... [+]the notion that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in and leaked from the Wuhan Institute for Virology. The scientific evidence says otherwise on all counts.The other hallmark of conspiracies almost always involve some sort of guilt by association accusation. This typically manifests itself as anunclean handsargument: some statement or person that’s part of the mainstream, consensus narrative is found to have done something untrue or unethical, and therefore the entire narrative can be dismissed. Dr. Fauci, for example, caved to political pressure about encouraging people not to wear masks in order to reserve them for frontline healthcare workers, undermining the entire credibility of all subsequent public health campaigns. When Dr. Li Wenliang blew the COVID-19 whistle before succumbing to the disease in China, we learned of an uncomfortable reality: the Chinese government did try to cover up the truth about this new affliction in humans.Although these facts don’t necessarily mean that anyone lied about any other aspects of COVID-19 — Fauci, the Chinese government, or anyone else involved in combatting the worst effects of the pandemic — it’s reasonable to question such statements. Many of us wonder about what else could be getting covered up in this situation. In fact, speculations about a lab-based origin to this virus, with claims that it was engineered as a bioweapon by the Chinese government, go backas far as January 26, 2020. But were those claims — and, in fact, all the claims that followed — motivated by legitimate scientific uncertainty? Or were these merely political machinations, designed to disingenuously cast blame while simultaneously justifying a wanton neglect of necessary responsibilities by numerous governments across the globe?Judy Mikovits, shown in her then-lab with then-graduate student Cassandra Puccinelli in 2011, is now... [+]notorious for three things: lying about her role in the treatment and identification of HIV/AIDS, committing gross scientific misconduct in her XMRV research concerning its presence in humans and its ability to cause chronic fatigue syndrome, and her faux documentary about COVID-19, Plandemic, which is a scientific travesty.The original conspiracy theory claimed that China was in the process of engineering a bioweapon to inflict maximum damage on human populations in enemy countries around the world:a bizarre role-reversal of an earlier conspiracy theorywhere China claimed that the United States engineered the original, 2003 SARS virus to attack China. They claimed that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was deliberately bioengineered as a plot against humanity, was inadequately contained, then accidentally released, and then grew into the global pandemic we all continue to live through.These baseless claims were repeated by many prominent individuals — mostly politicians but including the occasional contrarian scientist — over the early months of 2020. In May, a faux-documentary touting various aspects of this conspiracy was released:Plandemic. The videos were viewed millions of times, anddespiteanenormousnumberofdebunkingpieces, includingone tracking the horrific fraud and toxic legacy of its main “scientist” Judy Mikovitz, they continued to influence the thought processes of many, particularly of non-scientists.In September of 2020,Dr. Li-Meng Yan published a pre-print of a reportclaiming that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a Chinese Lab as part of bioweapon research. That paper wasdebunked by numerous researchers, and multiple reviewers at MIT’s Rapid Reviews of COVID-19concluded that the claims were misleading, unethical, and “baseless and are not supported by the data and methods used.”Li-Meng Yan, an ophthalmologist (not a virologist, as stated), has made many bold and unsupported... [+]claims about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a bioweapon, but these claims are not supported by the data and have been rejected by at least four independent reviews of her work.This has been the state of affairs: wild, unsupported accusations touting a variety of conspiracies have been a highly politicized counter-narrative to the obvious consensus opinion: that SARS-CoV-2 emerged naturally,likely through pangolins as an intermediarybetween bats and humans, infected its first humans in 2019, and found its way to the city of Wuhan, where it entered the greater human population and grew into the ongoing pandemic.Has anything changed, based on scientific merits, that could cause us to reconsider the idea that this virus emerged from a lab, rather than naturally? While no new scientific information has been made publicly available that would shift opinions on the scientific merits, there are some people for whom a few circumstantial facts stand out:For some, you can look at this subset of facts and your brain will fill in the details, connecting the dots from potentially dangerous research to an insecure lab to early infections to a global pandemic. But there areno scientific revelations to be had here. In fact,while news coverage has increased, thescience case has actually weakened; what’s being presented is essentially just the already-debunked Plandemic ideas with a few of the discredited points removed. That places you, the non-expert, in a situation where you’re asked to draw your own conclusions with insufficient information.This figure shows the structure of the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2. Panel A shows the spike... [+]homotrimer in its open configuration, while panel B shows the cleavage sites on the spike protein.What’s needed — in fact, what even professionals in fields like immunology, epidemiology, and disease ecology need —is expertise that most of us don’t have: specifically, expertise from field of virology. This includes the expertise of how virus genomes evolve, how virological research is conducted, and what the specific facts that are known about viruses and how they spread and reproduce. It also includes what’s likely, unlikely, or impossible to happen when you tinker with a virus’s genome through various natural and artificial modification methods.If you want to know whether a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2 is reasonable, the two things to look at are the genome of the disease and the ecological modeling of how that disease should behave in the wild. From the virus’s genome, we can robustly conclude that the mechanisms proposed for how this virus would have arisen in a labare all wildly insufficient to explain its properties. From the case records of COVID-19 and the behavior of the disease, it’s likely thatthe first cases in Hubei province occurred as early as October of 2019, meaning that the alleged infections among Wuhan Institute of Virology workers could not explain the origin of the very first cases.But even beyond that, it’s important to take a look at the research in question: that of Dr. Shi Zhengli —known as China’s “bat woman”for her research into bat-borne diseases — at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Shi Zhengli, a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), speaks during the 2020... [+]Zhongguancun Forum on September 18, 2020. Dr. Shi is one of the world's top virologists, and is arguably the leading researcher on coronaviruses that originate in bats. She is one of humanity's most important assets in the fight against current and future pandemics. (Hou Yu/China News Service via Getty Images)Over the past 17 years, Dr. Shi has been the pre-eminent virus hunter in bats, undertaking expeditions into bat caves to find and characterize novel viruses in an attempt to combat something that could turn into the next SARS: a disease that first emerged in 2002/2003, infecting more than 8,000 and with a fatality rate of nearly 10%. In late December of 2019, the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, her direct boss, told her that the Wuhan CDC had detected a novel strain of coronavirus in two hospital patients with an unusual form of pneumonia, and she was told to investigate. Immediately, she feared the worst: that perhaps the virus could have come from her lab.But what she did next was what you’d want any good researcher to do: she went through her lab’s records to check the genetic sequences from all of the viruses in her lab. The results? None of them matched SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the closest match — at 96% — was a coronavirusthat was identified in a population of horseshoe bat in Yunnan: three provinces away from Hubei, where Wuhan is located. This is not novel information, either; it was publishedin Nature back in early February, 2020.The genetic sequence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from patients, as compared to other known... [+]coronaviruses. The coronavirus that was studied with the alleged gain-of-function research, RaTG13, is not a good match for the disease that causes COVID-19, but rather a species of horseshoe bat from Yunnan province: nowhere near Wuhan itself.Diseases do frequently jump from animals to humans, and this trend is fully expected to continue without purposeful intervention. Swine flus arise from pig farming; bird flus largely arise from poultry farming. Civets brought the original SARS into humans; horses brought the Hendra virus into humans; pigs brought the Nipah virus into humans. In addition, the low fatality rate of COVID-19 and the high incidence of asymptomatic individuals indicates that the pathogen could have been around for some time before the first severe cases emerged. Virologist Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,drew attention to the following important point:“There might have been mini-outbreaks [before the first wave of major cases], but the viruses either burned out or maintained low-level transmission before causing havoc. [Since most animal-borne viruses re-emerge periodically], the Wuhan outbreak is by no means incidental.”Indeed,in two-out-of-three simulations, the natural emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans would result in extinction of the virus before an epidemic ensued. Either we got relatively unlucky, which is possible, or this might not have been the first jump of the virus to humans; it’s just the first jump we know of. In addition,it may not be the last, which further emphasizes the importance of identifying and studying these viruses in the wild and in the lab: before the next pandemic occurs.A sequenced genetic analysis of the UK variant of the novel coronavirus. The location of the change... [+]in the viral genome is marked by the stitches. (Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance via Getty Images)The virological evidence supporting a laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, is enormously flimsy. The idea that we can insert novel genetic sequences into a virus is true, but what happens next isn’t generally appreciated. In particular:None of these criteria even consider the variation in the genetics of the host, the immunity of potential hosts, and the probabilities associated with infection among hosts. In summary, if SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab — which the evidence does not favor — this virus somehow won the generic lottery on multiple, complex fronts, each one of which is an active research area in virology to this day. Furthermore, if this virus did originate from a leak from the Wuhan Institute for Virology, it either leaked out prior to the very first cases, which is a problem for the timeline of cases, or it was already circulating in humans prior to its release. Either way, however, there would have to be an enormous conspiracy. Dr. Shi must have been lying; other people in her group and at the Wuhan Institute for Virology must have been lying; people at EcoHealth Alliance must have been lying; affiliated researchers such as Peter Daszek must be lying; and Dr. Fauci must be lying as well. It’s like imagining the world of Fahrenheit 451, where the “firefighters” are actually arsonists, except for virology: where the experts in pandemic prevention are actively trying to unleash pandemics upon the world.This 3D rendering of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, shows the basic structure of the virus... [+]particle that has caused so much death and suffering in the world. Our global response to its emergence was woefully inadequate, but resorting to a witch hunt to implicate the very researchers who work to prevent and mitigate these pandemics is truly a new low for our society.Or, alternatively, this was a naturally occurring virus. It leapt from bats to another animal years or even decades ago, and then to humans, naturally, in 2019, which the genetic sequences clearly support. The researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who were allegedly infected early on were most probably infected the same way all the other people in Wuhan got infected: likely through airborne contact with another infected person. All of the studies support the same conclusion: that once the disease entered humans, it evolved from there, with a single entry point consistent with every one of the subsequent cases.The ultimate lesson from COVID-19, in fact, is that these pandemics are going to continue to emerge naturally, and that we should be encouraging the researchers who are on the front lines of studying these potentially infectious diseases to investigate them to the fullest extent of their abilities. Instead, the tactic we’re taking — accusing them of fraud without a shred of meaningful, direct evidence — showcases how thoroughly we’re letting fear and conspiratorial thinking cloud our judgment. After all, our thinking about what the “next pandemic” would be was woefully incorrect; it would be a shame to not learn the valuable lessons that COVID-19 has to teach us. AsDr. Joel Wertheim at the University of California, San Diego, put it,“Pandemic surveillance wasn’t prepared for a virus like SARS-CoV-2. We were looking for the next SARS or MERS, something that killed people at a high rate, but in hindsight, we see how a highly transmissible virus with a modest mortality rate can also lay the world low.”The Wuhan Institute of Virology, shown as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team... [+]investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus visit. This is one of the leading laboratories in the world for safely studying human-to-human transmissible diseases. (HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)What no one is disputing is that it’s reasonable to be concerned about security at research institutes, and to be concerned about lab leaks in general. If you wanted to call for routine inspections, and the enforcement of sufficient safety criteria across the board, there are very few who would be opposed to that. But a call for a large-scale, outside investigation into Dr. Shi’s laboratory lacks the necessary evidence to motivate it. If any of the18 scientists who signed the recent Science lettercalling for such an investigation actually wanted to investigate the lab leak hypothesis in a scientific manner, they would simply write a research grant to do so. That’s how virology is routinely performed, andhow scientific and professional misconduct in virology has been uncovered in the past.The fact that they’ve brought their case to the general public instead reveals how flimsy their arguments are, while a broader concern is that the next time a pandemic flu emerges within the United States, we'll have set a grossly unacceptable international precedent. American scientists will be vilified and harassed; foreign agents will demand access to our federally funded labs; lab records will be demanded by foreign governments; etc. This is a Pandora's Box, brought forth by political inquisitors, that must not be opened unless adequate scientific proof of these specious allegations comes to light.We frequently say that what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, and this conspiracy theory of a lab leak-origin for SARS-CoV-2 should be treated as such. Dr. Fauci, EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr. Shi, among others, simply have the misfortune of being in the crosshairs of political agents who themselves have been largely responsible for the mismanaged global response to this inevitable pandemic. Just like the notions that 9/11 was an inside job, the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax, or that “ClimateGate” proves the unethical behavior of practically all climate scientists, there is plenty of strong evidence opposing the conspiracy, instead supporting the consensus conclusion. If we are to take an alternative seriously, it cannot just consist of circumstantial evidence with enormous gaps separating the steps; you would need concrete evidence. Unless that evidence arrives, the “lab leak hypothesis” will remain a conspiracy theory, while the zoonotic origin hypothesis remains overwhelmingly supported by the evidence at hand.",2

The county prosecutor's office is inside the administration building.This was the second straight day the group organized a picket in front of the courthouse in the county seat.The five arrested Saturday were being held in the county jail in Mount Clemens and were arraigned via video Monday at 41A District Court in Shelby Township. The picket was going on during the arraignments, with organizers watching and listening to the video court proceedings from their cellphones as people marched and chanted.The five each were given a $5,000 bond, with Detroit Will Breathe organizer and co-founder Nakia Wallace saying people were on their way to the jail to bond out those held, and that they plan to fight the felony charges.She said the group initially was told there were six people being held at the jail. She said 10 total people were arrested Saturday, with five released.Authorities said those arraigned Monday were:Police said all five were charged with assaulting, resisting, obstructing a police officer, a two-year felony.Additionally, Taylor, Deininger, Nadeau and Phillips were charged with disturbing the peace, a 90-day misdemeanor. Taylor and Deininger also were charged with refusing or resisting to provide DNA samples, a one-year misdemeanor..Of the other five arrested Saturday, Shelby Township Police Deputy Chief Mark Coil said two were released pending further investigation and three others were arrested and bonded out when they returned to the police station Saturday night.At least two dozen people marched in a circle in front of the county administration building for about an hour chanting ""drop the charges,"" ""free the Shelby 6,"" ""this is what democracy looks like"" and ""these racist cops have got to go.""Many held signs, including ""Stop Shelide,"" referring to the Shelby Township Police Chief Robert Shelide, who was suspended for 30 days without pay earlier this year by the township's Board of Trustees for controversial social media posts that seemed to glorify police brutality. Many people wanted Shelide fired.In addition to the picket, Detroit Will Breathe also hosted a ""phone zap"" to the county prosecutor's office demanding the charges against the ""Shelby 6"" be dropped.Shelby Twp. police arrest 7 protesters at march against police brutalityIn a Facebook post Sunday, Detroit Will Breathe said 750 people have emailed the prosecutor's office demanding the charges be dropped.Wallace told those picketing Monday that this is ""the latest attack to silence this movement,"" adding: ""they don't get to silence us.""Detroit Will Breathe claimed in a tweet on Monday that a female protester was stripped to her bra and underwear by police in the street.But an in-car video released by township police Monday afternoon clearly shows the woman in the back seat of a squad car, freeing her flex-tied hands from behind her back and then stripping down to her bra and underwear.In the 109-second video, the woman frees her hands and then takes off her jacket,  before saying, ""I'm dyin',"" and removing her shirt. She then takes her belt, pants and shoes off and says: ""There, now you don't need to search me. Make it easier on ya.""When the door opens from the outside, she says: ""Now it's easier to search me. Go ahead and search all of it.""Coil said she was taken out of the vehicle, re-secured and put on a transport bus. He and Wallace said the woman was arraigned Monday.""The video speaks for itself. The video is completely transparent,"" Coil said. ""This is the detriment of social media postings, often you have inaccuracies.""Shelby Twp. residents say police chief must go for tweets that glorify police brutalityShelby Twp. police chief suspended but will keep his job after controversial tweetsWallace said Monday she thinks it's clear from the video the person is experiencing some form of panic attack or a need of mental health attention and instead of giving her that ""officers decided to display her naked on Van Dyke.""Wallace said the interactions should have stopped, mental health attention given and a female officer called.""This is just a furthering of the callous way in which they interact with people with no regard for their safety -- physical safety, mental safety and emotional safety,"" she said.Saturday's protest started at 1:30 p.m. with about 100 people in a parking lot at 23 Mile Road and Van Dyke Avenue, police said.

76,Trump Makes Appeals to Pennsylvania Voters Two Weeks Before Election Day,-4.67,51.67,https://www.voanews.com/2020-usa-votes/trump-makes-appeals-pennsylvania-voters-two-weeks-election-day,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,voanews,24,"U.S. President Donald Trump is demanding Pennsylvania get back to normal business operations at a time the state is seeing a spike in coronavirus cases.“What the hell is happening in Pennsylvania?” Trump asked the crowd at his Tuesday evening campaign rally at Erie International Airport, in the western part of the crucial swing state for the November 3 general election.Expressing frustration with pandemic restrictions imposed by Governor Tom Wolf, a member of the Democratic Party, the president said “Pennsylvania has been shut down long enough. Get your governor to open up Pennsylvania.”Wolfe issued a renewed plea on Monday to Pennsylvanians to work together to stop the spread of the virus.Every part of the state is seeing community spread of COVID-19, partly due to “relatively small gatherings of families and friends,” said Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's top health official.The number of people hospitalized from COVID-19 in the state has doubled in the past four weeks, but it is still more than three times lower than at its peak in late April.Trump, along with Vice President Mike Pence, has been making frequent campaign appearances in the state, seen as critical for their re-election chances in two weeks.Wolf has criticized the Trump campaign for holding ""unsafe rallies that will put Pennsylvania communities at risk"" of COVID-19 outbreaks.A letter signed by more than 75 physicians in Pennsylvania urged people not to attend Tuesday’s rally, saying such campaign events endanger public health and give a false impression that the coronavirus is “no longer with us.”Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden, a native of Pennsylvania, has also frequently been in the state but has followed social-distancing guidelines, minimizing the number of attendees and requiring all in attendance to wear masks.Former President Barack Obama is to campaign for his former vice president in Philadelphia on Wednesday at what is being called a “drive-in rally.”Polls taken in Pennsylvania this month show Biden leading Trump by just a few points and the race further narrowing.Trump acknowledged to the tightly packed crowd of thousands in Erie that he had not expected to have to campaign in their city this year.“I have to be honest. There was no way I was coming,” said the president. “And then we got hit with the plague and I had to go back to work.”During his 56-minute speech in Erie, the president said the U.S. government is “crushing the virus,” the country is doing much better than Europe, and the pandemic “is ending.”Biden did not make any campaign appearances on Tuesday, remaining in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was said to be preparing for Thursday evening’s second debate with Trump, which is to take place in Nashville, Tennessee.Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes, out of the 270 needed to capture the presidency, is a crucial prize. In 2016, Trump edged Hillary Clinton by only 45,000 popular votes in the state with the help of white, working-class voters in Erie, who had long been loyal to the Democrats.First lady Melania Trump had been scheduled to join her husband on stage in Erie on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, her office announced she was canceling her appearance due to a lingering cough following her coronavirus infection.President Trump spent three days in the hospital being treated for COVID-19. He has declared himself cured and now immune to the virus that has killed more than 220,000 people in the United States.Surveys show his administration’s handling of the pandemic has hurt him among voters. According to a New York Times/Sienna poll released Tuesday, Biden is favored over Trump to lead on the coronavirus pandemic by 12 points.Biden has repeatedly accused the president of deliberately downplaying the deadliness of the disease, calling Trump’s behavior “close to criminal.”Steve Herman, formerly White House Bureau Chief, is now VOA's Chief National Correspondent.",2
77,Students and faculty urge deeper look at land-grant legacy,-14.17,42.17,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/indigenous-affairs-land-grab-universities-students-and-faculty-urge-deeper-look-at-land-grant-legacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,hcn,16,"A banner hangs on a statue of Cornell University’s founder, Ezra Cornell, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day this year.Della Keahna UranWhenpublished “Land-Grab universities” last April, the two-year-long investigation shed new light on a dark open secret: One of the largest transfers of land and capital in the country’s history had masqueraded as a donation for university endowments.HCNidentified nearly 11 million acres of land, expropriated from approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities through more than 160 violence-backed treaties and land cessions. Now, in the wake of the investigation, land-grant universities across the country are re-evaluating the capital they built from these stolen Indigenous lands.More than 150 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act — the legislation that transferred the lands — new discussions about the universities’ moral and ethical responsibilities have forced Americans to re-examine the law’s legacy. Land-grant institutions have long prided themselves on their accomplishments as beneficiaries: They used the proceeds generated by the land to broaden access to higher education, thereby contributing to economic development across the nation. But many of those institutions paid next to nothing for the public lands they received and sold.By far the largest beneficiary was Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, which acquired almost 1 million acres from Ojibwe, Miwok, Yokuts, Dakota and other Indigenous nations through 63 treaties or seizures. The land came from 15 states, and by 1935, when the last parcel was sold, Cornell University had generated nearly $6 million for its endowment, the largest of any land-grant institution. Adjusted for inflation, it raised over $92 million.Now, as the country reconsiders long-standing issues of racial equity and justice — focusing on everything from local political races to national legislation — students and faculty alike are pressuring administrators to address the investigation’s findings.On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, Oct. 12, 2020, members of Native American and Indigenous Students at Cornell (NAISAC) put forward a list of 10 demands in the form of apetition. The demands include turning the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program into a university department; recruiting new Indigenous faculty and students, specifically Indigenous students affected and/or displaced by the Morrill Act; waiving tuition for those students; acknowledging the land of the Gayogo̱hó:nǫ’, or Cayuga Nation, before every Ithaca-based event; and reinstating an ad-hoc committee on Native American Affairs to oversee the approval of these demands.“If the president’s office was responsible, then they would meet each of these demands to the extent that we’ve laid them out in our petition,” said Colin Benedict (Mohawk), the external relations chair for NAISAC. “Each of these demands in my mind is completely 100% justified and should already have been implemented by the university decades ago.”As of Dec. 1, the petition had more than 900 signatures from students, staff, alumni and community members. The president’s office has yet to respond publicly, but in an email exchange, it stated, “The Office of the President is in receipt of the NAISAC petition, and the President is looking forward to working with the Native American and Indigenous community at Cornell on these issues.”A faculty committee, headed by American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program Director Kurt Jordan, launched theCornell University and Indigenous Dispossession Project. The project will research Cornell’s Morrill Act land history, identify the Indigenous communities affected, and foster discussion of possible remedies.“We’ve had a number of statements that have been made by the administration in light of the George Floyd murder, Black Lives Matter, and all of the other things that have been happening this year about the need for Cornell to really address its legacy, its historical roots, its complicity in … to some degree, with white supremacy,” Jordan said.“Benefiting from stolen Indigenous land has to be part of that.”History professor Jon Parmenter recently discovered that Cornell is in possession of over 420,000 acres of mineral rights in the Central and Southwestern U.S., a portion of which was retained through Morrill Act lands. In its petition, NAISAC urged the university to release a statement acknowledging the amount of land acquired, the interest accrued and mineral rights funds received, and pledging to refrain from mineral and resource extraction on those lands., faculty and students at the University of California, Berkeley have also made strides. Established in 1868, the university received almost 150,000 acres from the Morrill Act. The land raised $730,000 for the university’s early endowment, and, adjusted for inflation, has generated over $13 million. The university paid nothing in return.The presence and history of Indigenous people has been largely erased from the UC system, said Phenocia Bauerle (Apsáalooke), director of Native American Student Development at the University of California, Berkeley. Two years ago, Bauerle and the Native American Student Development center created a land acknowledgment to honor the Ohlone tribal lands that the university sits upon. However, the university has yet to adopt an official acknowledgment.According to aCalifornia audit, UC Berkeley is the worst offender among the schools when it comes to complying with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which grants Indigenous nations the right to regain ancestral remains and objects from museums. UC Berkeley has only repatriated 20% of its 500,000-artifact collection. In comparison, the University of California Los Angeles has repatriated 96% of its collection.“A lot of it comes down to, well, they see these issues as historical and not of the present because they see Natives as historical and not of the present,” Bauerle said. Since the dispossession occurred in the past, contemporary people don’t see themselves as responsible, and they feel no pressure to address the issue today. However, “ ‘Land-Grab’ gave us several concrete (points),” Bauerle said. “This dispossession of Native land that this whole country benefits from — here’s a specific way that we can show you that Berkeley actually played a part in it. These are the receipts. This is how much money you got.”Bauerle partnered with Rosalie Z. Fanshel, a doctoral student in environmental science, policy and management and the program manager for the Berkeley Food Institute, to organize a conference on the Morrill Act and Indigenous land dispossession.“The UC Land Grab: A Legacy of Profit from Indigenous Land” was held in two parts in September and October. The conference dug deep into the history of California’s genocide and the founding of the University of California. Participants called for action, including shared land stewardship, research opportunities and tuition options for Indigenous students.More than 500 people attended both days of the conference. David Ackerly, dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources in Berkeley, was among them. “I felt like I was learning so much that I had not been aware of,” he said. “This is part of our story, I want to be part of this. I want to learn. I want to figure out where we’re heading.”Other attendees included staff from the office of UC President Michael V. Drake, the office of the chancellor at UC Berkeley and the governor’s office, as well as deans and administrators from various UC campuses and units.“Many Native and Indigenous people in the state and across the world have been made promises since colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”One of the panelists, Brittani Orona, a doctoral candidate in Native American studies and human rights at UC Davis and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, was surprised by how many people within the university system had no knowledge of the history of land-grant institutions. “I think with Native people and Native students, you know that our land, our places have been taken away from us, from many different institutions and at many different points of time,” Orona said.At the conference, Orona spoke about the history of genocide in California. “Scholars of California Indian genocide will say it ended in 1873, but I argue it is a continuous process,” Orona said.“Many Native and Indigenous people in the state and across the world have been made promises since colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”Orona, who will complete her Ph.D. in the coming year, hopes that future Native and Indigenous students have a different experience than she did. “What does that mean, when you’re having California Native students pay out of pocket on land that has been dispossessed from them?I appreciate the discussions that are going on, but I’ll believe it when I see it — and when it moves beyond acknowledgment towards actual actionable items that make life easier for Native and Indigenous students and peoples.”As of Dec. 4, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ has yet to respond about the conference publicly. In an email, however, she wrote, “To achieve this inclusive campus culture, we must acknowledge how our history, including the Morrill Land Grant Act, impacts Indigenous people. Now more than ever, we, as a university, must take immediate action to acknowledge past wrongs, build trusting and respectful relationships, and accelerate change and justice for our Native Nations and Tribal communities.”High Country News.Email her at[email protected]or submit aletter to the editor.Follow @jessicadd29_Thanks for subscribing!",1
78,New search launched for meth sobering center site – The San Francisco Examiner,-1.33,47.67,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/new-search-launched-for-meth-sobering-center-site/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,sfexaminer,19,"NualaIn February 2020, San Francisco was gearing up to open the nation’sfirst sobering centerspecifically for people who use methamphetamine. The center — which would take people who are high on the drug off the streets, providing them safety, medical care, and resources — was the primary recommendation of theMethamphetamine TaskForce, created in 2019. With the blessing of the mayor, plans were developed speedily to erect a tent in a parking lot of 180 Jones St. in the Tenderloin, with the goal of opening in spring of 2020.Then, the pandemic hit. Health organizations scrambled, redirecting resources to battling the virus. The opening of the meth sobering center, which was designed to include a large congregate room, was postponed, and 180 Jones St. became a pop-up safe sleeping site.Now, nearly a year after plans for the sobering center were put on hold, the project has been relaunched. But instead of a tent in a parking lot, The City is looking for a brick and mortar location. And the facility won’t just house the meth sobering center, but also a future safe consumption site — if and when California legalizes a pilot program to open one.Sobering centers are not a new idea. Since 2003, San Francisco has run an alcohol sobering center, located on Mission Street in SoMa. It takes in more than 5,000 people each year, many of whom are brought in via paramedics. In addition to providing medical support and care, the center makes direct referrals to Joe Healy, an alcohol detox program.The alcohol sobering center’s design is very intentional. The room can be seen in its entirety through windows in the staff office. Its 12 beds are low to the ground, with mats next to them, so that if someone falls out of one, they won’t sustain serious injuries. Showers and bathrooms are ADA accessible. Nurses are on hand to monitor visitors’ vital signs. All told, most people who are admitted stay six to 12 hours, before being transferred to a detox center or discharged back to the streets.“When those folks were developing their model [for the methamphetamine sobering center] they asked our in-house experts about what they need to know,” said Alice Moughamian, the alcohol sobering center’s director, noting that many people involved stopped through for tours. “Thinking about what substance people are intoxicated on really impacts how you want to physically lay out your sobering center to make sure people are safe and succeed.”On Feb. 11, HealthRIGHT 360 CEO Vitka Eisen spoke at a community meeting in the Tenderloin with San Francisco Director of Public Health Dr. Grant Colfax, left, and Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, director of Mental Health Reform at San Francisco Department of Public Health, center. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)People who are intoxicated by alcohol have very different needs from people who are high on methamphetamine. In 2019, Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, San Francisco’s director of Mental Health Reform, toured drug sobering centers in Houston, Texas, Portland, Ore. and Los Angeles for inspiration on design.“Methamphetamine is what we call a stimulant,” Nigusse Bland explains. “It’s very similar to cocaine, and it tends to cause people to have really erratic behavior. They often feel overheated. And they can be really, really confused and disoriented. On the street, you may see a person that’s pacing, engaging in repetitive motions, talking to someone that’s not really there, maybe yelling at someone because they’re having a surge of emotions. And they’re having delusions that something’s happening to them or that they might be in danger.”With that in mind, the methamphetamine sobering center being designed in San Francisco will have room for people to pace, and be active. But once they come down, they may feel exhausted, requiring a bed to sleep in for up to a day.Kathleen Silk is the managing director of behavioral health at HealthRIGHT 360, which will operate the sobering center once it opens. She helped design the first model for the tent at 180 Jones St.“The plan was a really simple one in terms of having a space for people to be quiet and sleeping, as well as active and having some tactile stimulation and an outdoor area,” she said. Storage would be built for people’s belongings, and bathrooms with showers would be installed. But plans were abandoned when the pandemic hit.“Because of the affordable housing development slated for 180 Jones St., that location for the drug sobering center was always going to be temporary,” explained Jenna Lane, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Health. “When the pandemic forced us to postpone opening a new congregate setting and to redesign it with COVID-19 distancing in mind, that shortened the amount of time we could use the space at 180 Jones St. enough that it became wiser to look for alternatives. That search continues, and SFDPH looks forward to opening a site that can serve the community for the long term.”Now, Silk is working with The City to identify a brick and mortar space, and a new design, somewhere in SoMa or the Tenderloin.“We do still want the model of a larger indoor space where we can have eyes on everybody, and a combination of different levels of activity,” Silk said.At the same time, there are new concerns about air flow and safety during the pandemic. “With COVID, there’s a ton of other implications, like what type of AC or HVAC system we’ve got going, or the capacity of people,” Silk said. “We had been playing with around 12 to 15 people for beds, or upwards of 20. We’re not trying to overextend ourselves. We run some programs that are like 60 or 70 people. That’s not what this is going to be.”The pandemic provided the time to pursue a more permanent location, but it also gave HealthRIGHT 360 the opportunity to launch its Street Crisis Response Team, which will be a key component in bringing people to the sobering center. The team, which began operating in November, consists of a paramedic, a peer support counselor and mental health therapists. Currently, it only takes calls in the Tenderloin, but the pilot program will eventually be expanded citywide.According to Silk, “They cannot wait for this to open.”Intake to the sobering center is being carefully strategized. In addition to the Street Crisis Response Team, HealthRIGHT 360 plans to launch a dedicated outreach team specifically to find people having a hard time with their methamphetamine experience, and a van to transport them to the center. Referrals will also be accepted from EMS-6, The City’s paramedic team dedicated to working with people experiencing homelessness.“Coerced involvement in this project is not what we’re going for whatsoever,” Silk said. “This has to be totally voluntary. When people are forced or given an ultimatum by law enforcement, their presence in the milieu is really disruptive and not what we’re going for here. We did not want a situation where it’s like ‘this or jail.’”The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in funding support services in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd, once word gets out, Silk expects people to walk in on their own.“At its best, this is a program where if I use drugs, I can go there myself,” she said. “I know I can knock on the door, I’m going to be invited in, and I’m going to get the resources I need, and I am not going to be told I have to stay there forever. And if I do want to sleep it off and stay there a little bit, it’s a welcoming community.”Kathleen Silk of HealthRIGHT 360 appeared before the San Francisco Health Commission on March 3, 2020, days before plans for the methamphetamine sobering center were paused due to COVID. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)^The creation of a space for people to safely ride out their methamphetamine high is one thing, but creating a route to care is an entirely different beast. People who use opioids — like heroin or fentanyl — have a variety of medications they can choose from to help withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. But despite its rapid rise in San Francisco, there are no government-approved medications to treat methamphetamine use, making treating people who are addicted to the drug tricky.What is available are treatment centers. In San Francisco, many of them are run by HealthRIGHT 360. By operating the Street Crisis Intervention Team, the methamphetamine sobering center, and both inpatient and outpatient addiction services, HealthRIGHT 360 will soon be able to move people through its systems of care fairly seamlessly.“I think one of our huge strengths for this is that not only do we have those robust programs in the area, but we also know 24-hour treatment,” Silk said. “It’s our bread and butter, and we do it well.”This means that people who come into the methamphetamine sobering center will not just receive a respite from the streets, but opportunities to receive care — from doctors who specialize in addiction medicine, to residential treatment centers, or even just an appointment with a dentist.For Silk, it’s also important that staff are trained at every level, from janitors to medical professionals. It’s her goal to make sure that every interaction with people who come in off the streets is as positive as possible. “Wherever people are willing to engage with us, we will do it,” she said.That commitment to meeting people where they’re at, and addressing their needs in the moment, is a vital key to recovery.Moughamian, from the alcohol sobering center, says they have people who come in 150 to 200 times a year. “The top 1% of our utilizers are actually 30% of our visits,” she said. Those high-utilizing visitors receive a high level of case management, and are also able to walk in without referrals.In other words, recovering from addiction requires patience. “It’s important that we acknowledge that recovery is not a linear kind of path,” Nigusse Bland said. “It takes some time. We expect people to want to return here when they’re under the influence, because the other consequences are far worse. We want them to feel this is a safe place to be.”Opening the first methamphetamine-specific sobering center in the nation is groundbreaking in itself, but San Francisco is already looking ahead. In December, state Sen. Scott Wiener reintroduced legislation to establish a safe consumption site. While it still has to clear the California legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, plans are already developing to combine a future site with the methamphetamine sobering center.In 2020, 699 people died of drug overdoses citywide.Silk said a safe consumption site is desperately needed, particularly in the wake of 699 overdose deaths that occurred across the city in 2020. “When people use in secret, they die, and when they use alone, they die,” she said.But for her, the safe consumption site and the methamphetamine sobering center are just two more resources for people who use drugs to receive the support they need. “I think one of the biggest barriers for people getting into substance use treatment is shame, and stigma,” she said. “If we are showing compassionate, non-judgmental service, we will see a higher rate of people saying, ‘you know, if HealthRIGHT can do this with me, or if Glide can allow me to do this, I can trust them a little bit further and potentially see what recovery could be like.’”There is no clear timeline on when either facility will open, but the hunt is active. And as for a name? The verdict is out. When the sobering center was slated to open at 180 Jones, HealthRIGHT 360 was toying with the name “Project 180.” Now, the organization plans to open up name ideas for the site to the community it will serve.That might come sooner than anticipated.“I have a feeling that a week from now, if we’re able to find the right space, it’ll all be happening very quickly,” Silk said.",2
79,Thousands of Central Valley farmers may lose access to surface water amid worsening drought,-1.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-23/thousands-of-california-farmers-may-lose-access-to-surface-water,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,latimes,25,"As California endures an increasingly brutal second year of drought, state water regulators are considering an emergency order that would bar thousands of Central Valley farmers from using stream and river water to irrigate their crops.On Friday, the State Water Resources Control Board released a draft “emergency curtailment” order for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed. The measure, which was first reported bythe Sacramento Bee, would bar some water rights holders from diverting surface water for agricultural and other purposes.The proposed regulation underscores just how dire matters have become as drought squeezes the American West.“It says that this drought is really severe,” said Erik  Ekdahl, deputy director of the state water board’s Division of Water Rights. The water board will consider the order’s approval on Aug. 3. If approved, it would go into effect about two weeks later at the earliest,  Ekdahl added.“This is probably the first time the board has contemplated curtailment orders for the entire bay delta watershed,” Ekdahl said. Some notices of water unavailability were sent out to water rights holders in the delta watershed during the 2014-15 time period, but this type of sweeping, formal order was not utilized, he said.If approved, the order would be implemented first with junior water rights holders, then more senior water rights holders, and then the most senior. According to Ekdahl, the board believes that more than 10,000 water rights holders would be affected, with their water largely being used for agricultural irrigation purposes. Some municipal, industrial and commercial entities could also be affected.The proposed regulation would carve out an exemption for health and human safety purposes, meaning that water for drinking, bathing and domestic purposes wouldn’t be subject to the curtailment. In mid-June, the board issueda notice of water unavailability— which urges, but does not order, people to stop diverting water — to many rights holders.The proposed emergency regulation comes at a time when the primary Northern California reservoirs that feed into California’s lakes and streams are at about 30% of capacity,  Ekdahl said. Unusually warm temperatures and dry soils have contributed to reductions in runoff from the Sierra snowpack.The water board has characterizedthe reductions as “unprecedented.”According toa water board presentation, projections for this year’s conditions degraded significantly between April and May, when watershed runoff decreased by nearly 800,000 acre-feet — an amount that is nearly equivalent to the entire capacity of Folsom Reservoir.“We’re in an extreme drought that’s come on extremely fast,” said Felicia Marcus, water policy expert and former state water board chair. According to Marcus, the proposed emergency regulation shows that the water board is working as it should to allocate water during  the shortage.“In theory, it’s a math thing. You’re looking at how much water is in the water course and if there’s not enough to meet all  the water rights, then you issue curtailment notices and orders,” Marcus explained. “That’s the way the water rights system is supposed to work.”",2

If Democrats win the two Georgia Senate seats — ousting GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler — the Senate’s partisan split would be 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats a majority.Stepien’s inadvertent admission that Biden will be president comes as Trump is refusing to accept the reality that he lost reelection.Not only is Trump refusing to accept reality, but he’s tweeting a steady stream ofliesthat falsely say mass voter fraud led to Biden’s victory, and that Trump is the actual winner.Trump’s deluded claims are beingbacked up by Republican lawmakersand elected officials, who have filed lawsuits seeking to overturn Biden’s win to hand the presidency to Trump.Courts across the country havethrown out those lawsuits, with the Supreme Court likely to toss alast-ditch effortby the Texas attorney general tooverturn the resultsin four states Biden won.As for the Georgia runoffs and control of the Senate,pollssay the race is close.

81,Tribes denounce North Dakota ID law in congressional hearing,-0.75,47.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/tribes-denounce-north-dakota-id-law-in-congressional-hearing,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,pbs,25,"BISMARCK, N.D. — Native American voters face poor access to polling sites, discrimination by poll workers and unfair identification requirements, tribal leaders told members of Congress who traveled Tuesday to a reservation in North Dakota wherevoting rightswere a key issue in last year’s U.S. Senate race.A House elections subcommittee’s meeting at the Standing Rock reservation was the latest in a series of on-site visits across the country on voting-rights issues. Activists told the panel that obstacles still remain more than five decades after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to eliminate such impediments for minority voters.“There continues to be barriers — interpersonal and systemic — at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across the state,” said activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota.The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota’s voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory and suppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominant state.The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a U.S. Senate race in North Dakota that was seen as critical to Republicans’ chances to keep control of the Senate. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who was seeking a second term.North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provable street address, which Secretary of State Al Jaeger says guards against fraud. Tribes allege the moves by state GOP leaders disenfranchised members who live on reservations where street addresses are uncommon or unknown and where post office boxes are the primary addresses.“The state knew this and they used it to suppress tribal voters,” said Charles Walker, CEO of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation.State officials have denied that. The U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed the state to continue requiring street addresses on voter IDs, though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a dissent that “the risk of voter confusion appears severe.”The decision led to an intense effort by tribes and advocacy groups to get tribal members to the polls with proper ID during November’s general election. It was largely successful but cost the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribes a combined $14,000, in part because they waived normal fees for tribal IDs.“Fifteen dollars is milk and bread for a week for a poor family,” said Turtle Mountain Chippewa attorney Alysia LaCounte, who broke down in tears during her testimony.U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout.Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: “We don’t think that outrage is a get-out-the-vote strategy, right?”“There are voter suppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren’t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it just so happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the national stage,” DeLeon said.Davis replied, “So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?”North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp’s surprise 2012 win influenced state voter ID law.OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has been successful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and other states, implored the subcommittee to work to increase federal dollars that states can dedicate to helping Native American voters.“The backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,” he said.",2

He says Sudan didn’t start the conflict, Ethiopia did, and now its eye for an eye. He says they killed Sudanese women and killed our farmers and burnt the lands before, and they claimed that it’s not Sudanese land and accused Sudan of entering their lands.Authorities in Sudan’s al-Qadarif state say residents of at least 34 villages near the border have been displaced.Sudan and Ethiopia formed a joint committee in December to resolve the long-standing dispute over al-Fashaga, located where northwestern Ethiopia meets southeastern Sudan.However, the Ethiopian ambassador in Khartoum has accused the Sudanese military of taking advantage of the war in the Tigray region to seize disputed land. Yibeltal Aemero called on Sudan’s military to withdraw from the border region and stop its military operations.“Very recently, in the first week of November 2020, we witnessed unprecedented military incursion by the Sudan while the joint special committee was still in progress and when the Ethiopian National Defense forces moved to Tigray region on November, 4, 2020 for the law enforcement majors, the Sudanese army took the advantage and entered deep inside Ethiopian territory, looted properties, burned camps, detained, attacked and killed the Ethiopians while displacing thousands,"" said Aemero.Many Sudanese condemned the ambassador’s accusations and called on the military to take wider actions.Security observers think the conflict could have severe ramifications in the region.Military expert Sawarmi Kahlid says the recent escalation has very risky security impacts on the residents in the border area and the troops in both sides. Also the call of war is threatening large groups of people and tribes, especially in Ethiopia, where these tribes are already witnessing a famine.More than 50,000 Ethiopians recently fled the war in the Tigray region for refugee camps in eastern Sudan. The Sudanese government has moved many of them away from the border, citing the security situation.",2
84,House Democrats make their case to Senate Republicans: Trump duped his rioters — and he'll dump you,-20.0,35.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/02/11/house-democrats-make-their-case-to-senate-republicans-trump-duped-his-rioters--and-hell-dump-you/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-11,salon,25,"""His directive is Trump first,"" House impeachment manager and Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island reminded the Senate during the second day of arguments in support of the singular article of impeachment filed against the former president. It's a crucial takeaway that should be heeded by the Senate Republicans who plan to acquit Trump, caring not one bit about the overwhelming evidence of his guilt in inciting an insurrection on January 6. Senate Republicans are putting their loyalty to and fear of the sociopathic man-child from Mar-A-Lago over their patriotism and basic sense of decency. But as Cicilline pointed out, no matter what you do for Trump, no matter how much you debase yourself for Trump, no matter what risks you take for Trump, he will not hesitate to throw you under the bus.The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has been overshadowed by the fact that the majority of Senate Republicans plan to acquit Trump. So the only real question is whether or not the House Democrats who are arguing the case against Trump can maximally expose the cowardice and complicity of the Republicans.House Democrats kicked off arguments on Thursday with a compelling presentation by Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, focused on how the insurrectionists believed they were there on Trump's orders. ""They actually believed they would face no punishment,"" DeGette explained, noting that the ""mob screamed at officers that they were listening to President Trump"" and ""believed the commander-in-chief ordered this.""The rioters were so dead certain that they were safe from consequences, DeGette pointed out, that they didn't bother to hide their identities. On the contrary, as most commentators remarked on in the days after the attack, they were so unafraid that huge numbers of them livestreamed, photographed, or otherwise advertised their participation in the insurrection.The reason these insurrectionists were sure that they'd be free of consequences isn't mysterious. It's because Trump promised them that they'd be safe. In the speech he gave sending the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump literally said, ""When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.""Even as the House managers argued their case, more evidence emerged proving it.New court documents from the Department of Justice revealed, CNN reported, that the leader of the Ohio Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, ""believed she was responding to the call from then-President Donald Trump himself."" The documents show that Watkins was deeply concerned ""about taking action without his backing."" As federal prosecutors argued, this was ""evident in a November 9, 2020, text in which she stated, 'I am concerned this is an elaborate trap. Unless the POTUS himself activates us, it's not legit.'""Trump gave the order to ""march"" on the Capitol and instructed that there is ""not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" The insurrectionists felt like they were shielded from consequences and free to ransack the building. After all, Trump promised the rules were now ""very different.""But they were not safe, as DeGette laid out.Over 200 people have been arrested and charged so far, some on very serious charges. Some of the rioters, DeGette noted, have since said they were ""duped"" by Trump,including Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnon shaman"" who became the face of the riot withhis weird buffalo headdress. On Wednesday,a lawyer for another one of the riotersreleased a statementcomplaining that his client, like many who heeded Trump's call, ""will be spending substantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence. Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.""The evidence does point to the long-standing truth grifters like Trump understand: The best marks are people who think they're part of the conspiracy. That's how Trump gets people. He lures them in by appealing to their ugliest impulses — like the growing Republican desire to unfairly seize power by undermining democracy — and then leaves his co-conspirators, who clearly followed Trump because they liked the idea of a fascist insurrection, holding the bag.""He lied to his base, saying this was all okay,"" Rep Ted Lieu of California said during his argument on Thursday.Democrats finished their case against Trump in a way that was just as impressive as they began it, meticulously laying out the facts while not shying away from the emotions brought on by these terrible events. Lieu was particularly hard-hitting, pointing out that, ""When you or I make a mistake and something very bad happens, we would show remorse,"" but Trump's reaction to January 6 was to brag about how perfect his behavior was, showing how intentional this was from the beginning.The Senate Republicans who are lining up to shield Trump should really think long and hard about why on Earth they want to protect a man who wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire. A man who always repays loyalty with spit in the face. A man who thanked his vice president, Mike Pence, for years of loyal service by sending a mob to kill him. A man who, as the House managers amply demonstrated with court documents, didn't care who he killed by inciting an insurrection, even if the victims were his most sycophantic supporters in Congress.But ultimately, the real question isn't whether Trump is guilty. Everyone knows he is. The only question is whether Senate Republicans want to be complicit with an insurrection that directly threatened their own lives. Presumably, they think they're playing 11th-level chess and will get some political advantage out of it. But in the end, they're no better than the morons who stormed the Capitol because Trump told them it was ""allowed."" And if they believe otherwise, it's because Trump has successfully exploited their own overblown egos against them — as he does to all of his marks.",1
85,"They Went Back to India to Care for Parents Dying of COVID-19. Now, They’re Stranded.",-5.33,46.33,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/they-went-back-to-india-to-care-for-parents-dying-of-covid-19-now-theyre-stranded/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,motherjones,25,"Medical staff attend to COVID-19 patients in the emergency ward at the Holy Family hospital in New Delhi on May 06, 2021.Rebecca Conway/Getty ImagesIn early April, Ashu Mahajan and his wife, Neha, got the bad news: Ashu’s father in India was sick with COVID-19. For days, Ashu and Neha kept tabs on him from New Jersey, but when he took a turn for the worse, Ashu decided to fly to India to see him one last time.Nearly two weeks ago, Ashu arrived in India, and rushed to his father’s bedside to say goodbye. His father passed away a few days later. Ashu was consumed by grief, yet he was also eager to get back to Neha and their nine- and 15-year-old daughters in the United States. But there’s a problem: He can’t. President Biden’s ban on travel from India began Tuesday night, so Ashu is effectively stranded.Even before Ashu left, Neha said she knew in her heart that her husband may have bought a one way ticket to India.“We both knew that this can get really, really bad for us,” she said. “Immigrant workers here in the United States of America, we’re all going through this dilemma—to take care of our sick parents in India, or to stay here just to make sure that our visa stamping doesn’t expire, so that we don’t lose what we’ve built with all the hard work that we’ve done.”Technically, Ashu should be able to come home. President Biden’stravel ban, instituted amidskyrocketing casesof COVID-19 in India, isn’t supposed to include US citizens, permanent residents, international students on visas, or Indians on non-immigrant work visas such as H-1B who have children born in the United States.Ashu and Neha Mahajan with their two daughters in New JerseyNeha and Ashu MahajanAshu is in that last category, but a bureaucratic hurdle stands in his way: H-1B workers, whenever they leave the United States, have to get their visas stamped at a US consulate in their home country before they can return. But right now, all the consulates in India are closed because of the pandemic. “I heard about the travel exemption, but it doesn’t do anything for us,” said Neha, who is an advocate for skilled visa workers and an outreach manager at a law firm.What about those who need to get a visa stamped but cannot get it as the consulates are closed? DOS should restart visa stamping within US like they did till 2004. Makes no sense to make someone travel to 🇮🇳 to get a visa when he is living in 🇺🇸 for 10+ years.— Anirban Das (@anirb_das)May 5, 2021Neha and Ashu aren’t the only ones whose family has been separated by the travel ban. While it’s hard to estimate the actual number of Indian H-1B visa holders stuck in India, my reporting turned up dozens of stories. Earlier this week, I joined a Telegram group on Indian visa holders with 20,000 members and asked how many were in this situation. More than 200 people replied to my message on the same day, though Indian advocates say the number is likely to be in the higher hundreds or thousands.On Telegram, the heart-wrenching stories just kept coming: a father separated from his toddler son. Children on dependent visas of H-1B holders unable to get their visas stamped and return to school. Pregnant women who couldn’t get their visa on time and had to deliver in India in the middle of a pandemic. A fiancé who flew for his wedding and is stuck. Many left the United States to take care of sick parents during the pandemic. My phone is continuously pinging with replies such as these (responses very lightly edited for clarity):“Both me and my husband are stuck here. My husband is going to lose his job with a reputed employer as they don’t allow working from India.”“My wife and US born kid are stuck. Cannot get stamping.”“We’ve been stuck in India for the last six months. I got my visa stamped, but my son who is not a citizen and is on a dependent visa had his appointment cancelled. He’s very upset and depressed.”“I traveled while pregnant as my mom and dad were both diagnosed with COVID and were admitted to hospital. My son needs an H4 visa which he can’t get because the consulates are closed. Husband is also here and can’t work remotely for very long. Our future has become uncertain.”“I am stuck in India and two-year-old son and wife are alone in San Francisco.”“We came since my father passed away, but our appointments were canceled last week We can travel with a US born kid, but how can we travel without a valid visa? My elder son studies there and his education has also gone for a toss.”“We are stuck in India because of stamping and our company can’t hold the job for long…we could lose our jobs. We have mortgages.”According to a2020report from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, there are around 500,000 workers on H-1B visas in the United States Most of them work in the technology sector, though there are also manydoctors, pharmacists, consultants, and marketing professionals. Around70 percentof these visas are held by Indians.Because of a Trump administration policy, many H-1B workers were already in India before the ban went into effect. In 2020, during the last year of his presidency, Trump ordered a temporary suspension on all new H-1B visas. For many months last year, US consulates in India were also closed due to the pandemic. Both of these things together made it difficult for H-1B visa holders to travel back and forth to India.The Trump-era banexpiredat the end of March, and the situation was supposed to improve. The Covid situation in India improved for a little bit earlier this year, and consulates opened for a short while and resumed processing visas, but with this new travel ban and an escalating pandemic, those who have been stuck since last year have no way of getting back anytime soon.Another complicating factor is theabsurdly long waitlistfor green cards: over to50 years, according to estimates from the CATO institute. Every year, thousands of H-1B holders qualify for green cards, yet there’s a cap on how many green cards can be issued to each nationality. As of May 2018, nearly600,000workers and their families were waiting for employment-based green cards. More than 90 percent are Indians, who receive about 10,000 employment-based green cards a year. Meanwhile, they have to rely on visa renewals and stamping of the visa at consulates at regular intervals.“Without a green card, there is always an invisible sword hanging over my head,” said Neha, who has been stuck in the green card backlog since 2012.Immigration advocates believe the travel ban isn’t worth the stress it’s causing families.Cyrus Mehta, a New York based attorney who specializes in immigration law, said that the ban isn’t very useful in stopping the spread of the virus since citizens, permanent residents, and others are still allowed to travel. But the ban disproportionately affects those who are working on temporary visas such as the H-1B visa.“Representing H1B visa holders, I know what they’ve gone through,” he said. “Each time they go to India, there’s a ban imposed on them. In the Trump administration, they were subject to bans. Then they wait patiently. They’ve now scheduled a visa appointment. And their appointment for later this week has been cancelled because of this latest COVID ban on India. So they’ve got a double whammy.”Mehta suggests stricter controls and protocols such as rigorous testing, quarantining, and vaccination requirements as a better approach to controlling the spread of the virus.Neha has a full-time job, two kids and is recovering from surgery. For the past few weeks, Neha has spent all her free time calling consulates, politicians and speaking with journalists to find a way to get her husband back into the country.“I haven’t slept a wink,” she said. “I am not a religious person, but these days I am praying to god everyday.”",2

Since Trump called in the Feds, the  turmoil and violence has escalated. We all know what Trump is doing, the Feds are baiting the demonstrators, and when they react to the  police violence, Fox News is there to convince the American people that the demonstrators are the bad guys, and the police are the good guys. This is a political recipe that is as old as lying itself. The Feds and  the News want to shape public opinion that these violent protests are being committed by mobs of anarchists and thugs. Now, if the American people really want to know about mobs and thugs, they can go back in  history and examine the U.S. Empire, when their military is sent all over the world to steal and murder for corporate profits. But, I am getting ahead of myself, as the U.S. swarming locust have come to Portland to convince people all over the nation that the Federal Government is protecting us  from violent descent.

I was very fortunate to get this image, because shortly after I took it, I got consumed by CS gas. That gas makes you very  humble, as you just turn and get the hell out of that space.

While this is going on, another cop his hitting Christopher David on the legs  with a long baton. That cop also hit him in the hand and broke two bones. And,  while this is all going on CS gas is everywhere. Seconds after I took this picture, this Navy vet turns the opposite direction and flips the cops off with both fingers. This  is a remarkable story, as this protester stood his fucking ground.The bottom phot is an image I took on July 19, 2020. On this  particular night, the cops chased us a couple of blocks. They then started firing projectiles at us from a couple of different weapons, to include more tear gas. As you can see in  this picture, the cop on the far right has just fired a munition round. One round  set off a fire, which the protesters quickly put out. I took a few more pictures of the cops firing what they like to call less than lethal riot munitions. As the cops  backed away from the intersection, one of them fired a round at me, as I saw it coming and hurriedly stepped out of the way, as it missed me by a few feet. I  can’t imagine taking a direct hit from one of these rounds, because it can kill  you if it hits you in the head. This is exactly what almost happened to a 26-year-old  man last week who was hit in the head by a projectile across the street from the Federal Justice Center. His name is Donavan La Bella. He was knocked  unconscious, and you can still see his blood on the sidewalk. He was sent to  the hospital where emergency reconstructive surgery was performed. He  will survive.It is hard to tell where this stand-off with the police is going. The Feds don’t  know this town, so they think they can control the tens of thousands of activists who live in Portland, Oregon, which George H.W. Bush labeled, ” Little Beirut.”The Feds are playing a chess game with Portland. If there is more overwhelming  violence against protesters, and more people get injured, or possibly killed, the  call from social media will bring out 50 thousand people to the streets. I have  been around these black belt protesters a lot, they are fearless, and I might say, they have become professional. As John Lewis once said: ” Find a way to get in the way.” His legacy is now in Portland, Oregon. I need to close, as John Lewis is calling me to prepare for another night.Use code 30years for 30% off all Merchandise!Dismiss",1
88,Is D.C. statehood about fair representation or Democratic power grab?,12.33,36.67,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/4/21/22395777/dc-statehood-about-fair-representation-democratic-power-grab-romney-biden-lee-stewart,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-21,deseret,22,"House Democrats are poised to again pass a bill to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state. But they won’t get any help from Utah Republicans in Congress who see it as nothing more than a power grab.Though the margin might be slimmer this time, the House is expected to pass the Washington, D.C., Admission Act for the second time in two years.Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.’s delegate in the House who can propose legislation but not vote on it, said proponents will make the case that Congress has the constitutional authority to admit the state of Washington, D.C., and that it would meet all of the traditional elements lawmakers have considered in admission decisions.For the 220 years since the District of Columbia became the nation’s capital, residents have always had all of the obligations of citizenship, including paying full federal taxes and serving in the armed forces, but have been excluded from much of American democracy, she said.“The citizens who live in our nation’s capital have never had voting representation on the floor of either chamber of Congress, and Congress has always had the final say on their local affairs. This is uniquely un-American, and it is undemocratic,” Norton said.The bill would give residents full representation in Congress, while maintaining a federal district that would continue to serve as the nation’s seat of government.Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewart said the push to make D.C. a state has nothing to do with whether the people of the District have fair representation.Democrats, he said, wouldn’t back the bill if D.C. were a reliably Republican area. D.C. residents voted 92% Democratic in the last presidential election.“This is about politics,” he said on KSL Newsradio. “This is about getting two solid Democratic members of the Senate. That allows them to pack the Supreme Court, allows them to break the filibuster, allows the Green New Deal, allows a whole bunch of incredibly progressive even radical legislation, and that’s what they’re trying to achieve by this.”Making D.C. a state would impact Utah in that it would make conservative principles espoused in the state harder to implement at the federal level, he said.D.C. residents chose to live there knowing they were living under “slightly different government accommodation, and they’ve known that for 200 years,” Stewart said.Making Washington, D.C., a state is unconstitutional and not what the Founding Fathers intended, he said. It needs to remain autonomous and free from the influence of states and the federal government, he said.In 1788, the District of Columbia contained 100 square miles that were carved out of Virginia and Maryland. Thirty-one of those square miles were returned to Virginia in 1846, leaving the 69 that once had been part of Maryland.The District’s 712,000 residents have no vote in Congress, but they do elect their own city council, mayor and school board.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, does not favor D.C. statehood but suggested a compromise that would make the District part of a contiguous state and able to vote with that state.“My own view is that we should maintain the system we have and not try and pack the Senate, like the Democrats are trying to pack the Supreme Court,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But if there were a desire to provide greater representation for the people of D.C., combining D.C. with Maryland, from which the land was originally taken, would make more sense.”Even if Norton’s bill gets through the House, it would face obstacles in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass, meaning 10 Republicans would have to cross party lines.“Unequivocally, this about adding additional Democratic senators to the U.S. Senate,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, recently told the far-right cable channel One America News. “If people try to dress it up as anything other than that, I strongly disagree with them.”Lee said he understands residents’ arguments about representation but that the solution isn’t creating another state. He said there could be a state of Washington, D.C., and a federal city that includes the Capitol, Supreme Court and White House.“I believe that there is a way to make it constitutional but it’s still a horrible idea,” he said.If it’s decided that D.C. doesn’t need to be the nation’s capital city and an independent district, the solution is to give it back to Maryland, Lee said.The Biden administration came out in support of Norton’s legislation Tuesday.The Office of Management and Budget in a statement of administration policy called for Congress to “provide for a swift and orderly transition to statehood for the people of Washington, D.C.”“This taxation without representation and denial of self-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our nation was founded,” according to the statement.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that President Joe Biden “believes they deserve representation, that’s why he supports D.C. statehood.”",1

But while it is well-known that the United States is a major aid supplier to Israel, the degree to which the Israeli military relies on US planes, bombs, and missiles is not fully appreciated.According to statisticscompiledby the Center for International Policy’s Security Assistance Monitor, the United States has provided Israel with $63 billion in security aid over the past two decades, over 90 percent of it from the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, a grant program that provides funds to buy US weaponry. But US support of the Israeli state goes back much further—total US military and economic aid to Israel exceeds$236 billion(in inflation-adjusted, 2018 dollars) since its founding—nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. Not only has US financial support helped Israel outfit its military, but it has been used tosubsidizeIsrael’s development of its own military industry, which produces, among other things, armeddronesthat have been used for attacks on targets in Gaza.The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is a case in point. According to theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies(IISS), Israel has 324 fighter and ground attack aircraft, all of US origin: 83 Boeing F-15s, 224 Lockheed Martin F-16s, and 16 Lockheed Martin F-35s. So, if someone asks whether US-supplied planes have been involved in bombing Gaza, it doesn’t require a research project to answer with an emphatic yes. Israel also possesses US attack helicopters, transport planes, precision-guided bombs, and air-to-surface missiles. And US aid powers the IAF,providingbillions of dollars’ worth of fuel under the government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.Despite Israeli conduct, the aid spigot remains wide open. Israel is in the third year of a 10-year,$38 billionaid memorandum of understanding negotiated under the Obama-Biden administration. The United Statesdoes notmake any comparable written agreement regarding a decade-long future financial commitment for foreign or domestic appropriations.Popular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyPopular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyRelated ArticleI Will Not Be Silenced Because I Demand Justice for PalestineAhmad Omar DaraldikAnd earlier this month, on May 5, Congress was notified of a planned$735 milliondeal for precision-guided bombs destined for Israel.

That may be changing. The recentgeneral strikeby millions of Palestinians that was reinforced by largedemonstrationsacross the United States is just the latest manifestation of years of organizing by Palestinians and their allies to change US policy towards Israel. Organizations like theUS Campaign for Palestinian Rights,Jewish Voice for Peace, and theAdalah Justice Project, who have long been calling for a cutoff of US military aid to Israel, have been joined by allies throughout the broader US progressive movement, including the Movement for Black Lives, which hasstated,“The fight for Palestinian rights and dignity is integral to the fight for human rights everywhere” and demanded that “the US divest the $3.8 billion of public dollars that goes to Israel in military funding each year.”Human Rights Watch recently released a groundbreakingreportthat asserted that some of Israel’s actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories led to “deprivations [that] are so severe that they amount to crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.” And last month, the prominent centrist think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued areportcalling for a “rights-based approach” to US policy on Israel/Palestine that “would prioritize protecting the rights and human security of Palestinians and Israelis.”Current IssueView our current issueThe political landscape in Congress is beginning to change as well. There’s still plenty of uncritical support for Israel on Capitol Hill, but the ground is shifting. One used to have to look far and wide for vocal support for Palestinian rights in the House or Senate, but on May 14 a group of House members—including Democratic Representatives Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pocan, Cori Bush, and Ayanna Pressley—took to the floor of the chamber to make a plea for the Biden administration to recognize the basic humanity of the Palestinians and to press harder for Israel to stop the killing. In a searingspeech, Tlaib said, “We can’t have an honest conversation about American military support for the Israeli government without acknowledging that for Palestinians the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization has been ongoing in their homeland since 1948.… We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international human rights and end the apartheid.” And Senator Sanders  took to the pages oftocall for“an evenhanded approach, one that upholds and strengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing U.S. law holding that the provision of U.S. military aid must not enable human rights abuses.” Evenenforcingexisting US human rights laws with respect to Israel’s use of US weaponry could go a long way toward ending impunity in the use of US armaments.Perhaps the greatest sign of progress in Congress comes from the newbillby Representative Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), which prohibits the use of US funds to enable violations of international and human rights law. The bill, which has 18 cosponsors, will face an uphill battle in Congress, but hills are made for climbing, and as public pressure for accountability over Israel’s use of military aid grows, so will support for the legislation.In McCollum’swords, “Now is the time to send a clear message to the Israeli government: Not one dollar more of U.S. military aid can be used to demolish Palestinian homes, annex Palestinian lands, and torture or kill Palestinian children.”As of late yesterday, the Israeli government and Hamas hadannounceda mutual cease-fire in Gaza, a goal the Biden administration had pressed in private conversations with Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. Hopefully the cease-fire will hold, but it is far from the only issue raised by the US arming of the Israeli military. On the whole, the Biden administration has been far too quiet in the face of ongoing Israeli atrocities. It should use the leverage provided by US aid to Israel to press forcefully for an end to the repression throughout Israel and the occupied territories, and to hold the Israeli government accountable for what Amnesty International hassuggestedmay be war crimes committed in Gaza.According to statisticscompiledby the Center for International Policy’s Security Assistance Monitor, the United States has provided Israel with $63 billion in security aid over the past two decades, over 90 percent of it from the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, a grant program that provides funds to buy US weaponry.

In a searingspeech, Tlaib said, “We can’t have an honest conversation about American military support for the Israeli government without acknowledging that for Palestinians the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization has been ongoing in their homeland since 1948.… We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international human rights and end the apartheid.” And Senator Sanders  took to the pages oftocall for“an evenhanded approach, one that upholds and strengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing U.S. law holding that the provision of U.S. military aid must not enable human rights abuses.” Evenenforcingexisting US human rights laws with respect to Israel’s use of US weaponry could go a long way toward ending impunity in the use of US armaments.Perhaps the greatest sign of progress in Congress comes from the newbillby Representative Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), which prohibits the use of US funds to enable violations of international and human rights law. The bill, which has 18 cosponsors, will face an uphill battle in Congress, but hills are made for climbing, and as public pressure for accountability over Israel’s use of military aid grows, so will support for the legislation.In McCollum’swords, “Now is the time to send a clear message to the Israeli government: Not one dollar more of U.S. military aid can be used to demolish Palestinian homes, annex Palestinian lands, and torture or kill Palestinian children.”As of late yesterday, the Israeli government and Hamas hadannounceda mutual cease-fire in Gaza, a goal the Biden administration had pressed in private conversations with Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. Hopefully the cease-fire will hold, but it is far from the only issue raised by the US arming of the Israeli military. On the whole, the Biden administration has been far too quiet in the face of ongoing Israeli atrocities. It should use the leverage provided by US aid to Israel to press forcefully for an end to the repression throughout Israel and the occupied territories, and to hold the Israeli government accountable for what Amnesty International hassuggestedmay be war crimes committed in Gaza.Marshall GanzFeature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianFeature/Mohammed El-KurdComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyMarshall GanzFeature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianFeature/Mohammed El-KurdComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyAhmad Omar DaraldikAnd earlier this month, on May 5, Congress was notified of a planned$735 milliondeal for precision-guided bombs destined for Israel.

90,"With Abuse Victims Trapped at Home, Detroit Moves Restraining Order System Online",0.0,47.0,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/detroit-michigan-online-restraining-order-personal-protection-order-domestic-violence/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-29,thetrace,16,"Before the pandemic spread, getting a domestic violence restraining order was an onerous process in Wayne County, Michigan, which includes Detroit, Dearborn, and several smaller cities. Obtaining one required going in person to the court building to complete several pieces of paperwork, waiting around to see if a petition was granted, and then finding out when a hearing would take place. The whole process could take all day. “It can be incredibly intimidating to file a personal protection order,” said Jeni Hooper, program coordinator of the community response team at First Step, an advocacy group in Detroit for survivors of domestic violence.The coronavirus has required court systems to adapt — and at a time when expertswarnthat social isolation, economic uncertainty, anda historic wave of gun-buyingare driving up domestic abuse. Calls to the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violencewere up102 percent in March and the first half of April, compared to the same period last year.In Wayne County, officials accelerated plans to digitize the process for a personal protection order (PPO) as it is called locally. On April 17, three days before its courthouses closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Wayne County Circuit Courtlauncheda digital portal through which people canrequest ordersremotely. As part of theprocess, a petitioner can ask a judge to prohibit the respondent from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Themajority of stateslack an automatic gun prohibition with an temporary pre-hearing order, even though experts warn that a failure to disarm abusers when an order is served exacerbates the risks for victims.Kathleen McCarthy, the presiding judge in the family division of Wayne County Circuit Court who spearheaded the e-filing program, said that when she was deciding whether to temporarily close the courthouse last month, her biggest concern was how domestic violence survivors would be able to get restraining orders. Growing up in a household with domestic violence had made her particularly attuned to the risks, she added.The pandemic “turned everything on its head and forced everyone to learn and to acquire the technology to do these things in a more up-to-date fashion,” McCarthy said.In 2018, Wayne County had the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents by county in Michigan, according toa Trace analysisof the most recent availablecrime statisticsfrom the Michigan State Police and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.When a state stay-at-home order started on March 24, officials and advocates in Michigan feared the problem would get worse. “A lot of times people need to get these personal protection orders and the person they need to get it against is still somewhere around them,” said Shelly Drain, an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County.“The pandemic puts survivors at a much more increased risk because they can be isolated with their abuser,” added Hooper.In April, the county registered a slight decline in reported incidents of domestic violence compared to the last year,accordingto an analysis of county data by theDetroit Free Press. But local crisis centers have reported an increase in calls about domestic violence in the same period compared to last year, a possible sign of underreporting.McCarthy says the e-filing system has been processing an average of 17 PPO applications per day, about the same volume that came through the old system in March. That’s down from a pre-pandemic average of about 25 per day, she said.Researchshowsthat when an abuser has access to a gun, the risk of homicide becomesfive timesmore likely. Federal lawbarsconvicted abusers and those subject to domestic violence protective orders from owning guns. But the law refers to permanent orders of protection that have been handed down by a judge, not orders that are served prior to a hearing.Twenty-one stateseither bar gun possession for people subject to a PPO before a hearing is held, or allow a judge to authorize a gun prohibition. Michigan falls into the latter category. Most of the time, Drain said, judges in Wayne County order a gun prohibition even if a petitioner hasn’t asked for it. McCarthy added that all sitting judges in her jurisdiction must attend domestic violence training, where “it’s clearly taught that removing guns from the household is the number one way, if you can, to prevent a fatality.”Thee-filing systemmakes it much easier for petitioners, whether in a pandemic or not, said Hooper, whose group is one of several domestic violence organizations available to help petitioners complete the process. They can file on behalf of a domestic violence survivor if that person is unable to access the forms themself. The courtwebsitealso makes it easier for petitioners to find court-approved process servers or send documents by certified mail.Georgea Cole, an advocate for victims with the Americorps Urban Safety Domestic Violence Program at Wayne State University, spends the vast majority of her time helping domestic violence survivors file for PPOs, including through the new system.Normally, she works out of police stations throughout Detroit, speaking with people who are referred by an officer or via a domestic violence hotline. She says working from home has hindered her ability to connect with survivors. “You can’t get that kind of refuge virtually,” she said.But for other survivors who are unable to get to a physical place of safe harbor, the online filing system offers potentially life-saving access — even without the pandemic or state of emergency. Cole said she thinks that the addition of online filing after the state reopens can allow for the greatest access possible for survivors whose circumstances restrict different resources.“We see both of the methods work,” Cole said. “But everything is not for everybody.”Wayne County is not the first place to add an e-filing system for personal protection orders. Macomb County in Michigan has had such a system in place since 2018. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, three states — Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin — allowed people to electronically file restraining order petitions directly to the court without having to visit a courthouse or meet with a legal advocate, according to an analysis of data from theNational Center for State Courts. Since the pandemic began, others likeUtahhave also allowed temporary restraining order petitions to be emailed directly to the court.But online systems remain unusual. And that largely comes down to funding, said Rachel Teicher, director of intimate partner violence intervention at the National Network For Safe Communities. “It costs money to set up these systems and adopt them and make sure they’re secure and that the process works,” said Teicher. But she said the investment is worth it. “It saves victims a lot of time and stress.”Wayne County officials hope that other jurisdictions might follow their lead. Said Drain, “It can really be rolled out everywhere.”",2
91,Bill Cassidy Blames White House 'Partisan Statements' for Vaccine Mistrust in His State,8.33,37.0,https://www.newsweek.com/bill-cassidy-blames-white-house-partisan-statements-vaccine-mistrust-his-state-1610822,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,newsweek,25,"Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) says the White House and PresidentJoe Biden's ""partisan statements"" are to blame for low vaccination rates in Louisiana.Cassidy joined Chris Wallace onto discuss Biden's $3 trillion infrastructure bill and vaccination rates in the Bayou State.Near the end of the conversation, Wallace turned the subject to COVID-19 vaccines, asking the senator why Louisana has such an unwillingness to get the shot. The state's vaccination rate is currently at 36 percent, the fifth-lowest in the nation, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Cassidy pointed to the White House andDemocratsinCongressfor Louisiana's mistrust of the vaccine. He explained that going back and forth on partisanship is not working.""People are surprised when citizens don't trust government, when you have partisan comments coming out of the White House regarding next Jim Crow laws, [and] people like Senator [Chuck] Schumer and the White House not cooperating on a bipartisan bill,"" Cassidy said. ""'Oh, here we're going to be partisan, but over here you better trust us.' That just doesn't work.""The senator said ""it shouldn't be the president advocating"" for the vaccine, but rather the healthcare workers in the state. As a medical doctor himself, Cassidy believes the healthcare workers have the power to increase vaccination rates if partisanship is cut from the discussion.""You need to have your doctor, your nurse, your physician's assistants, who's speaking to the patients they normally care for, they see at the PTA meeting, they otherwise communicate 'this is good, it saves lives.'""""What I'm doing, I'm trying to educate,"" Cassidy told Wallace.In the interview, Cassiday said he will be pushing his state to make the choice ""between vaccination or accepting higher rates of death.""OnTwitter, he said he would like to see Louisiana's vaccination rate increase to ""beat the pandemic.""Louisiana needs to get our vaccination rates up if we're going to fully beat this pandemic. We can’t accept anymore death. Vaccines are like seatbelts—you want to have it before the accident happens.https://t.co/d5t6TTIDCU""Vaccines are like seatbelts—you want to have it before the accident happens,"" he captioned a tweet linking an article about Dr. Catherine O'Neal, chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. O'Neal emphasized the ""vaccine or death"" choice.""That's the way to communicate through your physician, your nurse, your PA, etc., not through some uber-partisan person who's asked us to trust them except when they're making incredibly partisan statements,"" Cassidy said.Former PresidentDonald Trumpshared Cassidy's sentiment in a statement released from his Save America PAC on Sunday. Trump blasted Biden for boasting about his progress in managing the pandemic, noting that the vaccine was created under the Trump Administration.""[Biden] is not doing well at all. He's way behind schedule, and people are refusing to take the vaccine because they don't trust his administration, they don't trust the election results and they certainly don't trust the Fake News, which is refusing to tell the truth,"" Trump wrote.reached out to the White House for comment, but did not hear back by publication time.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.To read how Newsweek uses AI as a newsroom tool,Click here.",1
92,Americans From Both Parties Want Weed To Be Legal. Why Doesn’t The Federal Government Agree?,-0.33,48.67,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marijuana-legalization-is-super-popular-why-hasnt-it-happened-nationally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-23,fivethirtyeight,25,"Tuesday markedthe international holiday for marijuana— and consumers of the plant had lots to celebrate this year.New York,VirginiaandNew Mexicoall passed legislation in 2021 legalizing marijuana,1bringing the total number of states whererecreational consumption is legalup to 17, along with Washington, D.C. At the federal level, the House of Representativespassed a billthis week which allows banks toconduct business with cannabis-related companies in states where marijuana has been legalized,with the support of about half of the chamber’s Republicans and almost all of its Democrats; the bill now awaits its fate in the Senate.passed the House in 2019but wasn’t brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.But even if Biden may not be ready to pivot on marijuana legalization just yet (decriminalization, not legalization for recreational use, was part of his campaign platform), the polling on the issue has been loud and clear: People want weed to be legal.Gallup has asked Americans about whether they support legalizing marijuana since 1969, when only 12 percent of Americans supported the idea. As of their most recent poll last November, that number has ticked up to 68 percent, thehighest level of supporton record. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of states where recreational marijuana is now legal has also steadily increased since the Obama administration announced in 2013 thatit wouldn’t block state lawsthat legalized the drug, provided that marijuana was strongly regulated.And if recent polling in states where marijuana is not yet legal for recreational use is any indication, it is possible that even more states will change course. Although, as the chart above shows, legislators have often been slow to legalize marijuana for recreational use: Thirteen of the 18 states where marijuana is legal have done it via voter-driven ballot initiatives rather than legislation. That said, legalization is broadly popular even in more Republican-leaning states like Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas.Polls of support for legalizing marijuana in states where recreational use is not yet legalIncludes both polls that ask specifically about recreational use as well as polls that ask about legalizing marijuana for any purpose. Does not include polls that only asked about legalizing marijuana for medical use.Source: PollsMarijuana legalization may appeal to voters in both very blue and red states, in part, because it’s an issue with bipartisan support. According to a recent poll from thePew Research Center, 72 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans supported marijuana legalization for medical and recreational use. Further, Pew found that exceedingly few adults of any age were “opposed to the legalization of marijuana,” though it did find that older Americans were less likely than younger Americans to be in favor of legalization. Only 27 percent of Republicans 65 and older supported legalization, the lowest level of support among any group Pew surveyed.But just because legalization is broadly popular doesn’t mean we should expect federal legislation on the issue soon. For starters,not all Senate Democratsback Schumer’s plan, and Senate Republicanshave yet to show any supportfor legalization. Additionally, while legalizing marijuana is popular, itisn’t a top priorityfor many voters. That may be, in part, due to the success of legalization efforts at the state level. More than one in three Americanslive in stateswhere marijuana is already legal for recreational use, and asizable majoritylive in states where marijuana is legal for medical use. For those who already have access to the drug, it may not matter whether it’s their state government or the federal government making that allowance. Finally, as my colleague Perry Bacon Jr. pointed out earlier this year,electoral politics are increasingly disconnected from policy, meaning that despite the popularity of marijuana legalization, there may simply not be a ton of electoral benefit for Biden for taking up the issue.Still, if the polling is any indication, legalizing marijuana is hugely popular, and Biden may yet change his mind, depending on how the politics of the bill play out. And if he does, he may even get some brownie points from Republican voters who support legalization. But if things start to get politically messy, Biden may not have a lot to lose by passing on championing this particular issue.According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker,453.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 40.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +13 points). At this time last week, 52.8 percent of Americans approved of Biden, while 40.8 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +12 points).

""If I die from catching COVID-19 from being forced back into Pinellas County Schools, you can drop my dead body right here!"" shouts one demonstrator inmy new video.But schools rarely spread COVID-19.Studieson tens of thousands of people found ""no consistent relationship between in-person K-12 schooling and the spread of the coronavirus.""Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, encouraged schools to reopen, saying ""close the bars and keep the schools open.""Heritage Foundation education researcher Lindsey Burke points out that studies in 191 countries find ""no consistent link between reopening schools and increased rates of COVID transmission.""She says schools aren't COVID-19 hotspots.""But it's logical that they would be,"" I push back. ""Kids are bunched together.""""Positivity rates in schools are generally below those in the broader community,"" she says.Closed schools hurt low-income students most because they have fewer learning alternatives. The privileged get around union restrictions.Almost all of California's government-run schools are closed, but California Governor Gavin Newsom's sends his kids to a private school that stayed open.""Choice for me, but not for thee!"" quips Burke.Kids blocked from attending school suffer more than academic losses, she adds. ""Kids are social animals. A lack of their ability to interact in person, see their friends, see their teachers, is really having an impact.""That's not a good enough reason to open schools, say the unions. In my video, one San Antonio teacher argues: ""We understand that in-person learning is more effective than online teaching, but that's not the question. The question is what is safest.""""But that's really not at the heart of why unions are trying to keep schools closed,"" says Burke. ""It's really a question of politics.""Definitely. Uniondemandsinclude all sorts of things unrelated to teacher safety. The Los Angeles union demands: defunding the police, a moratorium on charter schools, higher taxes on the wealthy and ""Medicare for All.""""The Oregon Education Association ... said they wanted the state to halt any transfers tocharter schools,"" says Burke. ""There's clearly no health issue in a virtual setting.""It's revealing that government-run schools fight to stay closed, while most businesses -- private schools, restaurants, hair salons, gyms, etc., fight to be allowed to open.Why is that? Burke points out that government schools ""receive funding regardless of whether or not they reopen.""So, union workers get paid even when they don't work. Not working seems to be a big union goal.At one point, LA teachers even secured a contract saying that they only are ""required to provide instruction ... four hours per day"" and they will ""not be required to teach classes using live video conferencing.""Nice non-work if you can get it.Yet, the teachers unions keep winning. They will win more now that Democrats control the federal government. Congress' last stimulus package forbids any funds to be used to expand school choice: no ""vouchers, tuition tax credit programs, education savings accounts, scholarship programs, or tuition assistance programs.""So, students lose. Parents lose. Taxpayers lose. America loses.Unions win.We asked 21 teachers unions to respond to the criticisms in this column. Not one would.Their behavior reveals their true interest: power and money. Students come third.",1
94,“Don’t You Work With Old People?”: Many Elder-Care Workers Still Refuse to Get COVID-19 Vaccine,-2.67,44.0,https://www.propublica.org/article/dont-you-work-with-old-people-many-elder-care-workers-still-refuse-to-get-covid-19-vaccine,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,propublica,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receiveour biggest storiesas soon as they’re published.They are two sisters in two states. Both are dedicated health care professionals who watched in horror as COVID-19 swept through the nation’s nursing homes, killing a staggering number of residents and staff alike.One sister is now vaccinated. The other is not.“Heidi Lucas texted her sister Ashley in May from her home in Jefferson City, Missouri.Ashley Lucas texted back from Orbisonia, Pennsylvania.Heidi wrote.Neither sister is budging as the Delta variant brings a new spike in coronavirus numbers across the nation.Their divide mirrors America’s larger one, where the vaccine to combat COVID-19 is eagerly embraced by some, yet eyed with suspicion and rejected by others.It is the refusal group, including a significant percentage who work in the nation’s nursing homes, that has confounded and alarmed health care officials who are at a loss as to how to sway them.Nursing homes faced a shocking mortality rate during the pandemic. In the U.S., COVID-19 killed more than 133,000 residents and nearly 2,000 staff members between May 31, 2020 and this July 4, according toCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services reports. The true toll is thought to be even higher as data gathering lagged in the early months of the crisis, health experts say.Working in a nursing home became one of the “most dangerous jobs” in America in 2020, according to ananalysisof work-related deathsby Scientific American.Yet seven months after the first vaccines became available to medical professionals, only 59% of staff at the nation’s nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are fully or partially vaccinated — with eight states reporting an average rate of less than half, according to CMS data updated last week.Twenty-three individual facilities had vaccination rates of under 1%, the data showed.Staff vaccinations have lagged even as the overall rate for residents climbed to 83%, according to the CMS data.The strong vaccination percentage among nursing home residents is credited, in part, to an early campaign to bring the vaccine directly to facilities. That suggests availability is not necessarily the issue behind staff going without.So, what is?The question defies easy answers. Vaccine refusal is regional and often aligns not only with individuals’ political alignment but also with their preferred news sources and which social media they follow.Last week, President Joe Biden took aim at Facebook and other social media giants for failing to police vaccine misinformation that amplifies conspiracy theories and discourages people from getting vaccinated. “They’re killing people,” he said, directly blaming the platforms. On Monday, he recast the accusation to say it was specific individuals posting dangerous information who are culpable.On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pleaded to “anyone out there willing to listen: Get vaccinated.” While not mentioning skeptics specifically — including those in his own party — the Republican leader urged the unvaccinated to ignore “demonstrably bad advice.”COVID-19 cases are now surging in every state, with new hospitalizations and deaths almost entirely occurring among the unvaccinated. “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky warned last week during a White House briefing.In May, CMS began requiring weekly reports on vaccinations of residents and staff at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The emerging data confirms many health care experts’ worst fears, especially for Southern states.Louisiana has the lowest statewide average: Just 44.5% of the staff at its long-term care facilities have been at least partially vaccinated, according to CMS data released last week.Florida, the second lowest-vaccinated state, had a rate of just under 46% among its nursing home and long-term care staff, with Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Wyoming all showing rates of less than 50 percent, according to the data.Vaccination rates in assisted living facilities are not included in the data.A separate American Association of Retired Persons analysis,released last week, showed that only one in five of the nation’s more than 15,000 nursing homes were able to hit a goal, set by two industry trade groups, of vaccinating 75% of their staff by the end of June.While cases in nursing homes have recently slowed, and most of the new COVID-19 infections are among younger people, some experts still worry of a return to darker days.The CDC recently launched an investigation into deaths of residents at several western Colorado senior facilities possibly linked to unvaccinated staff, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.“We need to sound the alarm,” said Susan Reinhard, senior vice president of AARP and director of its Public Policy Institute. “Nursing homes were devastated by COVID-19, and many residents remain highly vulnerable to the virus.”Nationally, more than 89% of people 65 or older have received at least partial vaccination, the CDC reported this week. Still, public health experts have warned that even if fully vaccinated, the elderly may be vulnerable to “breakthrough” coronavirus infection because of compromised immune systems and other underlying health problems.In Missouri’s southern region, the overall rate of full vaccination in some rural counties is less than 20%, according to state health department and CDC tracking. The latest surge of the delta variant has turned the area into a “tinderbox,” Steven Edwards, CEO of the CoxHealth hospital system in Springfield, recently told reporters.On Thursday, 160 patients were being treated for COVID-19 at CoxHealth, a spokesperson told ProPublica. On May 14, there were 18.Heidi Lucas directs the Missouri Nurses Association. She is pro-vaccine and has been pushing hard for nurses to get vaccinated, especially those on the front lines of patient care.Lucas said it is impossible to separate the lack of vaccination among staff from the lack of vaccinations in individual communities. “Nurses are people too,” she said. “They are on social media and are inundated with false information. How do you fight it?”Her sister, Ashley Lucas, lives 900 miles away in Orbisonia, a small town of around 500 people about an hour south of State College. She’s a traveling certified nursing assistant at area nursing homes and chose to skip the vaccine.Her fiance and her children, ages 12 and 13, are also unvaccinated. “I don’t consider myself an anti-vaxxer,” she told ProPublica, bristling that some might see her as reckless or ill-informed.Instead, she said her decision was carefully considered. It never made sense to her, she said, that the virus seemed to strike randomly, with some residents getting sick while others did not. She said she is not convinced the vaccine would change the odds.She’s also concerned after hearing that the vaccine could interfere with fertility — a contention that has been deemed false by theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand theWorld Health Organization. It all leads her to believe more research is needed into the vaccines’ long-term effects.“This is just a personal choice and I feel it should be a free choice,” she said. “I think it’s been forced on us way too much.”Certified nursing assistants make up the largest group of employees working in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, providing roughly 90 percent of direct patient care. They are typically overworked and underpaid, most earning about $13 per hour and receiving no paid sick leave or other benefits, said Lori Porter, co-founder and CEO of the National Association of Health Care Assistants.Porter said she is not completely surprised by the low vaccination rate. It comes down to trust, she said, both of the vaccines and of facility administrators who now say staff must get vaccinated. Refusal may feel like empowerment. “It’s the first time ever they have had the ball in their court,” Porter said.On March 31, Houston Methodist Hospital mandated that all of its 26,000 employees be vaccinated by June 7 or lose their jobs. Jennifer Bridges, a nurse, sued along with 116 other employees, claiming the health care system had overstepped its rights and that she and the others refused to be “human guinea pigs,” evoking the Nuremberg Code, a set of ethical standards established in response to Nazi medical experimentation in concentration camps.On June 12, U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes dismissed theclosely watched case, taking offense to likening the vaccine to the Holocaust, which he called “reprehensible.” Ten days later, 153 Houston Methodist employees either were fired or quit after refusing the vaccine. The judge’s ruling has been appealed.A handful of long-term care chains have similarly sought to mandate worker vaccines, but such action is far from widespread in the industry. One sticking point has been whether vaccination can legally be required, since all three available vaccines have only emergency use authorization, not full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The thornier issue, though, is whether the facilities can risk losing staff when they’re already short-handed. Many workers have vowed to quit rather than be forced into vaccinations.Aegis Living, a long-term senior care provider in three Western states, made vaccines mandatory for its roughly 2,600 employees on July 1. Dwayne Clark, founder and CEO, said initially 400 employees refused but when the deadline arrived, only about 100 left rather than be vaccinated.“We lost some staff that we didn’t want to lose,” Clark told ProPublica, “but it felt like the right moral protocol to impose.”Recently the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissued guidelinesstating that employers can require workers to be vaccinated as long as medical or religious exemptions are permitted.“Nursing home workers certainly have the right to make decisions about their own health and welfare, but they don’t have the right to place vulnerable residents at risk,” said Lawrence Gostin, a health law professor at Georgetown University. “Nursing homes don’t just have the power to require vaccinations, they have the duty.”Still, the issue is far from resolved.“America is a highly litigious country,” Gostin said, “I expect the courts to consistently uphold nursing home mandates, because they are entirely lawful and justified. But there will likely be lawsuits at least until it is quite clear they are futile.”Diane Peters is a registered nurse in the Chicago suburbs who last year worked at a nursing home and is now working at a senior rehabilitation center. She does not trust the science behind the vaccine and is unvaccinated. So is her fiance.Everything about the rollout felt like propaganda, she said. Development was too rushed. Clinical trials typically take years, she said, not months. “I don’t think it’s safe right now, it needs more time,” she said she tells patients if they ask.Read MoreMost don’t, she said. Neither do her co-workers. She has only been asked once by her employer if she was vaccinated, she said, declining to name the company.Peters guesses about 40 percent of her colleagues are also unvaccinated, but said no one likes to talk about it because the divide surrounding the vaccine is “surreal.” Staff members are tested regularly and are required to wear masks, she said.She is doubtful mandates would stick. “They can threaten,” she said, “but a lot of nurses would walk.”She trusts her instincts and her own research for now. When asked what would change her mind, she had one word: “Nothing.”A caption with this story originally misstated Heidi Lucas’ job description. She is director of the Missouri Nurses Association, but is not herself a nurse.",2
95,"Chicago Teachers Union votes to refuse in-person work, defy Chicago Public Schools’ reopening plan",-1.67,46.17,https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2021/1/24/22247280/chicago-teachers-union-votes-in-person-work-defy-chicago-public-schools-reopening-plan-strike,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,chicago.suntimes,25,"Chicago Teachers Union members have voted to defy Chicago Public Schools’ reopening plans and continue working from home Monday because of health and safety concerns.City officials had said in recent days theywould view the collective refusal of in-person work as a strike, but in response to Sunday’s vote results said they will delay the scheduled return of thousands of teachers and staff until Wednesday “to ensure we have the time needed to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.”The CTU’s move to reject in-person work marks the culmination of a months-long fight between the union and the nation’s third-largest school system over how and when to reopen schools during the pandemic — a disagreement that threatens to plunge the city’s education into deeper turmoil if a deal isn’t reached over the next few days.“So what does this mean? It means the overwhelming majority of you have chosen safety,” the union told teachers and staff as they announced the vote results. “CPS did everything possible to divide us by instilling fear through threats of retaliation, but you still chose unity, solidarity and to collectively act as one.”About 86% of the 25,000 rank-and-file CTU members participated in the electronic vote over the past three days, with 71% favoring the rejection of in-person work in an unusually close vote for CTU labor actions. When the CTU voted to strike in 2019, 94% of members who voted chose to walk out.CTU President Jesse Sharkey wrote on Twitter he “will grant that it’s a lower percentage than we’ve had in the past. It’s a pandemic, after all.” He later added in a statement he believes “an agreement is within reach, but we need a willing partner.”Illinois law requires three-quarters of CTU members to authorize a typical contract strike, such as the one in 2019. The union has said a work stoppage this time around would come in response to several alleged unfair labor practices by CPS, and the approval of only a simple majority of voting members is required — though the CTU said last week it would seek 60% to show its unity.Union leadership has been adamant, however, that its initial action is not a strike since teachers intend to continue working from home — even though the school district is no longer allowing that option for about half of union members this week.The union has said it would only withhold its labor if no agreement is reached come Wednesday and CPS decides to block teachers from remote work — as it has done with a few dozen pre-kindergarten and special education staff members who have not reported to schools as ordered this month and are no longer being paid.The strategy from union leadership has been to back CPS officials into a corner in negotiations by forcing the district to address teachers’ concerns immediately, delay its reopening plan or risk halting all classes.Thekey unresolved issues are: which teachers and staff who have a household member with a vulnerable medical condition are eligible for accommodations for remote work; the public health metrics that determine the reopening or closing of individual schools and the district as a whole; how vaccines factor in to requiring staff to work in person; and the scope of districtwide testing of staff and students.About 3,800 preschool and special education cluster program teachers and staff were ordered to return to schools earlier this month for the resumption of in-person learning for their students. Another 10,000 staff members in kindergarten through eighth grades were due back Monday. K-8 schools are scheduled to reopen Feb. 1 for an estimated 71,000 students — out of 191,000 children in those grades — who have said they plan to return.Black, Latino and low-income families have been less likely to choose in-person learning, data has shown.It’s also not clear, however, how many of those K-8 students will actually follow through with their intentions to go back. CPS officials on Friday released attendance data from the first week of school for pre-K and cluster students that revealed an average of 3,189 of the 6,470 students who opted in — 49% — returned to classrooms each day.That meantonly 19% of 16,944 eligible students were learning in-person that week. The CTU has said those numbers should help predict a similar pattern in the next reopening wave, leading to fewer teachers needed for in-person work. But CPS has said it’s still planning as if all 71,000 kids are returning.Schools chief Janice Jackson wrote in an email to families Sunday that the return of K-8 teachers and staff will be pushed back to Wednesday as the two sides continue to negotiate, but CPS still plans for K-8 students to return Feb. 1. Pre-K and cluster staff will be expected to keep reporting to schools this week, and Jackson said the district’s goal is “to reach an agreement with CTU as soon as possible.”When she was asked Friday if the union’s walkout would mean even remote learning would come to a halt, Jackson said, “I think my point was clear that if the union refuses to work on Monday, that constitutes a strike.”Jackson said it would be unfair to deny families the opportunity to return to schools, and she and City Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady expressed strong confidence that all necessary precautions have been taken to keep students and staff safe from COVID-19. The district has spent $44 million on disinfectants, PPE, air purifiers and other measures to ready schools for the return of staff and students.After a rough fall and early winter, coronavirus infection rates in Chicago have steadily fallen. The city’s test positivity rate is at 7.2%, and the seven-day average of daily confirmed cases is down to 629 — both the lowest since mid-October.But teachers have shown serious concerns about their health in schools they believe won’t uniformly or strictly enforce mitigation protocols. The teachers union and its medical consultant, national expert Dr. Vin Gupta, have advocated for a slower, more phased-in approach to reopening schools that coincides with teacher vaccinations. School staffers in Illinois are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinations starting Monday, and some suburbs are prioritizing teachers for those shots over other essential workers. Gupta also said last week he was concerned about the new strain of the virus that originated in the U.K.Sharkey wrote to members Sunday that CPS’ decision to delay the return of K-8 staff was done “unilaterally” — not in agreement with the CTU, as the district claimed — and was meant “to sow dissent and disrupt collective Union action” without reaching a tangible agreement. Still, the union was encouraged by the move because it signaled a willingness to resolve the dispute, sources said.",2

97,REPORT: Pfizer Vaccine Confirmed To Cause Neurodegenerative Diseases,24.67,9.0,https://nationalfile.com/report-pfizer-vaccine-confirmed-to-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,nationalfile,25,"Last Updated on April 22, 2021“The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing,” the report declares. “In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.” Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain.This is especially concerning since the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, an untested type of vaccine which creates new proteins and can actuallyintegrate into the human genome, according to a report from the National Library of Medicine. In other words, degenerative brain conditions may appear at any time in your life after receiving the vaccine.“The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations,” explains the report. TDP-43 is a protein known to cause dementia, ALS and even Alzheimer’s, according toAlzpedia. Similarly, the FUS protein is known to cause ALS and Hereditary Essential Tremors, according to theHuman Genome Database.The experiment done for the report was to determine whether or not these two harmful proteins embed themselves into our DNA, as an mRNA vaccine is expected to do. The report determined that “the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations,” meaning that both proteins have the potential to embed themselves into our DNA and cause harmful neurological diseases.The report’s abstract summary concludes that “The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.” The report itself ends with this warning: “The vaccine could be a bioweapon and even more dangerous than the original infection.”National File actually reached out to the CDC to inquire as to why the Pfizer vaccine is still being distributed despite these credible allegations. No response was received prior to publication.",0

""So — by directing his subordinates to refuse to comply with lawfully issued subpoenas, whether it's for testimony or for documents — that's an impeachable offense.""Napolitano continued, ""We know that from history, every time the House of Representatives has looked at that with respect to a president. It has found it to be impeachable. On that, reasonable minds cannot disagree without rejecting history and without rejecting constitutional norms.""At the heart of the impeachment inquiry are allegations that Trump attempted to leverage a White House meeting and millions in military aid, sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that the Ukrainian government had conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.On Wednesday, Fox News host Bill Hemmer asked Napolitano, ""If you were in the House, would you vote for impeachment?""""I certainly would. I'm never going to be in the House,"" Napolitano said with a laugh, before adding, ""I would on that count.""The judge went on to note that ""reasonable minds"" could disagree on Trump's reasoning for withholding million in military aid for Ukraine which had been approved by Congress.""What was the president's intent when he held up this aid?"" Napolitano asked. ""Was it truly to eradicate corruption in Ukraine? Was he truly concerned that American taxpayer dollars would go into the hands of crooks? Or was he looking to use the instruments of a foreign government to help his political campaign?""Later on in the show, Napolitano weighed in on the House Judiciary Committee's Wednesday hearing in the impeachment inquiry, saying that it likely would not change public opinion. However, he warned that ""letting Trump be Trump is not good enough under the Constitution.""""We don't lower the bar because the president has unorthodox ways,"" the former judge added. ""The bar is intentionally broad and even ambiguous as to what high crimes and misdemeanors are. We learned today that the Democrats apparently intend to include in there things we didn't know they were going to include, like bribery, like the obstruction of justice allegations which were made by (former special counsel) Bob Mueller long before the Ukraine case came to the public's attention.""At Wednesday's hearing, the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over drafting articles of impeachment, heardtestimony from four constitutional scholars about the legal and historical underpinnings of the process. Three law experts called by Democrats said Trump committed impeachable offenses, while one called by Republicans offered the lone dissent.Also at Wednesday's hearing, the panel's chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., suggested that issues in Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election could be included in eventual articles of impeachment. Nadler argued that Trump had obstructed justice both during Mueller's investigation and the House's impeachment inquiry.In his opening statement, Nadler said Trump's latest actions showed a ""pattern of conduct"" seen since his first year in the Oval Office.""When his own Department of Justice tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses,"" he said. ""Then, as now, this administration's level of obstruction is without precedent.""",1

The train had two locomotives and 10 cars. Seven of those cars derailed, the statement said.The Liberty County Sheriff’s Office confirmed three people had died, the New York Times reported.Liberty County Sheriff Nick Erickson said the names of the dead would not be released until relatives are notified.Amanda Frickel, the disaster and emergency services coordinator for Hill County, told the Times “well over” 50 people had been injured.

It would also represent an historic shift away from the roads-first approach to federal transportation spending that has reigned since Dwight Eisenhower created the Interstate Highway System.But the bill is riling up opposition from two potential allies of the Democrats’ big-spending infrastructure initiatives: state transportation departments and the road-building lobby.

103,At Least Seven Colombians in Haiti Assassination Received U.S. Training,0.0,42.67,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/16/haiti-assassination-colombia-us-military/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,theintercept,25,"More thana quarter of the ex-Colombian soldiers currently suspected in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse received U.S. military training, The Intercept confirmed Friday, with some of the alleged attackers participating in programs as recently as 2015 that ranged from vehicle maintenance and professional development to counterterrorism and drug war operations. Courses were held in both Colombia and the United States.The Pentagon and the State Department are currently reviewing internal records to determine precisely how many of the alleged assassins were trained by the U.S. “To date, State and DoD have identified seven individuals among a possible 25 alleged to have been involved by Haitian authorities, that previously participated in past U.S. military training and education programs, while previously serving in the Colombian military,” a U.S. government official confirmed in an email to The Intercept. “Individuals had been approved for a variety of training activities held both in Colombia and the United States between 2001-2015.”On Thursday, the Pentagonconfirmedto the Washington Post that “a small number” of the Colombian mercenaries suspected in the July 7 assassination had received U.S. training, though the department did not say how many, nor when, nor what type of training was provided. According to the official who spoke to The Intercept, “Examples of the types of training received were various types of military leadership and professional development training, emergency medical training, helicopter maintenance, and attendance at seminars on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism.”From 2000, when the United States first launched the massive, multibillion drug war aid program known as Plan Colombia, to 2018, the U.S. administered more than 107,640 trainings of Colombian security personnel, noted Adam Isacson, director of the Defense Oversight program at the Washington Office on Latin America, a figure that far surpasses any other military collaboration the U.S. maintains in the region. “Nothing comes close to 107,000 over the last 20 years,” Isacson told The Intercept. “Nothing.”Eighteen former Colombian soldiers are currently being held in Haiti in connection with Moïse’s assassination, including some who previously served in elite Colombian special operations units. New details on their involvement in the assassination continue to break by the day. On Wednesday, the Colombian news magazine Semanareportedthat one of the former soldiers confessed that the mercenary team was responsible for the assassination and that the killing was orchestrated by an inner circle of seven mercenaries within the larger group. The magazine reported that investigators had also recovered surveillance footage of the attack.Family members of many of the detained Colombians have said that their loved ones believed they were being hired to provide personal security for a VIP in Haiti and that they did not sign on to participate in an assassination. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Colombian President Iván Duquesaidthat regardless of individual levels of insight into the operation’s true intent, all would be held responsible for Moïse’s killing.To Isacson, little about the kind of training the alleged assassins experienced with the U.S. military stood out as particularly unique given the long-standing relationship between the U.S. and Colombia: In any random sample of some two dozen mid-level Colombian military veterans, it is more likely than not that some amount of U.S. training would turn up. “They’re not training every recruit or every private, but they are training a lot of people at that level,” Isacson said. “So it’s very likely they would have received us trading just through sheer statistical probability.”Still, Isacson argued, the fact that the mercenaries’ training was not unusual does not mean there is not reason for concern. “I worry about the United States being associated with or even increasing the lethal skills of military and police units around the region that are either abusive or corrupt or undemocratic, and of course that’s always been a huge risk in Colombia, given its human rights record. So it does require a lot of scrutiny to make sure that we are not associating ourselves with or improving the lethal skills of people who end up doing what we just saw in Haiti, but also people who end up doing what we just saw in Bogotá and Cali since late April,” he said, referring to recent andviolent crackdownsby Colombian security forces on protesters. “We don’t want to be associated with that.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe U.S. risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, experts say.Schuyler MitchellProposed laws to curtail the use of PVC plastics have failed amid heavy lobbying.Prem ThakkerA new report shows Norfolk Southern spent $2.3 million to lobby the government in 2023.",1
104,The election is over. How did the media do?,-8.67,36.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/the-election-is-over-how-did-the-media-do/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,poynter,24,"Isn’t it ironic?For the past four years, President Donald Trump has beaten up, verbally abused, assailed and ridiculed the media. He has called them fake news and the enemy of the people. He has tweeted insults, yelled put-downs and tried to discredit them every chance he could. He has used rallies and press conferences to mock and bash them.As ABC’s Jonathan Karl, the former White House Correspondents’ Association president, said on air Saturday, “(Trump) told people not to believe what they saw with their own eyes. He told people not to believe what they saw in newspapers and on television newscasts.”And yet as Election Day turned into Election Week and closed the curtains on Trump’s anti-media presidency, the media shined.Yes, the past five days had the entire country on edge. The country was frustrated watching the results come in at what felt like a sloth’s pace. We kept wondering when it was all going to be over. Tuesday night turned into Wednesday. Wednesday turned into Thursday. Thursday into Friday. Each day, we wondered if this was going to be the day it all ended.It all seemed like one long day broken up by short naps. Our diets consisted of hot coffee and cold pizza. We wore out our remote controls.We watched MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki and CNN’s John King work their big boards. We watched NBC’s Chuck Todd break down the outstanding votes. We watched PBS’s Judy Woodruff, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and CBS’s Norah O’Donnell lead panel discussions.We saw Gloria Borger argue with Rick Santorum on CNN and Chris Christie argue with Rahm Emanuel on ABC. We watched Fox News’ Chris Wallace bring common sense, wisdom and even-handedness.We started to see Chris Cuomo, Joy Reid, Wolf Blitzer, Brian Williams, Savannah Guthrie, Bill Hemmer and Gayle King in our sleep. We’d doze off to a map of Georgia on our TVs and wake up to a map of Nevada.We constantly hit refresh on the homepages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. We constantly checked the Twitter feeds of people such as Maggie Haberman and Nate Silver. We suddenly became experts on counties like Allegheny, Fulton and Maricopa. We learned the difference between mail-in ballots and provisionals.And while the country seemed stretched to its very limits, practically begging for the networks to just call the race already, especially as Joe Biden looked to be on his way to victory for a couple of days now, the news outlets did the right thing.They waited.They reported what they knew when they knew it. They offered possibilities about the future, but no guarantees or assurances that they couldn’t back up with facts and numbers. They said the thing that is often so hard for media outlets to say: “We don’t know.”In other words, they practiced responsible journalism. It wasn’t easy. It was sometimes messy. But it was right.As CBS News’ John Dickerson appropriately put it: “The media doesn’t call this race more than the weatherman makes it rain when he says it’s raining outside. We are observing a thing that is happening, we have experts who know how that thing plays out, but we are doing nothing more than observing it.”Yes, there was a time when some observers grew restless and impatient, worried that a delay in calling the election for Biden was giving life to Trump’s claims that the election was rigged. But the news outlets held fast to their standards, delaying a call until it was absolutely certain that Biden had secured the votes to become president.There appeared to be no major gaffes — a state projection that had to be walked back, for instance.Meanwhile, most networks showed outstanding instincts by pulling out of a Trump speech in which the president falsely claimed that he had won the election and would only lose if he was cheated. Anytime he tweeted or put out a statement, they immediately fact-checked him and shot down the claims that the election was rigged.Throughout the coverage, as commentators discussed what was happening, all outlets deftly walked the fine line of not declaring a victor, acknowledging that Biden appeared to be on his way to winning and, especially, debunking Trump’s groundless allegations of fraud.Despite all this pressure to call a winner, the networks waited until they were sure, and that finally happened Saturday morning.So what’s next?The work continues. Not just for Biden and the country. But for the media.As Karl said, “I think we have a challenge now as reporters and news organizations to — because (Trump) has effectively eroded the trust in much of this country in what they see in the mainstream media — and I think it’s completely incumbent upon us as we are to rebuild that trust. He had the biggest bully pulpit in the world and he used it for four years to undermine largely what we do.”But you could make a strong case that the media used their work over the past four days to rebuild that trust.The media can be proud of its work covering this election, of responsibly covering the end of the presidency of a man who constantly criticized that media for four years.Isn’t that ironic?If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects.It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But few share Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build proper support systems and processes to deal with high levels of stress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.’Our working paper found that the tech giants owe publishers billions of dollars. Here’s how we arrived at that conclusion and what it means.",1

She spoke to Kansas City's news channelFox4 WDAF-TV about her daughter's death and vaccine hesitancyin an interviewbroadcast this week.""She was afraid of the side effects, I think. You hear a lot of horror stories. I, myself, when I had the shot, it was rough, so it scared her and freaked her out. So she didn't want to do it. I couldn't convince her,"" Carmichael told the Missouri news channel.Jones, who resided in Grain Valley, was a mother of two, including her 18-year-old daughter Adriana, who just graduated from high school. The teen told Fox 4 that her mother was her ""best friend.""""There were so many days where I would just stand there next to my mom and say, 'Wake up, mama, wake up.' She would never wake up, and I just wish that she would. I don't think anyone should have to go through what we went through. Especially with the variant,"" the daughter said.Carmichael urged everyone to take the pandemic seriously and get vaccinated. ""Please take this seriously. You don't want to see a family member you love go through this,"" she said.Jones was reportedly hospitalized on May 9. She was then placed on a ventilator and died on June 9.""After she got it, she said, 'Mom you were right, about the shot, about masks, being diligent and all that.' I was like, 'I don't want to be right. I want you to be well. That's all that matters,'"" Carmichael said.Missouri continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., ranking above just 11 other states, according to aNew York Timestracker. Just under 56 percent of the state's adult residents have received at least one shot of the vaccine while just under 49 percent are fully vaccinated. Comparatively, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont have more than 70 percent of their adult populations fully vaccinated. Experts have posited that about 70 percent of a population needs to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity.A survey conducted by Gallup from May 18 to 23 found that about a quarter (24 percent) of U.S. adults do not plan to get vaccinated. Of those in the vaccine hesitant group, 78 percent said they are ""unlikely"" to change their mind about the vaccine while 51 percent said they are ""not likely at all"" to adjust their plans regarding vaccination against COVID-19.Public health officials,religious leadersand lawmakers haverepeatedly assuredthe public that the vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19.

106,"In Trump’s Jan. 6 Recast, Attackers Become Martyrs, Heroes",-13.33,34.67,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/07/18/trump-capitol-insurrection/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,snopes,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of Jan. 6.Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots.Months after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It’s a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed into shouts of “f--- the blue.”The fact inversion about the siege is the latest in Trump’s contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the most specious of which is that the election was stolen from him, when it was not.It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud, say it often, say it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Once spread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, now spread by swipe of finger, the result is the same: a passionate, unquestioning following.Techniques of glorifying your side and demonizing the other with skewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at least since World War I, when the U.S. government roused sentiment for the cause with posters depicting the German soldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany’s terrifying use of propaganda for the slaughter and subjugation of millions.Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president’s ego, some of the methods are the same, like telling the same fabrication over and over until it sticks.Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusations substantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among his supporters.Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate white supremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on both sides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on Jan. 6 were on one side: his.For the other side — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevateBabbittas a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around themainline social media platformswhere Trump is banned for spreading misinformation but his followers still commiserate. The woman died from a police officer’s bullet fired as she tried to climb through the jagged glass of a smashed window toward the House chamber during the riot.Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy theorists gather to vent. In Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered on street lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of a statue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trumpand many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers were said to be leftist antifa followers in disguise. Then they were said to be overexcitedtourists.Now they are heralded as foot soldiers for freedom.Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage they saw on their screens, and some lawmakers to ignore that they were among the shocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters.Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vast sea of nonsense,” said Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.That sea’s currents are familiar to historians who study what makes some conspiracy theories and propaganda persuasive.Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they aren’t true, said Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on Jan. 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries to set them straight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracin said.“The belief contains a device that protects it,” she said. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory and signals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. He said that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, including sticking your head in the sand.”Trump, Peterson said, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his core supporters and turn them against other Americans.“That’s where the power of Trump is,” he said. “He’s good at picking up on these threads ... that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country’s divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest,Quinnipiac foundthat 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected.That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s fabrications have stuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the Jan. 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,” said Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That’s what’s pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump, she said: “His method is generally to just create chaos so that people really don’t know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesia seems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though the scenes that were broadcast and streamed in real time are forever.Swarming to the Capitol after a staging rally whereTrump told them to “fight like hell,”and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with them, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injuring scores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as the side of his face pressed against the glass of the door.Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump’s vice president, who was there, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted.Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and as some members were still trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doors separating the hallway from the Speaker’s Lobby to try to stave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects.Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the other side of the stacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in, screaming, “F--- the blue!” and “Break it down!” One smashed the door glass next to an officer’s head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they didn’t get out of the way.A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackers shouted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. They started to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round.Babbitt was struck in the shoulder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released.Trump now states falsely — and with a stream of repetitions — that she was shot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That’s why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have never seen anything like it.”Klepper reported from Providence, R.I.",1

His trip follows foreign minister Wang Yi’s recent visit to Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, France and Germany.The rare back-to-back trips come at a time when the US is pushing for support from its European allies over its stance towards China.Europe has criticised China’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, its increasing combative diplomacy, its human rights records and the Hong Kong national security legislation.Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, said: “President Xi has a lot of political capital at stake in the September summit. If the investment talks do not get a push at that time, it will be politically difficult for [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel to discuss China issues at the European Council meeting on September 25, particularly at a time when the US is putting enormous pressure on Europe to fall in line with its position.”He said a substantial progress in September would make it possible for “a successful conclusion to a political agreement to the investment deal” in December.A European diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the investment treaty would be a “test case” for the two sides’ relationship.In the previous two rounds of negotiations China was open to discuss core issues such as state-owned enterprises, subsidies and sustainable development, but there is no clear evidence that it has acted to address the issues, the source continued.They said China has yet to address concerns about state-owned businesses and noted that Beijing faced difficulties in improving transparency about local-level subsidies.Wang Yiwei, a professor in European studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said China had recently published a three-year trial plan toopen cross-border data flow and other service sectors in selected cities, which he said was a sign of its determination to open up and attract foreign investment.Beijing also hopes the EU will commit to market openness in the hi-tech sector, including 5G contracts, although Wang said that risked a backlash from the US.“The US has closely followed the progress of China-EU investment talks. Any commitment Beijing agrees on structural changes, such as SOE protection and subsidies, is likely to be met with tougher demands from the US,” Wang said.The US has long called for changes to China’s state-led economy, but the phase one trade deal between the two sides sidestepped the issue.“China should consider all factors in negotiations with the EU and try to avoid getting on America’s nerves,” said Wang.But observers warned that if a deal cannot be reached this year, China may find itself in a more difficult situation in the future, with Merkel due to leave office next year.“China has a very trustworthy counterpart in Europe with Angela Merkel. The Chinese side knows exactly where she stands and they have 15 years of experience working with her,” said Wuttke.Germany currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency and Merkel has shown “the political finesse and power to get things agreed upon in Europe” he continued.“It is therefore very much in China’s interests to move on the investment agreement now, and not delay things until January next year when Portugal takes over the EU presidency”.The EU has now free trade agreements with over 70 countries. It concluded a free-trade agreement with Japan last summer, and signed a free trade and investment protection deal with Vietnam in June and is now in talks with India.It has declined Beijing’s proposal to start talks on a free-trade agreement and insists on finishing the investment treaty talks first.",2

109,Supreme Court ruling on student speech could impact Pasco school rules,0.0,46.33,https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2021/06/23/supreme-court-ruling-on-student-speech-could-impact-pasco-school-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tampa-bay-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,tampabay,21,"A U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding students’ First Amendment rights might change the way one Tampa Bay area school district deals with students’ off-campus comments.In an 8-1 ruling issued Wednesday, the court found that a Pennsylvania school district was wrong to suspend a student who made profane Snapchat statements about campus activities after she did not win a spot on the varsity cheer team.While schools have some room to discipline students for things said outside school, the majority wrote, they do not have blanket authority to control all student speech.“[T]he school itself has an interest in protecting a student’s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”Pasco County school district officials had been keeping close tabs on the case.A year ago, the School Board amended its student code of conduct to include potential punishments for students on teams or clubs who make derogatory online comments while wearing school gear.Pasco students could face suspension or dismissal from their team, and in some cases teams could forfeit games or events.Director of student services Melissa Musselwhite said the rule was meant to target instances such as students in uniform posting TikTok videos that depict violence or making negative statements about school — particularly if they cause campus disruptions.Given the nature of the Pennsylvania case, and the court’s support of the plaintiff’s right to make general criticisms on her own time, Musselwhite said the district would reexamine whether its stance could hold.“We’re definitely going to look at it,” she said. “We won’t take very long.”School Board chairman Allen Altman favored the restrictions placed on students in uniform, saying they should positively represent their schools.He added, though, that if the district rule does not meet legal muster, it would be fixed. The board updates policies at least twice a year to reflect changes in state and federal law, and court precedents.Officials in the Pinellas and Hillsborough county school districts said they did not have rules in their codes of conduct that go as far as Pasco.Their regulations over student speech adhere more closely to the areas the court found permissible to govern, such as dealing with bullying, cheating, threats and safety concerns.Pinellas, for instance, has a policy on First Amendment freedom of expression, which states in part, “when a student exercises that right, the student must do so in a responsible manner that does not cause a disruption of the school or a school activity. A principal may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on your exercise of First Amendment freedom of expression when there is evidence of imminent disruption of the school.”School Board member Nicole Carr, a former assistant principal, said she was pleased the court left intact schools’ ability to deal with threats and bullying that occurs off campus. She agreed that the Pennsylvania school district went too far in suspending the student because of her Snapchat tirade.“If someone expressed an opinion that doesn’t negatively impact an individual or constitute bullying, you should be able to articulate your opinion,” Carr said.The Pennsylvania case arose from posts made by Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time and just starting high school. One post pictured her and a friend with raised middle fingers and repeated use of a vulgarity to complain that she had been left off the varsity cheerleading squad.“F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything,” she wrote. Now 18, Levy recently finished her first year of college.Levy’s parents filed a federal lawsuit after the cheerleading coach suspended her from the junior varsity team for a year. Lower courts ruled in Levy’s favor, and she was reinstated.The school district appealed to the Supreme Court after the broad appellate ruling that said off-campus student speech was beyond schools’ authority to punish.The dispute is the latest in a line of a cases that began withTinker v. Des Moines, the Vietnam-era case of a high school in Des Moines, Iowa, that suspended students who wore armbands to protest the war. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court sided with the students, declaring students don’t “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”The court also held then that schools retained the authority to restrict speech that would disrupt the school environment.Breyer wrote that Levy’s case seemed less serious than its Vietnam-era predecessor, decided in 1969.In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he would have upheld Levy’s suspension.Pinellas School Board attorney David Koperski said he did not see any need to change the district’s policies because of the ruling. He said the decision seemed to generally uphold 50 years of case law without breaking much new ground.He speculated that the court took up the case “not to make any new rules, but rather to essentially overturn the 3rd Circuit Appellate Court’s statement that the seminal 1969 case ... did not applyat allto off-campus speech.”That would have been a significant change, Koperski said.Jim Porter, the lawyer for the Hillsborough School Board, agreed that the ruling offered more of a clarification for school districts as they deal with student speech issues. The Hillsborough code of conduct does not spell out any specifics on student free speech.“I don’t anticipate, based on this decision, we would have to change anything,” Porter said.This report includes information from Associated Press.",2

Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion.Ulises Ruiz/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionActivists supporting the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico march in Guadalajara, Mexico, on September 28, 2019. Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion.Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion as a crime, a landmark ruling that clears the way for the legalization of abortion across the country.The court took up the issue on Monday when eight of 11 justices voted to revoke a law in the state of Coahuila that punished women with up to three years in prison for having an abortion — even in cases of rape. The other three justices joined in the decision Tuesday, declaring such laws unconstitutional.""Today is a historic day for the rights of all Mexican women,"" said Supreme Court Chief Justice Arturo Zaldivar on Tuesday.""It is a watershed in the history of the rights of all women, especially the most vulnerable,"" he added.The ruling sets a precedent that would force judges across Mexicohome to one of the world's largest populations of Catholics—to hand down similar rulings and expands early abortion for millions of women in Mexico's 32 states.The decision was being celebrated as a major victory for the women's rights movement across Latin America that has gained momentum in recent years, prompted byrecord femicide ratesand a majorabortion rights victoryin Argentina last year.Inspired by that hard-fought triumph, tens of thousands of women in Mexico have taken up green bandanas — a symbol of abortion-rights activists in Argentina — calling for the decriminalization of abortion beyond the four states where it is legal up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.""This Supreme Court decision has legal ripple effects beyond the Mexican state of Coahuila and applies across Mexico,"" Paula Avila-Guillen, executive director of the Women's Equality Center, said in a statement following the decision.""As of this moment, any Mexican state that criminalizes abortion is in direct defiance of the Federal Constitution. As of this decision, all Mexican states where abortion is still criminalized are obligated to modify their legal frameworks to comply with the standard set by the Court,"" Avila-Guillen added.She noted that the ruling sets a precedent for women who are currently behind bars for seeking an abortion to be freed.Avila-Guillen called Mexico's decision a bright spot in the fight to protect women's reproductive rights around the world — one that comes just days after Texas enacted what amounts to the strictest anti-abortion measure in the U.S. The Texas law bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.""The pro-rights 'Green Wave' is poised to take over the region and bring it to the 21st Century, even as we see the United States Supreme Court and Texas walk women back into darkness,"" she said.Now that women in Coahuila, which borders the state of Texas, can choose to terminate their pregnancies through the first trimester, Avila-Guillen suggests some American women may benefit from Mexico's new law.She asks: ""Could the safest way for Texan women to have access to a safe, legal abortion soon be to make their way to Mexico?""",2
112,The Tax Day Outrage You Don’t Know About,-4.71,40.71,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/04/16/the-tax-day-outrage-you-dont-know-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,washingtonmonthly,25,"If you like to leave things until the last minute, you probably know April 15 as the day to squint at a 1040 tax form or rush through TurboTax. In the past, conservatives have also used this occasion torally againstBig Government, or to writelisticleschronicling “six of the more infuriating ways that [tax] money has gone to waste.”But the lesser known fact about Tax Day is all the money thatcome in. ProPublicaestimatesthat every year, the public misses out on $18 billion in revenue thanks to a whittled down workforce of government tax auditors. Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service has shed staff dramatically. As of 2017, the organization had 9,510 auditors—a third less than it had in 2010. That means fewer bookkeepers to investigate shady claims or to go after people who don’t bother to file taxes. No wonder the department’s inspector general estimates that the amount of lost revenue has gone up by at least $3 billion each year.It’s just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often don’t pan out to be the straight-forward, belt-tightening measures they’re pitched to be.“It’s been two years since we’ve hired anyone,” one Department of Labor bureaucrattoldRachel Cohen, writing for. “We’ve lost 25 percent of our staff, and our employees know nobody is being hired—but we’re not allowed to admit it.”That Trump’s bureaucracy is riddled with vacancies is intentional. Soon after taking office in 2017, the president announced a freeze on hiring federal workers. He reversed that decision 79 days later, but Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney (now doubling as his acting Chief of Staff) solicited recommendations on how to rebuild the executive branch “from scratch.” Mulvaney said that Trump wanted to start with “a literal blank piece of paper.”He’s hardly the first president to push for an overhaul of the executive branch. Bill Clinton’s ‘Reinventing Government’ initiative called for eliminatinghundreds of thousandsof government positions, and he followed through. Regan and George W. Bush pressed for cutstoo. Sometimes the rationale is belt-tightening; sometimes it’s making government more competent. Often, it’s both. But simply cutting the government work force, both in executive agencies and in Congress, often achieves neither aim.“Hiring freezes—not only in terms of explicit policy but also the struggle to hire when the budget is so uncertain—these have huge and dramatic implications for the federal government” said Donald Kettl, a political scientist at University of Texas at Austin. When staff are cut in government, agencies still have to find a way to complete their legally required duties. The Social Security Administration can’t not send out checks. The IRS can’t not collect taxes.Enter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelmanshowedthat while the U.S. population has ballooned since the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about the same size as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to bemore costlythan civil servants, sometimes dramatically so, which is why just cutting federal workers doesn’t always save taxpayer money.It’s also vital that the government have enough staff to oversee those contractors. But often, they don’t. When the U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, itdramatically increasedthe cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A governmentreportfound that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increased seven-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weapons systems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009.Sometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they’re overseeing for extra manpower—in effect asking private companies to help regulate themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing’s assistance in inspecting and approving the company’s own planes. That policy of delegation has come under scrutiny after two crashes involving Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets. “It seems pretty clear that the FAA didn’t have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,” says Kettl.But this problem isn’t just limited to the executive branch. It’s an issue for Congress, too. As Iwrotefor the most recent issue of the, legislators’ struggles with technology can be traced back to staffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and their staff on science and technology. They cut a third of staffers in the House who work on committees—where much of the policymaking happens. And they cut support agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter.Those numbers haven’t rebounded, and current staffers feel it. A recentsurveyof senior aides found that 84 percent thought “high-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch” was “very important,” while just 24 percent were “very satisfied” with the status quo.With fewer policy and research staff available, and without in-house science and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue to struggle to understand some of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its own staff. While they’re at it, they could increase funding for the IRS—and help recoup billions in the process.",1
113,What will cable news do without President Trump?,-11.67,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-will-cable-news-do-without-president-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,poynter,24,"Greetings from stormy St. Petersburg, Florida. Tropical Storm Eta rolled through the Tampa Bay area as I was writing this newsletter, so hopefully the words aren’t blowing off the screen. A tropical storm and Christmas music on the radio at the same time? Yep, it’s 2020.There’s no question that President Donald Trump has been a ratings booster for cable TV news. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC are enjoying some of their best ratings ever.To be clear, there are other factors for why folks are interested in the news these days, including a once-in-a-hundred year pandemic. It also should be noted that on a good night, the big three cable news networks draw fewer than 15 million viewers in primetime — decent for TV, but a pretty low number compared to the overall population.Still, the Trump presidency has been good for business.He tweets. He rants. He raves.And the cable news outlets eat it up.But, Variety’s Brian Steinberg writes, “There’s palpable concern the spotlight may fade with the departure of President Donald Trump and the arrival of President-elect Joe Biden.”So what will happen when Trump is no longer president?There are different theories.One is that interest in the news will remain high, so even with a Biden presidency, ratings will continue to thrive. Plus, the major news story — coronavirus — will remain a story that Americans must follow, perhaps for another year, if not longer.But as far as politics and the White House, the cable news outlets might see a drop in viewership. In a recent earnings call, Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, “I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching ‘The Masked Singer’ or ‘I Can See Your Voice,’ and we look forward to that shift.”A “more normal news cycle” would mean no coronavirus and a president who isn’t constantly elbowing his way into the news cycle.Lachlan, however, thinks Fox News will continue to lead in cable news viewership.“What we aim to control is share,” Murdoch said on the earnings call. “And I strongly believe and we’ve seen this through, I think, now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we’ve maintained our No. 1 position through all of that. …  So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be No. 1 and maintain share through that.”That, perhaps, is true.There is plenty of speculation about what will happen to Fox News, a favorite among conservatives and right-leaning viewers.On one hand, maybe a Biden presidency isn’t the worst thing ever. Primetime pundits such as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham can rail on Biden and his policies for the next four years. Complaining about Biden might be better programming than had Trump remained president with no election on the horizon.On the other hand, Trump supporters might quickly grow tired of being reminded every night that their favorite president did not win the election — and complaining about the other guy will soon grow old.Think of it like fans of a sports team. They can complain about a loss on sports-talk radio right after the game, but they don’t want to keep harping on it for weeks and months on end. After a while, it just becomes depressing.There are other wrinkles to consider. Might Trump start his own network or throw his support behind a place such as OAN? Is CNN boss Jeff Zucker going to leave CNN and what might that mean?But let’s also give credit to the cable news networks. They are run by smart people and have charismatic primetime personalities. We can assume they adjust what they have to attract viewers.And, hey, 2024 isn’t that far away.The New York Times building. (mpi43/MediaPunch /IPX)There are many reasons why The New York Times is such an outstanding news organization. But here’s a perfect example of what makes them so good. With all this talk about election fraud coming from the White House, The New York Times rolled up its sleeves, picked up the phone and went to work.The headline says it all:“The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud.”The Times’ Nick Corasaniti, Reid J. Epstein and Jim Rutenberg wrote, “… top election officials across the country said in interviews and statements that the process had been a remarkable success despite record turnout and the complications of a dangerous pandemic.”They also wrote, “The New York Times contacted the offices of the top election officials in every state on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether they suspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45 states responded directly to The Times. For four of the remaining states, The Times spoke to other statewide officials or found public comments from secretaries of state; none reported any major voting issues.”Jeffrey Toobin (Photo: PGDC/MediaPunch /IPX)Jeffrey Toobin has been fired from The New Yorker. During a video call last month with staffers of The New Yorker and WNYC radio, Toobin reportedly exposed himself. Following an investigation, Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker, announced Wednesday that he has been let go.In a memo to staffreviewed by The New York Times, Conde Nast’s chief people officer, Stan Duncan, said, “I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct.”Toobin announced his firing on Twitter, writing, “I was fired today by @NewYorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer. I will always love the magazine, will miss my colleagues, and will look forward to reading their work.”Toobin also has been suspended from his job and is on leave as a legal analyst for CNN.Looking for an expert source?

Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia called on the state’s secretary of state to resign, citing “failures” in the election process. However, they did not offer any specific evidence to support their claims.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution pushed back hard, doing something pretty much unheard of. It put an editorial above the front-page banner. You can see what it looked like byclicking here.The AJC editorial read, “Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have assaulted Georgia’s election system. That is dangerous behavior, both for this state and for the nation. Speaking on the record, Purdue and Loeffler offered no specifics. And that is what makes their campaign-speak attack message so unacceptable. Georgians are wise enough to recognize these antics. And Purdue, Loeffler and others should know better.”NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell speaks with former Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday. (Photo courtesy of NBC News.)Why is it so important that President Donald Trump concede the election and that a transition to President-elect Joe Biden gets underway? Here’s a helpful quick explainer from MSNBC’s Katy Tur, who said this on her show Wednesday:“They do have the benefit of Biden previously being in the White House and knowing some of the lay of the land. But I was talking to a senior administration official who was telling me that part of the big problem is not that Biden knows what he’s doing, it’s that they can’t look at the various agencies, see how they are staffed and who needs to be plugged in. They also can’t start the process of the national security background checks, which can take a long time. So that should be unnerving for any American who wants to see a seamless transition of power.”Tur asked Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire how much longer senior White House officials will continue “soothing the president” before pushing Trump to concede and begin a transition.“This is important,” Lemire said. “This shouldn’t just be about soothing the hurt feelings of a president who lost. … National security is at stake here. There is a surging, out-of-control pandemic in many states right now. And (Trump’s refusal to concede) is slowing everything down, not handing over the keys, so to speak.”Lemire said sources he talked to said this can’t go on forever, but they don’t see it ending anytime soon. It could end after Thanksgiving or maybe not even until the electoral college meets in mid-December.Meanwhile, on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Defense Secretary William Cohen called Trump’s refusal to concede “completely inappropriate … reckless and it’s consistent with how Donald Trump has conducted the presidency.”He added, “When you don’t help the incoming administration protect the country then you have failed in your duty. You have failed royally, if I can use the word royal, because the president wants to act like a royal, that everyone else is in his court and they must pay obeisance and pay tribute to him.”MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki talks with Savannah Sellers. (Photo: courtesy of NBC News.)One of the stars of election week TV coverage was CNN’s John King, who spent most of the week on his feet and wearing out CNN’s Magic Wall. My Poynter colleague Amaris Castillo caught up with King for agood Q&Athat you should check out.King told Castillo, “I am a mix of exhausted and excited. The election results are clear, but there is so much news and uncertainty — from the Trump refusal to concede to the continued counting of ballots to the Biden transition launch and the horrific COVID surge. So sleep has to wait a bit longer. That’s OK. It is a dramatic news story and at a very consequential moment, so this is why we do this — and sleep and rest can wait.”John King wasn’t the only big board star during election week. How about MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki?NBC News’ Savannah Sellers went to the big boardto get the lowdown from Kornacki, including questions for Kornacki from Chrissy Teigen.The most pressing questions?Gabriel Escobar has been named top editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. Escobar had been editor and vice president — second in charge in the newsroom — since 2017.The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Anna Orso and Jesenia De Moya Correa wrote about Escobar: “A former foreign correspondent, he is respected inside and outside The Inquirer as a skilled journalist and an even-keeled manager, as well as a deep listener always armed with a notepad.”Escobar replaces executive editor Stan Wischnowski, who resigned in June after a controversial headline — “Buildings Matter, Too” — in the wake of protests about race. That headline led to the Inquirer doing some soul-searching about the culture in its newsroom and how it covers issues involving race.After Wischnowski resigned, Inquirer Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughes said the company would conduct a national search to replace him, according to the Inquirer. But she stayed in-house by naming Escobar. She told The Inquirer that Escobar is “a seasoned leader who embodies our values, embraces our shared strategy, and understands the diversity of the communities we serve.”The Inquirer wrote, “Escobar, who was born in Colombia, will be one of the highest-ranking Latinos at a U.S. news organization.”Here’s something political and election junkies might enjoy.

The assault on the Capitol came shortly after a rally for the president, who continued to levy baseless claims that the election was rigged and told the crowd they would ""never concede,""USA Today reported.The actions of the crowd were “inexcusable” and crimes, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider told the Detroit Free Press.“There's a difference, a big difference, between peaceful protests and expressing your freedoms,” said Schneider, who was appointed to his post by Trump.“This is not it. The violent protesters are committing crimes, and they have to stop right now and this is not what our Constitution protects.”Depending on what investigators find and individual circumstances, charges could range from everything from low-level curfew charges, to trespassing, to the misdemeanor of destruction of government property less than $1,000, depending on the cost of the windows and anything else, he said.There could be a felony charge of destruction of government property over $1,000, depending on what was damaged, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, he said.Electoral counting resumes after police retake Capitol from pro-Trump rioters; woman shot and killed; Twitter locks out TrumpMichigan lawmakers hunkered down as rioters breached US CapitolOn the high end, charges of civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement, or inciting a riot could all be possible, up to seditious conspiracy — a federal charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison, he said.That latter charge seemed most appealing to two professors of  Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School.It reads:“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.""The phrase “delay the execution of the law” is key, and what was seen from some of the Trump supporters Wednesday, said Devin Schindler, a law professor who once clerked for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.“For at least some of these protesters, particularly the ones that broke into the Capitol, I think there's an extraordinarily strong case that they used force to delay, to hinder, the execution of our laws governing the election and how electoral votes are counted,” he said. “It seems fairly clear to me, based on what we're seeing, that folks are in fact, almost textbook violating this seditious conspiracy statute by using force to interfere with lawful government activity.""Though people on Twitter were levying the term “treason,” he and Schneider both agreed the charge didn’t quite fit with what is known, because treason requires the involvement of enemies to the U.S.Retired Brig.Gen. Michael McDaniel, associate dean for the Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School, too, pointed to sedition as a key possible charge in the case, after possible lesser charges.He also said the defense might be difficult; First Amendment protections aren’t in play once a break-in occurs.The idea of “sedition” has changed, he said, pointing to the version President John Adams used against his political opponents. It’s been narrowed by the courts in the present day.He also raised concern for a different federal charge of rebellion or insurrection, which could carry a sentence of 10 years in prison, and Trump’swords at the rally earlierin the day.“Remember it's got to be ‘against the authority of the United States,’” he said, using the language of the law. “So a really interesting question to pose to my law students later on this week is whether or not the president's speech … was inciting them to violence against the authority of the government of the United States.”Depending on that answer, given the president’s role, another impeachment would perhaps be more appropriate than a charge, he said.There likely won’t be any court action quickly on the events of the day, Michael Traugott, a professor emeritus of communication studies and political science and research professor emeritus at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan, said. There will be jurisdiction issues, even among which agencies will be doing investigations.Michigan leaders renounce US Capitol riot: 'This is happening because of lies'Trump repeated lies about Michigan's election before pro-Trump supporters stormed CapitolSchneider, too, said investigations could take weeks, but said some people could be charged Wednesday evening.But it’s not the first time the idea for ""seditious conspiracy"" has been raised in the last year. The U.S. government looked to the seditious conspiracy charge amid the violence of summer protests, Schneider said.Looking back historically, he also recalled another time shots rang out at the Capitol, in 1954.Five House lawmakers were shot and wounded then by members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which argued for the island’s independence, who were shooting from the gallery above the chamber,USA Today reported.A different time, a gunman on the first floor of the building also killed two Capitol police officers in 1998, and a former Capitol officer fired shots at a senator in 1947 as he entered the subway tunnel linking the Capitol to Senate offices, USA Today reported.However, Traugott said the nearest precedent to what happened Wednesday can be found back in the Civil War. But even then, the Capitol itself wasn’t stormed.""The action of the mob in Washington, incited by President Trump, is an unprecedented affront to the peaceful transfer of power on which our democracy is based,” he said. “It is a seditious act unlike anything since the Civil War.“There have been individual acts, like Oklahoma City, but nothing like this. It’s pretty directly attributable to one person (Trump).”The actions of the mob created a “tear in our civil and political fabric (that) will be difficult to repair,” he said.People need to know the punishments, so they go home and things don’t get even worse, said Schneider.“We should all be able to disagree peacefully,” he said. “That's one of the most disturbing things to me is that we're, on both sides of the aisle, everyone is taking these disagreements to the extreme interest shouldn't be that way,” he said.Considering the historical context, Schindler thought back to the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812, but still thought the 2020 storming stood out.“This kind of violence within the Capitol is extraordinarily rare,” he said. There’s some examples back in the pre-Civil War era or the Civil War era or congressman fights,” he said. “There was some …  shootings in the Capitol, but to see this level of violence directed towards the lawful exercise of government is unheard of.”",2

116,Conservatives Issue a Clarion Call on Trump’s Mental Health,-22.0,26.5,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/19/conservatives-issue-a-clarion-call-on-trumps-mental-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,washingtonmonthly,25,"Given what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have been suggesting for a long time that his mental status will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president’s behavior has triggered several conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health.The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, who served under three Republican presidents and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting to some of Trump’s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehnerrefers to the presidentas “a damaged soul with a disordered personality.”It doesn’t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump’s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better—and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses…Whether the worst scenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what weknow is that the president is a person who seems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead.Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe.Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president’s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of a stream where he reacted to some of Trump’s lies.Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man’s condition of mind.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 14, 2019Conwaytweetedthe diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, “Tell us,@realDonaldTrump—which of these diagnostic criteria do you not satisfy?” To explain, hetweeted a linkto an article in Rolling Stone titled, “Trump’s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump’s Behavior?”At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern.Agree with this, but would add that *all* Americans should be thinking seriously *now* about Trump’s mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress—and the Vice President and Cabinet.https://t.co/OoxgLJpltE— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 18, 2019Jennifer Rubinjoinedthe bandwagon.Whether meant seriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein’s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendment seems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as FBI director and the appointment of a special counsel, Trump’s mental and emotional health has seemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from the special counsel and widespread criticism of the president’s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration.These are not warnings coming from partisans seeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and those serving in Trump’s cabinet to take the situation seriously, before it’s too late.",0

United Behavioral Health (UBH) ""lied to state regulators"" to conceal misconduct, the judge wrote, and executives responsible for the guidelines ""deliberately attempted to mislead the court at trial in this matter.""""The harm that UBH caused by applying overly restrictive guidelines to make coverage determinations goes beyond the money spent by class members who could afford to obtain the treatment that UBH refused to cover,"" Spero wrote.""Rather, it was the unfair adjudication of claims that was experienced by all of the class members (and for some deprived them of much-needed treatment that should have been covered by their health plans) ...,"" he added. ""A fair determination of class members' claims will also allow them to correct the 'record' so that they can, if appropriate, pursue other remedies.""A spokesman for Minnetonka-based UnitedHealth Group said the company was reviewing the order and considering options including an appeal.Cathy Roberts — Associated PressUnitedHealth Group headquarters in Minnetonka.""Over the last several years, we have taken concrete steps to improve access to quality care by enhancing coverage through clinician-developed evidence-based guidelines, expanding our network of providers and providing new ways for people to quickly access care,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are focused on ensuring our members get the quality, compassionate care they need, and will continue working closely with people across the behavioral health community on this important issue.""Attorneys said that more than 50,000 patients are in the class of plaintiffs whose claims for residential or outpatient treatment were denied as UBH used the guidelines. Plaintiffs allege UBH denied them or their dependents coverage for residential or outpatient treatments between 2011 and 2016.The class-action lawsuit includes 11 named plaintiffs including DeeDee Tillitt of Edina, whose 21-year-old sondied of a drug overdosea few months after UBH said it would no longer pay for residential treatment of his drug addiction.The order issued Tuesday requires the UnitedHealth Group subsidiary to use better guidelines for making coverage decisions and train company employees on their use. The company also must reprocess an estimated 67,000 claims for coverage that previously were denied.There's no guarantee that UBH will now cover the claims, but ""we're confident that a lot of people are going to end up getting a different decision this time around,"" said Caroline Reynolds, a plaintiffs attorney with the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP.The court will appoint a special master to oversee the reprocessing of claims, which should take about one year to complete, Reynolds said.In his 2019 ruling, Spero found that UBH's guidelines made it harder for patients to get coverage. The company placed excessive emphasis on addressing acute symptoms, he found, rather than treating underlying conditions.The judge also faulted the guidelines for not addressing effective treatment of co-occurring conditions and breaking with standards of care in pushing patients to lower levels of care. The unique needs of children and adolescents also weren't properly addressed, Spero ruled.""The emphasis on cost-cutting that was embedded in UBH's guideline development process actually tainted the process, causing UBH to make decisions about guidelines based as much or more on its own bottom line as on the interests of the plan members, to whom it owes a fiduciary duty,"" the judge wrote in 2019.",2

""Unilever is a champion in corporate diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and remains committed to encouraging each entity, public or private, to align with these goals in support of LGBTQ+ people.""""We're thrilled to work with Unilever again on the 'United We Stand' campaign, and bring support and attention to these communities,"" said Rana Reeves, founder and CEO of RanaVerse, who has partnered with Unilever every year on the initiative. ""Through careful assessment, we targeted five communities with little to no LGBTQ+ discrimination protections and diverse needs, and used those insights to shape the campaign. This is an initiative that is for the queer community and by the queer community, and it's providing a space for so many untold stories. For me, the opportunity to work with Unilever on an effort so deeply focused on actionable purpose and systemic change has been a game-changer."" Reeves is a British-Indian gay immigrant whose agency, with offices in New York and London, helps brands ensure that their campaign work is made both for and by the community, with queer talent in front of and behind the scenes.Unilever and RanaVerse worked with LGBTQ+ community strategist Sean Coleman to select locales that scored a zero on the Human Rights Campaign's Municipal Equality Index: Monroe, La.; Moore, Okla.; Clemson, S.C.; Florence, Ala.; and towns and cities in need of support in southwest Missouri. Within each of those areas, they partnered with a local LGBTQ+ organization: Forum for Equality, Freedom Oklahoma, South Carolina Black Pride, the Knights and Orchids Society, and PFLAG Springfield, respectively.Tourmaline, a prominent filmmaker and artist who has also worked with ""United We Stand"" every year, will profile five diverse LGBTQ+ narratives from each of these communities for films that will make up the 2021 ""United We Stand"" campaign and will be released this month for Pride. They will be available beginning next Monday on YouTube and other platforms.While each region has its own set of challenges, there is one overarching similarity -- the lack of support for those who are the most vulnerable. ""Those that are in rural areas, are differently abled, and people of color have the least access to life-affirming services,"" Coleman said. ""'United We Stand' is different in its approach as we looked at the unique intersections that present within these communities and will work to bridge the gap, providing a blueprint that other regions can adopt.""The change-makers within these narratives represent multiple intersectional LGBTQ+ experiences including Indigenous, Black, Latinx, and transgender/nonconforming people. With a focus on ""the language of the heart,"" as Tourmaline describes it, the films will centralize these subjects' unique voices to share their stories and reflect their identities. Together, Tourmaline and her subjects are emblematic of Unilever and RanaVerse's commitment to increasing diversity both on-screen and behind the camera.""Unilever's 'United We Stand' campaign purposefully centers the voices of those organizing against harmful conditions and creating beautiful and powerful solutions in the wake,"" Tourmaline said. ""Queer people have a historic talent for lifting each other up, for banding together as one to fight for the collective good. During a time like Pride, rather than focusing on the pain and anguish of the LGBTQ+ experience, we will celebrate the thriving, abundance, and joy of the community.""The films will kick off a month of spreading awareness and information across Unilever's channels and partners, and it will include a continuation of the Unilever queer leader network, which brings together a mass assortment of LGBTQ+ celebrities, influencers, community leaders, and entertainers to help spread the campaign's message. The 2021 participants include Adore Delano, Detox, Jackie Cox, Jan Sport, Lady Shug, Nicky Doll, Latrice Royale, the Vixen, Aquaria, Heidi N Closet, Willam, Bob the Drag Queen, La'Darius Marshall, and more.

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) saved roughly $38,000 in taxes thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Republican-passed tax cut championed by President Donald Trump which therecently admittedcut most Americans' taxes.Sanders released ten years' worth oftax returnsMonday night, fulfilling a long-standing promise to do so. The returnsindicatedthat Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to the sales from his booksandBernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution.Sandersdodged questionsabout his new-found wealth during a Monday night townhall on Fox, declining to say if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox's Martha MacCallum about if he wouldvoluntarily givemoney to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was.If he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates.Sanders has not announced any substantive changes to the income tax system during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the tax system in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan.According toanalysisfrom the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders's 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent ""income-based [health care] premium paid by households,"" which the Tax Foundation writers say is ""equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.""Using the Tax Foundation's estimates of Sanders's brackets, as well as the senator's reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under his schema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would be shelling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income.Luckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime. Rather, Sanders enjoyed a tax cut thanks to the TCJA, just like millions of other Americans.""Ever since President Trump signed the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law,""reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote on Sunday. ""Preliminary data based on tax filings has shown the same.""Multiple tax-policy think tanks have provided tools to estimate tax liability with and without the TCJA. Using the information provided in Sanders's 2018 tax return, these calculators indicate major benefits to his bottom line from the TCJA. (Note: these estimators make a number of assumptions, and so may not perfectly reflect Sanders's real tax liability without the TCJA.)One tool, provided by the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of the left-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institute) estimates that Sanders's income tax liability without the TCJA would have been $144,451; with the tax law, it fell to $106,782, a drop of $37,669.Another estimatorfrom the Tax Foundation estimates a total tax liability (including payroll) of $188,753.06 before the bill and $149,773.88 afterwards, a $38,979.18 drop.In other words, the TCJA—which Sandersvoted against—saved him nearly $40,000 in taxes in 2018, roughly the additional tax burden he would have to face if his preferred tax code was implemented.2020 Election,Bernie Sanders,Taxes,Trump Administration",1
120,Why Do Democrats Want to Ban Members of Congress From Carrying Firearms in the Capitol?,16.0,30.0,https://thenewamerican.com/why-do-democrats-want-to-ban-members-of-congress-from-carrying-firearms-in-the-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,thenewamerican,16,"A clique of liberal Democrats is urging leaders of both parties in the House of Representatives to ban lawmakers from carrying firearms while on Capitol Hill.While members of the public are barred from carrying weapons of any kind on Capitol grounds, a decades-old rule lets the members of Congress themselves carry guns in most areas of the Capitol complex.So far, at least 21 Democrat anti-gunners have joined the effort to trash the exemption.Theysent a letterto House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) this week in which they argued that armed members of Congress make everyone on Capitol Hill less safe, in part, because Capitol Police are unaware who is armed and who isn’t.This group hopes that party leaders will adopt a rule change banning firearms for everyone in the next Congress. “Ultimately, the current regulations create needless risk for Members of Congress, their staff, members of the Capitol Police, and visitors to the Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote in their letter.The group is composed of well-known gun control advocates, such as Representatives Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), and Representative Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) — who was shot and wounded as a staff member during the 1978 congressional trip to the Jonestown cult settlement in Guyana, a shooting in which four others were killed.Pelosi reportedly likes the idea of prohibiting guns for members of Congress. She has long wanted stricter federal gun laws and wants the incoming Congress to expand background checks.The idea, however, doesn’t sit well with McCarthy or the Republican caucus.It’s currently unknown just how many lawmakers on Capitol Hill exercise the ability to carry. The policy as it now stands was adopted in 1967 by the Capitol Police Board after Congress passed a Capitol ban on firearms for the general public.The issue came into the spotlight last month when it became known that Lauren Boebert, a 33-year-old Colorado Republican newly elected to the House, approached Capitol Police during new member orientation to inquire about Capitol Hill firearm policies.Boebert often carries a gun on her hip and made the Second Amendment a central focus of her campaign, in which she defeated 10-year incumbent Scott Tipton in the Republican primary.Representative Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who is leading the movement to ban congressmen from carrying in the Capitol Complex, says one of the problems is that there are no guidelines to ensure safe storage of guns in representatives’ offices or anywhere else in the Capitol.“As you know, Member offices are open to staff, visitors, and the general public, and a firearm that is not secured could easily end up in the wrong hands,” the letter reads.His group also argues that while the House Sergeant at Arms was said to brief the newly elected members on the Capitol’s gun rules, older members have never received the same instructions.“Most returning Members are likely not aware of any regulations whatsoever regarding firearms on Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote. “As a result, there is a total lack of uniformity and procedure surrounding Members of Congress carrying firearms, which fosters an environment where Members may unwittingly be putting themselves and others in danger.”That’s a pretty weak argument, however. If that were really the issue, it could easily be remedied by a simple memo or orientation for veteran members of the chamber.Unfortunately, the House rules package for the 117th Congress is currently being drafted by members of the Rules Committee, led by Democrat Representative Jim McGovern (Mass.). Adopting rules for the chamber will be one of the House’s first votes when the body convenes on January 3 to begin the next session.While Democrats’ majority has thinned due to Republican gains in the 2020 election cycle, they nevertheless retain control of the chamber, making it possible that the restrictive gun rules Huffman and his colleagues want will be passed, especially as it could please the new wave of radical Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Corte (D-N.Y.), who are tired of Pelosi and the party’s old guard.It would be a shame and a loss for the Second Amendment if they removed lawmakers’ ability to carry. In such turbulent times, patriotic, constitutionalist statesmen should carry to protect themselves against reprisals from the Left and the establishment.

Ned Lamont on Thursday formally approved the Phase 1B expansion, whichhad been recommendedby a state subcommittee earlier in the week.“It will probably take a few weeks before all the people in Phase 1A get their second dose,” Lamont said, “but that doesn’t mean we’re not beginning to do people in 1B, really focused right now on folks 75 and above.”With the expansion, the state has added about 715,000 people to the phase, for a total of more than 1.3 million, according to state estimates. (Previous state estimates placed the number at more than 1.5 million.)The newly expanded phase, which began this week with residents 75 and older eligible to sign up for vaccination, now includes:All residents aged 65 and older.Residents aged 16 to 64 who have at least one high-risk co-morbid condition (including cancer and Down syndrome).Frontline essential workers (including teachers and grocery store workers).Residents of congregate settings (including group homes and prisons).Because of the size of the phase, the state is rolling out eligibility in waves — meaning not everyone in Phase 1B will be vaccinated at once.“This allocation strategy is limited by the number of doses we have available,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of public health. “We’re hoping for more vaccine as new [vaccines] get approved and as the existing manufacturers are able to ramp up production, but we can only give out as many vaccines as we have doses.”The state’s 277,000 residents who are aged 75 and older are first in line, and the state has already opened up vaccination appointments to that group. However, Connecticut officials have not said which group might become eligible next, or given any timeline for the full rollout of Phase 1B.“Our message to the public today is please be patient,” Gifford said. “It will take time for us to get to the other members of Phase 1B.”Lamont noted that “demand is far outstripping supply.” The state has received 46,000 vaccine doses a week from the federal government, though Lamont said Thursday they were expecting an extra 50,000 next week as a one-time reward for successful vaccine administration.Phase 1B marks the beginning of the widespread vaccination in Connecticut. Previously, only a narrow subset of the population — health care workers, medical first responders and nursing home residents — were eligible for inoculation.Gifford said the full vaccination process will take months but that state hopes to have most residents vaccinated by the fall.Also on Thursday, the state opened its centralized vaccination registration website to residents who are 75 and older. Eligible residents can now make a vaccination appointment through the website, which can be found atportal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19–Vaccination-75-and-older. They can also call (877) 918-2224 to set an appointment.Appointments are currently available only to residents who are 75 and older. Appointments are required at vaccination sites across the state.“Don’t just show up. That doesn’t work,” Lamont said. “You need to get registered, and you need to make an appointment.”Connecticut has so far administered more than 170,000 vaccine doses, with about 5% of the state’s population having received at least one shot and about 16,000 residents having received both of their required doses. The state ranks fifth nationally in the share of its population to receive at least one dose.State reports lower-than-usual positivity rateLamont on Thursday reported 968 new COVID-19 cases out of 22,171 tests, for a positivity rate of 4.4% — lowest in a single day since late November.That lower-than-usual figure came just days after Connecticut reported its highest single-day positivity rate since May. The state’s seven-day average currently stands at 7%, down slightly from recent days but still near its peak level.“The numbers are bouncing around a little bit,” Lamont said. “What we know is that outside is safer than inside and there’s nothing more important than wearing a mask.”Connecticut currently has 1,118 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, down 30 from Wednesday. Hospitalizations have remained mostly flat for about a month now, since peaking in mid-December.Additionally, Lamont reported 17 new coronavirus-linked deaths Thursday, following 87 on Wednesday. The state has now recorded 6,553 COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, including 264 over the past week.The United States has now seen more than 23 million COVID-19 cases and 386,996 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University.High-capacity vaccine sites coming to Rentschler Field, other sitesIn addition to an existing vaccine site at the Connecticut Convention Center, state officials announced Thursday that the state will organize two additional high-capacity sites: one at Rentschler Field and one in Shelton.Josh Geballe, the state’s chief operating officer, said the sites are taking only a small number of patients currently but that they help ensure the state’s preparedness for future phases of vaccine rollout.“We’re limited for the foreseeable doses by the number of doses that we get in,” Geballe said. “What we’re doing is setting up these mass sites in anticipation [of more doses becoming available].”Emily Brindley can be reached atebrindley@courant.com.",2
122,"Young Voters, Motivated by Climate Change and Environmental Justice, Helped Propel Biden’s Campaign",-11.67,44.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07112020/young-voters-climate-change-environmental-justice-joe-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,insideclimatenews,21,"If Joe Biden wins the presidency, young voters between 18 and 29 will have played a critical role in his election, turning out in force and favoring the former vice president over President Trump by 61 percent to 36 percent, according to ananalysisby the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning at Tufts University.The Center concluded that those young voters, and particularly young people of color and women, may have helped put Biden over the edge in crucial battleground states, based on ananalysisof votes counted by midday Friday.The Tufts’ center estimated the youth share of the vote in the 2020 election at 17 percent, compared to 16 percent in the 2016 presidential election and13 percentin the 2018 midterms, based on the 2020 VoteCast from the Associated Press, the National Election Pool exit poll from Edison Research and its own analyses of census population data. That figure could change as more data becomes available and the election comes to a close.The center, a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement, also projected that once all votes are counted, youth turnout may rise to 53 to 56 percent, compared to46 percentin the 2016 election and36 percentin the 2018 midterms. That would represent the highest youth voter turnout since at least 1984.Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.Young Black, Asian and Latino voters supported Biden over Trump by margins of 77, 72 and 49 points respectively. By comparison, young white voters supported Biden over Trump by a margin of only 6 points. Support for the two candidates also divided along gender-based lines within racial and ethnic groups, with young white women preferring Biden over Trump by a 13-point margin, while young white men preferred Trump over Biden by a 6-point margin.The center’s analysis also found substantial pro-Biden youth voter turnout in key battleground states, including in closely-watched Georgia, where youth comprised 21 percent of the vote and gave Biden a 19-point edge over Trump. Specifically, young Black voters, who favored Biden over Trump by an 82-point margin, “put Georgia in play,” the center said in its analysis.With a recountunderway, Biden currently leads in Georgia by just over 4,000 votes. The center estimated that youth voter turnout across the 11 crucial battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and South Carolina could rise to 51 to 53 percent by the election’s end.“In many ways, the energy young people have brought throughout this election cycle—that will have catapulted Joe Biden into the presidency if we get that result” and given him a “climate mandate” in office, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate organization, said at a press conference on Thursday.Prakash added that Sunrise and allied climate and progressive organizations played a critical role in making a youth-powered Biden victory possible by pushing for the Green New Deal and advocating for climate more broadly. For young voters across the political spectrum, she said, climate is “essentially a litmus test for the 2020 election.”Garrett Blad, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, said Biden’s use of climate change as a “closing argument” in advertisements in swing states down the election’s final stretch testified to the group’s success in shaping climate as a dominant issue in the Democratic Party and national political dialogue.“This is going to sound so simple but when a campaign is actually talking with young people publicly, I think that matters a lot,” said Abby Kiesa, the Tufts’ center’s deputy director, who attributed Biden’s favorability among young voters in part to his effort to appeal directly to youth from early on in his campaign after the primary.Kiesa added that young voters could distinguish authentic appeals from political rhetoric. “Young people aren’t dumb; they know when someone’s just out to get their vote,” she said.Blad offered a similar analysis. “To Biden’s credit, like a lot of politicians don’t do, he listened to young people,” said Blad.He said he thought Biden’s heavy communications about climate change was a driving force behind thevast uptickin his favorability among young voters between May and October.Zanagee Artis, co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth climate justice organization, said the Unity Task Force on Climate Change Biden formed with Sen. Bernie Sanders, which included Green New Deal champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise’s Prakash, signalled the former vice president’s willingness to listen to and work with young people.Though Biden’s refusal to commit to a ban on fracking and fully embrace the Green New Deal frustrated many young progressive climate activists, Artis said he felt encouraged by how successful the youth climate movement had been in pushing Biden to adopt a much bolder climate policy plan than he would have otherwise.Artis was among several climate activists who said youth helped propel Joe Biden into office on the promise that his presidency would deliver not only bold action, but specifically climate justice.Rather than talk strictly about science or decarbonization, Biden spoke about climate in terms of green job creation and investment in marginalized communities—language that helped energize young people who had coalesced around Sanders in the early Democratic primaries.“Climate is a mobilizing issue because climate is an intersectional issue,” said Saad Amer, an environmental activist and director of Plus1Vote, a youth voter mobilization organization. He said climate was inseparable from racial justice and health equity.Alex Leichenger, strategic communications manager at NextGen America, an organization of young voters created to elect pro-climate Democrats, said Biden’s focus on environmental justice as part of his climate policy may help explain his higher support among young people of color and young women. Research has found thatpeople of colorand specifically,young people of color, are more likely to be concerned about climate change.The center’s analysis of APVoteCast datashowsyoung Biden voters were more likely than young Trump voters to say coronavirus, racism and climate change were top issues facing the country by 21-point, 14-point and 9-point margins, respectively, with young Trump supporters being significantly more likely to prioritize the economy and jobs.That disparity reflects the gap between Biden, who linked climate to health and environmental racism, and Trump, who has continuously denied the science around the climate and Covid-19 crises while painting climate action as a threat to people’s jobs in the fossil fuel industry.Leichenger said he looked forward to seeing more data on the breakdown of youth voter turnout to better understand how racial and gender disparities affected young people’s support for Biden over Trump, along with any disparities between Gen Z and millennial voting trends.Beyond having the right messaging, Biden’s campaign may have benefited substantially from concerted organizing efforts by young climate activists to get out their peers’ votes.Danielle Deiseroth, a climate data analyst for the progressive think tank Data for Progress, said hundreds of thousands ofpostcardsSunrise sent out to young voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Florida were emblematic of the large-scale, youth-led organizing that may have played a critical role in swaying the election.Blad said Sunrise made a total of 1.8 million phone calls, sent 2.5 million texts and mailed 778,000 postcards to eligible voters, reaching 3.5 million unique voters just since the end of the presidential primary.Digital technologies may also have played an important role in mobilizing young voters, both Leichenger and Amer said. With in-person campaign events next to impossible because of the pandemic, they said, youth took advantage of their social media and internet savvy to get out the vote using platforms like TikTok and Instagram.And for many climate organizers, this year’s powerful youth turnout is only the beginning. Youth have “shown that they are relevant, that they are here and they are going to have a say,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of U.S. policy at 350 Action.Leichenger said he thinks Gen Z voters between 18 and 23 are “only at the beginning of exercising what can be very substantial power.”Ilana Cohen is a proud New Yorker and a rising junior at Harvard University studying philosophy and social studies.

123,Tennessee Department of Education to start reporting the number of COVID-19 cases in schools weekly,-3.0,47.67,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2020/09/03/tennessee-department-education-start-reporting-number-covid-19-cases-schools-weekly/5700594002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tennessean-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,tennessean,20,"After flip-flopping for more than a month on whether releasing such data violates federal privacy laws, Gov. Bill Lee and the state of Tennessee are finally publicly reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to schools.The Tennessee Department of Education will launch a new dashboard on Tuesday that will include the total number of active cases among students and staff broken down by school across the state.The department will update the dashboard every Monday with the previous week's number of new cases and will include classroom or school closures and whether students are learning in-person, remotely or a hybrid of both for each district.“Parents and community members are working to make informed decisions, and we have determined the best path that balances informed decision making with our obligation to student privacy,” Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn said in a statement. “We believe this resource will not only help parents but will inform how COVID-19 is affecting student attendance, chronic absenteeism and overall student attainment.""Tennessee refuses to release information about COVID-19 cases in schoolsLee, Schwinn and state Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Pierceyhave all been criticized for not publicly reporting information on COVID-19 casesin schools. All have previously cited federal privacy law restrictions, like HIPAA and FERPA, for preventing the release of the information.""The real challenge is to provide as much information as possible to provide for transparency and to give information that is important to the public but continue to provide and adhere to privacy restrictions that FERPA and HIPAA require,"" Lee said previously. ""And that's a balance.""Lee acknowledged Thursday there is wide desire among parents for data that will help them make informed decisions about whether to send their children to school or not. Developing a dashboard to meet these needs appropriately was a process, Lee said during a news briefing.""We believe (the dashboard) will help parents make choices, but it won't compromise our commitment to parents and to students and to teachers,"" Lee said. ""It's uncharted territory. Most states are still grappling with this, but we think we have developed a tool that will be helpful in determining not only how many cases are in a school but also how it affects attendance, chronic absenteeism and even academic outcomes among our students.""Nearly200 COVID-19 cases linked to schools have been reportedacross the state since the first school districts in Tennessee reopened in late July, many prompting quarantines of students and staff and even temporary school closures.Dozens of school districts scrambled to launch their own online dashboards or other methods to report the number of positive cases among staff and students, how many individuals were in isolation or quarantine and school closures.Several states are already reporting or have committed to reporting the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, including Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Texas.These Tennessee school districts are already reporting COVID-19 cases after reopeningHow should districts notify parents about confirmed COVID-19 cases in their child's school?Schwinn said that the majority of state reporting efforts are being led by state health departments — the Tennessee Department of Education is the first to report cases in schools itself.The commissioner has been under fire in recent weeks from a group of lawmakers and some school district leaders over the education department's handling of the pandemic.From what information to report about confirmed cases to what safety guidance to follow in classrooms, some school leaders say the department has not given clear, consistent guidance.Lee releasedthe state's school reopening guidanceon July 28 — days after some Tennessee school districts had already reopened. Initially, he and Piercey said that neither the education or health departments would be tracking or reporting COVID-19 cases in schools. Helater announced that the state would work on a plan for reporting such data.Just a week later, Lee reversed course again and saidthe state would not release the data. After that, Lee said the state was contacting federal officials about what it could release.Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, has consistently argued the public has the right to know what's happening in schools. She acknowledged that districts might be worried that if they release school data, people will use it to try to identify infected people.""It all comes down to, 'Are we somehow identifying that Joe Smith in third grade has COVID-19?"" Fisher said.But privacy concerns are also dueling with the public's right to know, Fisher said.“That has to be weighed with the need for the public to know what’s happening in the schools,"" she said. ""People don’t want to make decisions about their kids in the dark.”House to hold special hearing on school return as legislators, conservative activists raise concerns about Commissioner SchwinnTennessee Department of Education launches dashboard to track school closings due to coronavirusThe state's new dashboard will be maintained by education department officials and school districts will be expected to update the department weekly. The state will not report specific case numbers for schools with less than 50 students enrolled — there are less than 40 of those statewide — and will not report the specific number of cases if the active case number is less than five.The education department routinely redacts student demographic or test data when it only applies to small numbers of students as a way to protect privacy.Department officials anticipate local school districts will likely still have the most up-to-date information on active cases in their schools and encourage families and community members to continue to reach out to local districts for more information.Search and report cases of COVID-19 in Tennessee schools",2
124,Facebook Oversight Board Upholds Trump Ban but Ridicules the Reasoning,-18.33,30.67,https://newrepublic.com/article/162310/facebook-oversight-board-upholds-trump-ban,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-05,newrepublic,25,"He has yet to launch his rumored social media platform, but we now know where the former president will be posting for at least the next six months. It’s calledFrom the Desk of Donald J. Trump: a drab, dated microblog that would be equally comical and forgettable if it weren’t the new mouthpiece of this country’s most powerful demagogue.Unless Parler backs up atruckload of cashto Mar-a-Lago, this might be Trump’s only option. He remains banned from Twitter, and on Wednesday morning the Facebook Oversight Board—or FOB, a pseudo-legal organization conceived andsubsidized by Facebookto issue binding decisions on major content moderation issues—declaredthat Facebook’s post-Capitol insurrection ban of Trump could stand. “The Board found that the two posts by Mr. Trump on January 6 severely violated Facebook’s Community Standards and Instagram’s Community Guidelines,” wrote the FOB in its decision, arguing that Trump broke “rules prohibiting praise or support of people engaged in violence.” (Trump’s posts encouraged rioters to go home peacefully, but they also contained statements supporting their false grievances about a stolen election.)FOB and its parent organization agree here, but perhaps nowhere else. Facebook initially declared its Trump ban temporary but indefinite, then asked the FOB to weigh in. The board on Wednesday excoriated that decision as a reflection of Facebook’s rudderless policies, and its members are not pleased at being used to run political interference for the company. “In applying a vague, standardless penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities,” declared the FOB. “The Board declines Facebook’s request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty.”Punting the decision back to company leadership, the FOB said that Facebook now has six months to decide what to do about Trump—and to get its policies together in the process. It’s a vital, long overdue request, and Facebook shows no sign of being able to fulfill it.Meanwhile, Trump now has another six months to rile up his legions by painting Facebook as a leftist shill that silences conservatives. “Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before,” read aTrump statementdistributed via email. “The People of Our Country will not stand for it! These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.”This messy, embarrassing result, which will satisfy few across the political spectrum, must come as a shock to Facebook. While the FOB had a respectable roster of academic and political luminaries, it was widelyconsidereda rigged regulatory body that would, perhaps temporarily, pacify legislators and activists critical of Facebook policies. Instead, after issuing a few sober-minded decisions on lower-profile matters, the FOB has come out with surprising aggression, showing up its minders as blithe techies ignorant of the damage their platform causes.Yet however silly Facebook ends up looking, the FOB decision still represents a qualified success for the company. The system—Facebook’s system—works. It just needs some clarity and fine-tuning. Facebook, which is used to riding from scandal to scandal, has six months to improve procedures and gauge thepolitical weather vane, after which it can again declare itself a responsible steward of public conversation.Facebook surely will remain undaunted in the wake of the board’s judgment. Time and again, the company has proven unable to reckon with its own scale and impact, as it recklessly pursues growth at all costs. This is especially true in certain foreign markets likeSri Lanka,India, andMyanmar, where Facebook has been manipulated by illiberal and authoritarian governments to spy on dissidents, propagandize, and provoke real violence. In his use of Facebook as a rallying tool for an aggrieved base capable of its own sudden acts of political violence, Trump has more in common, stylistically and strategically, with India’s Narendra Modi or Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte than with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who lamented Trump’s initial ban.Facebook’s political utility and its runaway popularity have always outstripped its policies and its identity. While notionally liberal, it’s hard to say what Facebook stands for—even its supposed devotion to free speech has been watered down as something called“Voice.”The company has no firm public standards for how to deal with lying demagogic political leaders weaponizing its platform to intimidate opponents and manipulate supporters. It claims to have “human rights commitments,” including aCorporate Human Rights Policybased on United Nations standards, but the platform is a constant site of abuse. It probably should not be available in nondemocracies, which is to say nothing of its destabilizing effects on our own rickety political infrastructure.“Facebook has become a virtually indispensable medium for political discourse, and especially so in election periods,” wrote the FOB. “It has a responsibility both to allow political expression and to avoid serious risks to other human rights.” Because it can be a tool for free expression and also one for spreading misinformation or political incitement, the board said, “Facebook’s human rights responsibilities must be understood in the light of those sometimes competing considerations.” In short, Facebook’s own values may be in conflict with one another, perhaps irreconcilably so.There’s a deep reckoning to be had over how Facebook handles content moderation at scale, freedom of expression, and the outsize influence of certain politicians. The FOB’s decision wasn’t it. This necessary round of criticism will do nothing to solve Facebook’s core problems, which revolve around its business model, its profound dependence on surveillance, monetizing user behavior, and stoking division to boost engagement.The problem with Facebook is Facebook. We are well past the point of reform. All that remains is more bumbling, mealymouthed corporate decision-making that will only further enrage the left and right alike. Perhaps Trump’s stay of social media execution can somehow unite those political factions to take down Facebook, but more likely we’ll all be in the same place six months from now: yelling about Facebook’s obscene power, while the company ravenously accrues more of it.",1

The future of fashion may be conflicted, and we don't have all the answers, but we do have one thing to look forward to: the up-and-coming designers who are changing the narrative of fashion. We're excited to introduce you to's Generation Next Class of 2020.This mentorship initiative was launched last year to identify and champion voices we think are up next to lead and push things forward in the fashion industry. The designers from last year's inaugural Generation Next class are now off doing amazing things: Hanifa is innovating runway shows, and debuted her latest collection with a3D digital show;Slashed by Tia is creatingstylish face maskswith her signature ruffles now that covering our faces every day is the new normal; and Dyke Sport was recently worn byRosaliaat an Astroworld performance.This year,’s editor in chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner and fashion and beauty features director Tahirah Hairston selected, with the help of our style team, five fashion brands that we feel embody the ethos ofTeen Voguefrom sustainability to inclusivity. There’s Sheena Sood of Abacaxi, Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, Elliss Solomon of Elliss, Tolu Coker of Tolu Coker, and Krystal Paniagua of Krystal Paniagua.What young designers need to succeed varies based on the designer, and includes building relationships with luxury retailers and mentorship with stylists and fashion editors for placement in publications. Our mission is to give young designers resources to set them up for success, by bringing them together with fashion industry insiders for critical networking opportunities and fostering new relationships. Ahead, meet the Generation Next Class of 2020…. and stay tuned for what's next.Designer Sheena Sood, born in the Minneapolis suburbs, now based in New York2018Sheena Sood caught our attention because of her handmade, environmentally friendly bright designs that tell a story of travel and nature. Sood, a South Asian-American designer, worked as an assistant designer for Tracy Reese, and decided to branch out on her own in 2018. Her tie-dye and mindfully made textile prints are an ode to her childhood and culture. Every look is infused with a sense of boldness, and the name of her collection, Abacaxi, is derived from the Portuguese word for pineapple. As an advocate for slow fashion, her pieces are produced in Delhi and made using artisans in India. Whether crocheted dresses or knit tunics, the collection is an innovative play on traditional silhouettes that are sure to evoke wanderlust.Designer Edvin Thompson, born in Jamaica, now based in New York2016Edvin Thompson is a creative who comes from humble beginnings in Jamaica. After launching his collection in 2016, in New York, he has continued his rise as an innovative talent. “For women and men who show courage while facing an adversary, I design for evidence of trials and triumph, adhering to the constant celebration of life,” he says. Combining nostalgia and Thompson's love of upcycling clothing, each piece moves as a wearable biography, with emotional power and raw energy. The collection is heavy on the details with ruffles, fringe, and intricate headpieces that toe the line of avant-garde couture in silhouette but are somehow still wearable. It’s all Thompson's way of breaking down the barriers in fashion around what “certain people can wear,” and creating his own dialogue with a customer that isn’t interested in the norm.Designer Elliss Solomon, based in LondonByP. Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara Delgado2016London-based designer Elliss Solomon launched her collection in 2016, after graduating from Central St. Martins, with a desire to create a line that was chic in simplicity but conscious of waste. The conversation around using natural organic fabrics, bamboo, and recycled ocean plastics that have a low impact on the earth isn’t new, but Solomon has brought a fresh perspective and an energized approach to simple, elegant pieces that are breathable and comfortable. From conception to creation, Solomon is acutely aware of her clothing, and wants to attract people who may discover her brand because they care about the environment but become customers because of its excellent design. Solomon is everything that fast fashion is not, and what the fashion industry needs.British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker, based in London2017British-Nigerian fashion designer Tolu Coker launched her eponymous line in 2017, after working at Maison Margiela, J.W. Anderson, and Celine, just to name just a few. Coker strikes a balance between dissecting the complexities of diasporic Black identity, maximalist embellishments, and prints with a skillful approach to mainly unisex designs. Her work extends beyond clothing, including illustrations and documentaries with embedded notes of her family history. From her father, an activist in the Black Panther movement in the U.K., to using her platform as a designer to express political reform, Coker is continuously redefining contemporary culture.Designer Krystal Paniagua, originally from Puerto Rico, now based in London2020Krystal Paniagua launched her eponymous line this year, after graduating from the Royal College of Arts and heading back home to Puerto Rico. A common thread in her collection is celebrating her homeland while demonstrating a sense of irregularity and decay through distressing and embroidery. From knit cutouts to dresses molded to the body, Paniagua has developed both a technique that is all her own and a fluidity with knitwear that the industry has never seen. Aiming to create a relationship with the wearer of each item, the collection is inclusive of size and lifestyle while maintaining a strikingly modern approach.",1
126,Donald Trump Jr. Has Tested Positive for COVID-19,-5.67,43.67,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/donald-trump-jr-has-tested-positive-for-covid-19.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2020-11-20,nymag,25,"The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has the coronavirus, Bloomberg Newsreported Friday night. Don Jr., who is one ofdozens of peoplein President Trump’s inner circle who have caught COVID-19, apparently tested positive earlier this week, and a spokesperson told Bloomberg that he is asymptomatic and now self-isolating. His girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the virus over the summer.It’s not clear how or where Trump Jr. was infected or if his case is linked to theearlier White House outbreaks. Also on Friday, White House aide Andrew Giuliani, who is Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s son, revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 as well. The younger Giuliani had attended thebizarre conspiracy theory-saturated press conferencein a packed room at the Republican National Committee headquarters where his father and other members of Trump’s legal team held to make a case for overturning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who took part in the press conference, said Friday that both she and Rudy Giuliani had tested negative.Bloomberg News also reports that Hannah McInnis, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, also tested positive earlier this month, which may be another case linked to the earlier outbreakthat struck Pence’s teamthe week before the election, infecting several staffers including his top aides. That was one of at least three serious outbreaks linked to the White House in the last two months. Two weeks ago, numerous people who attended an indoor Election Night party at the White Houselater tested positive for COVID-19, including President Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, White House political director Brian Jack, Trump campaign adviser David Bossie, and many others, including a large number of Secret Service agents.Two Republican senators, Florida’s Rick Scott andIowa’s Chuck Grassley, also reported positive tests this week.More than 193,000 new cases of the coronaviruswere reported in the U.S. on Friday, a new national record, as COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread across the country.

The Reagan administration moved the Cold War to its endgame by taking the initiative through measures short of warfare, and that era’s technology competition holds lessons relevant for a strategy of geoeconomics today. At stake in the Sino-American rivalry is who gets to tilt the table of the twenty-first century and slide trillions of dollars of prosperity and international political influence toward a center of gravity in Beijing or Washington.Some commentatorson the American rightroll their eyes at “zombie Reaganism” in the form of a warmed-over 1980s policy agenda, whileliberal skeptics have dismissedthe accounts of Reaganites who touted a coherent grand strategy pursued by their administration. Yet, forcontemporary strategistsanddiplomatic historians, Reagan’s results stand the test of time. Of course, we cannot and should not try to replay the Reagan performance like an episode of VH1’s. Sound answers to a historical set of geostrategic problems underpinned Reagan’s success, but America’s problems of the 1980s are not those of the 2020s. What we need to replicate is that era’s mode of geostrategic thinking and the lessons learned for how to get America out of a rut.Failing to think geoeconomicallyover the last three decades blinded us to Beijing’s technology strategy and lost us initiative, but intensifying public-private partnerships for strategic objectives can retake it and enhance American economic competitiveness. Power competition provides the focus and need for American innovation policies, which in turn produce technological breakthroughs that create prosperity when commercialized by the private sector. Debates aboutwhat “a foreign policy for the middle class” would look likemisses this connective tissue between political power competition and a prosperous middle class.At the heart of the Reagan administration’scompetitive strategywas an aggressive pursuit of winning “the Technological War”—the application of a defense industrial base to strategic objectives. The aim is to make your opponent counter your moves, and dance to your tune, in major resource allocations through industrial policy. Technological war targets enemy willpower directly, paralyzing it with demonstrations of superior capabilities, so that a hot war is postponed or not fought. The 1980s have a richhistoryof such industrial policy.For example, Reagan-era industrial policies in microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing weresuccessesthat formed the basis of U.S. information technology dominance in the 1990s. In the 1980s, Japanese makers made significant inroads in the semiconductor and high-performance mainframe computer market that were understood to be critical for next-generation military capabilities. To beat back this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)launched the Strategic Computing Initiativewith $1 billion invested over ten years (1983-93), and alsofounded the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologyconsortium in 1987 as a public-private partnership to regain competitiveness for American companies.Surprise in the mind of enemy staff isa key elementof technology strategy. Displays of strategically relevant military, industrial, or scientific breakthroughs—conducted in concert with diplomatic offensives—can sap the adversary’s self-confidence in his offensive operational concepts. This imposes uncertainty on him and gains you the initiative, which when paired with a political-psychological strategy can project dominance, the backbone of deterrence.Technological competition is an inevitable fact of international economics, but as a strategy underpinning the military buildup of Reagan’s grand strategy, it wasdevisedby defense intellectuals such as Andrew Marshall, longtime director of the Office of Net Assessment in the Defense Department. Marshallchampionedthe view that America had to determine which of the Soviet Union’s pressure points were most vulnerable to comparative U.S. strengths and selectively compete with them. Later, Reaganites such as Secretary of DefenseCaspar Weinbergerand Under Secretary of Defense for PolicyFred Ikléapproved approaches that paired offensive and defensive moves for such competition.The offensive move applied our military-industrial base to innovative capabilities that would provoke Moscow to counter them by costly science and technology investments. The most famous and provocative of these was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but it was hardly the only or most important offensive move to stimulate Soviet fears about U.S. superiority in high technology.The defensive move orchestrated technology security and export controls to deny Moscow access to Western technical innovation and scientific knowhow, make it more difficult for the Soviets to catch up to American expertise. Iklé’s office establishedtechnology security policy at the Defense Departmentfor the first time, defining technology as a valuable national security resource and controlling its transfer to allied and friendly governments. Iklé believed—correctly, as we would come to learn—thatSoviet industrial theft and economic espionage of Western technologyaccelerated its military advances in the 1970s.This technological strategy was the necessary foundation for making effective economic, diplomatic, ideological, and psychological offensives that pushed the Soviet Union off balance and subverted its prestige and willpower in Eastern Europe. America under Reagan took the initiative in the Cold War without firing a shot, and shifted the configuration of force in its favor, through asymmetric military advances powered by technological competition. In this way, the Reagan administration set up the Bush team to win without fighting, and made the 1980s an end game of peaceful victory for America.So, how does the United States get out of a rut this time? Retaking the geoeconomic offensive requires American statesmen to embrace our history of industrial policy and to reject mythologies about innovation arising merely from commercial competition.Alexander Hamiltoncreated the nation’s firstpublic-private partnershipto help compete with Great Britain. The United States won the race to nuclear fission and nuclear weapons, and in the decades that followed the Americannational laboratory systembuilt off the Manhattan Project’s science and technical innovations.DARPA fundinglaid the Internet’s technical foundations. Of the dozen major technologies integrated in the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, eleven of themstem from or were advanced by U.S. government (usually Department of Defense) support. As Daniel Sarewitzwrites:Americans lionize the scientist as head-in-the-clouds genius (the Einstein hero) and the inventor as misfit-in-the-garage genius (the Steve Jobs or Bill Gates hero). The discomfiting reality, however, is that much of today’s technological world exists because of DOD’s role in catalyzing and steering science and technology. This was industrial policy, and it worked because it brought all of the players in the innovation game together, disciplined them by providing strategic, long-term focus for their activities, and shielded them from the market rationality that would have doomed almost every crazy, over-expensive idea that today makes the world go round.For the Sino-American competition, American statesmen must remember this basic offensive move of geoeconomics. A consensus on taking the initiative through industrial policy may beforming already.But what good is the initiative if you cannot keep it? Industrial security and technology export controls paired with rule-making influence at international scientific organizations are critical defenses. Technology denial aims to keep asymmetric advantages from being unraveled by an adversary’s overt technology transfer, industrial theft, or economic espionage. If properly orchestrated, technology security keeps you on the geoeconomic offensive. Orchestrating domestic technology security measures, multilateral export control regimes, and diplomatic pressure at international institutions will require savvy multilateralism, and they are a major growth area for U.S. defensive action in the Sino-American competition.For example, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is America’s main defensive instrument tomitigate, on grounds of national security, the risk of legal transfer of sensitive technology or expertise through corporate mergers and acquisitions. But CFIUS relies mainly on voluntary reporting for compliance, and many American lobbyistsassistforeign corporate clients with navigating CFIUS procedures to purchase U.S. companies and possess their intellectual property.U.S. export controls are similarly disjointed. The problem for Washington is coordinating with foreign capitals to block export to Beijing of knowledge or commodities, such as intellectual property oradvanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, that constitute critical sub-components to the technology competition. The West’s main architecture for technological security in the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), impeded Soviet industrial espionage against critical technologies such as microelectronics. COCOM was abolished in 1994 and replaced with the Wassenaar Arrangement, adeficientsuccessor not aimed at China and mostly restricting conventional arms rather than sensitive science and technology transfers.The deepest positional moves of technology security occur at scientific and technical regulatory and governance bodies atinternational institutionslike the United Nations. This is the grand chessboard where Beijingtriesto convert its scientific leadership into global advantage. U.S. success will preserve Western initiative for defining international legal rules and scientific standards and unravel Beijing’s attempts to play Western countries off each other. Diplomacy in these institutions is the long game for pushing and keeping the PRC off-balance in technology competition.Sun Tzufamously judgedthat attacking the enemy’s strategy is best and the worst is to attack his armies and cities. In grand strategic terms, fighting represents the failure to inflict enough uncertainty in the mind of a rival to deter his aggression against the peace. Attacking the enemy’s strategy can be done—indeed is done preferably—in peacetime competition. A strategy of technology competition, offensively through industrial policy and defensively through technology security controls, is a way to neutralize rival advantages before the fighting starts.",1

130,"How Hurricane Ida’s path, climate change, and Covid-19 made the Gulf vulnerable",-8.33,42.67,https://www.vox.com/22648189/hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-flood-climate-change-covid,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-30,vox,25,"Hurricane Idamade landfall in Louisiana on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, as an enormousCategory 4storm with sustained winds of 150 miles per hour and gustsup to 172 mph. The storm tore roofs off buildings, flooded homes, and left the entire city ofNew Orleans in the dark.Ida will likely be one of the worst extreme weather events of 2021, a year already swelling with heat waves, wildfires, droughts, and storms. “Hurricane Ida is one of the strongest storms to ever hit Louisiana,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement on Sunday.The storm is still churning and turning east through Mississippi. Though Ida has been downgraded to a tropical storm, more devastation is likely in store. The nation will learn more about local impacts as communities regain access to electricity and spotty communications. Even after the winds die down, the towering storm surge will likely linger for days and impede rescue and recovery efforts. So will the coronavirus pandemic: Less than half of Louisiana’s population is vaccinated, and 2,600 patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 as Ida made landfall.The size and uncanny timing of Hurricane Ida makes it impossible to avoid comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm thatkilled at least 1,170 peopleand tied 2017’s Hurricane Harvey as the costliest disaster in US history. While levees appear tohave protectedmuch of the state from Katrina-level flooding so far, some similarities are likely to emerge: Structural inequities and vulnerabilities remain, and communities of color are still at high risk from hurricanes like this.But much of Katrina’s toll in human suffering and devastation became visible in the days and weeks after the storm, in part due to a botched relief effort. It will take time to figure out whether Louisiana, the city of New Orleans, and the US as a whole learned the lessons of Katrina in advance of Ida.Related“People think of a few common themes when they think about hurricanes in New Orleans,” including levees and the legacy of Hurricane Katrina, Lamar Gardere, executive director of the Louisiana nonprofit the Data Center, wrote to Vox on Sunday, shortly after evacuating the city. “But every hurricane boils down to a story about infrastructure, inequity, and climate change/coastal land loss.”“These are the same stories that affect much of our country, but they come into acute focus with immediate and dramatic effect during these events,” Gardere added.Cities along the Gulf Coast have spent billions over the past decade and a half building up their defenses — levees, sea wall, flood control mechanisms. But populations have grown, the oceans have risen, and the planet has warmed. The threat of extreme weather is growing, and it’s becoming harder to adapt.Millions of people live in the US Gulf Coast, which is one of the country’s fastest-growing regions and stretches across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Between 2000 and 2016, the population in the regiongrew by 25.4 percent, compared to 14.8 percent across the US as a whole.That in turn has fueled a construction boom of homes, businesses, infrastructure, and industrial facilities, particularly for the oil and gas sector. Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, an oil and gas hub that experienced some of the storm’s most extreme winds and storm surges. Much of the new construction is in low-lying areas prone to coastal inundation, with someplaces lying below sea level.Parts of theGulf Coast are sinkingas the soft ground settles beneath heavy construction and changes in land use, a phenomenon known as subsidence. The coastline itself, which can serve as a barrier against storms, iswearing awayas rising seas erode the shore. Changes to waterways like the Mississippi River have also diminished vital sources of sediments for replenishing the coast.All this means that lots of people and property are in harm’s way when disasters occur. And Ida took an especially destructive course through major population centers.The risks, however, are not distributed equally. Many lower-income communities and those populated by people of color have less protective infrastructure like levees and sea walls, leaving them vulnerable to storms and rising water. The people in these communities also often have themost difficulty getting out of the path of the stormas they struggle to find adequate money and shelter to evacuate.In May, the NOAA forecasted that the US Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from late May until the end of November, had a 60 percent chance of being “above normal.”So far, that prediction has come to pass. “After a record-setting start, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season does not show any signs of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,” said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator, in anAugust statement.This year’s season is below the record-breaking season last year, which was thebusiest on record. But there are several factors this year that are fueling a more active year for tropical cyclones.Ordinarily, a key factor is sea surface temperature. Hurricanes need water to be at least 26 degrees Celsius, or 79 degrees Fahrenheit, and the warmer water gets, the more energy is available to form storms. Water temperatures in the Gulfspiked ahead of Hurricane Ida, but sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic this year have generally beennear average levels. Still, forecasters are anticipating a strongerWest African monsoon, which helpsbirth hurricanes.Meteorologists are also expecting less vertical wind shear in the atmosphere, which are changes in wind speed and direction that can rip apart hurricanes before they form. Another factor that favors more active hurricane seasons: Since 1995, the Atlantic Ocean has been in the warm phase of a decades-long ebb and flow in ocean temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation.The planet is warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. That amplifies the raw ingredients of hurricanes and can worsen storms.While researchers are still parsing the climate signals in Hurricane Ida, scientists have known for decades that climate change worsens hurricanes for several reasons.Sea surface temperatures are rising, which infuses storms with more energy and can increase their intensity.“As the climate warms, we expect that the upper bound of how intense a hurricane can get ... goes up at a certain rate with warming and that’s been known for 33 years,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year.Another way climate change makes hurricanes more destructive is by increasing their rainfall. Air soaks up about 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius the air warms, so warmer air means more moisture is available for precipitation. Extreme rainfall events are on the rise, and Ida drenched parts of Louisiana with as much as24 inches of rain.Rising sea levels due to the melting ofice caps and the thermal expansion of waterare leading to largerstorm surges, too. This coastal flooding, driven by a storm’s winds pushing water inland, is often the deadliest and most destructive element of hurricanes. Ida created a storm surge as high as16 feet.Climate change is also causing the rapid intensification of more hurricanes. NOAA definesrapid intensificationas a gain of 35 mph or more in wind speed over 24 hours.Ida strengthenedfrom category 2 strength (with winds up to 110 miles per hour) to category 4 strength (with winds topping 150 mph) in less than a day. Hurricanes tend to rapidly intensify when they pass over a patch of water that is warm, deep, and calm. These changes in wind speed can make the difference between a building surviving a hurricane and being obliterated by it.Experts have been warning for more than a year that ahurricane striking during a pandemicwould pose unique challenges, and health officials are worried more difficulties may arise in the wake of Hurricane Ida.“We’re having a situation where even when you’re stretched to the limit — to superimpose upon it what will likely be a historic weather environmental catastrophe — is going to do nothing but make things much, much worse,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, toldCNN on Sunday.Hospitals are contending with power outages, and many are unable to relocate their patients because othermedical facilities in the region are already full of Covid-19 patients.For evacuees in shelters, it’s proving hard to maintain social distance. The risk of further transmission is high, given relatively low vaccination rates across the Gulf Coast and the spread of the more-transmissible delta variant.Hurricane Katrina took a devastating toll on communities of color, and advocates fear these communities will again suffer some of the worstimpacts of Hurricane Ida.Indigenous communities in the bayou have been hit by catastrophic flooding, said Donny Verdin, a member of the tribal council of the United Houma Nation. “We have people who stayed behind whose houses were flooding and roofs were blown off as they were in them,” Verdin, who evacuated to Texas on Saturday, told Vox on Monday.The United Houma Nation is typically overlooked by federal relief, Verdin said, because it’s not a federally recognized tribe. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he said, his community relied on donations and nonprofit organizations instead of support from the federal government. “We’re just left to fend for ourselves,” he said. “The community usually pulls together and we build back. It’s what we’ve done forever.”Storms and sea-level rise fueled by climate changehave been pushing tribes further inland, away from their traditional territories. The majority of Verdin’s community used to live right on the coast: “We are people of the water,” he said. After Katrina, three-quarters of them moved inland, Verdin told Vox.“The community is not as close as it once was because people are more scattered,” he said. “The best-case scenario is that we are able to relocate our communities. The worst-case scenario is that they wash away.”Relocating communities who have lived in coastal Louisiana for generations comes at a steep cost. “Our access to the natural resources and food security has been everything for our sovereignty,” said Monique Verdin (no direct relation to Donny Verdin), another member of the United Houma Nation who works with the community group Another Gulf is Possible. “When you take the people away from the bayou you’re literally taking them away from their ability to feed themselves.” Plus, at the end of the day, she told Vox, “you can’t run from climate change.”It’s hard not to draw ties between Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Katrina, one of themost expensive storms in US history. The storms landed on the same day of the year and in roughly the same spot. They had similar wind speeds. They even gained strength by passing over a similar patch of warm ocean water in the Gulf that fuels hurricanes,the AP reported.There are some important differences in the storms themselves — Ida caused a weaker storm surge but had stronger winds, for example. But even if all things were considered equal, Ida is likely to be far less devastating than the 2005 storm.Katrina was destructive in part because of structural issues with the region’s system of levees — many of which failed — and a botched government response to the crisis, as Vox’s German Lopezpreviously reported. Here’s how Lopez put it:The government response was so wildly incompetent that it allowed the worst of the catastrophe to continue and sometimes created entirely new, unnecessary problems. People will always have to deal with unavoidable natural disasters, but a poor government reaction and preparation can lead to many more deaths and untold costs.The US government also failed to evacuate tens of thousands of people who couldn’t afford to leave Louisiana before the storm hit, Lopez reported.The levee system is much stronger today, after a $14.5 billion investment in storm protection authorized by Congress in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers has since constructed hundreds of miles of levees around New Orleans,Reuters reported, some of which are30 feet tall. They appear to be working, with onlya small numberof levee failures reported outside of the city. The governorsaid on Mondaythat the state’s storm protection system performed “extremely well,” afterstating earlierthat they were “built for this moment.” (His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)The details of Hurricane Ida’s devastation will trickle out for days to come, as officials survey the damage and conduct search-and-rescue operations. “I fully expect [the] death count will go up considerably throughout the day,” the governor told MSNBC on Monday.And if past hurricanes are any guide, the government’s ongoing response to the storm — including its long-term follow-through — will shape the region’s recovery and its resilience to future hurricanes.There will be more storms, and in a warming world, they’ll get worse.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

It has been fined untold millions of dollars.  But the company sees that as the price of doing business.  Again, they can make more money by just not treating people and hoping that they don’t die than they can by actually providing medical care and then paying court-ordered legal settlements.Take as just one example the case ofMarques Davis.  The 27-year-old was a prisoner in the Kansas Department of Corrections, where Corizon has an exclusive contract to provide medical care.Davis went to a Corizon nurse saying that he felt weakness in his arms and legs.  The nurse determined that Davis was “malingering,” that is, making it all up so he didn’t have to work.  Months later, with the numbness worsening, Davis began to complain that he felt like something was “eating his brain.”  In fact, somethingeating his brain.  It was an untreated fungus that caused his vision to blur, his speech to slur and his cognition to become so impaired that he began to drink his own urine.Davis finally had a heart attack and was taken to a local Kansas City hospital.  A CT scan revealed “dramatic swelling of the brain.”  A day later, he was dead.  Davis’ lawyer hopes to prove in court that this was not an isolated incident, but “a clear and consistent pattern of Corizon delaying, postponing, or not providing necessary medical treatment.”  AnACLU spokesmansaid, “Corizon is simply writing off the damages they’re having to pay as the cost of doing business without doing anything meaningful to improve.”The only way to force change and to try to stop these atrocities from happening is in the courts.  So far, Corizon has shown that it simply doesn’t care what the courts say about its behavior or about the depravity of its business model.Arizona, however, has an idea.  After scores of lawsuits against the company for failing to provide adequate care to prisoners and for failing to make any improvements in the delivery of healthcare, despite court orders to do so, Arizona simply threw Corizon out of the state.And then the state legislature passed a (nonbinding) resolution urging private equity firms based in Arizona to divest themselves of Corizon stock.  Corizon leaders huffed and puffed and released statements saying that they had been wronged.  They alsodid nothingto improve healthcare.  But if 49 other states did the same thing, at least Corizon medical professionals couldn’t kill any more innocent people.toConsortium News’Post Views:527",1
132,The Nature of Money,-9.33,39.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/trumps-taxes-and-the-nature-of-money,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-23,currentaffairs,25,"Even as the pandemic and financial crisis introduce us to new and grotesque ways to suffer, it seems as if the rich have been spared the worst of it. Their net worth has increased by$637,000,000,000while poor friends of mine beg for rent money on social media. It can feel as if there are two economies, one for us and another for the rich. This is wrong, however. There is only one economy. The difference between how the wealthy and the working classes experience the same world is not just in the amount of money we have and what that can buy—it’s built into the nature of money, as I learned when I was studying to become an accountant.The first two classes in an accounting major outline a handful of extremely basic equations, standard forms (like the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows), and the theoretical underpinnings of accounting. They are considered “washout” courses—ones so difficult a significant number of people drop the major—and it’s not because of the math. Accounting requires no more than middle school algebra. If you want to know why it’s so difficult, here is one of the very first thought problems I was presented with in one of my classes:There are multiple answers. For internal figures (called managerial accounting), the painting is worth whatever management would find most useful at any given time. How that’s done, and what figures are recorded there, is unregulated. On the other hand, when preparing numbers for people outside the company, thererules. For tax reporting purposes, the hospital (with some exceptions) needs to have it assessed and recorded at fair market value. Fair market value is a different figure—usually a more conservative one—than what you’d expect the painting to fetch at auction. For the purpose of enticing investors or seeking a loan, there’s yet another answer: it depends on what the hospital plans to do with the painting in the near future. If they’re willing to sell it in the next year or two (especially to repay a debt) then they should report it at fair market value. But if they wouldn’t part with it under any circumstances, it should be recorded at the price it was acquired for—a dollar. The painting is worth a lot of money, but if they’re not planning to make use of that value, then they can’t treat it as a resource.To summarize, there are two correct ways to record the value of the painting, either “fair market” or “acquisition” value (i.e. the original purchase price), and neither of them are what the painting would actually “be worth” in the conventional sense. Which value the accountant chooses depends not on anything objective, but on what the business plans to do with the painting.This example breaks the kind of people who find an accounting major attractive. We’re creatures who love objectivity and order, and accounting is not that.The thought experiment about the painting isn’t a weird edge case—it’s a typical day on the job. I used to audit natural gas companies, and there are many whose distribution systems are bringing in tens of millions of dollars a quarter, yet their infrastructure is worth $0. The first time I saw a company claiming to literally be worthless, I brought it to my boss because I swore it couldn’t be right. He said, “depreciation,” and I toddled off back to my desk.We record the wear and tear infrastructure goes through as depreciation—we slowly reduce its value, in other words—and we do that in a standardized way. Usually this involves an evenly allocated reduction of value per year over the expected life of the asset—for example, if a new oil pipeline is expected to last 10 years, we might subtract 10 percent each year until it’s worth nothing. For other industries or assets, the rate of depreciation might be based on the number of units produced—the more widgets are made, the less the widget stamping machine is worth. The different models are used so we can compare companies apples-to-apples. We do this regardless of whether their infrastructure is still functioning or not. This isn’t a mistake: it is the right way to record the value for the purpose of comparison to other companies and for taxes.But if I worked for that same company and wanted to sell it to a buyer, the considerations would be totally different. For example,depreciation for tax purposes is usually accelerated faster than actual wear and tear. A car with a 15 year life, for tax purposes, has to be depreciated over five years. This is the government encouraging companies to build and buy more for political reasons. Depreciation is an expense that is deducted from income to arrive at taxable profit, and so accelerating it is effectively a tax break—but one only companies that rapidly build and expand can reliably use. However, that same infrastructure, when being assessed for sale, is often worth more money than even its depreciated value. When buying or selling infrastructure, businesses take into account how much cash that infrastructure is generating regardless of its age. These differing considerations change the numbers on the page.Therefore, a business infrastructure’s value may swing millions of dollars based on the market and the needs of a business. A 1992 Geo Metro’s value will not. That giant fluctuation is characteristic of assets which make money (like an oil pipeline or intellectual property) and assets which store value (like fine art or some kinds of real estate). The same holds true for the portfolios of rich people. The wealthy who depend primarily on their assets to sustain them (rather than wages) will have many, many large assets, and their entire net worth will swing millions of dollars simply based on their plans for the coming year.Accounting is less of a science and more of a language with grammar, vocabulary, and ideological underpinnings. Recording something with a number, especially one with decimal places, gives a false sense of precision and objectivity to what is being quantified. Even in the “hard sciences,” which also use numbers with decimal places and high degrees of certainty, there is a subjectivity. A human being chooses what to count and what the criteria is for counting it for an intended audience. That influences what number makes it onto the page. Accounting as a field is perhaps more aware of this subjectivity than most disciplines that work with numbers. Business accounting’s grammar is set by an organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which regularly publishes guidance on how to present figures for public consumption. Those standards evolve as part of an ongoing process of polling the industry and holding open discussions, along with formal appeals.In short, accounting is an ever-evolving language that records the day-to-day workings of a life or a business. It is designed to describe the flow of assets, assess it, and make arguments about what should be done. It’s not objective because it can’t be. All I can do as an accountant is be clear about the purpose of why I am presenting specific numbers, what assumptions I am making, which set of accounting standards I’m using, and how closely I hew to those standards.We know shockingly little about the mega rich. Lists like the Forbes 400 are the only available resources we have on who is wealthy because governments don’t really track individual wealth, and the wealthy themselves don’t advertise. The first Forbes 400 wasan immense feat of journalism, digging through public property records in order to compile estimates. But roughlyhalf of wealth is either privately held or in cash—not a matter of public record, and so unavailable to journalists. Even the public record is easy to evade. The rich routinely use shell corporations and trusts and elaborate tax evasion schemes. We gained a small window into that complex web of financial entities the wealthy use to evade taxes through thePanama Papers. That leak, which comprised millions of documents, detailed many billions of dollars of schemes (legal and not) from only one law firm. One estimate saysabout 8 percent of the world’s wealth is in offshore tax havens, and 80 percent is untaxed. Because of the sheer complexity of where the wealthy keep their money and how it’s accounted for, it can be literally impossible for a rich person to quantify what they themselves are worth. The richest person on earth may have no idea theythe richest person on earth. The wealthier someone is, the more the relationship between value and currency breaks down, and so the title “wealthiest person on earth” may actually be meaningless.On the scale we workers live, money seems very precise because itprecise. For young accountants, that’s the appeal. They come into adulthood with some experience of money. A Coke costs $1.75. If they’ve ever filed taxes before arriving at school, the accounting was very straightforward. It was either correct or not correct, with an accuracy to the dollar. But all that lovely order and certainty falls apart outside the realm of small personal finance.This precision in the micro and lack of it in the macro comes down to the function of money.The purpose of money is to establish an exchange rate between labor and finished goods. It allows capitalists—not us, we are not the primary “users” of the tool—to compare worker to worker, good to good, investment to investment, and translate between them. It does a pretty good job of describing the lives of wage earners because that’s what it’s designed to do. Our hours worked, productivity, and consumer habits are all numbers in a spreadsheet. But any attempt to turn it back on capitalists is like an amoeba trying to look at a human being with a microscope—the lens doesn’t go both ways. A poor person’s tax liability can be calculated to the cent. But when a wealthy person does their taxes, there are a number of arguments to be made about how much they own, how much they made, and how much they lost. Your net worth is a number. A capitalist’s worth is a conversation.That difference has material outcomes. Among the capitalist class, fraud is rampant. In 2001, Enron—an energy and commodities trading company from Texas—committed fraud on such a large scale (and more importantly, soundermined the credibility of the entire industry’s figures) that it prompted a reform of accounting practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act greatly tightened the standards on how figures must be reported outside of a company. The “language” of accounting became more standardized. Financial statements presented to investors must now be audited by independent, outside accountants. And while these reforms seem necessary given the stakes, I can’t find firm figures either way on whether they helped at all.I am not a fraud investigator myself, but as an auditor I was privy to how several fraud investigations turned out. Without exception, my experience is that whether law enforcement is called is a matter of how much money was stolen. Petty theft is always prosecuted. But if someone embezzles $10 million, a company tends to prefer to keep that person employed with them and treat it like a loan. Someone in a position to steal that much money has connections.One white-collar criminal who comes to mind—I personally had some contact with him—was in a niche industry. He was a deal broker for commodities, and his customers would only deal with him. 10 million dollars is a lot of money, but in relation to his commission, it was not that much. His placement in the industry, his relationship to labor, was what made him wealthy, not merely the dollar amount of his salary and his assets. He himself didn’t work to produce a product, or really provide a service. He maintained a set of relationships with business owners (who also didn’t make anything with their own hands—they had employees for that) and acted as a gatekeeper of  information about who needed what. Within the very specific parameters of his work, he was trusted. Of course his embezzlement wasn’t brought to the police. Focusing on the numbers rather than seeing their movement as descriptive of something, as pointing towards his relationships, is the same kind of mistake a dog makes when you point at the moon and he sniffs your finger.This gets at whatDavid Graeberwas talking about when he outlined the origin of money in his book. Before the wide use of currency for everyday transactions (which only became common in the 1800s), poor workers relied on credit almost exclusively. Credit in this sense meant “trust.” People did not directly barter (e.g., eight eggs for one shoe), they kept track of what they owed one another over time and paid as they could. These were relationships built on trust. The switch to currency-only transactions had to be imposed by state force. For example, in the very early days of industrial capitalism in England, shipyards were routinely a year or two behind on wages, so workers took tools and food and other things they could barter to pay their rent and their grocery bills. This wasn’t a sign of economic collapse—thiswasthe economy. In order to force a switch to currency, the government criminalized taking tools and goods from the shipyards (previously it was not just legal, but precisely how compensation worked), and the shipyards instituted whippings for this now-theft. Samuel Bentham, an architect, redesigned ship yards with a new central surveillance tower to curb this new kind of theft, an idea lifted by his brother, the architect Jeremy Bentham, for the now infamous prison panopticon.Before that, in medieval Europe, the legal penalties for defaulting on a debt were harsh and involved mutilation or death. However, they were almost never used. Debt was considered a private matter between two individuals, worked out between them in whatever units of barter and timeframes suited them. As Graeber put it, capitalism is “the story of how an economy of credit was converted into an economy of interest; of the gradual transformation of moral networks by the intrusion of the impersonal—and often vindictive—power of the state.” Relationships have always been the fundamental underpinning of money: the thing money reflects for the wealthy and destroys for the poor. In a way, the wealthy fraudster I met is a throwback to an older, kinder, more personal concept of money—one most of us will never experience.Today, prosecution rates for white collar crime are the lowest they’ve ever been andtrending downwards. Theft itself becomes a conversation, rather than just a crime, when a wealthy person does it. When one capitalist robs another, my experience is that they tend to discuss among themselves how to restore the thief to good standing without destroying anyone’s life, livelihood, or privacy. There are of course exceptions. Bernie Madoff and his$50 billioninvestmentPonzi schemesprings to mind. But Madoff’s position was dependent on resources and connections that turned out to be fictional. He had no realistic means to ever repay the investors he scammed (or even to return their initial investment), and so he went to prison. But for those that genuinely are well connected and do have the means to repay the people they rip off, the wealthy already have the restorative justice prison abolitionists fight for.Petty theft, on the other hand, is prosecuted mercilessly. I find this especially strange given how much more of a problem fraud is than theft. The FBI estimates that burglary and petty theft cost Americans about$3.4 billion in property losses. White collar crime costs between$426 billion and $1.7 trillion annually. This kleptocratic culture isn’t harmless. Enron was a natural gas company whose entire business was propped up by fraud. When they were no longer able to continue to hide the extent of their debt, they both crashed that industry and spurred massive reforms in accounting practices and fraud controls. Perhaps those reforms worked, but I doubt fraud has dropped at the rate fraud prosecution has.Personally, I wonder if the lesson companies learned was about keeping a lid on scandal rather than about curbing white collar crime. They preserve the social relations that money points to at risk to everyone else. And I guess it’s easy to see why—it seems on the surface short-sighted to protect thieves who can crash an entire economy, but the fraudsters and their wealthy connections aren’t the ones who suffer in a crash. They still have the power which underpins money, which their money merely gestures towards. The figures in a spreadsheet are shadows cast by power, and during financial crises their power preserves them. The wealthy are so completely insulated from the consequences of what they do, good or bad, it’s very hard for me to understand what motivates them at all. The future itself feels obscure. Here, the lack of imagination that makes me a good accountant makes me a poor visionary: I’m not sure what to do about money beyond believing something should be done. Depending on the study, betweeneightand26people own half of the world’s wealth, and if money isn’t a good means to describe them, then that is a failure to describe the world as it is. Marx advocated abolishing money, as do some foundational anarchists. There are also thinkers on the left (likePierre-Joseph ProudhonandDavid Graeber) who believe public ownership of the means of production is more important than exactly how we account for it, and so are fine with markets and currency, albeit in forms that would be nigh unrecognizable. A full survey of left thought on money and a weighing of the pros and cons of each approach is beyond the scope of a single article. However, on the road to a better society, we will have to grapple with money as it exists. As of now, it’s a tool used to describe workers with the goal of extracting wealth and labor from them. It is an incredibly poor tool for holding the wealthy accountable, and so we will have to come up with other methods.",1
133,Will Armenia’s political turmoil undo its democracy?,0.0,43.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2021/03/will-armenia-s-political-turmoil-undo-its-democracy,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,newstatesman,16,"Armenia, the small country in the South Caucasus between Russia and Turkey, has been mired in political crisis for two weeks, after a group of army officials signed a letter calling for Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down in what the country’s leadercharacterisedas an “attempted military coup”.The context of the unrest is Armenia’s catastrophic defeat in a short war against Azerbaijan late last year over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Swathes of territory which had for three decades been governed as a de facto extension of Armenia were recaptured by Azerbaijani forces in a stunning advance. (Shortly after the end of the war, I visited Azerbaijan and some of its recently reconquered territories,reporting from the regionfor the.)The crushing defeat struck at Armenia’s sense of self. As Thomas de Waal, a fellow at Carnegie Europe, wrote in, his account of the conflict, for almost 30 years after the end of the Soviet Union, Armenia was no longer the “weeping nation” defined by the genocide of 1915. Rather, it had become a regional power, able to defeat its neighbour to claim land it considered rightfully its own. Until it wasn’t.It is no surprise that last year’s defeat has roiled the country’s politics. Pashinyan, who toppled former president Serzh Sargsyan in a peaceful revolution in 2018, is blamed by many in the country for the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedlycitedPashinyan’s provocative statements, notably a fiery speech made in August 2019 saying that “Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh] is Armenia, full stop” – as a casus belli.Nor was the Armenian government honest with its populace during the war. Manybelievedthat Armenian forces were on the cusp of victory against Azerbaijan, right until the November night when Pashinyan appeared with Aliyev and Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign a ceasefire deal containing crushing concessions. As a result, the sudden news of Armenia’s surrender shook the country, leading to repercussions only now coming to the fore.The final straw was Pashinyan appearing toclaimin February that a Russian-made missile system used by Armenian forces had proven ineffective. As the ceasefire is underwritten by Russian peacekeepers, the unsubtle pronouncement went down badly with the military, wary of alienating Armenia’s patron, now more indispensable than ever.Yet even so, the apparent attempted coup appears remarkably half-hearted. It seems to have been limited to 40 or so army officerssigninga letter calling on Pashinyan to go. The military did not detain civilian officials or seize government buildings. The contrast between the ruthless efficiency ofthe military coup in Myanmar, carried out by the country’s experienced and pitiless junta two weeks earlier, is striking.Pashinyan has offered to call snap elections, confident that he will retain power. Unusually, the opposition have so far refused the offer unless the prime ministerconcedespower to a transitional authority, probably because most polls show him comfortably winning re-election, though his approval ratings have more thanhalvedto around 30 per cent since he came to power.Pashinyan claims figures from the ancien régime he swept away three years ago are behind attempts to destabilise his leadership. Former leaders – widely perceived as corrupt – attempting to make a comeback not through elections but through coercion “shows how deep Armenia has fallen into chaos and uncertainty, bordering on state collapse, following defeat in Karabakh,” says Hovhannes Nazaretyan, an Armenian journalist.Pashinyan’s coming to power in 2018 heralded remarkable liberalisation in Armenia, which, along with neighbouring Georgia, is now one of the only democracies in the region. The prime minister had harboured dreams of closer alignment with the West, shelved with the arrival of Russian peacekeepers. Most Armenians have no great fondness for Pashinyan but believe any plausible replacements would be worse. The outcome of this latest power struggle will determine the fate of Armenia’s fragile democracy for years to come.Related",1

136,What the “Creator Economy” Promises—and What It Actually Does,0.0,43.0,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,newyorker,25,"The influencer is a fading stock character of the Internet’s commedia dell’arte. Often a conventionally attractive white woman, she shows off her aspirational life style via social-media channels. She accrues a large following, and then makes a living by getting companies to sponsor the content of her glamorous life. The cliché of the influencer emerged, during the twenty-tens, from multimedia-rich platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, where the goal was to forge as curated and polished an image as possible. Influencers were social-media users as celebrities, with much of the vanity and purposelessness that the comparison implies. By now, the connotations of being an influencer are mostly negative—edited selfies, vapid captions, faux relatability, staged private-jet photos, and unmarked sponsorships. Accordingly, social-media platforms are embracing a new buzzword as a successor: “creator.”“Creator” is a term with a more wholesome air, conjuring an Internet in which we are all artisanal blacksmiths plying our digital craft. But what, exactly, the word implies beyond that is up for debate. According to Taylor Lorenz’sreporting for, the term was originally marketed by YouTube, as early as 2011, as an alternative to vocabulary like “YouTube star,” which seemed to imply that only a few famous figures could succeed on the platform. But it’s now used to describe practically anyone who is producing any form of content online.TikTokusers are “TikTok creators.” Members of the invitation-only real-time voice-chat app Clubhouse are “audio creators.” OnlyFans, a marketplace mostly used for pornography, hosts “adult-content creators.”Even proponents of the so-called “creator economy,” the lattice of new platforms and tools meant to serve creators, can’t quite agree on what the term means or whom it includes. Its rise has sparked asemantic debatethat tends toward the solipsistic. “I think all influencers are creators; maybe not all creators are influencers,” Nicole Quinn, a partner at the venture-capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, told me. Lightspeed’s creator-economy investments include Cameo, a platform best known for custom video messages that celebrities sell to fans, and Outschool, a marketplace for online classes. For Quinn, the difference in terminology comes down to success: influencers are already famous; creators are striving to be. Li Jin, the founder of the creator-economy investment firm Atelier Ventures, instead defined creators in terms of revenue. “Anyone whose fame stems from online channels, if they are able to earn income through that influence, I consider that to be the creator economy.”Despite its vagueness, “creator” is being adopted as a byword for a new generation of social-media spaces purportedly designed to support content producers in new ways. Where the ad-driven platforms Facebook and Twitter profit from our data and attention without giving much back, the likes of Clubhouse and OnlyFans promise to deliver a larger share of value to users by allowing  for what Quinn, of Lightspeed, calls “direct monetization.” Instead of the company’s selling ads based on over-all engagement, creators can get paid by their individual viewers, who might buy subscriptions, send tips, or crowdfund new projects. The word “influencer” emphasized a person’s magnetic effect on her followers, a nebulous charisma easily turned toward marketing. “Creator,” by contrast, stresses that everyone posting on social media is producing something, pitching in to the collective effort of making user-generated platforms compelling and thus profitable. This idea has proved highly marketable: the creator economy hasreportedlyseen $1.3 billion in investment funding in 2021 thus far, nearly three times the funding it received in all of 2020.Creator-economy businesses have devised various revenue models as alternatives to advertising. Subscription-driven platforms like Patreon, Substack, and Buy Me a Coffee charge a percentage of users’ income in return for publishing and paywalling their content. Apps like Linktree, Beacons, and Feedlink offer a service that, for a monthly fee, expands the Web site links that sit in the bios of social-media accounts, directing fans to a creator’s various content channels. Marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (N.F.T.s), like Foundation, Rarible, and SuperRare, allow creators to sell expensive digital-art objects in exchange for commission fees. On Twitch, a site where users can live-stream content like video games, and Heygo, a streaming site that provides a virtual proxy for travel, viewers can access video streams for free, with the option to send tips to the hosts. According to Quinn, March of 2020 was the “key inflection point” for this burgeoning economy, as the increased appetite for digital content and the loss of jobs in other industries during thepandemicprompted more people to try their luck as creators.In some ways, the creator economy does appear to give more agency to the user. Rather than trying to game social-media algorithms, creators can theoretically rely on more dependable income from supporters. They can choose which kinds of work they take on, whether it be newsletters, livestreams, or audio chats. “They don’t have to care about fighting against the current of the platform,” Sam Yam, the co-founder of Patreon, a pioneer of the creator economy, said. In Yam’s mind, earning a living as a creator is an evolution of the so-called gig economy facilitated by companies like Uber and TaskRabbit. Followers are paying for access to someone’s unique talent or voice. “You care about the individual more than just the task that needs to be done,” Yam said. “It’s value exchanged for creativity.” The model promises a more human and less automated interaction. What were once called followers—the anonymous numbers racking up on a profile page like so many fungible eyeballs—are now customers, supporters, and patrons.But this emerging field, in many ways, resembles a gig economy for digital content. Participants are still precarious workers, relying on the whims of corporations for their livelihoods. Much like an Uber driver or a twenty-tens Instagram influencer, the creator is responsible for her own marketing, health care, and tax contributions. She makes money for the platform that hosts her without receiving the legal and financial protections of employee status, or the stock options typically given to the platform’s engineers, designers, and managers. Meanwhile, the social-media giants are developing their own version of the creator economy in an attempt to keep users from fleeing to newer, smaller platforms. Last year, TikTok launched a Creator Fund to pay its users directly for popular content. Snapchat launched a similar program called Spotlight, which offers creators millions of dollars of compensation a month. This past week, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced that it would pay out more than a billion dollars to users across its platforms by 2022.Anshuman Iddamsetty, a former podcast producer who now runs a Patreon focussed on erotic self-portraiture, and who uses the pronouns “they” and “them,” told me that they make an adequate living from that account and an OnlyFans page. But they said that there’s a gap between the platforms’ message that anyone can “build an independent creative career,” as Patreon’s Web site touts, and the reality of being a solo entrepreneur. “Patreon doesn’t suddenly, magically make the act of creating your deliverables easier,” they said. Ambiguous guidelines can give platforms the power to block users or types of content at will; Patreon does allow some forms of adult content, but Iddamsetty, who describes themself as a “fat erotic artist,” has run into unexpected barriers. Creator-economy hype is relevant “only if you’re a certain kind of creator with a certain kind of product,” they said.Even Yam, of Patreon, recognizes the limitations of the burgeoning field. He anticipates a future in which both the social-media giants and the creator-economy brands are avoidable altogether. Each creator will instead have her own custom-built platform, “their own world top to bottom,” from the underlying technology to the published content—an “ownership economy.” For the time being, though, the bulk of users will continue to rely on the preëstablished attention economy for the bulk of their digital consumption. “Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, those are just as dominant as ever,” Jin said. “Today, no one finds a person on Patreon; you go there after you’ve found them.” In other words, to be a creator, you still have to be an influencer after all.",1

Collectively, they’ll get $791 million from the richest man on Earth, although Bezos did not specify how much would go to each group.“I’ve spent the past several months learning from a group of incredibly smart people who’ve made it their life’s work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world,” Bezos said on Instagram. “I’m inspired by what they’re doing, and excited to help them scale.” The Amazon CEOannounced the creationof his personal $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund in February.Support for mainstream environmental groupsHis fund is equivalent to more than 7 percent of his net worth. It’s also10 times as muchas philanthropic foundations gave globally in 2018 to efforts to slow climate change. For his first round of funding, Bezos chose to back a handful of legacy organizations with an established history of advocacy on behalf of the planet. His choice in recipients so far signals support formainstream environmental groupsrallying for new policies and research on climate change.It’s also somewhat of a departure from contributions that Amazon and other giants have made recently to climate tech startups.Amazon,Microsoft, andStripe, in contrast to Bezos, have all pledged to funnel money toward developing brand-new technologies to reduce and capture their industries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Much ofthe first round of fundingfrom Amazon’s $2 billion climate fund will go toward getting more electric vehicles on the road and capturing carbon dioxide emissions, the company announced in September. Microsoftsaid in Januarythat it would spend $1 billion over four years on technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies is still in its infancyBut the carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies is still in its infancy. In contrast, some of the advocacy groups Bezos pledged to fund today have been fighting for environmental protections since close to the birth of the modern environmental movement in in the US in the 1960s. That includes the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which is led byGina McCarthy, an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency administrator and vocal critic of Trump’s environmental rollbacks. “This generous gift from the Bezos Earth Fund enables NRDC to move even faster on achieving the climate solutions we need at the federal, state and local levels to protect people’s health, strengthen nature’s ability to help fight climate change and grow the clean energy sector and all the jobs that come with it,” McCarthy said in astatement.Bezos also named the Environmental Defense Fund, which tends to take a more corporate-friendly approach to its advocacy. It’s worked with companies like Walmart and McDonald’s on their sustainability goals. “The needs are enormous,” Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp toldafter the Bezos fund was announced in February. “No matter what organization receives this funding, what’s important is that the money be put to work.” Krupp and McCarthy’s organizations will each receive $100 million, according to statements from each group.Some of the big green groups Bezos chose, however, have been beset by scandal lately. Human rights abuses came to light in a 2019investigationinto the nearly 60-year-old conservation charity World Wildlife Fund. The organization’s anti-poaching efforts supported paramilitary groups that captured, tortured, and killed villagers and indigenous peoples in Asia and Africa,BuzzFeedreported.Two more groups Bezos will fund have had recent shifts in leadership as part of a broader reckoning with systemic racism and sexism withinscience fieldsandenvironmentalism. The CEO of conservation group Nature Conservancy decided toleave his post in June 2019following allegations of gender discrimination within the organization. The president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, Ken Kimmell,said that he would step downat the end of the year. Kimmell’s decision follows the high-profile resignation of the organization’s former coalitions coordinator, Ruth Tyson,who penned a public lettersaying, “It was really stressful and traumatic for me working [at the Union of Concerned Scientists] and I hope no other Black people ever have to share this pain.” World Wildlife Fund and Nature Conservancy said they would each get $100 million from Bezos’ fund, while the Union of Concerned Scientists said it’s been given $15 million.Among the established organizations, Bezos also decided to fund a recently formed group that centers racial equity in its work, the NDN Collective. It was founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to fund and support indigenous-led movements and sustainability initiatives. Bezos will also fund the new Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, which was launched in 2019 with a focus on supporting women in the Southeast US. Bezos is funding research groups, too, like the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute and World Resources Institute.Bezos has so far avoided key activist groups that have been critical of him and AmazonBezos has so far avoided key activist groups that have been critical of him and Amazon, like the Sunrise Movement, which has spearheaded campaigns for a Green New Deal. “A reminder that Jeff Bezos has made over $48 Billion during the pandemic while over 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment. Imagine if he actually had to pay taxes and what that money could help fund,” Sunrise Movementtweeted in September.Still, Sunrise Movement hasn’t necessarily ruled out accepting funding from Bezos to promote its campaigns. “It’s better his extreme wealth sits with organizations like the Climate Justice Alliance and Sunrise than in some offshore tax haven,” Stephen O’Hanlon, Sunrise Movement communications director,said toin an email after the Bezos fund was announced in February.",1

He made an initial court appearance Friday.According to the U.S. attorney’s office for the Northern District of Texas, from 2015 to 2019 Duety was the fleet manager for Builders FirstSource — a Dallas-based Fortune 500 company that says it’s the country’s largest building materials supplier. That position gave him access to credit cards that were supposed to be used for expenses related to the company’s vehicle fleet.Instead, authorities allege, he and a relative used the cards to make personal purchases as well as to buy inventory for their candle businesses, including one named Steves the Man Candles.Read the crime and public safety news your neighbors are talking about.Or with:By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy PolicyDuety used the cards for nonexistent transactions that caused payment processors to put money in his or his relative’s bank accounts, according to the indictment.

California is suffering from drought, and farmers in the state's Central Valley are pumping more groundwater from their well to make up for a shortfall in water from the state's reservoirs.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionWell water is pumped into an irrigation system at a vineyard in Madera, California. California is suffering from drought, and farmers in the state's Central Valley are pumping more groundwater from their well to make up for a shortfall in water from the state's reservoirs.The next time you pick up some California-grown carrots or melons in the grocery store, consider the curious, contested odyssey of the water that fed them. Chances are, farmers pumped that water from underground aquifers on a scale that's become unsustainable, especially as the planet heats up.Facing an ongoing drought that is squeezing surface water supplies, farmers are extracting groundwater at higher rates to continue growing food as usual.California's farmers probably will pump an additional six to seven million acre-feet of water from their wells this year, above what they normally use, according toJosue Medellin-Azuara, a water expert at the University of California, Merced. That quantity would cover 10,000 square miles with a foot of water, and far exceeds the amount that naturally replenishes the aquifer, even during a year with normal rainfall.""It's a huge amount,""says Steve Jackson, a farmer in Visalia who helps to manage 40,000 acres of almonds and other crops. ""I'd say 90 to 95 percent of our crop demands this year are going to be met by groundwater.""This year, however, may mark the beginning of the end of California's great groundwater grab. The state is preparing to phase in new limits on groundwater pumping that will force painful adjustments on the state's farmers.California is a powerhouse of food production, growing some 40 percent of the country's fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Yet the production depends on a supply of water that's increasingly fragile and unreliable as the climate warms.""Drought reveals the lie of a place,"" says Mark Arax, the Fresno-based author of, a history of California's water conflicts. ""The lie is our ambition. We've taken on too much.""In good years, an intricate system of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation canals captures water from rivers and melting snow, much of it in the northern part of the state, and moves that water to fields in the wide Central Valley where most crops are grown. The system also supplies coastal cities, but agriculture remains the largest consumer of water.This year, rivers are running low. The state's biggest reservoirs containless than halfthe average amount of water, and farmers have been forced to rely on their wells. ""This year, there is no allotment, because there is no water,"" says Kathy Briano, referring to the amount of water that farmers are assigned for irrigation use. Briano grows almonds near the town of Porterville, and she's relying on her wells instead.Until now, groundwater use in California has been unrestricted. Farmers and cities could pump as much as they wished. And there was a time when that water source seemed inexhaustible.The Central Valley aquifer is like a giant, multi-layered lake beneath the ground. ""A hundred years ago, when you tapped a foot into the earth, in certain parts of the valley, the water would gush out,"" Arax says. At that time, wells typically only needed to be 50 or 80 feet deep.But year after year, towns and farmers --- but mostly farmers --- pumped more water out of the aquifer than nature put back in, and the water table fell. Today, farmers and towns are drilling wells over a thousand feet deep. Extracting so much water even changed the region's geology.""As you draw the water up and out of the earth, the earth itself then collapses and sinks,"" Arax says. ""We're not sinking by inches. We're sinking by feet.""Jerry Jones (R) and his son Brandon Jones (L) of Jones Construction and Excavation install a 2,500 gallon tank in front of the home of Loren Scott Denney after his well went dry on May 25, 2021 in Madera, California. Denney did not have running water for almost a month as he waited for the tank to be installed.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionBriano says the problems first became obvious during the drought of 2014-2015. ""Everybody was pumping,"" she says. ""You had to pump all that you needed, and you just brought that groundwater down to nothing.""On her ranch, the water table dropped by 60 feet. The well that supplied water to her house went dry. The same thing happened to hundreds of people who relied on shallow wells in the nearby town of East Porterville. ""People were without water, and they had to bring water tanks in. They had no water at all!"" she says.During that drought, there was growing pressure to enact limits on groundwater use. Susana De Anda, executive director of theCommunity Water Center, in the town of Visalia, was among those pushing for change. ""When 90 percent of our valley residents rely on groundwater, we have to be sure that we're sharing that for all beneficial uses,"" she says. ""That means that we should not over-pump.""In 2014, California passed theSustainable Groundwater Management Act(SGMA). It requires big changes, but they will be enforced only gradually, over the next two decades.Under this law, overuse of the aquifer must end by 2040. By that date, use and replenishment of the state's groundwater must be in balance.State and local officials now are coming up with limits on groundwater use to achieve this. In practice, it could mean that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which occupies a large area of the Central Valley between Sacramento and Bakersfield, will have to cut their groundwater pumping by 70 or 80 percent by 2040, compared to what they're using this year.In order to enforce these limits, some authorities are requiring meters on wells. Others are monitoring water use through satellites that can detect which crops are being grown.The reaction among farmers has been mixed. Some, like Steve Jackson, agree that limits are necessary, even though groundwater has kept his farm alive in drought years. ""It is a lifeline, but I think that it's a lifeline that we've all taken for granted, and it's not infinite,""he says. ""I think that's what's coming home to all of us.""The limits probably will mean that some land will no longer grow crops, although there's dispute about how much. One study, backed by the agricultural industry,predictsthat a million acres, or 20 percent of the fields in the San Joaquin Valley, will be taken out of production. Other researchersthinkit will be half that much. Farmers are likely to adapt by shifting their limited water supplies to their most valuable crops. They also will be able, for the first time, to buy and sell groundwater allotments, shifting the water to the places where it's worth the most.Other farmers, like Kathy Briano, reject the prospect of idling fertile Central Valley land. Briano agrees that it makes sense to protect the aquifer. But to make up for it, she wants the state to deliver more water from dams and reservoirs, to which she says the farms are entitled. ""My solution is, you need to bring us more water,"" she says. ""We can't keep taking from the valley, because we're taking away [food] production, and where can we grow everything? Right here!""Mark Arax, the writer, says the changing climate is likely to breed more conflicts like this, also in other parts of the country. ""How we deal with this becomes an example for the rest of America, when it comes to their doorstep,"" he says.The California dream was born in the Gold Rush, claiming nature and re-shaping the land. Now, Arax says, it's time to re-invent that dream.",2

The Chinese drone giant was named to the blacklist on Friday for “enabl[ing] wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance” — most likely a reference to how DJI provideddrones and other technology to the Chinese government to be used in its Muslim detention camps in the Xinjiang province.“DJI is disappointed in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision. Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally,” the company said in a statement to. “DJI remains committed to developing the industry’s most innovative products that define our company and benefit the world.”The company declined to provide any more information about what it thinks will happen as a result of being named to the Entity List. Being on the list typically means US companies are banned from exporting technology to blacklisted companies. DJI not only sells products to consumers, but since it is far and away the market leader, its technology is used by all sorts of companies that need drones or handheld cameras.This is not the first time that access to Chinese drones has been targeted by the US government, usually due to security concerns. The Department of Justicebannedthe buying of foreign-made drones with agency funds in October, and the Department of the Interior said it wouldground its drone fleetwhile it looks into claims of spying and cyberattacks. DJI has pushed back against many of these actions, saying accusations of national security transgressions are unfounded.",1
142,Hollywood’s Other Foreign Censor: Saudi Arabia,8.67,33.67,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/hollywoods-other-foreign-censor-saudi-arabia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,theamericanconservative,25,"China and Saudi Arabia have outsized influence in Hollywood today. Money from their repressive governments is influencing American culture, including our films, and thus our representation around the world. It is also leading to widespread censorship, against our cherished freedom of expression. America must regain the pen of our cultural narrative.Culture, including film, is a valuable tool in the international relations theory of“soft power,”or the ability of a country to persuade others to do what it wants without force or coercion. The film industry is a highly profitable one,valued at over $2 trillionin 2019 box office revenue alone, and it wields significant international influence.I grew up as an American expatriate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens have a dichotomous attitude towards Americans: They disdain our economic influence, yet they yearn for our freedom of expression. They consume American films in spite of the rampant censorship in their Kingdom.This attitude towards Americans is currently shared by China: Americans are a necessary evil for economic development, and pose an ideological threat to their dictatorship. However, China has intentionally circumvented Hollywood’s influence over their population by strategically producing propaganda. The Chinese government censors every film shown in their country, from the top of the production chain: They manipulate the representation of the United States itself—not only in their own films, but in ours.American film companies increasingly cater to Chinese government ideology, including the American cultural icon Disney. In the credits of Disney’sMulan, Disney gave special thanks to several government entities in Xinjiang, China, whichoperate internment campsthat contain over a million members of the country’s Uyghur minority. Former U.S. Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr said, “Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.”This year, Chinese director Chloe Zhao’sNomadlandswept up the Best Film and Best Director categories at the Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and the Academy Awards. Chloe Zhao is the daughter of a Beijing steel magnate and People’s Liberation Army doctor, and two of her prior award-winning, American produced films (Songs My Brother Taught Me,The Rider) depict contemporary cowboys and Indians in the United States. The protagonists of the films are not traditional heroes; they struggle in criminal worlds only to give up on their dreams. In a similar vein,Nomadlandis set in an American city called Empire, and tells the story of an impoverished nomad who searches for employment, in veiled criticism of one of the largest American companies in the world, Amazon. Zhao’s next project, the Disney/Marvel film,Eternals,depicts the reunion of an immortal race, after being in hiding for thousands of years, to protect Earth from the “Deviants.” According to these films, America is a world where you cannot fulfill your dreams; you can only fulfill Amazon—and to deviate from the norm will result in inevitable defeat.How did this happen, and how can America regain our cultural narrative?Money plays a significant role in American culture, a culture built upon a capitalist market economy that encourages competition and innovation. But the freedom of expression Americans fought for when we established the United States is paramount. The tension between these two priorities since 9/11 and subsequent economic recessions have led to short-sighted, profit-driven decision-making by American leadership, in both the private and public sectors.The American-Saudi partnership has been fraught with controversy and contradiction since the 9/11 attacks, which culminated in a 2016 Congressional vote to allow 9/11 familiesto sue the countryfor its alleged links to the attackers. Yet in 2017, the Trump administrationsigned a $350 billion arms dealwith the Saudi government. According to the U.S. Department of State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is currently the United States’slargest foreign military sales customerand one of our largest trading partners in the Middle East.The Kingdom is also taking notes from China. “They’re the new Chinese,”stated one Hollywood insidertoForbesin 2018. Following Saudi King Salman’s decision to lift a 35-year cinema ban, AMC Theaters declared intent to open up to 100 cinemas in Saudi Arabia by 2030. In 2020, the Kingdom invested about$500 million worth of sharesin Disney. Penske Media (co-owner of theHollywood Reporter) took a$200 million investmentfrom the Saudis. Netflix announced an eight-picture deal they would finance through a Saudi production company. Like the Chinese, the Saudis have a strategy to buy their way into Hollywood, and also like China, the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM) administers censorship—screening for what it deems to be inappropriate content.In 2019, Netflix pulled comedian Hasan Minhaj’s “Patriot Act” episode on Saudi Arabia and Khashoggi after Saudi officials claimed that it violated the Kingdom’s cybercrime law. Thereis no evidenceNetflix tried to challenge the ruling or asked Saudi Arabia to explain how the episode was a threat to public order.The Saudi government’s brutal assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 sent an anti-American message to the world: Do not stand up for freedom of expression. Brian Fogel’s filmThe Dissidentmeticulously documented the Saudi murder of Khashoggi, who was employed by theWashington Post.The Dissidentwas blacklisted in Hollywood. Fogelstated in an interviewthat “there was a unified front among the major global media companies, distributors, that they were not going to touch this film.”“What I observed was that the desire for corporate profits have left the integrity of America’s film culture weakened,”said Thor Halvorssen, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Human Rights Foundation, who financedThe Dissidentand served as a producer.Meanwhile, China has steadily accumulated U.S. Treasury securities since 9/11. As of February 2021, China owns $1.104 trillion, or about 4%, of the $28 trillion U.S. national debt, which is more thanany other foreign countryexcept Japan. It is also the world’s largest country by population, and ispredicted to overtake the U.S.as the top box office market. A 2013Rolling Stonearticleobserved: “The hardball negotiators of Hollywood were willing to roll over, in terms of finance and even content, in return for access to the world’s largest overseas moviegoing audience.”Disney is one of the biggest winners in China: The proud owner ofMarvelStudios sat on more than $1 billion from the country’s box office in 2019. The version ofIron Man 3released in Chinafeatured added footagewith Chinese product placements and Chinese characters saving Iron Man. Marvel’s 2016 superhero filmDr. Strangechanged the appearance of a major Tibetan character for fear of jeopardizing the movie’s success in China. American film studios, including Disney, alsoinvite Chinese government regulatorson film sets to advise “on how to avoid tripping the censors’ wires.”Prioritizing profit over freedom of expression has diluted the perception of American culture and weakened our international influence. As Frances Stonor Saunders detailed in her book,The Cultural Cold War, the most vocal exponents of intellectual freedom during the Cold War were instruments of American culture, and cultural efforts to win hearts and minds continue to be relevant today. However, a key difference between the Cultural Cold War of the mid-20th century versus today is the ability of other governments to finance cultural influence. The Russian Soviet Union could not compete with the American entertainment industry; China can.The Chinese government understands that culture stands upstream from policy and from politics, impacting the population. According to Matthias Niedenführ, vice director of the China Center in Tübingen, Germany,Chinese government censorsdo not want to see Chinese people portrayed as villains, and they do not want to see American powers portrayed as heroes. Hollywood is “often gleefully willing to speak truth to American political power” yet it takes the opposite approach tothe Chinese government, which monitors their population with drones,AI-powered CCTVcameras, andsystemic censorship.The Chinese government wants to maintain a relationship with Hollywood, which remains the most potent force for global storytelling—a power their government envies. The free speech nonprofit PEN America issued a 94-page report in 2020 titled, “Made in Hollywood, Censored by Beijing: The US Film Industry and Chinese Government Influence,” which recommends the following:The report concludes American decision-makers have a moral imperative to stand for freedom of expression, to resist the gradual encroachment of any government that attempts to dictate what stories may be told. Journalists covering Hollywood ought to be writing about this, and those who value freedom of expression should pay attention to its muzzling.As Americans, we have a responsibility for the evolution of our culture and representation in the world. We cannot allow the liberty we fought for when we established the United States of America to be sold: The freedom of expression is more valuable than money.Evin Ashley Erdoğduis an author, artist, and analyst.

Duff decided to get tested for COVID-19. He wasn’t feeling great and his two-year-old son was running a fever.“My symptoms were being extremely tired, some body aches and feeling very warm,” said Duff, who is 39 and serves on the Rocky Hill town council. “I’ve been working from home, social distancing and wearing a mask out in public, so I didn’t think I was likely to have COVID, but I wanted to rule it out and make sure, especially because we have a toddler and an infant.”The testing process, conducted at a CVS Minute Clinic in Rocky Hill, took a total of 30 minutes. Duff’s wait for the results took eight days.Across the state and the nation, wait times for some COVID-19 test results are stretching to a week or longer.Timely results are key to containing the spread of the virus, public health officials say. The longer a person is unaware of a positive test, the more time they have to infect others and lengthy delays can hamper contact tracing and other efforts to control outbreaks.“Five days is an eternity in COVID time,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday. “You don’t know what’s happened…in the five days it’s taking you to get that response.”In addition to causing stress and disruption for individuals, experts fear the rising backlog of test kits could jeopardize efforts to control the virus and reopen society.“We are concerned that the national demand for testing is causing longer wait times for test results,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of the state Department of Public Health.“Anyone that has a known exposure to a COVID-positive individual or who has symptoms should be in self-quarantine until they have a negative test result,” Gifford said. “That’s how were going to contain the spread of this virus…people [should] remain isolated from others if there’s a chance they may be infected. It’s very important…as inconvenient as we understand that is, that individuals remain in quarantine.”The wait for test results has grown longer in recent weeks, with national labs processing a spike in samples from Arizona, Texas, California and other hot spots.CVS Health attributed the “extremely high demand for tests” to rising caseloads in much of the nation.“This has caused backlogs for our lab partners and is delaying their processing of patient samples,” said Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for CVS Health. “Currently, due to these factors, it may take 6-10 days for people to receive their results and, in some instances, our lab partners may take even longer to return results. Our lab partners are working hard to address this issue.”With schools and businesses looking to reopen, demand for testing could swell even more, putting additional pressure on an already overburdened system, officials say.Early in the pandemic, Connecticut contracted with several in-state laboratories, which agreed to process a certain number of tests and to turn around results as quickly as possible.In most cases, the in-state diagnostic centers are reporting results within 24 hours, said Josh Geballe, Gov. Lamont’s chief operating officer.The state is currently in discussions with some of those facilities to take on additional capacity to help compensate for the backlog at the national laboratories.“We’re working as much as we can with our local labs and…there we’re getting a quick turnaround, 24 hours or less,” Lamont said. “We’re doing as much as we can to move all the testing analysis right here in the state of Connecticut and we’re not going to have that wait.”Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation’s largest labs, said it is trying to address the backlog. “At Quest Diagnostics, we are doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing to patients at this critical time,” the company said in a statement.Last week, the Federal Food and Drug Administration allowed Quest to pool its samples. Under this scenario, four samples can be tested at once; if the results are negative, all of those individuals are COVID-free. If it’s positive, the four samples are separated and tested individually to determine which is infected.Even as steps are taken to speed up the process, some state residents continue to face long waits for results.John Silver went to a mobile testing site in New Britain on July 9 for a COVID-19 test. He and his wife had several trips planned and wanted to make sure they weren’t infected before they set off.His results arrived nine days later, on July 18, and his wife’s arrived on July 20; both were negative.Although they had no symptoms and no reason to suspect they were sick, they isolated for the first two days following the test.“But nine days?” said Silver, who is 43 and lives in Farmington. “Just too much time.”Christopher Duff’s test was also negative.“Everyone’s symptoms lifted before we got results back,” he said, “although I was still concerned I could have it and be asymptomatic.”After eight days of waiting, “it was a relief,” he added.",2
145,Homeless encampment grows on Apple property in Silicon Valley,0.0,44.67,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/10/homeless-encampment-grows-on-apple-property-in-silicon-valley/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-10,mercurynews,17,"Apple promised to help quell the Bay Area’s homelessness crisis with a series of big-ticket investments, but the tech giant soon may have to get more directly involved — addressing a problem that has spread to the company’s front door.A large homeless encampment is growing on the site Apple earmarked for its North San Jose campus, two years after Apple made waves with a$2.5 billion pledgeto combat the Bay Area’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis.What started as a few RVs parked on the side of Component Drive has grown over the past year into a sprawling camp of dozens of people, a maze of broken-down vehicles and a massive amount of trash scattered across the vacant, Apple-owned property. People with nowhere else to go live there in tents, RVs and wooden structures they built themselves. At least two children call the camp home.Apple is trying to figure out what to do, but it’s a tough situation. Clearing the camp likely will be difficult both logistically — it’s more challenging to remove structures and vehicles that don’t run than tents — and ethically — there are few places for the displaced residents to go.“There are approximately 30-35 unhoused people living in the area with an estimated 200 tons of hazardous trash and debris on the private property, making this a complicated and challenging situation,” Daniel Lazo, spokesman for the city of San Jose’s department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services, wrote in an email. “There are also an estimated 65-75 operable and inoperable vehicles at the site.”Residents of the camp say there may be as many as 75 people living there.Apple is “in talks with the city on a solution,” company spokeswoman Chloe Sanchez Sweet wrote in an email, without providing additional details.The number of people living without homes in the region has grown dramatically in recent years — it’s estimated there are about 30,000 homeless people in the five-county Bay Area. The crisis has become even more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cities cut back on clearing encampments, allowing unhoused people to shelter in place and camps to grow and become more entrenched.As the problem intensifies, local tech companies — some of the region’s main generators of jobs and wealth — have feltmounting pressureto intervene.GoogleandFacebookeach pledged $1 billion to fight the housing shortage and homelessness in 2019, andApplefollowed by committing $2.5 billion.The vacant land off Component Drive figured into Apple’s $2.5 billion commitment.  Apple originally bought the land in apush to acquire real estate in North San Josefor a new tech campus, but so far, the company hasn’t done much to develop it. In 2019, the tech company promised to make $300 million of land it owns in San Jose available for new affordable housing — including a portion of the Component Drive property.But it’s unclear when anything might be built.For Tigs Smith, who has been living on Apple’s land for the past year, the tech company’s promises mean little when they do nothing to help her or her neighbors. Smith, a 40-year-old construction worker, lives in a tiny, one-room house she built herself on the Component Drive property — where she landed after her ex-boyfriend kicked her out of the home they shared.

146,Tucker Carlson Raises a Very Serious Alarm Bell About Ashli Babbitt's Murder and the Enemy Within,21.67,22.0,https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2021/06/16/tucker-carlson-raises-a-very-serious-alarm-bell-about-ashli-babbitts-murder-and-the-enemy-within-n397591,https://adfontesmedia.com/redstate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,redstate,21,"President Joe Biden was sworn in on January 20, but it’s January 6 that stands out in the minds of many that truly marks the beginning of the Biden era. Yes, Trump was still technically president but we’re still waiting on answers that we have yet to get about what happened that day. The Biden administration seems to have no interest in releasing information about it, but the more private entities look into the matter, the more oddities arise.One, in particular, is the murder of Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was part of the riot within the Capitol and was shot while unarmed. At the time of this writing, we still have no idea who it is that shot her or why he decided to fire on her in particular. It’s just one of the many questions the Biden administration is actively not giving us answers to.Aspreviously covered by Nick Arama, Fox News host Tucker Carlson had a very solid point to make about this fact and one that he’s actively being mocked for bringing up, which should worry you even more.Carlson began by discussing how the Biden administration has declared that the largest threat to America isn’t China, Russia, Iran, our porous southern border, or even leftist extremists attempting to defund the police and burn our neighborhoods down. No, they say that it’s white supremacist as said by Attorney General Merrick Garland.It’s a very nebulous term. Who are these white supremacist radicals? Why won’t the Biden administration name names? For some reason, the administration is withholding that information, but it’s likely that they don’t know either. What they do know is that it’s a good narrative crop to harvest thanks to the January 6 riot at the capitol, a riot the left continues totry to call an “insurrection.”With this event in place, they can now create white supremacist boogiemen that can take the form of any person they need it to, including you.It also allows them to come up with solutions that sound just as nebulous to the public but gives them the freedom to do whatever they want. “We must adopt a broader societal response to tackle the problem’s deeper roots,” said Garland somewhat ominously.As Carlson points out, this is a scary thought as it marks a change in the way the government treats its citizens, specifically ones that don’t agree with the administration. A government can arrest and imprison or even kill a citizen, like Babbitt with no accountability or explanation as Carlson points out:Who did shoot Ashli Babbitt? Why don’t we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That’s OK now? No, it’s not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protesters still in prison on trespassing charges, while so many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What’s the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call it scary. We’d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator.And speaking ofJanuary 6th, why are there still so many things, basic factual matters, we don’t know about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration hiding more than 10,000 hours of surveillance tape from the U.S. Capitol? What could possibly be the reason for that? Even as they call for more openness. We need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those tapes today, but they’re not. Why?#ThreadMust Watch Tucker Carlson Segment On Revolver News's Piece About January 6th: Unindicted Co-Conspirators In January 6th Cases Raise Disturbing Questions Of Federal Foreknowledgepic.twitter.com/wzxwsPU0dE— The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle)June 16, 2021Carlson goes on to make a much deeper point about the possible involvement of the FBI in the January 6 riot, which is another article, but for the moment, focusing on this one fact is something we as a country really need to do.Was Babbitt wrong to storm the Capitol? Sure. Did she deserve to die for it?If the footage of her shooting is any indication, then no. She was unarmed and while she was attempting to advance into the Capitol she could have easily been detained or pushed back by authorities as they had been doing in other places. Instead, she was shot, and regardless of the apparent reason, no matter how obvious, when an American is shot on American soil by American agents an investigation is warranted and answers need to be given to the American people.Why is the government withholding that info? Moreover, what makes them think they can withhold it? What gives them the gumption to believe they don’t owe us answers? Are we now living in a country where killing citizens is just something our government can do if they’re protesting at the wrong place and at the wrong time? Do they not feel like they need to justify it?Meanwhile, as Carlson points out, why do the people who tout their narrative get to roam free despite the damage they do all over the country, including the Capitol city? Why not point out the fact that there were many racial supremacists in those riots that lean toward the black race? Why can they burn, loot, and assault with slaps on the wrist?There are far more victims of the Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots than there were victims of the Capitol riot. Is the fear and inconvenience politicians experienced far more egregious than the actual loss of livelihood and even life that American citizens experienced at the hands of leftist riots? Why do we need to know the most minute detail about officers who shoot black people but get absolute obscurity when they shoot someone from a different crowd?It’s questions we need to ask and definitely questions the Biden administration needs to answer. In fact, they need to have these answers ready before we ask them. Yet, they’re not providing answers. What they’re providing are narratives and reasons to dissuade from asking questions. “This was a white supremacist riot” they repeat ad nauseum with little to no proof that it was, making questioning their narrative a defense of white supremacists. No nuance. No context.No questions.Our government has gotten too full of itself. It sees itself above us. It kills us and tells us questioning why makes us morally bankrupt. They think their own accountability isn’t necessary and if you vote them out they’ll spend ungodly amounts of time and resources attempting to correct your mistake with lies that allow for excuses for the impeachment of not only a man but also your vote.Our government is out of control. We’re losing the Republic we were advised to keep and the unanswered for murder of Ashli Babbitt is a strong indicator of how far we’ve fallen from it.",0
147,An uncomfortable $15 minimum wage column,4.0,38.67,https://www.al.com/opinion/2021/02/an-uncomfortable-15-minimum-wage-column.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,al,24,"President Joe Biden is pushing to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of another COVID-19 relief package. Republicans have sounded the alarm, and Democrats don’t see why their political counterparts refuse to see the wage hike as an unmitigated good. Like most policy issues, it’s more complicated than the partisan spin makes it sound.The wage hike will not result in $38 burritos at Taco Bell. The restaurant chain confirmed as much to Politifact, “At our company-owned restaurants in New York City, where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, our Bean Burrito is $1.89 plus tax and Crunchwrap Supreme is $4.49 plus tax.” Rest easy. Mandatory wage increases do not necessarily result in massively expensive heartburn delivery mechanisms.The minimum wage does have a practical impact on hiring decisions. It is the lowest entry point to engage labor. If an employer needs someone to sweep and mop the floors, it might be worth hiring someone at $7.25 an hour for the task. At $15 dollars an hour, the manager might allocate the task across several existing employees and not hire anyone. Their workload goes up, but it’s not clear that pay would follow, especially if those workers are already above the minimum wage threshold. That may not be a problem for a large retailer like Amazon that already pays higher wages, but it definitely forces tough choices for smaller employers.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) hasstudiedvarious minimum wage proposals, and both Democrats and Republicans like to cherry pick the information that fits their respective narratives. Yes, the CBO does find that “1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless” under a $15 minimum wage. It also concludes “the $15 option would increase the wages of 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour.” The report determines that overall family income would slightly decrease.It’s almost as if economic realities don’t respond conveniently to political narratives.Hiking the minimum wage does mean higher pay for millions of workers, but it also means that up to 3.7 million (the CBO’s high-end estimate) might lose their jobs. That’s the real tradeoff we’re talking about. Supporters of a higher minimum wage should stop acting like it’s an unmitigated good, and opponents ought to be honest that it would absolutely increase incomes for some lower-income workers.But what about the machines?We’ve all seen the memes of various automated ordering kiosks being the “new” $15 minimum wage employee. Saavy businesses will always look for more efficient operational choices, but that doesn’t always hurt workers. A 2017 McKinsey & Company study found, “employment and productivity both grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and 100 percent of rolling 10-year periods since 1960.” In other words, technological advances across American history haven’t meant fewer jobs. Amazon’s Alexa is nice, but she can’t fill the shoes of the average Chick-fil-A employee with a smile on her face.While the minimum wage is billed as an effort to address poverty, income inequality is the real problem. According to CBO, average household income after federal taxes and means-tested federal program transfers was $35,900 for the lowest 20% and $229,700 for the highest. That’s a big difference, and it expands rapidly towards the opposing ends of the income spectrum.It might seem strange for a conservative to discuss income inequality, but it’s essential to protect a free marketplace. Absolute wage equality would remove powerful incentives to work hard and take economic risks, but being mindful about corporate income distribution is smart politics. Members of Congress who champion free markets should encourage. When companies take care of their workers in terms of benefits and do what they can to increase take home pay, workers thrive, their families are better off, and the average worker has an incentive to defend an employer against government encroachment.Progressives tend to take a more skeptical view that corporations will almost always prioritize shareholders over employees. When businesses don’t focus sufficiently on workers, their lives are more difficult. When laborers see the handful of folks at the top of the organization chart with fat pockets, politicians have a far easier time promoting themselves as champions of the little guy with a government cudgel.Thinking of the minimum wage in that context puts some options on the table. If the pain point is mostly for small businesses, why not offset the minimum wage increase with a corresponding tax reduction for the entities most economically harmed by it? If the logic is that the increase makes lower-income Americans less reliant on government social services, it’s a tradeoff that might make sense. Better yet, simplify and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and let most average families keep more of the money they already earn.The uncomfortable reality is that increasing the minimum wage to $15 isn’t as impactful at creating entry-level jobs, moving people out of poverty, or helping families thrive as we’d like it to be. If we want to make real progress on those issues, we must expect more from our elected employees in Congress who make a lot more than the bare minimum.Cameron Smith is CEO of the Triptych Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat. “This failure may have led to millions of dollars in FinTech-facilitated PPP loans being made to fraudulent, non-existent, or otherwise ineligible businesses.”The subcommittee’s letters to the targets of its investigation cited stories published by Bloomberg, the Miami Herald, the Project on Government Oversight and ProPublica that found fintech companies account for an outsized amount of the fraud that has plagued the PPP from its inception.Last week, ProPublicarevealedthat Kabbage processed 378 loans collectively worth $7 million to single-person businesses that don’t appear in corporation records of their respective states. The overwhelming majority identified themselves as farms, typically registered to residential addresses with no discernable agricultural activity.“The illegitimacy of these purported farms — including potato fields in Florida and orange groves in Minnesota — would have been obvious if even the bare minimum of due diligence had been conducted on the loan applications,” the subcommitteewrote in its letter to Kabbage, which was acquired by American Express last fall.The letter demands a long list of documents, including any records of potential fraudulent activity on the platform, documents describing what resources were devoted to fraud detection, and descriptions of how the company recruited PPP applicants and how it incentivized loan reviewers to process more applications.Read MoreThose questions mostly implicate Kabbage’s conduct before it became part of American Express, which did not acquire Kabbage’s loan portfolio or its servicing arm, which are now incorporated into a separate company. The new company, called K Servicing, continued to process new PPP applications as well as close out those from the first round.Kabbage is alsoreportedlyunder investigation by the Department of Justice over how it calculated PPP loan amounts.A spokesperson for American Express, who had earlier said that Kabbage complied with all required fraud protocols and reported suspicious loans to SBA, referred questions to K Servicing.

149,When I first met Rush Limbaugh,20.17,25.0,https://www.wnd.com/2020/02/first-met-rush-limbaugh/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wnd-bias-and-reliability/,2020-02-10,wnd,23,"When my wife, Gena, and I heard that Rush Limbaugh revealed this past week that he hadstage 4 lung cancer,we were stunned like millions of others across the nation.Very few people on the planet need no introduction. Even fewer are known by just their first name. But that's him: ""Rush.""Despite Rush's advanced cancer, the left and mainstream media can do nothing but continue to slam the man, even when he's down. Many have been downright cruel at times since his breaking health news.Advertisement - story continues belowOne Milwaukee public school teacher posted on social media that he thought it was""awesome""that Rush had cancer and that he hoped he would die a painful death.Even formervice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Bidenjoined the march to degrade, demean and deride the radio giant when Biden said from the campaign trail: ""Rush Limbaugh spent his entire time on the air dividing people, belittling people, talking about blacks in ways that … anyways.""11 things desperate Dems are willing to do to beat TrumpReally? That's how Biden would summarize Rush's proliferating contributions and impact on society?Then Biden finished by saying, ""I don't think he understands the American code of decency and honor."" That coming from a politician who just denigrated a broadcasting mogul who has 10 times his popularity and influence and has just been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer? Is that Biden's idea of an ""American code of decency and honor""?Advertisement - story continues belowTrue decency and honor were demonstrated in the fitting tribute President Trump and first lady Melania Trump gifted Rush at his State of the Union speech this past week by awarding him with the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, or PMF.For those who don't know, the PMF is awarded to those who have ""made exceptional contributions to the security or national interests of America, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,"" according to the White House website.According toBusiness Insider,Trump has awarded 14 other PMFs, including to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Babe Ruth and Tiger Woods.It's fascinating to note that, in 2017, Joe Biden himself was awarded the PMFby former President Barack Obama.Obama lauded Biden as ""the best vice president America's ever had"" and a ""lion of American history."" So, Biden is worthy yet Rush unworthy to receive the PMF?Republican lawmakers declared their answer to that question by giving Rush a standing ovation while Democratic lawmakers remained seated and stunned as if Trump just awarded the Medal of Freedom to an ISIS imam. Again, how tacky would those Democrats' reactions be to any PMF recipient, let alone a ginormous American patriot like Rush?Advertisement - story continues belowIn his State of the Union speech, the president described Rush as ""a special man, beloved by millions of Americans … the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet."" (I would increase that number to hundreds of millions of Americans since making history by launching his national radio show on Aug. 1, 1988, when he pioneered political talk radio on AM channels.)Rush has inspired the full gamut of Americans for over 30 years, including millennials (A must read is Nicole Russell's article at the Federalist:""How Rush Limbaugh Made Millennials Like Me Conservative."") His daily radio show averages a listening audience of 27 million people.Regarding Rush's landmark pioneering in radio broadcasting, theWashington Postexplained:Limbaugh remade all the rules of talk radio. Before him, the norm in talk radio, in the major markets where it existed, was local hosts who rarely aired their views, and whose programs centered around interviews and interesting callers, on a full range of topics. Limbaugh changed that, demonstrating that a market existed for edgy, boundary pushing, nationally syndicated talk that centered around the host's opinion.Advertisement - story continues belowWithin a few years Limbaugh had shot to superstardom, broadcasting on hundreds of stations and reaching millions of listeners per week. Restaurants even launched ""Rush rooms"" in the early 1990s, where people could come eat lunch and hear their favorite show.Limbaugh's success catalyzed a series of decisions by radio executives that, over the next decade, not only led to an explosion of talk radio, but conservative radio, with most talk stations broadcasting all conservative, mostly syndicated, political talk formats by the early 2000s. …This model soon expanded to television, as it directly shaped Fox News. By the late 2000s, it also extended to conservative digital sites like Red State, Breitbart and Townhall, which would explode in number in the 2010s.Speaking of Fox News, Gena and I first met Rush at the home of Roger Ailes, the former CEO for Fox News. In person, Rush is down to earth and a no-nonsense type of guy who you can't help but love and like. Just a single minute after beginning to converse with him you are convinced that this man cares for you and everyone else in addition to the fact that he's a genius. He might flare with showmanship on air, but let there be no doubt he has and does contribute more to the preservation of the American republic than just about anyone.Advertisement - story continues belowGena and I not only commend Rush as a recipient of the PMF for his three decades of continual ""excellence in broadcasting."" Even more, we also join his beloved wife,Kathryn,and millions across this country in praying that God's hand would work through medical technology and advances to heal Rush.Rush, if you're reading this, Gena and I have always been and will always be your fans. Thanks for always fighting the good fight of faith as well as truth, justice and the American way. Now, it's time to turn all that energy and harness it to fight for your own health and life. We'll be supporting and praying for you all the way.And as far as your own attitude, we know you will practice what you've preached: ""Try to always stay focused on the objectives that are possible and the positive – and on having fun outside of the stuff that's going on in Washington.""",0

Unfortunately, he seems to have hit quite the roadblock in the form of Judge John Cooper of Tallahasse. Earlier on Friday, the activist judgestruck downthe mask mandate ban the Governor has been trying to enforce, saying that they are “arbitrary” and that children lack “legal authority”. Correspondents will surely wait with baited breath to see if Judge Cooper will say the same thing regarding “legal authority” when it comes to lowering the voting age to 16 or lower.“I conclude that this evidence demonstrates that facemask policies that follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance are, at this point in time, reasonable and consistent with the best scientific and medical and public opinion guidance at this time,” Cooper wrote. “I am enforcing the bill passed by the Legislature and requiring that anyone who uses that bill has to follow all of the provisions, not some of the provisions.”And since the CDC is as infallible as the Pope, it would seem logical that the CDC with itsstellar track recordbe the bellwether with which judicial decisions should be made for the country’s third most populous state.Governor DeSantis’ primary motivation for this legislative effort was not only to provide parents the authority and autonomy needed to make informed and uncoerced medical decisions for their children, but to also push back on the emerging medical tyranny that has metasticized over the last year and a half, which seems to be the globalist’s latest and most fashionable attempt to claw away humanity’s freedom and dignity.It would also appear that many Republicans in Florida’s State Legislature are content with the trends in the Sunshine State and the rest of the country. One major exception appears to be State Legislator and Congressional hopeful Anthony Sabatini, who has on multiple occasions and venuescalled outwhat he considers the RINO leadership in the GOP at all levels of government.With the uniparty establishment taking greater pains to maintain their entrenched positions, it would appear that Republican politicians will continue to diverge in their actions, with more establishment types helping with maintaining the status quo and America First nationalists working harder and smarter than ever to overturn what they perceive to be the rot in all levels of government. The question of who will succeed will certainly be answered by time either way.Share:",0
151,Condo Buildings Are at Risk. So Is All Real Estate.,0.0,40.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/surfside-tower-was-just-another-condo-building/619348/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,theatlantic,25,"The disaster in Surfside, Florida, focuses attention on condominiums’ flaws, but all forms of property ownership carry the potential for ugly surprises.After most ofa condominium tower in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last week, the second-guessing began almost immediately. Some residents accused the building’s condominium association of acting too slowly to address known structural flaws identified in a 2018 engineering report. Recent news stories have emphasized dissension among the owners. As someone who studies condos—their history, architecture, politics, and social dynamics, in Florida and all over the United States—I, too, have been wondering whether the building’s divided ownership contributed to the June 24 catastrophe, which killed at least 18 people and left more than 140 missing. Could a single landlord have responded better to engineers’ and occupants’ concerns than an association of 136 homeowners?Condos have long been big business and a way of life in southeast Florida, which by the 1970s had become America’s center of condo living. Today roughly one in five homeowners in U.S. cities and suburbs lives in a multifamily complex rather than a single-family house, according to U.S. census figures; in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, that share rises to one in three. Surfside residents described Champlain Towers South as a genuine community: “There was a beautiful mixture of cultures and people in that building,”one local toldl. “People from South America, Cuban Jews, American Jews, American nationals.”In most ways, the tower in Surfside was no different from Florida’s thousands of other high-rise condo buildings. Those, meanwhile, face many of the same risks—most notably their proximity to the ocean during a time of sea-level rise—as single-owner apartment buildings and other concrete-and-steel properties along the Florida coast. A number of reports suggest that the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association functioned properly and had moved methodically,albeit amid considerable resistance, to figure out how to fix the problems that an engineer had identified.Investigators still have much to learn about the causes of the disaster. Thevagaries of the condo format, including the need to raise $15 million for repairs through a “special assessment” on the owners, might conceivably have slowed the building’s response to structural problems. Absentee ownership, common in many condo buildings, especially in resorts and cosmopolitan business centers, might have hindered repairs further.Derek Thompson: Why Manhattan’s skyscrapers are emptyAnd yet the collapse might also have been caused by other, yet-to-be-identified factors that didn’t turn up in the 2018 engineer’s report. “From what I see, [that report] didn’t look like something that I would say, ‘Get the people out,’” Norma Jean Mattei, a University of New Orleans engineering professor,told. “The deterioration played a part, but it wasn’t what caused this failure. Something else had to push this building over the top.” In other words, Champlain Towers South might have suffered not from bad ownership or bad governance but from bad circumstances and bad luck.Because of the disasterin Surfside, long-standing questions about condo-mania in Florida and elsewhere are resurfacing. The condo, like other forms of co-owned housing such as the co-op, occupies an ambiguous place in American life. Most American homebuyers have historically preferred single-family houses and understood other kinds of dwellings to be second-best. Geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists have argued for decades that the condo system is fundamentally unworkable, little more than a scheme cooked up by developers to seduce property buyers with good locations, luxury amenities, and hollow promises of community. Others saw condominium arrangements as an inevitable fiasco, worrying that an amateur group of owners couldn’t possibly run a building competently.Still, the individually owned apartment emerged in the 19th century in cities such as New York and Washington, D.C., for those who could afford a house but didn’t need or want one—with careful efforts in design and marketing to distinguish them from working-class tenements. The originator of the for-sale apartment in the U.S. in the 1880s opted for a simple system: the corporate-title “cooperative,” in which the association holds title to the entire complex and individual ownership is conveyed by perpetual, in many cases $1-a-year, “proprietary” leases. In some respects, this is a superior model. The single title enables associations to more easily take out commercial loans for repairs, while the leases allow them to evict owners who become a liability.Yet the power of the association, especially to screen resales, made mortgage lenders wary. And in a nation deeply committed to unfettered property ownership, it also limited the appeal of owning an apartment. Starting in the late 1950s, the mortgage industry, anticipating untapped demand, began to promote condominium arrangements in Florida, then nationally. As early as 1921, Congress questioned the entire premise of for-sale apartments, grilling homeowners about its viability. By 1974, an aggrieved owner, also testifying before Congress, asked, “Can a condominium actually work?” More recently, dysfunctional condo politics have been the stuff of TV comedy on shows such as. Since 2009, disputes between owners and homeowner associations have aired on Sunday mornings in South Florida on an AM radio show called “Condo Craze & HOAs,” hosted by the attorney Eric M. Glazer—a Judge Judy for the Condominium Coast.Behind much of the skepticism of the condo system were tensions between private rights in property and community obligations. Between the 1880s and World War I, co-owned buildings in the United States were mostly sponsored directly by future tenants (foreshadowing therecent wave ofin Berlin). By the 1920s, though, speculative developers came to dominate. To sell apartments, they learned to emphasize lifestyle, including ease of physical maintenance (“no lawn to mow,” read many an ad), while downplaying responsibilities.But owning an apartment, like any other property, comes with its own burdens—just ones less tangible than a lawn. No matter the system, ownership turns tenants, ready or not, into landlords: Members of a condominium automatically become co-owners of a corporate entity responsible for common elements. As nearly everyone who has ever owned an apartment in a large building knows, however, rare is the condo owner who’s attuned to this duty, and rarer still is the one who attends association meetings, let alone serves on the board of directors.Read: The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle AgesAnd yet developers and sales agents recognized this gap early on. While honing their marketing strategies, they began to encourage buildings to hire “professional” management, leaving associations with few direct responsibilities. Governance could still be challenging. In co-ops in New York and D.C., where associations typically screen new buyers (ostensibly for reasons of financial security), battles erupted over whether to allow resales to Jewish people and, later, single women, Black people, and gay men. In more recent decades, residents of condo buildings have feuded over everything from cosmetic upgrades (redecorating lobbies) to the installation of EV charging stations. These disputes hint at why some early critics believed that condos would inevitably result in huge problems, including premature physical decay.These predictionsoccasionally proved true—but almost never in the U.S. In America, our faith in a stable and transparent real-estate system supersedes our deep-seated aversion to public oversight of private transactions. As a result, regulation of condominium-like arrangements in this country, even in freewheeling Florida, has been among the most robust in the world, making American condo ownersthe envy of their counterpartsin places as diverse as Australia, China, and Israel.People around the world following the news from Surfside are now aware of Miami-Dade County’s requirement that buildings undergo recertification by engineers or architects after 40 years. But since the 1970s, Florida has also introduced an array of other regulations to ensure safe, equitable, and relatively efficient governance of co-owned apartments, and other states have followed its lead in many ways.When developers experimented with locking associations into management contracts at uncompetitive rates (as detailed in John D. MacDonald’s 1977 disaster novel,), kept down sales prices by retaining ownership of common areas and renting them back to associations (also at inflated rates), or made monthly charges unsustainably low by retaining control over associations until an overwhelming majority of units were sold, the state outlawed these practices. To allow for a more timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes among owners, and between owners and associations, it set up provisions for resolving disputes outside the courts.None of this guarantees that, when major repairs become necessary, owners will be able to make decisions or raise money quickly. And even if states push associations harder to take the unique pitfalls of condo arrangements into account, owners are still exposed to other risks, including, in some cases, the uncertainties inherent to waterfront living amid climate change. Ultimately, the condo format could turn out to be a factor in the Surfside disaster, but any presumption of guilt now may provide false reassurance to people who have a stake in other forms of real estate—and face the ugly, rare, and sometimes catastrophic surprises that are a possibility in property ownership of every kind.​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

But from resisting racist exclusion to building CIO unions in the 1930s, Mexican American workers have been central to left-wing politics in the United States.Workers Alliance leader Emma Tenayuca speaks to a crowd outside San Antonio City Hall, March 8, 1937. (UTSA Special Collections)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today.On January 29, 1911, a coalition of Mexican revolutionaries and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a US-based anti-capitalist labor union, crossed the border between California and the Mexican state of Baja California to launch what would come to be known as the Baja Insurrection. Many of the Mexicans belonged to the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which had announced its intentions of toppling Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz, transferring the ownership of factories to their workers, and returning lands to Indigenous communities. Driven from Mexico to the United States by Díaz, the PLM had found solidarity with the IWW, which similarly advocated for workers’ control of production.Growing from a small band of less than two dozen revolutionaries to hundreds of PLM members, their supporters (including Indigenous tribespeople), and IWW members, the insurrectionists seized the towns of Mexicali, Algodones, Tecate, and Tijuana, opening an early northwestern front in the Mexican Revolution. The insurrectionaries were supported by arms and funds from US radicals, including the Socialist Party — which, combined with the prospect of thousands of US-based Mexicans joining the revolution, pushed president William Taft to act.Twenty thousand US troops sealed the border, while the US Navy secured access to ports in Baja California for Díaz’s forces. The insurrectionists held out for six months, but, without any means of reinforcing or resupplying themselves, ultimately quit the campaign. Some of them subsequently flocked to the banner of Francisco Madero, a centrist, US-backed opponent of Díaz, but those who had crossed the border were summarily arrested by US authorities for violating neutrality laws.While short-lived, the Baja Insurrection illustrates many of the characteristics that define the historic role of Mexicans in the US left: radical, transnational, and often targeted for steep government repression.Jacobincontributor Arvind Dilawar recently spoke with Justin Akers Chacón about his book on the history of transnational Mexican working-class struggle,Radicals in the Barrio, about how participants in the Mexican Revolution brought their experiences to the early US labor and civil rights movements, and the vital position that women occupied in Mexican radicalism. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.How would you define the barrio? What role did the United States play in creating the barrio both stateside and in Mexico?Barrios, within the context of early twentieth-century US history, refer to the formation of Mexican working-class communities that developed along migration corridors and in proximity to capitalist industries, particularly agriculture, mining complexes, railroad hubs, fisheries, and factories.Along the California coast, for instance, you have barrios dotting the roadmap of the multibillion dollar harvest corridor that stretches from the Imperial Valley [in southeastern California] to the San Joaquin Valley [part of the Central Valley]. Others took shape or expanded in proximity to fisheries and canneries (San Diego), near garment factories (Los Angeles, Dallas) and railroad hubs (South Texas, Chicago), and near the Cotton Belt in Texas (San Antonio). Historic Mexican barrios have stretched from Arizona mining towns to the Yakima Valley in Washington State, east across Colorado’s hard and soft rock mining regions, near the sugar beet farm complexes spanning the Great Plains states, and into the environs of Chicago’s transcontinental railyards and beyond.Some of the oldest barrios in the contemporary Southwest actually predate US conquest and colonization. For instance, San Diego was established as a Spanish Catholic missionary project through the forceful colonization and attempted conversion of the original Indigenous Kumeyaay people beginning in 1769, and Los Angeles was founded as a land-grant concession to Mexican migrants (mostly Indigenous and African-descendent people from Mexico City) by the Spanish Colonial government in 1781.It’s impossible to understand barrio formation without understanding the long and sordid history of US colonialism and imperialism in what is today the southwestern United States, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century. The US invasion of Indigenous and Mexican lands began with the uprising of slaveholders in Coahuila y Tejas in 1835 and was followed in 1846 by full-scale military invasion. This opened up a period of more than half a century of conquest and settler-colonialism across the West and Southwest.Conquest then continued in the form of economic imperialism, through which US capitalists exported vast stocks of capital and consolidated control over much of the Mexican economy. This induced widespread social and economic displacement within Mexico, as the exploitation and sale of Mexico’s vast natural resources were repatriated as profits for US investors. This transformation of Mexico into a resource colony of the United States pushed over a million displaced Mexican people to migrate north over the first three decades of the twentieth century alone. US economic domination and political and military meddling was entrenched by the turn of the century, and the US state played kingmaker in Mexican politics, backed by US Marines. These factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910.After the US invaded Mexico in 1846 and annexed its northern half in 1848 — today’s Southwest — the federal and state governments treated the conquered inhabitants the same way as it did other Indigenous peoples in the path of settler-colonialism: through violent dispossession from the land, disenfranchisement from the political system, and racialized proletarianization and segregation.Barrio, which means “neighborhood” in Spanish, now meant something different: poverty and underdevelopment. Indigenous people were forced onto reservations and Mexicans could only live within racially restricted neighborhoods that were systematically impoverished and marginalized, excluded from civil and political participation, and brutally over-policed to keep people subjugated.How did Mexican radicals fuse Indigenous traditions with European ideologies to arrive at their own unique politics? How did those politics differentiate Mexican radicals from their Anglo counterparts?Many radicals operating within Mexican territory in the early twentieth century were Indigenous people or had Indigenous roots, with ties and networks connecting to Indigenous communities. One cannot fully understand Mexican history — especially the deep-rooted resistance of the people and episodes of rebellion and revolution — without identifying the centrality of Indigenous people within that history.Indigenous communities resisted the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico over its four-decade span (1876–1910), especially when the government began to sell off large swathes of their communal and ancestral lands to foreign investors in the 1880s as part of its drive to build Mexican capitalism following the US model. By the early 1900s, Indigenous radicals from different groups across the country had joined (and formed a large part of the ranks of) the proto-socialist movement founded in 1901 as the Partido Liberal Mexicano, under the leadership of the Flores Magón brothers: Ricardo, Enrique, and Jesús.In most cases, Mexican Indigenous people did not see themselves as Mexican or part of the nation, but rather victims of it. In understanding the dynamics of revolutionary movement-building in Mexico, the radical socialist left developing around the Flores Magón brothers understood and embraced this in their internationalist framework.The Flores Magón brothers were radicalized while attending college in Mexico City, but also drew from their own cultural knowledge and experiences. Their father was an Indigenous elder in their hometown in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and they came of age learning the important tenets of collectivism, reciprocity, other forms of communal obligation, and mutual well-being. They developed their radical philosophies by reading European texts available at the time (Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, etc.), while also following news stories and instances of Indigenous rebellion happening across the nation, which were becoming more widespread in the 1890s. They refracted their vision of communism through the Indigenous courage to act and power to resist, and the real-to-life models of how it could work within their Mexican Indigenous context.Unlike their Anglo and European counterparts, most of whom embraced the tenets of American exceptionalism and ignored the plight of Indigenous populations, themagonistasmade the Indigenous struggle a central component of the class struggle. They situated the importance and relevance of Indigenous liberation and struggle alongside those of the industrial and rural working classes.Aside from Indigenous people forming their ranks and providing bases of support, the magonistas supported and helped organize and coordinate revolt in defense of Indigenous lands, and returned ancestral lands to the people in the few instances when their insurrections were successful during the revolutionary period. The direct participation of magonistas in support of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata and his Army of the South played an influential role in the development of the Plan de Ayala, in which the Zapatistas pledged to restore all stolen Indigenous lands over the course of the revolution.Mutualistas— mutual aid organizations — served as multipurpose vehicles for the Mexican working class, approximating labor unions during times of workplace strife and civil rights advocacy groups during periods of racial persecution. Why were mutualistas at the center of radical Mexican politics?The economy of late nineteenth-century Mexico was characterized by social underdevelopment, underwritten by imperialism. Unions were outlawed by the Mexican state to maintain low wages and a high rate of exploitation for foreign capital. Under these conditions, the working class had to develop its own means and methods of self-sufficiency, mutual support and reliance, and reciprocity to meet the basic needs that were not provided by the state or nongovernmental institutions. These included burial services, medical plans, support for destitute or disabled members, etc.In their initial self-help form, mutualistas were tolerated by the state since they posed no threat. They could even be co-opted by the state for political patronage purposes, trading demonstrations of political loyalty in exchange for benefits and rewards. Nevertheless, the class-based infrastructure of mutualistas — collectivist practices, reciprocal obligations, family and kinship relations, and overlapping memberships within the working classes in local industries — meant that they could also become mechanisms for organizing strikes and other actions at the point of production. By the turn of the century, economic and political crisis and growing social inequality led to the formation of explicit “labor mutualistas,” which represented the evolution from self-help to class-conscious, working-class defense organizations.In the United States, Mexicans brought their mutualista traditions with them and reconstituted them across the Southwest. This practice continued as a response to the racism experienced by Mexicans and the systematic neglect and social underdevelopment of the barrios. Also, with some exceptions, most US-based unions, especially the American Federation of Labor, largely ignored or excluded Mexican workers, leaving them to their own devices.The mutualista organizations that formed across western US states in the first three decades of the twentieth century formed the class base and functional networks for the growth and spread of the radical and revolutionary Mexican left in the US in that period, especially the magonistas of the PLM, as well as the IWW. Later, the Mexican working-class rank-and-file members of these organizations were pivotal to the organization and growth of a new labor federation, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), in Mexican communities across the Southwest from the 1930s to early 1950s.What role did repression play in catapulting Mexican women in particular to the forefront of these movements? How did they overcome the machismo of Mexican culture and the early left more generally?It’s important to recognize that machismo has been a feature and function of labor exploitation embedded in US capitalism from its inception, and has impacted women across all cultures. Not only have women historically been paid less for the same work, but racialized labor exploitation has meant that women of color are paid even less than white women. Mexican women, alongside black women, were paid the lowest wages within the formal economy.By the 1930s, Mexican women constituted a substantial part of the working class within the gendered divisions of labor that characterized industry and employment in the Southwest. For instance, women were the majority of workers in canning and packing, garment manufacturing, and nut-shelling, as well as in domestic service, laundry service, cigar-making, and a variety of other sectors. During World War II, Mexican women became a large contingent of the labor force in wartime industries.Mexican women were at the forefront of some of the most important episodes of militant labor organizing and strike efforts. From the barrios, they emerged as mass leaders, radical theorists, and national figures within the Communist Party and the CIO. Their leadership at many junctures of the rising labor movement during the period impacted the thinking of many men, created the basis for wider discourse on gender and sex equality, and challenged the patriarchal structures of the unions and political organizations.For example, women cannery workers negotiated the first union contracts to guarantee equal pay for all workers regardless of sex, race, or nationality, paid maternity leave, and Spanish-language rights provisions guaranteeing bilingual publication of contracts, work notifications, and all other company documentation. In fact, you can see how the concept of civil rights first emerges in the hard-fought labor struggles and union contract guarantees won at the point of production at this time.Because of their resilience and militancy, Mexican women were brutally repressed alongside the men. There is a long history of police violence against Mexican people in the barrios, including women and children. Labor unions and worker-led civil rights organizations at the time, such as the Workers Alliance in San Antonio and the Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples in Los Angeles, organized their communities to battle strike-breaking police and to resist and oppose the racist brutality that they experienced on a daily basis.In numerous strikes, women were at the forefront of blocking and fighting scabs and squaring up against the police. They also protested and organized againstla migra(immigration authorities), as people were routinely arrested and deported during the Great Depression, with agents directly targeting strikers, union organizers, and political radicals.In some instances, state repression of male workers led to circumstances where women carried a strike or struggle forward. From 1908 to 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, women in the PLM were leading and coordinating a transnational movement from the Southwest to the interior of Mexico, as the male leadership faced constant police harassment and incarceration. In the 1950 Empire Zinc strike in New Mexico (memorialized in the filmSalt of the Earth), the wives of striking miners took over after the corrupt local government declared the strike illegal and threatened the men with arrest if they maintained their picket lines.In crucial junctures of US labor and radical history, Mexican working-class people have often been at the forefront — with women in the foreground.What forces pushed Mexican workers to the forefront of both the labor and early civil rights movements? Why has their participation in these movements been under-acknowledged?It’s important to understand the close proximity to Mexico and the particular conditions of conquest, imperialism, and migration that led to the substantial growth of a Mexican working class within and across the United States by the 1920s. Mexicans became the largest section of the working class across major industries — agriculture, mining, railroad, and, in many cases, urban manufacturing. They were systematically oppressed across the economy to the point where the lowest wage in sectors was colloquially referred to as the “Mexican wage.” Under these conditions, Mexican were often the first to down tools or to join others who did so.Their tendency toward explosive resistance and instincts toward organization and collective action was also a result of many workers’ participation in the Mexican Revolution. Many workers brought their experience in revolutionary armies and radical unions and revolution-era organizations with them into the farm, mining, and railroad camps. This experience, politicization, and accumulated knowledge was activated and deployed during periods of conflict and class struggle.The proclivity of Mexican worker militancy and leadership in class struggle was recognized by farsighted socialists, anarchists, and communists. These radicals learned and understood Mexican workers as an essential component of any radical labor movement or revolutionary transformation. There were various efforts by these radicals to recognize, document, and steer their organizations or unions toward understanding, supporting, and acting in solidarity with Mexican workers.Despite episodes of convergence between radical and revolutionary organizations with upsurges in Mexican labor struggle, these have been followed by massive state repression or ruptures and decline. This includes the growth of the IWW through its merging with the PLM in the Southwest between 1909 and 1916, which was crushed by a nationwide campaign of state terror and deportation; the building of Communist Party organizations in Mexican barrios across the Southwest in the 1930s, followed by federal and state anti-communist campaigns to repress and deport Mexican Communists and labor leaders; and the inclusion of tens of thousands of Mexican workers into the CIO by the late 1940s, followed by a full-scale mobilization by the state to destroy the predominantly black and Mexican CIO unions as part of the McCarthyite campaign to drive radicals out of the CIO and union movement altogether. In each of these episodes, Mexican and Central American labor leaders and Communists were deported en masse. McCarthyism represented a convergence of organized anti-communism and Jim Crow white supremacist reaction.The history and knowledge of these episodes of mass Mexican labor upsurges and radicalism have been erased and buried.Radical and Marxist Chicanas and Chicanos, politicized in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s, began the process of reconstructing and reconnecting to this Mexican working-class history. The mass strikes, walkouts, and marches for immigrant rights and amnesty centered on May Day 2006 awoke a new generation to the power and transformational potential of the Mexican working class in the United States, as well as Central American and Caribbean workers.Justin Akers Chacón is an activist, labor unionist, and educator living in the San Diego-Tijuana border region.

153,The College Admissions Scandal Is Even Worse Than You Think,-13.25,36.75,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/13/the-college-admissions-scandal-is-even-worse-than-you-think/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-13,washingtonmonthly,25,"What kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people—who will already pass enormous economic and social capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)—are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?Paying half a million dollars–or in one case, $1.2 million—and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutorscharged50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kids spots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other top-tier schools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople.Their kids have every advantage in the world. Barring some sort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children’s only path to success and sustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities.The main story at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat—and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford a scheme like that. But thebehind this crime are the same that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of money spent on a cottage industry around preparing students for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or posh secondary schools that explicitly market themselves as funnels into elite colleges.But this scandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It’s not exactly clear why these parents didn’t just bribe schools the legal way: write a big check to the school at the same time their kids were applying. (See, for example,Jared Kushner.) As our Editor in Chief Paul GlastrissaidWednesday morning on Hill TV, “It’s not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in the school.”Washington Monthly editor-in-chief@glastrissays college admissions scam is an “illustration” of higher education problems.https://t.co/vUdBwvoXs3pic.twitter.com/RsQOv2piYW— HILLTV (@HillTVLive)March 13, 2019While this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfare story that I think has stronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent.Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that’s not nearly the kind of money that gets rich schools’ attention. Kushner’s father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in today’s money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, theincome cutofffor the top 1 percent was $386,000, seven times the national median. The top .01 percent’s was $7 million, eighteen times larger.This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elite schools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvardreceivedan individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a$400 millionindividual donation. It might be safe to say that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child’s application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe these schools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits.This scandal is indicative of the state of higher education these days—overly obsessed with the most selective schools that don’t actually educate the vast majority of the American public. In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-ed studentsdon’t goto elite schools. But the way our economic system is set up, there’s good reason for this obsession. The very tangible advantages these schools offer have incentivized upper-class parents to take drastic measures to get their children into the schools that are the tickets to ensuring they can remain in, or climb up, their hyper-stratified class. It’s a self-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.",1
154,Nasa’s Mars landing is a reminder that good science depends on good politics,-6.0,36.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/international/science-tech/2021/02/nasa-s-mars-landing-reminder-good-science-depends-good-politics,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,newstatesman,16,"The successful landing of Nasa’s Perseverance rover on Mars last night is a moment of scientific triumph. The mission could uncover profound truths about the Red Planet and our place in the universe.But we should not content ourselves that science is celebrated and accepted everywhere. The past year has demonstrated the ways science can be sidelined whenever it is politically expedient.Most of the differences between the modern world and the ancient one can be attributed to science. The scientific revolution introduced an entirely new attitude toward what could be considered fact. It wasn’t enough any longer to just state what you thought; you had to explain why you thought it, and exactly how you had reached your conclusion.In particular, the founders of modern science, among them those “ingenious and curious gentlemen” (as they described themselves) of the early Royal Society advocated that there was only one way to discover scientific truths about nature: by patient experiment, observation and reasoning. This same approach is employed today, not only by scientists but by lawyers, detectives and anyone whose work involves categorising phenomena, forming hypotheses and testing evidence.But the desire to suppress or even stifle intellectual freedom and scientific thinking are equally durable. Such attempts fail in the long run, but they can nonetheless have a chilling effect on progress in science that can last for decades.One infamous example was that of Galileo Galilei. Following his trial by the Inquisition, in which he was found “vehemently suspected of heresy”, the scientist and philosopher René Descartes wrote to a mathematician friend:“I inquired in Leiden and Amsterdam whether Galileo’s World System was available, for I thought I had heard that it was published in Italy last year. I was told that it had indeed been published, but that all the copies had immediately been burnt at Rome, and that Galileo had been convicted and fined. I was so astonished at this that I almost decided to burn all my papers, or at least to let no one see them.”The great poet John Milton, who visited Galileo in 1638, wrote that the Inquisition’s restrictions on “philosophic freedom” in Italy meant that “nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian”.But just as science persists, so does the denial of science. Donald Trump, who claimed climate change was “an expensive hoax”, and that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”, denied the alarming conclusions of thousands of climate studies worldwide. As the Trump administration began the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and attempted to freeze fuel efficiency standards imposed on new vehicles, it also took aim at the science itself, suppressing research that showed the effects of climate change on the US, removing scientific advisers and restricting the data that government agencies could use to make decisions on public health and the environment.In March 1616, the Tuscan ambassador to Rome wrote that “the Roman climate is getting very dangerous [for Galileo], […] for the present Pope [Paul V], who abhors the liberal arts and this kind of mind, cannot stand these novelties and subtleties; and everyone here tries to adjust his mind and his nature to that of the ruler.” Four centuries later, little has changed in the relationship between power and truth.The Covid-19 pandemic, too, has been characterised by the dismissal of scientific opinion. On 22 January 2020, Trump said in an interview that the disease was “totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” Even in March, in a meeting with Leo Varadkar, Trump continued to brag: “The United States, because of what I did, and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. Other countries that are smaller countries have many, many deaths.” That was less than a year ago. At time of writing, the United States has more than 25 million cases and is nearing 500,000 deaths.Nor was this attitude limited to the Trump administration. Boris Johnson was slow to recognise the grave risks involved, and even after the pandemic had become impossible to ignore, his government did not succeed in putting together a rapid, effective response.All scientific theories are provisional. Knowledge has to be constantly reappraised as fresh evidence becomes available. But only science can promise a continuous mid-course self-correction, even on simple things: when we were young, milk and eggs were good; a decade later, we were warned off them because of cholesterol; today, they are recommended in moderation. This is not consistent with politicians’ need to be right, and to stay right.But it is never a good idea to bet against the judgement of science. To do so when human life (as in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic) or the future of the planet’s biosphere (as in the case of climate change) is at stake is unconscionable.CP Snow’s 1959 lecture on the “Two Cultures” bemoaned the failure of scholars in the humanities to appreciate the “creativity” and imagination that are essential to the practice of science. Science should surely feature in everyone’s culture; it’s not just for potential scientists. There are two main reasons: first, it’s a real intellectual deprivation not to understand the natural world around us, and to be blind to the marvellous vistas opened by Darwin’s theory of evolution or by the breakthroughs in modern cosmology – the chain of emergent complexity leading all the way from a “Big Bang” to stars, planets, biospheres and human brains able to ponder the wonder and the mystery of it all. It is essential to marvel at the intricate web of life on which we all depend, and to understand its vulnerabilities.Second, we live in a world where more and more of the decisions that governments must make involve science. Obviously Covid-19 and climate change are at the forefront of our minds today, but policies on health, energy, the environment and space-related existential risks all have a scientific dimension. But these policies have economic, social and ethical aspects as well. And on those aspects, scientists speak only as citizens, and all citizens should be involved in democratic choices.If there is to be a proper debate, rising above mere sloganeering, everyone needs to be informed, to have enough of a feel for science to avoid becoming bamboozled by propaganda and bad statistics. The need for proper debate will become even more acute in the future, as the pressures on the environment and those resulting from misdirected technology become more diverse and threatening.The US has already rejoined the Paris agreement, but the war on facts waged by Trump is far from over. There remains little agreement on what defines a reliable source, and it seems that we may have to take up Galileo’s defiant call (apocryphal as it may be) “And yet it moves” as a rallying cry: a reminder that, in spite of what you may believe, the facts do remain the same.We have been there before. In, Hannah Arendt prophetically wrote: “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (ie the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (ie the standards of thought) no longer exist.”Galileo and the Science Deniers.Related",1

The disruption also exacerbated preexisting tensions over restrictions on meat sales across state lines.To get their meat to shelves, livestock farmers pay either state- or federally regulated slaughterhouses to butcher their animals. Meat from state-inspected facilities can’t be sold across state lines, making it more advantageous for farmers to work with the four federally regulated companies that dominate the market:Tyson Foods Inc.,JBS SA, Cargill Inc., and National Beef Packing Co.Lawmakers have offered bipartisan proposals to help small-scale processors and livestock producers access larger markets at fair prices, with House Agriculture Committee ChairmanCollin Peterson(D-Minn.) leading the charge. His legislation to make it easier for processing facilities to become federally regulated was added to House Democrats’ stimulus measure (H.R. 925), but it faces an uncertain future if last-minute stimulus negotiations fail.“The pandemic confirmed something farmers have known for some time: there is a severe shortage of local and regional meat processing facilities across the country,” Rob Larew, the National Farmers Union’s president, said in a statement.The Agriculture Departmentregulatesabout 6,500 slaughter and processing facilities nationwide, while 27statesmonitor about 1,900 small-scale processing facilities.

Large retailers will often only sell meat that carries the Agriculture Department inspection seal.Eight of the 27 states participate in a program that allows state-inspected plants to qualify as federally inspected establishments.Although state inspection programs are required to impose requirements “at least equal to” those of USDA, plants applying to become federally inspected often have to spend money to upgrade their facilities.Facility upgrades are the greatest barrier to businesses being able to qualify for USDA oversight, a department spokesperson said.Meatpacking giants running federally inspected facilities have come under fire for allegations of price gouging during the pandemic, sparkingoutrageamong lawmakers such as Sen.Chuck Grassley(R-Iowa) and prompting an investigation by the Justice Department.Peterson’s bill (H.R. 7490), incorporated in the stimulus package, would establish facility upgrade and planning grants for meat and poultry processors to qualify for federal inspection. The stimulus measure would set aside $100 million for the grants.Some lawmakers have taken an alternate approach to address processing industry issues.Reps.Chellie Pingree(D-Maine) andJeff Fortenberry(R-Neb.) introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act (H.R. 8431) to aid small meat processors and boost state operations.The bill would expand the Agriculture Department’s portion of state inspection program costs. It would also offer grants to small and state-inspected plants, and set up two $10 million grant programs for meat-processing training.Fortenberry said the legislation would reinvigorate local meat processing as there’s “broadening concern over corporate concentration in the meatpacking industry.”The Cattle Market Transparency Act (S. 4647), introduced by Sen.Deb Fischer(R-Neb.), would address cattle industry issues by setting regional negotiated cash minimums and giving producers more market information, among other policy changes.The nation’s top four meat processing companies control about 80% of the slaughter market, according to Grassley. The North American Meat Institute estimates their share of beef production is actually closer to two-thirds.The companies last month persuaded a judge to temporarily toss a 2019lawsuitover alleged antitrust violations.JBS, Tyson, Cargill, National Beef Avoid Cartel Claims for NowCargill, with 12 federally inspected processing facilities primarily for beef and turkey, is “confident in our efforts to maintain market integrity and conduct ethical business,” Daniel Sullivan, the company’s media relations director, said in a statement. The other companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.Grassley urged government officials to look into possible cattle market manipulation by large beef-packing corporations in late March. A federal investigation is ongoing, he said in an Oct. 13 telephone interview, adding, “I really haven’t had this positive of a response from the Justice Department, Republican or Democrat, for years.”The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.Mike Stranz, vice president of advocacy at the National Farmers Union, pointed out that “98% of all meat processed in the U.S. goes through 50 plants,” making supply chain interruptions consequential, he said.However, National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said in an email that “there is no shortage of chicken plants in the U.S. and we did not experience any major disruptions in production this spring or summer.”To contact the reporter on this story:Megan U.

157,Analysis: Cities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic face bankruptcy,-2.0,44.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/analysis-cities-hit-hard-by-the-covid-19-pandemic-face-bankruptcy,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,pbs,25,"U.S. cities are fast running out of cash.The pandemic will reduce local government revenues by anestimated US$11.6 billionin 2020. With COVID-19 requiring residents to stay home and stores to shutter, the bulk of this reduction comes from a slump in local sales taxes. Declines will continue into 2021.State revenues are heading in the same direction, so many U.S. cities will need to rely on help from the federal government. Aid to cities may be part of the next pandemic aid package now being discussed by members of the House and Senate.But so far, the Republicans’ bill leaves out any new funding for state and local governments, while the Democrats’ bill includes $1 trillion for it.And if federal assistance arrives, it will not fix every city’s budget.The pandemic has hit budgets so hard that even cities in relatively good financial health – including those withrainy day fundsto help them through an emergency – will face significant changes to staffing and services.For cities in the poorest shape, the pandemic could mean bankruptcy.The Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesBankruptcy is a legal process where people, companies and governments who cannot pay their debts seek to reduce them.Which debts get paid during a bankruptcy are important decisions. They involve how comfortable a city employee’s retirement might be, the level of health insurance for pensioners and workers, the extent of labor protections for employees and the future cost of borrowing for a city.City bankruptcy was created by Congress after the Great Depression, in response to4,770different units of city government going belly up.Twenty-seven statesnow allow their cities to file for bankruptcy.Those statesthat do not allow city bankruptcy – Georgia and Iowa explicitly prohibit filing, with the other 21 states having no specific allowance or prohibition – manage the problem of city indebtedness in various ways, ranging from strict budget oversight to the disbanding of heavily indebted cities. Since 1938, city bankruptcy has been usedaround 700times.A city’s bankruptcy differs from corporate bankruptcy in that it does not allow for the liquidation of assets. For cities, bankruptcy is used to reduce debts, not sell off things – such as public roads and buildings – to pay off debts. The bankruptcy judge’s role is to determine whether the proposed reduction is fair to all people the city owes money to, which may include workers, pensioners, bankers, suppliers and investors.But bankruptcies can look different in different cities.We are scholars who research changes in how cities go about budgeting.Our work hasshowed that the city bankruptcies that followed the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008 were not uniform.If you were in a big city, your government owed money to lots of people. The converse was true in small cities. As the number of participants in a bankruptcy increases, the task of deciding how much different creditors should get repaid becomes more complicated.Westfall Township, Pennsylvania, home to about 2,000 people, declared bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a lawsuit to New Jersey real estate developers David and Barbara Katz.Courts ruledthat the city owed the Katzes $20.8 million after improperly denying them permission to develop projects in the township.With annual revenues of just $1 million, Westfall had few options but to file for bankruptcy.Resolving Westfall’s bankruptcy meant reaching a new agreement with the Katzes. The bankruptcy court approved a$6 million settlementwith the developers and gave Westfall 20 years to pay. The city would also raise property taxes and delay the repayment of other debts. By 2014, Westfall’s budget had recovered enough for Pennsylvania toremove itfrom its list of distressed cities.Bankruptcy proceedings were more complicated in Vallejo, California, which is on the northern end of San Francisco Bay. Vallejo,population 120,000, had a 2008-2009 budget of $79.6 million. In 2008, the city lost around one-quarter of its revenues as local sales taxes and real estate development fees collapsed. Vallejo suddenly found itself unable to pay all of its bills.The City Council voted unanimously to file forbankruptcy.In its bankruptcy filing, the city estimated it had between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors. The most contentious part of the bankruptcy concerned the city’s obligations to its own unionized employees. Vallejo argued that its bankruptcy should include the option of reducing employee wages and benefits, and changing working conditions, if necessary, without union consent.The judge agreed and, in doing so,expandedwhat types of debt could be reduced in bankruptcy. This was, and remains,controversial. Although unions havepushed back, later bankruptcies have confirmed the court’s decision.Vallejo ultimately chose not to impose new employment contracts on most of its employees.That decision helped Vallejo avoid costly legal battles – but the city’s main expenditures, wages and pensions, remainedlargely unaltered. The city emerged out of bankruptcy solvent butstruggling. Filing for bankruptcy ended up costing Vallejo over $20 million in court and legal fees.Vallejo’s bankruptcy foreshadowed an even more complex one in Detroit, where revenue decline and failedWall Street betsleft the city unable to balance its budget.Detroit listed 100,000 creditors in its 2013 bankruptcy filing, totaling$18.5 billionin debts. Like Vallejo, Detroit would have to decide which creditors to stiff, effectively asking them to pay for the city’s budget failures.Detroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesDetroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesThe eventual settlement would reduce Detroit’s debts by $7 billion, mostly by slashing the amount of borrowed money the city would have to repay to banks and investors.Butno creditorwould walk away unscathed. Wages, pensions and health care for city employees were all cut. The city also entered into a complex “Grand Bargain” brokered by local philanthropists with the state of Michigan and pension holders that helped settle the city’s largest debt, which was to pensioners, while keeping in the city its one major asset, the Detroit Institute of Art’s collection.The administrative and legal costs of the Detroit bankruptcy came in at around $100 million.The bigger the city, the more complicated and expensive the bankruptcy. More creditors means more lawyers making competing claims on the city’s dwindling revenues.It also makes the process of picking winners and losers more complex and something that can involve testing the limits of bankruptcy law. When these limits expand, just what going bust means can change dramatically. Things that once seemed untouchable, like pensions, can become vulnerable in bankruptcy courts.With many budgets in tatters, the prospect of growing numbers of city bankruptcies looms.Distressed citieswill have to figure out what the process means for them.It is rarely possible to predict what any city will decide. With any part of a city’s operations – including salaries, pensions, road repairs, borrowing, park maintenance, policing, libraries – potentially fair game, everyone involved faces great uncertainty. There is nosingle, predictable paththrough city bankruptcy.",2

On Thursday, he refused to dismiss the two songwriters' claim that Taylor Swift used their lyrics from a 2001 song for her smash hit ""Shake It Off,"" court records show. That claim has been ongoing since 2017.In the suit, songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler alleged that Swift lifted lyrics from the 2001 3LW recording ""Playas Gon' Play,"" which includes the phrase: ""Playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate.""The lyrics in Swift's song, by comparison, read: ""Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.""U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald dismissed the claim in 2018, finding that the disputed lyrics lacked sufficient originality to merit copyright protection. However, an appeals court overturned the Los Angeles federal judge's decision the following year.In a Wednesday ruling, Fitzgerald refused to toss the case out of court.The judge wrote that Hall and Butler ""have sufficiently alleged a protectable selection and arrangement or a sequence of creative expression,"" and Swift's ""use as alleged is similar enough"" to survive the motion to dismiss.The plaintiffs seek a share of the profits from Swift's hit.According to the lawsuit, over 9 million copies of the song sold as of the filing date and 6 million copies of Swift's album ""1989,"" and the video for the song had nearly 2.4 billion views on YouTube.Swift's representatives reacted when the suit was filed, saying it ""a ridiculous claim and nothing more than a money grab.

159,We Need a MAGA 2.0,21.33,29.33,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/15/we-need-a-maga-2-0/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,amgreatness,25,"With all sincerity, what was the “Stop the Steal” rally supposed to accomplish? When you think about millions of unhappy Americans traveling to Washington, D.C. to express their unhappiness with the results of the 2020 elections, one is left to ponder whether that energy needed to be directed elsewhere, or if there should have been a different message for the event? Everyone at that rally had the right to be unhappy and to protest, but just because they were within their rights does not make that action the right choice for the moment.Much like waiting until after he contracted COVID-19 to start conveying a more aggressive message about re-opening the economy, President Trump led a rally that was many days late and many dollars short. As we approach the 300th day of15 days to flatten the curve, it is becoming apparent that taking a backseat to the Fauci-Birx-Redfield triumvirate and allowing the country to fall under the rule of the White House Coronavirus Task Force doomed the president’s reelection chances more thanSharpies in Arizona.In short, the time to “stop the steal” wasElection Day. An “open the country” or “take off your mask” rally would have been more productive for the more than 74 million Americans seeking to reclaim their freedom.Because of the ugliness of January 6, it’s tempting to be gaslighted into thinking President Trump’s administration was an unmitigated disaster. There wereforeign policy winsandtax cuts. His outsider status exposed the manyRINOswho populate the Republican Party. His exposure of media bias pushed the mainstream media everdeeper in the tank for the Left, further eroding its public image. His outreach to different racial and ethnic communitiesproduced greater supportin those demographics.Yet, because he is a flawed human like us all, his ability to create his movement came with heavy baggage. His boorishness has been documentedad nauseam. More relevant to where we are today is the reality that while he was bestowed the magic “R” by the Republican Party, he is not a principled conservative. Rather, he is a septuagenarian businessman who loves the country and understands marketing. That unleashed the MAGA movement and many red hats, much like President Obama’s “Hope and Change.”Unfortunately, MAGA also was revealed as an ambiguous slogan that faltered when we needed it in March 2020.Principled conservatives who are guided by freedom and liberty would not allow themselves to become the face of putting a multitrillion-dollar economy “on pause.” One who believes that citizens are responsible for their own risk tolerance in life would seek to inform rather than mandate. Nothing guided the messaging on COVID policy beyond declaring preemptive victory over the virus. This emboldened a determination to enact an unprecedented level of government intervention, even in states with trifecta Republican control of the state government. We can have the federalism debate all we want, but regardless, a strong leader owns a crisis response.The president’s reactionary style contributed to the communication of a hodgepodge message about the government’s COVID strategy. Even as we sit here today, whatthe COVID endgame? The public signed on to saving hospital capacity but has been conditioned to believe that we are seeking zero COVID cases, which effectively ends our culture as a free country.Thus, it’s now crucial that patriots thank Donald Trump for the awakening, but it’s time to move on to MAGA 2.0. MAGA 1.0 was about Donald Trump and effectively ended on January 6. MAGA 2.0 is about infusing the culture with the energy and onus behind the original movement. As the late Andrew Breitbart noted, politics is downstream from culture. The current political climate that has Communist analogies is rooted in the Right ceding the culture battle to the Left. Reclaiming some semblance of liberty involves infusing popular culture with that spirit for freedom.Whether Joe Biden’s victory was legitimate or not, more than 74 million Americans cast a vote for the candidate who, to their minds, stood for challenging the uniparty political system of cronyism. MAGA 2.0 needs to harness the energy created by Trump’s ascendency but refocus that energy away from how one man was wronged and into local communities and culture.More than 80 percent of the counties in the United States voted for Trump. At least a few of them can be governed as far to the Right as California is to the Left. Many of these areas should declare themselves “constitutional sanctuaries”that reject COVID coercion and promote freedom of expression. MAGA 2.0 should also encourage dollars to flow to businesses that are pro-freedom. Liberty sells. It’s tough to refute the notion that long, unkempt facial hair and camouflage clothing are now stylish because afamily of God-fearing duck hunters in Louisianahad one of the most popular shows on television a few years ago.Most politicians on the Right are not leaders, they are followers who are constantly ceding ground to the spirit of the age. They don’t drive the culture, they follow the trends. Very few are Ron DeSantis, Kristi Noem, Chip Roy, or Thomas Massie. Those like Mike DeWine, Larry Hogan, Eric Holcomb, and Liz Cheney are more common.Yet, if the 75 million Americans who voted for Trump demanded toughness from all elected public servants, you’d eventually see more of the former and less of the latter. The Georgia runoff sent a signal about what people didn’t want. But that can only go so far. That’s why MAGA 2.0 really needs to be less about making America great again and more about making America free again.",1

As Bill Goodykoontz noted elsewhere in theRepublic:That none of this is actually about, you know, ballots is demonstrated by what’s going on in Texas. Governor Greg Abbott, whose approval ratings are headed down the Pedernales, originally said that there did not need to be an audit in the Great State.

The call came out from Mar-a-Lago for a “forensic audit” in Texas and, within eight hours, the Texas secretary of state’s office announced that an audit soon will be underway. And, as thepoints out, even the announcement was a riff.This is purely a product of the former president*’s perpetually tender fee-fee and Greg Abbott’s raging, visceral cowardice. He’s already got three declared challengers in the 2022 Republican primary: a wealthy developer (Don Huffhines), a star on Glenn Beck’s television network (Chad Prather), and perennial wingnut all-star Allen West, who decamped to Texas from Florida and became the chairman of the state Republican Party.

161,Covid got California Gov. Newsom into this recall mess. He's banking it'll get him out.,-5.67,43.0,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/covid-got-california-gov-newsom-recall-mess-he-s-banking-n1277314,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,nbcnews,25,"WASHINGTON — Covid-19 restrictions got Gavin Newsom into this mess. Now he’s counting on them to get him out of it.Amid a contentious national debate over masks and vaccines, California’s embattled Democratic governor is betting his political life on turning next month’s recall election into a referendum on some of the nation's strictest mandates.""What's at stake in the Sept. 14 recall? It's a matter of life and death,” the narrator ofNewsom’s latest television adstates, arguing the top Republican candidate “peddled deadly conspiracy theories and would eliminate vaccine mandates on day one.”Recent polls show a dead heat among likely voters on whether to fire Newsom, despite the state’s overwhelmingly Democratic tilt.It is starting to show with some nervousness by Newsom. Vice President Kamala Harris, who won statewide in California three times, will campaign with Newsom next week, and President Joe Biden may visit soon, too.While overall support for recalling Newsom has remained steady around 35 percent — about what former President Donald Trump earned in California last year — Republicans are far more motivated to turn out. Democrats, on the other hand, overwhelmingly assume Newsom will win and are telling pollsters that means they are less likely to bother.""The big question,"" according to Eric Schickler, a pollster at the University of California, Berkeley, is whether Newsom and his allies ""are able to get Democratic voters more engaged.""Newsom this month made California the first state in the nation torequire all K-12 teachersto be fully vaccinated or submit to mandatory weekly testing and has implemented new masking requirements on school buses and in classrooms.The governor also was the first to requirehealth care workersandstate employeesto be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing.“I have no interest in taking us off the Covid cliff,”Newsom told a Bay Area TV station, alluding to states like Florida and Texas, where Republican governors have tried to prohibit local schools from implementing vaccine and mask mandates.""Just consider the Republican candidates,"" he added. ""Not only do they all share one thing in common — their support for [former President Donald] Trump — but they also support eliminating mask mandates in our public schools, eliminating vaccine verifications.""It’s an ironic turn of events for a governor whose job might not be in jeopardy had there not been a pandemic.The petition to recall Newsom, while not mentioning Covid-19,gained tractionin the backlash to the first wave of lockdowns and mask mandates Newsom implemented last year.Organizers were only able to collect the 1.5 million-plus signatures needed to trigger the recall election after ajudge extendedthe deadline by four months, citing the pandemic’s impact on canvassing.And Newsom’s lowest political moment came when he defied his own restrictions and was caught dining inside without a mask at one of the nation's ritziest restaurants, The French Laundry, which further fueled the recall effort.In a state where Republicans are outnumbered 3 to 1, some recall proponents have tried to broaden their appeal by focusing on less polarized issues like homelessness, the rising cost of living, power blackouts, crime, water shortages and wildfires.“One of the challenges with these recall elections is people get grumpy and they start to feel like they can cast votes out of grumpiness,” said David Atkins, one of California’s Democratic National Committee members. “What's happening with Covid is it makes the stakes clear. It makes it harder for Republicans to tap into that generalized grumpiness.”The governor and his allies are hoping to jolt awake Democrats and independents who have tuned out the race by warning them there's a real chance California could end up with a Republican governor.The quirk of the recall ballot is that if a majority of voters who show up on election day say yes to recalling Newsom, it practically guarantees a Republican governor.""They actually could do it if Democrats don't show up, so it's time to ring the alarm bells and let them know what's at stake,"" said Dan Newman, a top political adviser to Newsom. ""There are just two very very different paths on how to end the pandemic.""Newman called the race a ""binary choice"" between Newsom and Larry Elder, a Black conservative talk radio host who is the clear polling leader among challengers.Elder is an appealing foil for Newsom in a Democratic-leaning state.The longtime radio host, who helped former Trump adviserStephen Millerget his start in politics, has a long history of provocative comments about everything fromworking womento theminimum wage(he believes it should be $0).A recent spat ofnegative storiesabout Elder has made Republicans think Newsom is worried about him gaining polling strength and is trying to push opposition research.Elder said he'd repeal Newsom's mask and vaccine mandatesbefore breakfaston his first day in the governorship.While there are 46 candidates of various parties vying to replace Newsom, every leading Republican opposes mandates. Several say they favor a statewide ban on local mask and vaccine mandates, like Florida’s.“We must draw the line and protect people’s freedoms,” said John Cox, who was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in the last general election and is running again.Vaccine and mask opponents are a vocal minority, large enough to form the nucleus of the recall, but polls show most Californians favor an approach to the pandemic more like Newsom’s.California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and 59 percent of respondents to a recentCBS News/YouGov pollsaid people who refuse to get vaccinated are “putting people like me and my family at risk.” Just 27 percent said they respect the decision to not get the shot.Still, as Biden and other Democratslearned last year, turning out and even reaching voters during the pandemic is harder for Democrats, since their base takes the issue more seriously.“We're so Covid-sensitive, our voters are so Covid-sensitive,” said Michael Trujillo, a Los Angeles-based Democratic strategist, “but Republican volunteers are happily going knocking on doors and voters are happily opening their doors.”Democrats say they’ve had a harder time recruiting canvassers, with most volunteers preferring to make phone calls or send text messages, which have been shown to be less effective.Of particular concern is Latino voters, with a recentEmerson College/Nexstar pollshowing a majority of likely Latino voters support firing Newsom, due in part to Republican Latinos being more engaged.Newsom has focused on campaigning in heavily Latino areas like East Los Angeles in recent days and is rolling out endorsements from prominent Hispanic figures like comedianGeorge Lopez.But Trujillo said past elections show there’s no substitute for face-to-face conversations on peoples' doorsteps.""That's what does it,"" he said. ""That's why you had a historic number of Latinos voting for Donald Trump, because we were unable to persuade our cousins, our uncles, our fathers to vote and to vote the right way.""Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior politics reporter for NBC News.",1

U.S. officials who spoke toForeign Policyindicated that the consulate closure is a response to a surge in Chinese espionage in the United States.Washington directed the closure of the consulate “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said on Wednesday. Ortagus did not cite a specific incident that prompted the move, but she raised accusations that China violated U.S. sovereignty. The closure was announced after a sweepingindictmentwas unsealed in federal court in Washington state outlining years of Chinese state-directed hacking and theft of intellectual property affecting victims across the United States and in other countries.“The United States will not tolerate the PRC’s violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC’s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior. President Trump insists on fairness and reciprocity in U.S.-China relations,” Ortagus said, referring to the People’s Republic of China.Chinese officials have vowed retaliation, raising the likelihood that a U.S. consulate in China will be forced closed in response. “The U.S. has far more diplomatic missions and staff working in China. So if the U.S. is bent on going down this wrong path, we will resolutely respond,” Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman, said to reporters on Wednesday.Reutersreports suggest that the U.S. consulatein Wuhancould be closed in retaliation.How China chooses to retaliate could determine whether the situation spirals, said Larry Pfeiffer, who served as CIA chief of staff under former CIA Director Michael Hayden. “If they want to keep it from escalating then picking a place like Wuhan wouldn’t be a bad one,” said Pfeiffer, noting that U.S. diplomats were already evacuated from the consulate earlier this year during the coronavirus outbreak. “If they closed our Hong Kong or Shanghai consulate, that would be seen as an escalation,” he said.U.S. officials have maintained that China, likeother rival powers and the United States itself, uses its embassies and consulates for spying under the guise of routine diplomatic work.“There’s always a certain amount of spy versus spy that gets tolerated, but this would suggest to me that the Chinese have stepped outside those norms of normal espionage,” Pfeiffer said.The United States ordering the closure of foreign diplomatic missions is a rarely used diplomatic step. The Trump administration in 2017 ordered Russia to shutter its consulate in San Francisco—alsoaccusedof being a base for espionage—as relations worsened between the two countries.Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee,tweeted: “#China’s Houston consulate is a massive spy center, forcing it to close is long overdue.”“We are under siege from Chinese espionage, and they traditionally use their consulates for propaganda and espionage,” said Daniel Hoffman, a former senior executive Clandestine Services officer with the CIA who served three times as station chief overseas. “Houston is a big city, large manufacturing center, aeronautics, oil field equipment, high-tech, all things that would be of interest to China,” he added.China also apparently used the consulate in Houston as a base to pressure andintimidateU.S. energy firms that were carrying out projects in the disputed areas of the South China Sea.“In the bigger scheme of things, this is looking awfully like a 21st-century cold war,” Hoffman said.FBI Director Christopher Wray warned earlier this month that Chinese espionage was the “greatest long-term threat” to the United States economic and national security during a speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C. He cautioned that China was using a multifaceted approach “to become the world’s only superpower by any means necessary,” and he said that the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case roughly every 10 hours.“The People’s Republic of China has engaged for years in massive illegal spying and influence operations throughout the United States against U.S. government officials and American citizens,” a State Department spokesperson told. “These activities have increased markedly in scale and scope over the past few years.”China’s top spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, maintains an intelligence unit in California, likely run out of its consulate in San Francisco, according to a 2018 investigation from. Chinese hackers indicted this month in Washington worked with the Ministry of State Security.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in February before the National Governors Association, accused China of meddling in U.S. state affairs. “Chinese consulates in New York, in Illinois, in Texas, and two in California, bound by the diplomatic responsibilities and rights of the Vienna Convention, are very politically active at the state level, as is the embassy right here in Washington, D.C.,” Pompeo said.Pompeo said that in August 2019, former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant “received a letter from a diplomat in the consul’s office in Houston, threatening to cancel a Chinese investment if the governor chose to travel to Taiwan.”“Phil went anyway,” Pompeo said.As the State Department announced the closure on Wednesday, local authorities in Houston responded to reports of fires at the Chinese consulate, with witnesses reporting people in the consulate compound were burning files in trash cans, according to theHouston Chronicle.The United States has consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Wuhan, as well as its embassy in Beijing.is a diplomacy and national security reporter at.

The Democratic presidential nominee, offering solace to a suffering nation, said ""decency, science, democracy, they're all on the ballot.""Trump, hosting a packed GOP convention crowd on the White House South Lawn, told of another apocalyptic future — one without law and order, where Democrats would give ""violent anarchists and agitators and criminals"" free rein over the country.The back-to-back party conventions painted a dark picture of a divided nation and set the stage for a presidential race that portends an epic clash between Republicans promising to restore order and Democrats vowing to restore a semblance of normalcy.In words and images, the unprecedented virtual gatherings also provided sharply contrasting perspectives on a summer of urban unrest as the nation comes to terms with episodes of disturbing police violence against Black men in Minnesota and Wisconsin, both in the heart of the Midwestern battleground.For both sides, the stakes couldn't be clearer.""They always say that every four years, every election is the most important election since the last one, but I think both sides believe it more deeply than usual,"" said David Sturrock, a former Minnesota Republican Party officer and a political-science professor at Southwest Minnesota State University.Ushering forth two well-known nominees in Trump and Biden, the parties kicked off their fall campaigns in somber, existential framing for the Nov. 3 election. For Democrats, that meant appeals to social justice and tapping into polling that shows broad dissatisfaction with the administration's handling of the pandemic.The Republicans' focus on law and order relegated the pandemic to the background, hardly noticeable in the sea of maskless faces coming together for Trump's in-person acceptance speech on the White House grounds. The event infuriated Democrats and some conservatives who called it an improper — and possibly illegal — political use of government property.""Get off our lawn,"" tweeted Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former contender for the Democratic nomination.Trump reveled in the stately backdrop of the White House, the sort of break from political tradition that delights his followers: ""We are here,"" he said, ""and they are not.""Trump's unapologetic appropriation of the White House, and the National Mall fireworks display that went with it, gave Republicans the sort of patriotic spectacle that animates their America First base. For Democrats, it played into one of their central arguments for his ouster.""The message was, in part, are you tired of this [expletive] show? Are you tired of all of this?"" said Norman Ornstein, Minnesotan and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. ""We can go back to some semblance of normality with Biden.""Republicans centered their message on the riots, looting and destruction across the country, counting on the disorder in Minneapolis and other cities to bring suburban voters into the Republican fold, whatever their reservations about Trump.Speakers disavowed ""cancel culture"" and ""Woketopians,"" framing socialism and anarchy as the greatest threat to the American way of life. Mark and Patty McCloskey, who were charged for allegedly waving their guns as Black Lives Matter protesters marched past their home in St. Louis, warned that the same thing could happen to others ""watching from quiet neighborhoods"" across the country.""It's almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work and school, versus rioting, looting and vandalism,"" said Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, on the opening night of the Republican National Convention.While Democrats promised to address racial inequities, voters of color featured in the Republican convention vouched for the Trump administration and policies they say led to record employment — at least before the virus hit.""The Republicans know they're not going to pull over a significant portion of Black voters, so part of that messaging is to moderate whites saying, 'Look, our party, we're not racist,' "" said Michael Minta, a political-science professor at the University of Minnesota who focuses on race and ethnicity. ""They're saying, 'How could this guy be racist if he has these people who are vouching for him and his credibility and integrity?' ""Even as the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd infused a new racial subtext into election-year politics, Minnesotans weren't featured prominently in either convention. Klobuchar scored a speaking slot on the opening night of the Democratic convention. She talked about unity and the right to vote. Republicans tapped Eveleth Mayor Bob Vlaisavljevich, a former Democrat who praised Trump's support for the mining industry, the lifeblood of the Iron Range, where Republicans see a bounty of rural white voters.For the broader public, conventions are a signal to start tuning in to the campaigns. For each party's base, it's a way to rev up its most active members, who typically mingle with their peers in the convention halls and return home and start on the groundwork of campaigning.""There's a certain organizational element to the conventions that helps,"" said Vin Weber, a lobbyist and former Republican congressman from Minnesota. ""That's missing, you can't do that virtually.""Millions of Americans, held captive in their homes by the pandemic restrictions, still tuned in to the two surprisingly glitch-free virtual conventions. Some pundits note that the ongoing pandemic, the waves of civil unrest and the deepening polarization of politics have done much of the work of motivating voters this year.""Emotions are high given everything that's going on, and it's also about how polarized we've become,"" said Ben Toff, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota's journalism school, who also works at the Center for the Study of Political Psychology. ""It's not just an intellectual debate about policy, and frankly, there hasn't been a lot of policy discussion in these conventions. It's been about identity. Those emotions are very much at the surface.""Briana Bierschbach • 651-925-5042Twitter: @bbierschbach",2

'There's nothing we can't do if we do it together'Inside, the headline was:It's Time to Come Together: A divided nation in the grips of a pandemic turned out in historic numbers to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. 'Let's give each other a chance,' Biden told the millions who sought a second term for President Trump. 'We are not enemies, we are Americans.'Next to the article's first words was a quote from Harris: America ""chose hope, unity, decency, science -- and yes, truth."" That doesn't sound like ""unity"" talk, does it?reporter Sandra Sobieraj Westfall proved a reliable Biden repeater by beginning and ending this chronicle with tender stories of deceased Bidens. In large type, it began:It continued:The lyrics to ""On Eagle's Wings,"" a favorite hymn sung at the 2015 funeral of his son Beau -- who died of brain cancer at age 46 -- had kept coming back to the former Vice President over the five days he spent at his Delaware home watching voting returns trickle in as his grandchildren buzzed around him. ""After Beau passed, it was difficult for him to listen to [that hymn],"" says close friend Ted Kaufman.Now as Biden added its words to his first words as president-elect -- ""He will raise you up...make you to shine like the sun"" -- he aimed to lead Americans on the first step to healing writ large. ""Joe standing on that stage, reciting that hymn, proves that you can come back from even the worst,"" says Kaufman. ""When it comes to healing for the country, he knows it's possible.""They repeat the story with a picture of Joe and Beau and a long caption on the story's final page, where Beau says ""you've got to promise me, Dad, that no matter what happens, you're going to be all right."" And Westfall goes back to the violins:Through it all, Biden leans on what he's learned about healing -- not just from Beau's death, but form the December day in 1972 when his wife Neilia and baby daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash that landed his young boys Beau and Hunter in the hospital.""Having lived through almost inconceivable loss and failure [in his earlier presidential campaigns], Joe Biden knows humility and resilience,"" says historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who sees in the President-elect now a bit of Teddy Roosevelt's gift for helping people from all corners ""feel common American citizenship"" and FDR's ability during World War II to rally Americans to ""accept brutal reality.""It's natural to think of lost loved ones at big turning points in your life. But with the Bidens, this has happened so often in 2020 (as it did at the convention) that it sounds like strategic messaging.",1

But two big decisions Thursday—one on ObamaCareand the other on a Catholic groupthat refuses to workwith gay couples—suggest that a different kind of breakdown is happening on the court. Coverage:In an analysis atCNN, Joan Biskupic writes that 3-3-3 seems to be the new pattern. One trio is the ""center-right"" of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Another trio is made up of liberals Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. And the last is made up of conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch.In Thursday's rulings, the three liberals joined the center-right (as did Clarence Thomas) in the ruling that dismissed a challenge to ObamaCare. And though the court sided with the Catholic group in the other case, the protection offered was limited, and the decision went nowhere near as far as the more conservative justices wanted.AtPolitico, Josh Gerstein notes that the three more conservative justices, particularly Alito, issued sharply worded critiques seemingly aimed at the other GOP appointees. ""Some liberal legal commentators noted that the most carefully dissected rhetorical sparring is now taking place among members of the new six-justice conservative majority, with the three remaining liberal justices often left as mere spectators,"" Gerstein writes.Alito, for instance, wrote in the Affordable Care Act case that ""no one can fail to be impressed by the lengths to which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA against all threats."" And in the other case, which involved a foster care agency in Philadelphia, he complained that the court ""has emitted a wisp of a decision that leaves religious liberty in a confused and vulnerable state."" As South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman puts it to Politico: ""I think Alito was just pissed.""The outcomes of Thursday's cases ""mean the court potentially will close out Justice Amy Coney Barrett's first term with no watershed conservative victories,"" writes Greg Stohr atBloomberg. ""Although the court still has 15 remaining cases, including a clash over the Voting Rights Act, the term's theme so far has been more incrementalism than revolution."" Stohr notes, however, that a truer test might come in the fall, when Roberts has scheduled an abortion case with the potential to dismantle Roe v. Wade.Matt Ford at thedigs more into the Philadelphia decision and sums up the narrow outcome: The court ""is still strongly inclined to favor litigants who bring religious freedom claims before it, and has handed down a series of major rulings in their favor in recent years,"" he writes. But ""the justices appear unwilling to rule conclusively that religious beliefs can overcome anti-discrimination laws that protect gay and transgender Americans in all cases—at least for now.""(Did former President Trumpinadvertently save ObamaCare?)",1

The state of 9 million residents has now reported 18,952 deaths since March 10.The number of deaths reported in the month of December is the most in any month since May.“In 10 months, this virus has cut a deep scar across countless families, entire communities and indeed our entire state,” Murphy said Wednesday during his regular COVID-19 briefing. “The scale of infection and death that 2020 would bring is not anything any of us could have imagined at this time one year ago.”The statewide rate of transmission of the virus, meanwhile, remained at 0.95 for the second straight day. It increased Monday to 0.96. It was at 0.95 for two consecutive days prior to Monday. Before Saturday, the rate dropped for 12 straight days to 0.95, the lowest it’s been since Sept. 2.And the number of people hospitalized throughout the state dropped Tuesday after increasing for three consecutive days.There were 3,727 people hospitalized in the state as of Tuesday evening, down from a more than seven-month high on Dec. 22 of 3,873 patients.The latest figures were announced the same day Murphy said all indoor organized sports at the youth, high school and adult recreational levels in New Jersey that were put on hold for four weeks because of the pandemicwill be permitted to resume beginning Saturday.CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:Live map tracker|Newsletter|HomepageHOSPITALIZATIONSThere were 3,727 patients hospitalized in New Jersey with confirmed (3,523) or suspected (204) COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday night.

Though the numbers keep rising every week, Murphy has said the school outbreak statistics remain below what state officials were expecting when schools reopened for in-person classes.The extensive rules for schools, which include social distancing guidelines for classrooms and strict mask requirements, have made schools among the safest places in the state, he said. The governor said of the 250,563 cases reported overall statewide since the school year began, only 2/10ths of 1% are “traced to activity within our schools.”AGE BREAKDOWNBroken downby age, those 30 to 49 years old make up the largest percentage of New Jersey residents who have caught the virus (31.4%), followed by those 50-64 (23.9%), 18-29 (19%), 65-79 (11.2%), 80 and older (5.8%), 5-17 (6.9%), and 0-4 (1.4%).On average, the virus has been more deadly for older residents, especially those with pre-existing conditions.

170,Voting rights hit the Supreme Court.,-0.67,44.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/voting-rights-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,readtangle,16,"Plus, a question about migrant facilities.The Supreme Court’s voting rights battle. Plus, a question about migrant facilities.Voting rights. Today, the Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments ina case in Arizona that could shape the future of voting rights for decades.The case challenges two Arizona laws: one that calls for a ballot to be thrown out if it was cast at the wrong precinct, and another that bans the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties (also known as “ballot harvesting,” which is permitted in 24 states and the District of Columbia). The plaintiffs, supported by Democrats, are arguing that these rules discriminate and infringe upon the rights of minorities, especially Native Americans, Black and Latino voters, by making it more difficult for them to vote. The state, supported by Republicans, argues that they are neutral laws that codify reasonable ways to secure elections.While the case is specific to Arizona, it could have monumental national implications. Up until 2013, the Voting Rights Act required states with a history of discrimination to get permission from the courts or Justice Department before changing its voting rules. This was called a “preclearance test,” dictated by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. But the Supreme Court suspended that requirement in 2013 after it ruled that Congress had not properly updated the criteria to determine whether a state was discriminating or not. Without the preclearance requirement, states like Arizona began implementing laws that would have otherwise needed to clear the Justice Department and the courts first.Now standing in the way of these two Arizona laws is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which says a state cannot pass a law “which results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote based on race. In the past, Section 2 has been applied to cases of gerrymandering, or “vote dilution.” This time, the plaintiffs are attempting to apply it to “vote denial.”Given that the court is expected to interpret Section 2 in this case, its ruling could set up dozens of similar, sweeping rulings across the country, and impact how other states legislate their elections.“The specific issues in the case are narrow, but to resolve them, the court has to address for the first time a question of major consequence: how the Voting Rights Act should be applied to regulations of the electoral process,” New York University law professor Richard Pildes told The Wall Street Journal. “The way that question is resolved will affect a myriad of election-law issues for years to come.”This has become increasingly important since the 2020 election. Now, Republican-controlled state legislatures across the U.S. are proposing new voting laws they say will secure elections. Opponents of the laws say they are designed to be restrictive and limit the number of minorities, who predominantly vote with Democrats, casting ballots.However, these two cases preceded the 2020 election. In 2017, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state, saying the rules were minimally burdensome and did not impact the majority of voters. But the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision, siding with the plaintiffs and the Democratic National Committee, which had joined the lawsuit.There are other voting rights stories right now, too, including the Democrats’ push to pass H.R.1., a federal bill that would substantially update election laws. But today we’re focused on what’s happening at the Supreme Court now.The left is vehemently opposed to these laws, saying they represent an existential threat to minority voters’ ability to participate in the democratic process.In Slate, David Gans said“state legislatures run by Republicans are engaged in a concerted effort to roll back voting rights, particularly for communities of color,” with “new hurdles to prevent voters of color from fully participating in our democracy.”“After, the Voting Rights Act has beenhanging on by a thread,” Gans wrote. “The key to its continuing promise is Section 2’s nationwide ban on electoral practices that result in a denial of equal political opportunity to voters of color. Section 2’s results test is critically important because its plain language targets discriminatory results, not merely purposeful discrimination by state policymakers. It forbids state laws that result in voters of color having ‘less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Now, in, the results test is in the crosshairs. If the court slashes what is left of the Voting Rights Act, states will have the green light to enact new voter suppression measures that make it harder for voters in communities of color to register to vote, cast ballots, and have them be properly counted. As in theaftermath ofShelby County, state voter suppression measures will once again proliferate. One of the most powerful weapons to combat white supremacy and safeguard a participatory democracy will be reduced to a historical relic.”In The New York Times, Charles Blowwarned that voter suppression is “always draped in noble language” and “those who seek to impede others from voting, in some cases to strip them of the right, often say that they are doing so to ensure the sanctity, integrity or purity of the vote.“However, when the truth is laid bare, the defilement against which they rail is the voting power of the racial minority, the young — in their eyes, naïve and liberally indoctrinated — and the dyed-in-the-wool Democrats,” Blow said,citing 253 proposed billsthat would restrict voting access in 43 states. “They can use all manner of euphemism to make it sound honorable, but it is not. This is an electoral fleecing in plain sight, one targeting people of color. We are watching another of history’s racist robberies. It’s grand larceny and, as usual, what is being stolen is power.”The right is hoping the Supreme Court narrows the places that Section 2 can be used, and makes it clear that any discrimination must be proven to be “substantial” for a court to throw out an election security provision.The Wall Street Journal editorial board said the Supreme Court has a chance to“restore the Voting Rights Act to its original purpose,”noting that Section 2 initially required proving intent, not just outcome, before the law was expanded in the 1980s.“Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to stop states from disenfranchising blacks with underhanded methods like poll taxes and literacy tests,” the board wrote. “But Democrats now argue that any state regulation that makes it a little harder for anyone to vote violates the law—even if it applies equally to minorities and whites. Importantly, the Voting Rights Act (VRA) puts the burden on plaintiffs to show that minorities, based on the ‘totality of circumstances,’ have ‘less opportunity’ than others ‘to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Even the Biden Justice Department told the High Court last month that it doesn’t ‘disagree’ with Arizona’s argument that its law is legal under Section 2’s ‘results test.’ The Court is highly likely to agree, and the shrewd liberal Justice Elena Kagan will no doubt tell Chief Justice John Roberts he can get a 9-0 ruling by holding that the Ninth Circuit committed a clear error in overturning the lower court findings of fact,” the board said. “But that would be a lost opportunity…“Arizona’s election laws are clearly not a violation of Section 2 as a matter of law, and the Court needs to protect state procedures that protect ballot integrity from electioneering lawsuits. But it would be even better if the Court goes further and clearly defines what the language of Section 2 means.”In SCOTUSblog, Megan A. Larrondo and Robert A. Berry, deputy attorney generals for the state of Idaho, which joined Arizona, said “The court should clarify that, on a Section 2 challenge, the plaintiff must show that (1) the entire voting and registration system provides voters in some protected groups with unequal voting opportunities and (2) the challenged law, not some other factor, causes the unequal opportunity.“States are the entities entrusted with running elections,” they wrote. “States must be given the space to enact and enforce neutral laws of general applicability to run those elections. The Supreme Court should reject an evidentiary standard that puts a wide swath of state laws at risk and improperly inserts the federal judiciary in the role of micromanager of state electoral systems.”Putting aside what the Supreme Court might do, or whether it should rule in a specific way, the central issue here is more straightforward for me: that Arizona’s legislature is implementing these laws in the first place.At the Supreme Court, Democrats will probably have to prove that the laws Arizona is trying to enact are having a statistical, disproportionately negative impact on minority voters in the context of the election system as a whole. They’ll simultaneously need to win the argument over how Section 2 should apply to those laws. I don’t think their chances are good, and voting rights activists are wise to brace for impact.But just as Democrats will need to show their work, Republicans should too. That’s why the 2013 ruling, which pared back the Voting Rights Act, has been so destructive.I’ll be the first to admit that ballot harvesting makes me uncomfortable. The idea of collecting and delivering a group of ballots seems to give at least another opportunity in the chain of custody to commit fraud — and I’m not at all sure how I feel about it as a general idea. About half of the states do not allow ballot harvesting, and Arizona isn’t unique for banning it.At the same time, if the claim is that ballot harvesting leads to fraud, where’s the evidence? Before the law was passed,USA Today reportedthat there “has been no evidence or cases linked to fraud related to the collection of ballots.” In a 2016 ruling, Arizona judge William Fletcher said the same: “there is no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona.” I could find justone caseof ballot harvesting that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who is taking this case to the Supreme Court, prosecuted in 2020. Two women from Yuma were charged with collecting four ballots in the August primary election. They’re now facing two years in jail and a $150,000 fine. This is the monumental threat to election integrity we’re worried about?Voting in the wrong precinct is a much more open and shut case to me. It should be allowed. Or, at the very least, voters should have a chance to “cure” their ballots if it’s not.Casting a ballot in the wrong precinct is almost never a sign of fraud, it’s a sign of confusion. And it’s easy to see why: many voters live further away from the precincts they’re supposed to be voting in. Sometimes voters move a few blocks in an urban area and return to the same place they voted last time, only to find out they’re in the wrong place (this has, literally, happened to me). I don’t buy for a moment that throwing those votes out makes our elections more secure.In Arizona, these challenges are unique. Democrats have rightly argued that minority voters cast a disproportionate number of out-of-precinct ballots. This is because, in Arizona, they are more likely to be low-income and thus more likely to have unstable housing, which means their address changes more often. Similarly, Native Americans and Latinos living in remote places in Arizona had previously leaned on community programs to collect and deliver their ballots (i.e. ballot harvesting).Given that these voters disproportionately cast ballots for Democrats, and absent any evidence that ballot harvesting or voting in the wrong precinct has opened the door to fraud in Arizona, it’s tough to conclude that this is anything but a cynical attempt by Republicans to preserve power in the state legislature.If the goal is to shore up election integrity, why not actually shore it up? Build out the infrastructure to track voters who cast ballots out-of-precinct and create non-partisan, government-supported initiatives to ensure voters in remote areas can get their ballots in on time. A legislature honestly invested in election integrity and democratic participation would be pursuing goals like that, not going to the Supreme Court in a fight to throw ballots out and limit the ways voters can deliver their ballots to polling places.Amidst all this is the reality that Arizona Republicans are trying to thread an uncomfortable needle. They’re simultaneously framing this as a state’s rights argument but also bucking their own secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, who is a Democrat. Of course, Hobbs doesn’t (and shouldn’t) get to overrule the Republican-controlled state legislature, but her dissent on this issue is notable.She is, by law, the state’s highest-ranking election official. She hastestified in courtthat ballot collection laws, as well as throwing out ballots cast in the wrong precinct, were “certainly meant to disenfranchise voters” and were “unnecessary because voter fraud already is a felony.” She won her election in 2018 running on a campaign to remove “barriers that can make it harder for minorities, seniors and low-income people to vote.” Then she inherited her predecessor’s legal fight that’s currently in front of the Supreme Court.I have loudly and proudly maintained that the 2020 election was one of the most secure in U.S. history. There were instances of fraud, as there are in any election, but they were few and very far between. The vast majority of ballots were cast by mail, which requires paper ballots and several checks on a voter’s registration, signature, address and identification and are the easiest ballots to verify. In Arizona, this was not a big change from years past — 80% of voterscast ballots by mail.I’m a proponent of securing elections. Adding more checks to the system, insisting on paper ballots that create a reliable trail and creating a central database to track voters across states and precincts would make our elections more secure. I’m also interested in ways to make it easier for more people to vote without sacrificing that integrity. I don’t see how these laws do that. And while protecting them may be a winning case in front of the Supreme Court, the fact the Arizona legislature passed them in the first place is a losing cause for Arizonans and the American public.Generally speaking, the argument they are bad hinges on three things: 1) asylum law 2) the conditions of the facilities and 3) family separation.In general terms, American asylum law dictates that anyone arriving at our border can seek asylum here if they qualify as a refugee. Part of that qualification involves reasonable fear about returning home. Since 2004, the vast majority of people who arrive at the border go through expedited removal processes. In that process, they are screened to determine if they have a credible or reasonable fear about returning home, and are then detained until appearing in court, or they’re assigned a court date and released into the U.S., where they often will find friends or family (this is often referred to as “catch and release”).Opponents of migrant detention facilities generally point to thehigh rates of return for court appearancesas proof that detention is not necessary.At the same time,Democrats contendthat conditions for children at these migrant facilities amount to prison: cold temperatures, lack of clothing, lack of food, lack of education or physical activity, and mistreatment from immigration law enforcement officers have all been documented. Access to the facilities for inspection has at times been limited or outright denied. There is a history ofmedical abuse and neglect.Finally, the issue of separation: migrant facilities for children sometimes exclude adults, meaning parents can be separated from their children when they are detained at the border. This was obviously a prominent issue under Trump, but has occurred in other administrations, too.The case for migrant facilities is basically all of these things inverted: That thousands of migrants are “released” into the U.S. and never show up for court; that facilities are necessary but need better funding to accommodate the migrants; that if we don’t want to house migrants then we can simply deport them or keep them on the Mexican side of the border; and that family separation acts as a deterrent against immigrants attempting to cross the border in the first place.Personally, I’m not opposed to migrant facilities in principle. I think housing asylum seekers, especially children, is an inherently good thing when they arrive at the border. But I certainly think the facilities need better funding — or perhaps better allocations of funding — to ensure the children are kept in an environment that at least approaches something that’s appropriate for kids. Many facilities, right now, are not meeting that standard.New data show that one year into the pandemic, which forced states to revise their revenue forecasts, many of the worst outcomes have not come to fruition. That’s in part due to a $600-a-week federal unemployment supplement, according to a new analysis. But it will hamper the case in the Senate to spend big on filling budget gaps at the state level. “By some measures, the states ended up collecting nearly as much revenue in 2020 as they did in 2019,”The New York Times reports.“A J.P. Morgan survey called 2020 “virtually flat” with 2019, based on the 47 states that report their tax revenues every month, or all except Alaska, Oregon and Wyoming.” Total state revenues were down just 1.8% from April to December this year compared to 2019.A New Jersey plumber drove 22 hours to Texas to help people who were overwhelmed by the winter storm. Andrew Mitchell, along with his wife, 2-year-old son and apprentice, packed $2,000 of equipment into his car and took off for Texas to help out. “A lot of the people we’ve helped were telling us they either can’t get a plumber on the phone or—if they do get one on the phone—the wait to be serviced is three to four weeks out, so they can’t have water during that entire time,” his wife Kisha toldthe BBC. Mitchell first stopped at his sister-in-law’s home, then worked out from there, servicing 6 to 10 houses a day for more than a week. (BBC News)",2

If that never occurred to you, you can consider yourself lucky and privileged. Even though feeding yourself and your family is is the least you can do to survive, for many Americans it is out of their reality to do what for some of us is just the basics for the maintenance of our lives. To say 2020 has been a hard year is not enough. 2020 has been the toughest year in decades for several families around the country. Even during easier times, millions of American families battle hunger on a daily basis, and right now, times couldn’t be farther from easy. That is what we’re going to talk about today. We about to disclose some very disturbing data which points out that over 50 million Americans will face starvation by the end of this year. Keep tuned and don’t forget to like and subscribe to our channel and to help spreading this very important message.From all the unsettling things we have seen so far in 2020, to witness a massive amount of families having to count their coins to find money to minimally feed themselves is one of the most tragic situations America has undergone over the past few decades. Many Americans were forced to change their lifestyle dramatically, cutting their food budgets due to a lack of income, while many others are now only having one or two meals a day, and demands at food banks around the country are spiking like never before.Yesterday, Bloomberg has published a report that could only be defined as one of the most devastating situations this country has ever faced. It reveals the struggles of a number of rural workers that expend the day inside plantations amongst an abundant amount of food that they can no longer pay for. Jessica Traxler is one fo these workers. Surrounded by food that she couldn’t afford, and “sitting in a faded-out Chevy sedan one July morning in southern Minnesota, she looked out at corn stalks, lush green, as far as the eye could see. A few miles to the east, a mill was pumping out flour. Just beyond it, a farm grew peppers, beans, and berries. To the north, there were dairies, one after the other. To the south, a huge pork plant. Grain elevators, poultry yards, cheese plants—all stood just a short drive away,” describes the article authored by Catarina Saraiva, Carolina Gonzalez, and Peyton Forte.If there is a place that portrays how atrocious America’s hunger problem has become during the sanitary outbreak, it is both sadly and ironically in the middle of the breadbasket that supplies food from coast to coast. It is being projected that the ranks of Americans fighting hunger are going to increase by 45% this year, meaning that over 50 million are likely to face starvation or at least severe food deprivation until the end of 2020.The story describes that “Traxler, her husband, and six children are among them. She had come to this spot, an empty school parking lot in the town of Mankato, to collect free boxes of food staples: milk and apples and carrots. Hundreds of Minnesotans waited in line ahead of her for hours.“It’s been hard,” she said. “We’ve had to dramatically change how we eat.”According to Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, about one-third of those relying on food shelves, large-scale and emergency food distributions at this moment are in such situation for the first time in their lives, just as Traxler and her family, after losing her job due to shutdowns related to the health crisis. In some parts of Minnesota, that number can escalate up to 70%. Now, the roughest debate regarding deeply-rooted systemic inequalities is about one of the most basic divides: who will eat well and who will go hungry.Millions of families are already unassisted and don’t have enough to eat. Over 60 million jobs were lost and every day it goes by this number only rises. Even though you might think that your job is safe, and hopefully it is, millions of others also thought their jobs were safe right before they were let go. With that said, we want you to know that our aim is not at all to discourage you. As Michael Snyder describes what is on his latest book “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America”: “there is hope in understanding what is happening, there is hope in getting prepared” and we say there is hope in trusting that there is still a way out of this mess. Stockpile your food, gather your supplies, join forces with your friends and neighbors. Keep informed, and most importantly, protect yourself. To be prepared is to be able to face the harsh reality and still keep your mind strong enough to face hardships resourcefully.”For more economic collapse news visit our website:-https://www.epiceconomist.com○Viewer comment:Minnesota Prepper DIY,“I’m sure it will be more like 100 million by the end of Winter.”I agree… – CP",0

He said Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, we should do a carveout.' I don't care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburn said to Politico.Biden has so far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as a second piece of legislation that reauthorizes sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburn said Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carveout immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona.On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden's upcoming Tuesday speech in Philadelphia is set to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than a simple legislative consideration.Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democratic senator and crucial swing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburn said he told Manchin at the time: ""I'm not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I'm saying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likened state-by-state GOP voter suppression bills to aggressive forms of ""white supremacy."" Casey saidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn's tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is the solution: Enact a carveout for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens of states have recently passed GOP-backed voter suppression laws that are being pushed through state legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes. The six Supreme Court justices who recently upheld the Arizona voter restrictions were all appointed by a Republican Party president.reached out to Clyburn's office Saturday for any additional remarks about the filibuster.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Benjamin Fearnow is a reporter based out ofNew York City offices.

You can find it, and subscribe,Over the last week, we’ve received some really great reader responses to the Tangle newsletters. As I often say, we’re just one person and a small team trying to produce a holistic view on the news of the day. That makes reader feedback really valuable to us, because we get to hear from both American and international readers with a diverse set of views.Below, I’ve tried to pull together a wide range of challenging, thought-provoking and well-reasoned feedback about the things we’ve published in the newsletter. By sharing it, I hope you can get a glimpse of the range of responses that are out there to the issues we cover.As always, thanks for reading (and for writing in). Remember: you can reach us anytime by just replying to this email.A reader from Jerusalem responded to yesterday’s edition on the clashes in Israel.Another reader wrote in about the conflict in Israel and said this:Michael from Sebastopol, California, responded to the story on Rep. Liz Cheney.Kendra from Phoenix, Arizona, replied to the newsletter on the latest jobs report — and wanted to chime in about why people aren’t returning to the restaurant industry.Another reader, who asked to remain anonymous, wrote in about what they’re seeing in the retail jobs market more generally.In response to a reader question about guns, I wrote that “advocates for a gun-free future tend to ignore thehundreds of thousandsof self-defense incidents that occur every year thanks to firearms. The CDC estimates that there are between 500,000 and three million incidents every year where victims of crime use firearms to defend themselves. That is one reason why gun ownership is so popular.”Julie from Brooklyn wrote in and said the following:Replying to the edition on Trump’s Facebook ban, Jonathan from Seattle, Washington, said:Writing in about the ban on menthol cigarettes, a former tobacco executive made this point:I think one of the flaws about the messaging around systemic racism on the left is born out of the bubbles we all live in. Progressives are often talking to other progressives, which means they are learning and adopting language together that makes sense to them — or language that is commonly used in progressive circles. If you pick a random suburb in America and strike up a conversation about “equity” or microaggression, you’re probably going to encounter some glassed over eyes.In my experience, it’s not at all difficult to talk to older, white, upper-middle class Americans about racism if it happens in their “language.” I’ve had plenty of conversations with people who fit that description and happily concede Black Americans have “gotten a raw deal,” or have been “boxed out of powerful positions at corporations,” or are facing the after-effects of generational wealth disparities and laws that gave huge advantages to white people just 50 years ago. Usually the friction comes when you press them on the advantagesgained by being a part of that system. Nobody wants to be told what they have isn’t well-earned.This friction only grows when progressives describe an institution, system or country as “racist” because it produces racially unequal results. The fact that many Americans don’t usually use the word racist in this way (but instead as you defined it: open hatred of a group of people) results in a great disconnect. One of my regrets from covering the Tim Scott issue was that I could have tried to preface the conversation with definitions of racism or systemic racism, which is often helpful. As basic as it is, some people are just using the same word to mean two different things. Asking people, or defining it yourself, would probably be useful in the conversations you are having.As I often say in politics, personal experience always prevails. All the data and studies in the world can fail to convince someone that there are, say, disparate outcomes in how job applications are receivedwith minority-sounding names. But if someone can talk about their experience as a person of color being interviewed or applying for a job, and the tiny clues they pick up on about the biases of the person interviewing them, that’s a more compelling story.What I often see in these debates is one side throwing links and data at the other side, trying to compel them to abandon a belief they might have come to from their own life experience. But if you center the self, and talk from your own first-person experience, that’s a different ball game.For example: I could argue that there was a Harvard study showing police are more antagonistic when pulling over Black drivers. That might be a somewhat compelling data point for a person who doesn’t think there is any discrimination in policing. But if I could compare my own experiences being pulled over as a driver with the time I was pulled over while a Black colleague was driving, and explain the differences I witnessed in how the police acted, that’s going to be a much more convincing story.Ultimately, if your goal is to move someone’s position on an issue, any issue, giving them space to explain why they think the way they do and then centering your own personal experience (rather than an article you read in Vox) is a really productive way to have a conversation. It’s also why I so often share my own personal anecdotes in Tangle, because I think that may help readers understand why I feel the way I do — and that allows more space for them to consider the supporting evidence I may bring to an argument.If you’re enjoying Tangle, and not yet a subscriber, please help support us by becoming one.

174,“F--k Him”: Rupert Murdoch Reportedly Made the Call to Bury Trump’s Election Night Dreams in a Shallow Grave,-10.0,35.33,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-arizona-2020,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,vanityfair,25,"In the early-morning hours of November 4, the day after the 2020 election,held a news conference in the East Room of the White House in which he falsely claimed that the fact that he had been ahead in the early tallying of votes, and then later behind, meant that the election had been stolen from him. “This is a fraud on the American public,” hedeclared. “This is an embarrassment to this country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.” Obviously that wasn’t true at all—Trump hadn’t won anything because not all of the votes had been counted yet. Still, in some states it had become clear that he was very likely going to lose, hence Fox News’s decisionto declareArizona forJoe Biden.At the time the call from the right-wing outlet, made before any other major network, shocked the country—and according to a new book, it wasRupert Murdochwho gave it the greenlight, with some less-than-charitable things to say about Trump!Insiderreportsthat’s forthcoming book,includes a scene in whichLachlan Murdoch,the nonagenarian billionaire’s son, got a call from Fox’s election desk saying it was ready to announce Biden had won Arizona, which he then took to the top:The book [notes] that the Murdochs—who spearhead a vast right-wing media empire—had “every reason” to delay calling Arizona at the time, given Fox’s steadfast allegiance to Trump and the fact that no other network had made the call yet. “Lachlan got his father on the phone to ask if he wanted to make the early call. His father, with signature grunt, assented, adding, ‘F--- him,’” Wolff wrote. The book [says] that Fox News anchorthen called Trump’s lead social media strategist,Jason Miller,to let him know the network was going to call Arizona for Biden. “Miller involuntarily rose from his seat. ‘What the f---?’ he said out loud, looking around and seeing the still-merry and untroubled faces in the Map Room”...Wolff wrote. Hemmer reportedly replied: “That’s what they’re doing. That’s what they’re going with.”“Who?” Miller asked.“The election desk,” Hemmer said, adding that the network’s decision was going to be aired imminently. The decision to call Arizona for Biden was a pivotal moment on election night, indicating the Democrat was poised to win the traditionally Republican-leaning state and complicating Trump’s ability to declare an early victory in the overall race.In a statement, a Fox News Media spokesperson told the Hive: ""This account is completely false.who leads the FOX News Decision Desk made the Arizona call on election night and FOX News Media PresidentJay Wallacewas then called in the control room. Any other version of the story is wildly inaccurate.” Regarding Bill Hemmer’s call to Miller, a Fox News spokesperson insisted “This never happened and is completely untrue.”Trump was unsurprisingly livid about the Arizona decision and, as my colleaguereportedat the time, personally called Murdoch “to scream about the call and demand a retraction.

A ban on abortionsafter six weeks?Anti-trans legislation? The potential disenfranchisement of millions of people? “Gelatinous tubeworm”? The Lone Star State has got it all. Per:Republican lawmakers in Texas on Thursday launched their second effort this year to pass new voting restrictions after Democrats blocked them in May with a dramatic walkout at the state Capitol. The legislature convened Thursday for a special session called by Gov.(R) to enact a laundry list of conservative priorities, including a ban of transgender athletes on youth sports teams and beefed-up border security. But Abbott has made clear that “election integrity” is a top priority, and Republicans filed bills in the House and Senate that include many of the same voting provisions they sought to enact earlier in the year.The new election proposals include a number of restrictions championed by former presidentThe measures would ban several election programs implemented last year to help people vote during the coronavirus pandemic, including drive-through voting and 24-hour and late-night voting. Voting rights advocates noted that voters of color used these programs disproportionately, meaning they could disproportionately feel the impact of the restrictions.ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofIn May, after Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout to stop a piece of legislationviewed asone of the worst voter-suppression bills in the country from becoming a law, Abbott threatened to cut off funding for the Texas Legislature,tweeting, “I will veto Article 10 of the budget passed by the legislature. Article 10 funds the legislative branch. No pay for those who abandon their responsibilities. Stay tuned.” He also vowed to pass the scuttled bill—which would restrict polling hours, make it harder to vote by mail, give more power to partisan poll watchers, and increase punishments for mistakes made by election officials—in a special session. The so-called election-security proposals are “based on a lie that there was rampant fraud in our elections, and on the ‘big lie’ that Donald Trump actually won the last election,” state Rep.who urged Texas Democrats to walk out on May 30, told the.“That’s what this is all about—so they can curry favor with Donald Trump and his supporters.

175,Out of the Shadows: New York Legalizes Adult-Use Marijuana,-6.67,46.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/31/out-of-the-shadows-albany-legalizes-marijuana-in-new-york/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-31,villagevoice,17,"Albany was all about cannabis on Tuesday, with New York lawmakers debating the issue across three committee meetings, a few more hours in the senate, and a marathon, almost seven-hour session in the assembly. This morning, Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that he had signed the three-way deal, theMarijuana Regulation and Taxation Act.For hours on Tuesday, State Senator Liz Krueger passionately defended the seven years of effort she’d devoted to New York’s legalization plan leading up to its 40-23 victory in the Senate. In the Assembly, Majority Leader Crystal D. Peoples-Stokes oversaw the day-long defense of the effort. Late in the day doubters in the senate formed what seemed like a firing line to pepper Krueger with the same questions she’d heard for the better part of a decade of working on the issue.#BREAKING: I just signed legislation legalizing adult-use cannabis.The bill creates automatic expungement of previous marijuana convictions that would now be legal.This is a historic day.I thank the Leader and Speaker and the tireless advocacy of so many.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo)March 31, 2021The Governor would applaud the efforts of Albany’s cannabis champions in an evening statement prior to singing. “Tonight, the New York State Legislature took the first step in a major leap forward for the Empire State by passing legislation to legalize adult-use cannabis,” Cuomo said. “I thank Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and the many legislators who worked tirelessly on this issue for securing passage of this historic legislation.”Cuomo went on to offer a final reminder of New York’s troubled past with cannabis enforcement on the eve of putting his signature on the bill. “For too long the prohibition of cannabis disproportionately targeted communities of color with harsh prison sentences and after years of hard work, this landmark legislation provides justice for long-marginalized communities, embraces a new industry that will grow the economy, and establishes substantial safety guards for the public,” he said.But the road to get to those congratulations yesterday was a long one.During the debate in the Senate, State Senator Fred Akshar was Kreuger’s first sparring partner. He started by questioning the bill’s stated intention to reduce violent crime. How would it accomplish this? Krueger quickly pointed to the reality that much of the drug trade in New York is currently controlled by violent criminals.“When people go to buy their marijuana they don’t know who it is they’re buying from, there’s no licensing. They don’t know if they’re organized crime,” Krueger said. “They don’t know if that same person is selling other much more dangerous drugs.”While Kreuger did not claim the bill as a fix-all to criminal elements currently involved in the cannabis supply chain, she argued that its provisions will help. “I do think that people will choose within the two options, an illegal dangerous option, and a legal regulated option, to buy marijuana through our legal regulated options,” she said, pointing to the resources that would remain after legalization to target serious threats to society. “We expect to actually save up to $500 million in our criminal justice system simply because we have legalized marijuana. So we won’t be using our police to pick up kids.”Akshar went on to question Kreuger on whether she’d been in the room for the final negotiations between the Assembly, Senate, and Governor. She said most of it had been left to staff, but she had been readily available at all hours to provide input to everyone taking part in that negotiating process until the deal got done.The conversation turned to who else was in the room for that final language deal. Akshar wanted to know if mental health professionals, substance use disorder professionals. Parent-Teacher associations, school leaders, or police officers had a seat at the table.“The answer is yes,” Kreuger replied and went on to point out how all the years at the table with those groups informed the final language. ”And it was me sometimes, and it was staff. This bill has been percolating into a bigger and bigger, and changed —and I believe better bill —for over seven years.”Kreuger reminded everyone that when she first introduced thebill in late 2013,  everyone thought she was crazy. And she said that may still be the case. “But the fact is we had hearings, we took meetings, endless, endless meetings with anyone who asked us. We met at the local level. I would go out to people’s communities if they invited me there to talk about their concerns. So, in truthfulness, I’m not sure I have ever met with as diverse a group of people as I did over the seven years that my Chief of Staff and I were working on this stuff.”Kreuger mentioned advertising restrictions and other ways to avoid appealing to children as early and easy concessions to PTA groups. Also important was leaving room for municipalities to locally opt-out of the state’s legalization plan, with the option to jump into the mix when they see fit.For much of the time, the debate in both houses centered around the impact on law enforcement. Across New York law enforcement there are only a few hundred drug recognition experts. Part of the argument revolved around law enforcement needing money upfront to get more DREs, despite the fact that the current number has already been serving New York’s millions of cannabis users, most of whom are now expected to transition to the legal market.Despite the lack of cash upfront, Kreuger argued there’s a significant amount of resources committed to make sure we have more local police and state troopers who are trained in the skills to evaluate drivers intoxicated with marijuana and getting them off the road. More understanding of the financial aspects of that process would arise as the enforcement mechanisms are developed in the next 18 months before the market opens. Kreuger also pointed to the governor’s office commitment that police have the resources they need to combat impaired driving.But again, Kreuger kept things realistic saying the DRE topic was important as she addressed these question: “I don’t want anyone listening to us to imagine that we’re starting today from a place where there is zero marijuana being used by people who drive cars, because it is being used, and they are driving throughout the state of New York.”Eventually, Senator Anthony Palumbo queried Kreuger on a variety of topics that included what happens to parents who use weed compared to alcohol use in child custody situations; the five-pound limit around homegrown pot; and police not being allowed to search a vehicle solely based on the smell of burnt marijuana.Kreuger explained that there was indeed some confusion on the five-pound limit when talking about the gross weight of the plants compared to the usable marijuana. “The five-pound example wasn’t actually a great example,” Kreuger said. “But you might have several ounces of usable marijuana in your home. That isn’t evidence that you’re using it every day. That’s not evidence that you’re using it at all, actually. So just like, I guess in some people’s houses they have cases and cases of wine or beer or other spirits. That’s not evidence of anything other than they have a lot of bottles of liquor in their home.”Another part of the bill Kreuger was questioned on came in regards to law enforcement being forbidden to cooperate with federal authorities on now state-legal cannabis crimes. The opposition, like that in 15 states before it, argued this lack of compliance with the federal law was a setup for failure. Kreuger compared it to law enforcement not cooperating with ICE deportation efforts in recent years.“I think it’s a fairly parallel situation, and every once in a while, you hear a story coming out, and something gets resolved or not, but I don’t think it’s been a huge issue,” Kreuger said, “And I don’t think it’s been a real issue in any of the other 15 states that have legal marijuana, even though they’re under the same federal laws we are.”Senator George Borrello began with concerns that the cannabis industry seemingly wouldn’t be as strict as the hospitality business in NY. Borrello explained he was deeply versed in the licensing structure meant to prevent the shady figures of New York’s past from operating liquor establishments, pointing out that a felony was almost a guaranteed rejection. He asked if the bill would really let people with drug dealing felonies operate in the legal market.“Yes, and of course a major portion of this bill is to expunge the records of people who got caught up in the criminal justice system involved with cannabis,” Kreuger said, basically asserting if those convictions don’t exist anymore they can’t have an impact on licensing. “So our goal is to expunge the records of people who had cannabis convictions and open them up to be able to be full citizens where they can apply to actually work legally in this business. Where they have no risk of problems with getting an education because they had a cannabis record, or being able to apply for certain kinds of jobs, or being able to live in certain places. So yes, part of the goal of this law is to ensure that people who may have been participating in an activity that was illegal will now be able to become taxpayers, owners, work in stores, etc.”Borrello pressured Kreuger on whether people selling other drugs or with gun charges would qualify, offenses that wouldn’t get caught up in a mass expungement sweep.  Kreuger said the agency handing out licenses determines whether they believe they can be a trustworthy, reliable business person in this field and if so then they will be allowed. And it will be through a regulatory process and evaluation.Borrello went on to ask how restaurants would be protected from edibles, adding that he has numerous concerns. “That’s because as an operator, I am responsible for you being sober. I’m responsible for your intoxication level yet someone can walk in with a handful of very potent gummies and consume them on-premise.” He proposed a situation in which people would head to bars to consume edibles, and he asked what would happen if they were to “leave that establishment, get into an accident and kill someone. In that scenario, especially with the restaurant restrictions that we now have where, you know, these people are going to be… it’s gonna be difficult to stop these people because of all the freedom that they’re going to have to consume and drive.”“Well, the irony is that exists right now,” Kreuger replied, “We don’t know when somebody comes in your bar, whether they have used marijuana before they got there, or popping other illegal drugs or not. They are wandering around the world they’re using what they use. And so we faced this risk and reality today.”Although legislators argued until 10 PM, Kreuger finally triumphed when the bill was sent to the Governors desk. Twelve hours later cannabis possession became legal in NY with the Governor’s tweet.Various advocates weighed in on this historic day. Empire State NORML Deputy Director Troy Smit said, “We stand on the shoulders of giants. It’s taken a great amount of work and perseverance by activists, patients, and consumers to go from being the cannabis arrest capital of the world to lead the world with a legalized market dedicated to equity, diversity, and inclusion.”Smit admitted things weren’t all positive, but there is plenty to work with. “This might not be the perfect piece of legislation, but today, cannabis consumers can hold their heads high and smell the flowers,” Smit said. “Senator Krueger and Assemblywoman Peoples-Stokes have laid the groundwork for marijuana justice and a consumer-centric industry. Now, it’s time for the Office of Cannabis Management to take up their torch and implement regulations that protect patient and consumer rights. In the words of our late Director, Doug Greene — Cannabis Excelsior!”NORML’s national leadership also weighed in on the big victory. “These votes are historic because they signal the beginning of the end of the racially discriminatory policies that have long made the Empire State the marijuana arrest capital of the United States, if not the world,” said Erik Altieri, NORML Executive director. “Once enacted, this measure will end the practice of annually arresting tens-of-thousands of New Yorkers for low-level marijuana offenses, the majority of whom are overwhelmingly young, poor, and people of color.”The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) represents workers in New York’s medical cannabis industry. RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and John Durso, President of Local 338 RWDSU weighed in on the new opportunities for working-class New Yorkers. “Today, in passing the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the New York State legislature took enormous strides toward ending the decades-long war on drugs and its discriminatory impact on people of color,” Appelbaum said. “The legislature listened to calls by workers and advocates to create an industry centered on equity. From the creation of a social equity fund to requiring labor peace for cannabis license holders, this places New York on the forefront of social equity nationally. We thank the legislature for prioritizing the needs of workers and the community and look forward to swift signature into law.”Durso spoke to how important he believes organized labor will be in helping New Yorkers get the most out of the forthcoming pot industry. “Local 338, New York’s cannabis union, has organized almost 500 workers in the medical cannabis industry in New York, setting standards across the industry that benefit workers and their families,” Durso stated. “Our contracts in the medical cannabis industry have established full-time careers with family-sustaining wages, affordable and quality health care, workplace health and safety standards, funding for retirement, and more.” He added,“It is our priority that the 30,000-60,000 jobs created in our State’s adult-use industry meet the same standard as those in the medical cannabis industry. The MRTA will help to do just that, by ensuring access to opportunity at every level of this brand-new industry, including for the thousands of New Yorkers who will be entering it as workers.”   ❖More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from theeditorial department, which does not accept paid links.Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

Andrew Cuomo. Hiya, soon-to-be Gov. Kathy Hochul.Cuomo did the unexpected Tuesday when heannounced he would resignunder the weight of sexual harassment allegations. Combative to the end, the governor blamed politics, not himself, for his downfall. But even he couldn’t bend the reality that he had lost the confidenceof New Yorkersand his fellow Democrats.Corneredby his accusers andabandonedby his allies, Cuomo did the right thing by quitting.Wenever thoughtwe’d see it.Technically, we still haven’t. The governor said he would resign in 14 days to ensure a smooth transition to his lieutenant governor, Hochul. The grace period seems unnecessary. Hochul is well-prepared to take over.Hochul,62, a native of Buffalo and a graduate of Syracuse University, has long experience in government. She was a county clerk, a member of Congress and, for the past six and a half years, Cuomo’s emissary to every corner of the state.In many respects, Hochul is the anti-Cuomo.While the governor hunkered down in Albany or New York City,Hochul traveledto all 62 counties to cut ribbons, meet people and introduce herself to local officials. Her talent for retail politics made her friends in every part of the state, including New York City.She showed surprising electoral strength Downstate. In the 2014 Democratic primary, HochulbeatColumbia University law professor Tim Wu, a progressive. In 2018, she thwarted Cuomo’s effort to dump her from the ticket bydefeatingBrooklyn councilor Jumaane Williams in a primary. No other statewide elected officials come from Upstate.Hochul will be the first woman to become governor of New York. She will be the first Upstater since Republican Nathan L. Miller, from Solon, Cortland County, was elected in 1920. Cuomo bragged that he did more for Upstate than any previous governor — and rightly so — but the bar was pretty low. Who’s to say someone from Upstate won’t do more? New York City remains the center of gravity of New York politics. Hochul should provide a counterweight.Her detractors on the right point to her tendency to flip-flop on key issues, depending on the audience. Her detractors on the left say she is too moderate. Few would argue with Cuomo’s description of her as “smart and competent.” Hochul has a little over a year to show what she can do before having to face the voters in 2022.People who know Hochul say it is a mistake to underestimate her tenacity and political savvy — traits she honed as astudent activist at Syracuse University.New Yorkers are counting on her to change the tenor in Albany.Hochul’s immediate challenge upon taking office is to clean up thetoxic atmospherein the Executive Chamber, as revealed in Attorney General Letitia James’ sexual harassment investigation.Hochul also has decisions to make about retaining or replacing Cuomo allies in powerful appointed positions at Empire State Development, the Metropolitan Transit Authority and state agencies.This is in addition to her main job(s): leading the state out of the Covid-19 pandemic, managing the economic recovery, working with the Legislature to balance a state budget saddled with out-year deficits, and stemming the exodus of New Yorkers to other states.After 10 years of Cuomo’s secretiveness, bullying and casual relationship to ethics, we urge Hochul to lead the state with integrity, transparency and a collaborative spirit.Cuomo may leave office, but he must not evade accountability. Cuomo still facesvarious investigationsinto the sexual harassment allegations, a promisedcivil lawsuitfor allegedly retaliating against an accuser, and probes into the undercounting of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and the allegeduse of state resourcesto produce his Covid leadership book. The authorities should see these investigations through to their conclusion.Editorials represent the collective opinion of the Advance Media New York editorial board.

That’s his re-election platform — nonsense. Among other points, Trump claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden should drop out of the presidential race because of the unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens that Trump’s cronies have been pushing. A report released by Senate Republicans just this weekfailed to confirmthat the Biden family financial relationships in question had any impact whatsoever on U.S. foreign policy, as Trump previously alleged.Summary of the first segment of Trump's Fox News Radio interview:– Baseless claims about Biden– Baseless claims about mail ballots– Boasts about how Mike and Chris Wallace like him, in part because he gave/gives them good ratings— Daniel Dale (@ddale8)September 24, 2020Trump said:‘I look at Hunter Biden, where he stole millions of dollars. Stole millions! His father should leave the campaign, because his father was in on it, his father knew everything — far more than we thought in Ukraine, far more than we thought in China, and now other countries are added. Look at what’s going on! The newspapers don’t even want to write about it, except the New York Post has it on the front page, which is great — good old New York Post is great. They should get the Pulitzer.’Trump is lying. Hunter Biden did not “steal millions of dollars,” and his father — Joe Biden — did not “know everything.” Hunter Biden had globe-spanning financial/ business entanglements, and these entanglements had no documented impact on the foreign policy of the U.S. while Joe Biden was vice president. These are the facts.Trump is lying about mail-in ballots on Fox Radio. He keeps lying about them. There is no evidence to support his lies. Mail-in ballots are safe.— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)September 24, 2020Listen to Trump’s comments below:Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that ballots that had “Trump written on them” were found in a garbage can, and he tried to present this dubiously characterized anecdote as evidence that mail-in ballots are a “horror show.” He couldn’t even name the state where this apparent incident took place — he said it happened in a “certain state” — and he struggled on other basic facts too. Voters don’t generally write the names of the candidates they’re voting for on their ballots; they fill in bubbles or maybe boxes, although yes, discarded ballots were recently discovered that had been filled out to support Trump.Still, the fact that a ballot happened to be thrown in with trash (or something along those lines) does not, in any respect, mean that there was some kind of fraud. Maybe the voters messed up their choices and wanted to request new ballots. If that happened — then voila, no fraud.A press release about the issuefrom the Justice Department doesn’t have a lot of details, and it certainly doesn’t have evidence of a conspiracy.Trump tells Brian Kilmeade on ""Fox News Radio"" that ""these ballots are a horror show.""pic.twitter.com/6MppvzWvD4— Talking Points Memo (@TPM)September 24, 2020No related posts.",1

Bossing folks around is, after all, a lot more fun than being bossed around. So, it's refreshing to see in this deeply divided country at least tentative steps towards bipartisan agreement that not every issue should be settled by dictates issued from the nation's capital. As encouraging as it is, though, this grudging acceptance of live-and-let-live doesn't go far enough.""American federalism has always been a partisan issue — the GOP are the modern advocates,""notesDemocratic political adviser and former legislator Frank Pignanelli in theDeseret News. ""But the left-leaning have reason to be equally suspicious of overreaching nationalism on key issues: privacy, immigration, environment, etc.""Pignanelli joined with Republican counterpart LaVarr Webb to warn of frantic pandemic-era spending and rules-making by first the Trump and then the Biden administrations. ""[T]his immense federal intervention comes at the risk of making states even more subservient to the federal government, both financially and with more federal regulation and mandates.""Pignanelli isn't the first Democrat to discover the attractions of decentralization.""In the wake of the presidential election, as Democrats realized that Republicans will soon control all three branches of the federal government, progressives disinclined to secede from the Union rediscovered another exit strategy: states' rights,"" Jeffrey RosenwroteforThe New York Timesin 2016. Democrats spent the next several years battling for local governance against the Trump administration's insistence on federal control over matters such asimmigrationandmarijuana.Since then, Democrats have recaptured the presidency, the House, and (sort of) the Senate. Now they're back to insisting that beltway preferences should prevail—at least when their party's positions on issues such asgunsandtaxesdiffer with local preferences.This back-and-forthing on the value of local control vs. central supremacy is exhausting, not to mention overtly opportunistic. As Pignanelli adds, with Webb's agreement, ""Federalism must be a bipartisan issue. Otherwise, it will continue to be subject to the inconsistent whims of elections.""To some extent, this opportunism is baked into American politics, argued Ernest A. Young, then of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, in a2004Brooklyn Law Reviewarticleabout attitudes towards federalism during the War on Terror. He saw switching preferences on central vs. local power as inherent to a system in which elections are won and lost, rotating factions through control of the federal government and localities. ""Federalism is about dividing power; nothing much depends on what the power in question is being used for,"" Young wrote.But ""[i]t is also about providing institutional space for a diversity of political views"" and so is inherently important beyond its utility to whoever lost the last federal election. State and local autonomy functions ""as a rallying point for political opposition to national policy"" and ""assures that a particular faction cannot become entrenched and unaccountable in power.""Or, as Webb put it in theDeseret News, ""On issues like gun control and the minimum wage, why not let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York? Half of congressional dysfunction could be eliminated by modestly accepting the diversity of our country.""That political differences are coming into dangerous conflict is obvious not just from the formal contests observed by Pignanelli, Webb, and Young, but from the national tensions and strife of recent years. Februarypolling by CBS News/YouGovfound that 57 percent of Republicans think of Democrats not as political opponents, but as ""enemies""; 41 percent of Democrats return the sentiment.""The country is increasingly split into camps that don't just disagree on policy and politics — they see the other as alien, immoral, a threat,"" Nate CohncommentedinThe New York Timeslast month. It's not an unprecedented problem, he notes, and other countries that have divided into mutually loathing camps have kept the peace and held together through arrangements including ""power-sharing agreements, devolution or home rule.""Power-sharing, devolution, or home rule sounds a lot like federalism, come to think of it, and for good reason. Decentralization of power reduces the danger that people will resent top-down decisions that are contrary to their own preferences – and that may even be maliciously intended to hurt ""enemies"" in a sectarian society. If you believe that people of varied values and preferences shouldn't be forced to live in lockstep, it makes sense to embrace ""space for a diversity of political views"" and to largely ""let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York.""But the federalism of the Constitution was designed for a nation of about4 million people; many states and evensome countiesare now more populous than the whole country was at the founding. Are you really allowing free range for diverse views by devolving control down to the level of aCaliforniaor aTexasthat each contain multitudes sufficient to entertain many more conflicting ideas than the original United States could have contemplated? EvenLos Angeles County, with 10 million people, is far larger than the entire United States of 1790.At this point,realfederalism, through the devolution of power, requires more than paying lip service to the existence of states and their ability to set independent policies. Decision-making has to go further down the food chain, at least to the county level, to revive something like the federalism of the Constitution. To the extent possible, power shoulddevolve to individualswhose right to make their own decisions and govern their own lives should be respected. Individual self-rule is about as pure an expression of the distributed power embodied by federalism as you'll find.Failing that, the major parties will continue to pretend that they care about federalism when they've lost control of Washington, D.C., and discard their faith in the principle when they've regained a grip on the central political apparatus.

Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is under pressure to support filibuster reform in the Senate.Nearly the moment that votes were tallied in Georgia, formalizing Democratic control of the Senate, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin began to object: to $2,000 stimulus checks—which even President Biden himself pledged to pass—to filibuster reform, to the size of the stimulus package, to passing it via budget reconciliation. Manchin, who frequently voted with President Trump, wanted to make it clear that he would be a willing obstacle to the Democratic agenda, according to his own whims and fancies.Just a handful of days later, in a series of media appearances both national and local, Manchin vocalized an openness to checks, to the bigger spending package, and to passing it without Republican support. He even wavered ever so slightly on the filibuster.What changed? A series of radio spots went up in the state, paid for and produced by No Excuses PAC, a group founded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alums Corbin Trent and Saikat Chakrabarti and Justice Democrats co-founder Zack Exley. The ads identified Manchin as the obstruction standing between West Virginians and desperately needed relief. PerThe Intercept’s Aída Chávez, Manchin was “getting pounded at home by a brutal radio ad.” And, not inconsequentially, he changed his tune.Now, No Excuses is launching its second pressure campaign, targeting intransigent Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin to showcase her willingness to be an obstacle, and grab some of that spotlight from Manchin as the foremost Democratic opponent of filibuster reform in the Senate. And unlike Manchin, she’s doing it from a purple state Joe Biden won in 2020.The group is up with radio ads across the state of Arizona, informing voters that their senator is one of Washington’s top obstructionists. It hammers Sinema not just on her support of the filibuster, but on the broad embrace of inaction that the filibuster necessitates. “She seems to think the Senate needs to do more talking and less doing,” said Trent, co-founder of the group and the voice-over artist on the ad spot. “Countless hours of partisan bickering and back-and-forth, they don’t prevent one case of COVID, they don’t stop one death, they don’t create one job,” the ad asserts. “It’s time Kyrsten Sinema stood up for the people and stood against the filibuster.”The new ad is part of a multi-week multimedia campaign in Arizona. No Excuses has also taken out ad space in, the state’s largest newspaper, to drive home the message. And this time, the messaging comes with a recruiting pitch: No Excuses is looking for candidates who could primary Sinema from the left when her term is up in 2024.The strategy is a new addition to Democratic politics, where it has not been commonplace to hit representatives back home for their work in Washington outside of an election cycle. While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with its six-year terms, is more sheltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping this strategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be. “We’ve gotta create a little political gravity on that side of them,” said Trent.Sinema’s stubbornness is especially confounding, at least compared to Manchin, given the respective political contexts of their states. Manchin is one of the only Democrats left at any level in arguably the country’s reddest state, one that has run away from Democrats at an astonishing pace. While Arizona can credibly be called purple, Joe Biden won the state in November, and it now sports Democrats in both of its Senate seats. Arizona’s fast-growing metropolitan areas and large Latino population, combined with significant organizing networks and popular movement groups, mean it’s a state where the progressive agenda has purchase now, and it will likely have even more in the future. The state recently legalized recreational marijuana and passed a substantial taxincreaseon high earners via ballot measure.Sinema won in 2018, a wave election for Democrats, who rebuked Trumpism and overachieved all over the country. She beat extremely unpopular Republican Martha McSally, who went on to lose to Democrat Mark Kelly two years later for the state’s other Senate seat. Sinema, a former Green Party member who then became a conservative Democratic vote in the House, portrayed herself in the campaign as an independent. But the notion that a maverick Democrat can only win in Arizona through a willingness to defy the party’s priorities makes little sense in the current political climate. Most importantly, said Trent, it brings “very little benefit for the people she represents,” which is the message Arizonans are now hearing over the airwaves.Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin to showcase her willingness to be an obstacle.In some sense, the No Excuses operation buttresses the Biden administration’s, and helps the president and party enact their agenda. Bidendispatched Vice President Kamala Harristo West Virginia for a media tour and pressure campaign of their own, hoping to drum up public support to sway Manchin. (Harris, who is not popular in West Virginia, did a clumsy job of it, talking about “abandoned land mines” instead of “abandoned mine land” when extending an olive branch to coal country.) If the party had better message discipline or could be counted on to vote the party line as Republicans do, none of this would be necessary. But that’s not the Democratic Party that exists.So far, the inside-outside game seems to be working, at least in a limited fashion. Manchin has not had a total political epiphany. Justyesterday, he did a YouTube live stream where he refused to support ending the filibuster and championed the legacy and reputation of notorious segregationist Robert Byrd as a roundabout way of supporting the Byrd Rule and the filibuster’s broad scope. And he appears to be themain obstacleto increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour within the COVID relief package. But he’s fallen in line on the overall bill, which was in no way a certainty. Even Republican West Virginia governor Jim Justice recently called on him to support the bigger stimulus package.Whether it will be enough to change Sinema’s tune is yet to be seen. But already, frustration is mounting in Arizona. Activist groups made up an important part of the coalition that helped Sinema across the finish line just over two years ago, and they’ve made their displeasure with her stance on the filibuster known.It’s clear that it will be harder for Democrats to hide behind claims of Republican obstruction, when they are well within their abilities to enact meaningful legislation. Doing so immediately is a top priority, given the fragile trifecta Democrats currently sport. With redistricting looming and a fearsome 2022 midterm cycle, inaction would be tantamount to suicide for Joe Biden’s agenda. If Sinema and Manchin, under threat of relentless public pressure, do come around, it will mark another lesson from the mistakes of the Obama years that Democrats seem to be learning, grudgingly.",1
181,How to Find a Covid-19 Vaccine Appointment in Your Area,-3.0,47.67,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-find-a-covid-19-vaccine/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-06,wired,25,"Omicron's rise hasbeen abrupt and startling. Like Delta, the WHO's director-generalsaid earlier this month, Omicron causes infections severe enough to lead to hospitalization and death, particularly among unvaccinated people. You should take every opportunity to protect yourself and your loved ones from it, and the latest shield available to you is a booster shot.Booster shots, like initial doses of the vaccination, may not completely prevent you from contracting Covid-19., and if you do catch a breakthrough case of Covid-19, you're far less likely to end up in the hospital with a severe infection.More thandosesof Covid-19 vaccines have been given worldwide since the pandemic began. The three vaccines used in the US—Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson—have been taken by hundreds of millions of people around the world by now, and they've been found to be safe and effective. In short, theycannot get you sickwith Covid-19.Vaccinations have led humanity out of many of history's most devastating diseases, such as polio, smallbox, and measles, and the Covid-19 vaccines—along with social distancing, masks, and smart policy decisions regarding reopening businesses—will beour path forwardto living with Covid long-term. States, territories, and our one state-like district (DC) all have wide latitude to set their own Covid-19 policies and procedures. Advice and paths to a Covid-19 vaccine are going to differ based on which part of the US you live in, but we've put together a guide that should give you an accurate overview of how to get the jab.All American adults, regardless of occupation or preexisting health conditions, areable to sign upfor a booster appointment. At least five months must have elapsed since your primary Pfizer-BioNTech or your Moderna series, and at least two months after your Johnson & Johnson.Children age 12 and up are eligibleare also eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. If, and only if, a child aged 5 and up is moderately or severely immunocompromised, they can also receive a Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot.There's no federal or nationally centralized list onto which you sign up for a booster shot. Each state, territory, and freely associated state has sign-up information available on its own health department website. Odds are that a vaccine appointment is already available near you. About 90 percent of the population in the US has a vaccine sitewithin 5 miles of where they live..Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonSome health department sites are more helpful than others, offering telephone hotlines, statewide sign-up lists, and eligibility checkers that will say whether you can get a vaccine yet if you answer a few questions about your age, gender, profession, and health conditions. Other states merely direct you to a list of vaccination providers to call yourself.Check outVaccines.gov(formerly VaccineFinder), built by Boston Children's Hospital and the CDC, to locate available vaccines near you, andfollow its Twitter accountfor updates. Other places to check include:Vaccination sites let you make an appointment so that you can be sure you're not in for a long wait when you arrive. Now that vaccines are widely available, it's fine to walk in without an appointment. It's not guaranteed they'll have space, though, so if you want to make sure you won't have a long wait, make an appointment beforehand.A government-provided vaccination site, such as a community health center or public health department, might be the safest option if you're worried about surprise medical bills or don't want to reveal your citizenship or immigration status. They tend to be free, too. In our research and experience, we found that many say they don't ask for health insurance information or immigration status on their websites. Check with your local facilities to make sure.Most states also run mobile vaccination units, a broad catchall term for pop-up tents, buses, and trailers that are regularly driven to different locations. They typically show up in areas where residents have limited ability to go to a vaccination site, such as low-income neighborhoods, nursing homes, and rural areas.While a state or city's website for government facilities might only drop new appointment openings on certain days or at certain times, private companies operating in those states aren't held to the same schedule. Each company seems to have a different time at which they drop new appointments, so openings are scattered across the day.Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonLike the initial vaccines, booster shots are typically covered by your health insurance, but it pays to check with your provider and the office before you commit to an appointment. Surprise bills are a problem in this country.Private practices and retail locations, such as pharmacies, usually require you to bring anandhealth insurance cardand may ask for the name of your primary care physician. Vaccination sites run by government services, such as at community health centers and public health departments, don't typically ask for health insurance info, but you may needproof of state residency.Depending on your state, it may be possible to use school records, samples of mail addressed to you, or a statement from another person as a substitute for a government-issued ID. But be sure to check with the specific vaccination site you've decided upon.In the United States, the three booster vaccines available to the public right nowvia emergency authorization by the FDAare from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen.TheCDC recommendsthe Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots over the Johnson & Johnson. ABritish studypublished in the Lancet compared the immune responses of six vaccines, including the three vaccines available in the US, and found that the mRNA vaccines—Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—provided the strongest protection, although all six booster vaccines did increase immune system protection. It is also safe to mix and match your primary and booster vaccine.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasgranted full approvalto the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots continue under Emergency Use Authorization. Moderna has requested full approval, and Johnson & Johnson says they plan to request full approval within the year.Vaccination sites typically tell you which brand of booster shot is available and let you choose when scheduling. It takes two weeks after your booster shot for your body to build up its maximum defenses, so remember that until then your body is still building up its immune system protection.The CDC also offers advice onwhat to expect at your vaccination appointment. You may get asked if you've been exposed to Covid-19 or shown any symptoms lately, and the facility should ask you to sit and wait for a period of15 minutesafter getting your vaccine to ensure you don't have a severe reaction, or 30 minutes if you've had a reaction to a vaccine or injection before. You should also be given a card that tells you the vaccine you got and the date (keep it).After your vaccination, you cansign up for V-safe, the CDC's Health Checkerwebsite. It will send you phone notifications to fill out an easy survey in the days and weeks after getting your vaccine, asking about any symptoms you've experienced and notifying you when you should get your second dose.A few warnings:Don't get any other vaccinationsin the 14 days before or after your Covid-19 vaccination. Don't preemptively take new medications before vaccination, even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, or stop taking your normal medications before your appointment; talk to a doctor before the appointment and tell them what you're on, though. They may have some advice for you.Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonEven if you've already had Covid-19, your antibodies won't last forever. Youshould still get vaccinatedwhen you can. Plus, theprotection you receive from a vaccination isthan the protection you get from having had Covid-19. If you had Covid-19a vaccination, then that's even stronger. I was a healthy guy who hit the gym regularly and had no existing health conditions, but Covid knocked me flat on my ass for five weeks in 2020 before there were any vaccines available. I was only 31.Protection isn't immediate after a shot. It takesabout two weeksafter Moderna's or Pfizer-BioNTech's second shot, and two weeks after the single Johnson & Johnson shot for your body's immune system to reach its maximum strength against the virus. Johnson & Johnson is currently testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, but the findings aren't ready yet, and so it's only being given as a one-dose shot at this time. In its clinical trial, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a lower overall efficacy than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, but all three are great atpreventing severe cases of Covid-19that would lead to hospitalization or death.On April 25, 2021 the USresumed administeringthe Johnson & Johnson vaccine afterpausing it on April 13, 2021to investigate a possible link between it and a rare type of blood clot that can appear within two weeks of being given the shot. There have been half a dozen or so reportedcases of complicationsout of the 17.8 million doses administered in the US.The CDC recommends that you bring your original vaccination card when you show up for your booster, as many vaccination sites will ask for either the card or a photograph of the card. Your vaccine provider will double-check to make sure thatfive months has elapsedsince your primary series, and add all your information—vaccination site, date, time, brand of booster vaccine, and details on the production batch of booster you received—to your previous doses' information in one place..Many venues, restaurants, bars, and methods of travel require proof of vaccination now. You need to keep your card safe so that you can use it as a pass. Carrying your physical card with you everywhere might be risky. Many cities and states have their own Covid pass apps for iPhones and Androids so that you can have your Covid pass information always handy without risking your physical card. There's also the nationwideCommonPassapp.Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonDon't laminate your vaccination card. Stick it in a Ziploc if you're worried about keeping it safe, and put it somewhere you know you'll be able to find it in three or four weeks when you're due for your second dose. If you lose your card, you can go back to the site and get another one printed off. Take a picture of it so that you have the information as a backup, just in case.some side effectsto the vaccines, butallergic reactionsare rare.If you've had allergic reactions to vaccines before, tell the person giving the vaccination as soon as you arrive. They'll probably ask you to hang around for a little while after the shot, just to make sure.Here's alist of vaccine myths and factsthat slaps down the persistent lies floating around social media and conspiracy websites. For example, the vaccines will not alter your DNA or make it unsafe for you to have a baby. They also won't make you magnetic.Even after you are fully vaccinated, keep wearing a mask in public (or get one). The CDC hasupdated its recommendation for vaccinated people to wear masksindoors and in certain other situations, as the risk level has changed since mask rules were relaxed earlier this year. Masking up keeps everybody—even you—safer.Finally, if there are folks in your life who might need help getting vaccinated, share the knowledge and give them a hand. Every vaccination makes us all a little bit safer.",2
182,"What Trump's Facebook, Google and Twitter lawsuits really mean for his campaign",-10.0,41.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/what-trump-s-facebook-google-twitter-lawsuits-really-mean-his-n1273319,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-07,msnbc,25,"In a move familiar to anyone who has witnessed a schoolyard bully react to being thrown out of a game for violating the rules, former President Donald Trump is lashing out.Trump’s primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law.Trump on Wednesday announced that he issuing Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube, as well as their respective CEOs for, well, following their own rules and kicking him off their platforms. He’s done so on behalf of himself and “similarly situated” people in an attempt to wage a class-action suit against the social media giants.Trump’s primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law.The suit is predicated on the assumption that in booting Trump, these companies violated his First Amendment rights. TheFirst Amendmentprovides that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” This prohibition applies not just to Congress (and federal laws), but also toall government representatives and agents. This means that someone who is a member of any level of government — local, state or federal — cannot restrict your freedom of speech (with some limited exceptions).Trump’s main difficulty here is that Facebook, Twitter and Google, while indisputably powerful, are private companies, not part of the government. When social media companies act, it is a private action, not government action. Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition can’t trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can do so.Surely, you say to yourselves, the former president of the United States and his lawyers must know about this fundamental flaw in their lawsuit? Well, yes — but Trump attempts to argue that the companies should be treated as state agencies who can, in fact, violate their individual users’ First Amendment rights.Namely, the suit claims because these companies benefit from the protections of a federal law, the 1996 Communications Decency Act, that Democratic legislators (who are, in fact, state actors) had special leverage over Facebook, Twitter and Google. Trump then argues that because the companies “are vulnerable to and react to coercive pressure from the federal government to regulate specific speech,” they were coerced into “censoring the specific speech at issue in this lawsuit and de-platforming” him. And, the suit continues, making a reference to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that because the companies were “acting in concert with federal officials, including officials at the CDC and the Biden transition,” their “censorship activities amount to state action.”Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition can’t trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can do so.Unsatisfied after introducing just one erroneous legal argument, Trump then specifically calls on the court to strike downSection 230 of the Communications Decency Actas unconstitutional. (It isn’t.)The act, which dates back to 1996 when the internet was in its infancy, largely protects online sites from liability based on what their users say on those sites and for their decisions about content moderation.None of this demonstrates that private companies have magically transformed into government actors. No, these arguments have enough holes to drive a Mack truck right through them.In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. Facebook, Twitter and Google have their own First Amendment rights to set the terms of their platforms’ use, free of government intrusion. Each company is also free to exclude users from its platforms for things like, oh, let’s hypothetically sayinciting an insurrection.Let’s pause for a moment and remember that Trump was the leader of the federal government when he claims that the actions of private companies, who tossed them off their platforms, violated his First Amendment rights. (That ringing you hear is the sound of irony calling.)In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here.So, Trump’s arguments are legally invalid and at times nonsensical. We have to ask ourselves: What is this lawsuit really about? It’s not about the law — it’s about politics. All 44 pages are just a political argument dressed in legal clothes. Facebook, Twitter and Google offered Trump a significant megaphone. In the span of a few days, he went from being able to broadcast his message with three of the world’s most powerful bullhorns to being reduced to a whisper. His rallies, packed as they may be, are no substitute for the reach of social media.Trump’s megaphone has not only been diminished, but perhaps just as important, his fundraising tools have also dulled. Social media platforms provided Trump with the easy ability to raise campaign donations directly and indirectly. Campaign rallies do not offer attendees the same ability to “click here to make a donation.”And if you wondered whether this is all really about raising political donations, take a gander at the fundraising pleas that GOP committees sent outmoments after Trump filed his suits.We should all recognize that these suits are unmoored from any cognizable theory. They will not succeed in courtrooms.But will they succeed in further persuading Trump’s base that Big Tech companies have engaged in a conspiracy against Trump and other Republicans? Maybe. And that is a problem that can’t be solved by a federal judge dismissing these suits.Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the ""Passing Judgment"" podcast.

183,Whiteness helps shield Donald Trump from election consequences,-19.33,24.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/whiteness-helps-shield-donald-trump-election-consequences-n1274244,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,msnbc,25,"Hervis Rogers, a 62-year-old Black man, waited over six hours to vote in Texas’ Democratic primary in March 2020. “I figured like it was my duty to vote. I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion,” hetold a CNN reporterat the time. “And I wasn't going to let nothing stop me.”Now,Rogers faces up to 20 years in prisonfor voting while on parole — despite not knowing he was technically ineligible to vote at the time.Around the time of the primary, former President Donald Trump was already laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the 2020 election,casting doubt on the security of mail-in ballots. Culminatingwith a speechin Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, Trump knowingly incited that day's act ofdomestic terrorism, as theFBI has defined it, in an attempt to nullify the votes of millions of Americans. Yet, he is facing zero criminal charges.There is, clearly, a disparity between the scope of both crime and punishment here.This injustice is even more appalling when you look at the facts of Rogers’ case. His lawyer has stated that Rogers did not know it was illegal to vote while on parole. In fact,The Washington Post reportedthat in at least 20 states, it’s not a crime to vote while on parole. Also, Rogers was arrested the day before theTexas Legislature began its special session, which Texas’ governor called to enact sweeping voter suppression laws.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who ordered the arrest and himself isunder indictment for felony fraudcharges,tweeted after Rogers’ arrest: “Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under TX law. ... I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!” (But Paxton has said the allegations against him are politically motivated and has denied any wrongdoing, according toThe Texas Tribune.)Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid the same penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct.Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid the same penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct.For example, in Pennsylvania,Trump supporter Bruce Bartmancompleted a request for a mail-in ballot so his mother could vote in the 2020 election. The only problem was his mother had died 12 years before. But Bartman, 70, was so dedicated to helping Trump that he wanted to vote for him twice. (He actually tried to vote for Trump three times by alsoregistering his mother-in-law as a Republican, despite the fact that she was also dead.)In the end, Bartman was able to vote in his late mother’s name. An investigation followed, and Bartman was charged. He ultimately pleaded guilty in April to perjury and unlawful voting. His punishment for his intentional scheme of voter fraud: five years of probation.This atrocious disparity is also clear in therecent caseof RepublicanEdward Snodgrass, who serves as a local elected official in Ohio. After an election worker questioned the signature on a ballot submitted in the name of Snodgrass’ father, Snodgrass admitted his father had died before the absentee ballot had arrived and that he had forged his deceased father’s signature.Snodgrass was initially charged with afourth-degree felonythat could have resulted in six months in jail, but instead he was offered andagreed to a plea dealof a $500 fine and serving three days in local jail.Compare that to the case of Crystal Mason, a Black woman in Texas who in 2016 attempted to vote while on supervised release afterserving five years in prison. After her mother urged her to vote, Mason headed to the polls not knowing she was ineligible. Mason’s name didn’t appear on the voting rolls, so she submitted a provisional ballot that was never even counted. What was her punishment for simply casting a provisional ballot that was never counted?Five years in prison. That case is now onappeal to Texas' highest court for criminal caseswhile she is out of jail on bond.Now stop to consider the even more mind-blowing fact thatover 500 people have been chargedfor trying to “stop the steal” as Trump demanded of them — yet he walks free. And alarmingly for our nation, Trump is nowback on the roadspewing the same lies that incited the Jan. 6 attack and openly defending the terrorists who attacked the Capitol in his name.As a lawyer this literally makes no sense to me. As an American, it outrages me to see this glaring injustice since we all know that if Trump was Black or Muslim (or both!) he would already be, rightfully, charged with various crimes.Rogers and Mason may end up in prison for years for unknowingly voting while ineligible, while Trump knowingly incited an act of domestic terrorism to overturn the votes of millions of Americans and not only walks free but is being celebrated by the GOP.This is beyond white privilege. This is dangerously toxic white supremacy that will very possibly lead to more violence unless Trump is brought to justice.

185,Missouri voters narrowly approve Medicaid expansion,-3.33,49.33,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-narrowly-approve-medicaid-expansion/article_197d1897-5978-5daa-b9dc-3017e3a0ae06.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/st-louis-post-dispatch/,2020-08-05,stltoday,19,"JEFFERSON CITY — Ignoring pleas from Republican leaders, Missouri voters approved a plan Tuesday to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 230,000 low-income people in the state.Missouri voted to expand its Medicaid program, as 53% of voters supported the measure. Missouri now joins 37 other states that have already expanded the federally subsidized health insurance program.The decision will mean adults between the ages of 19 and 65 whose income is at or below 138% of the federal poverty level will be covered. As of this year, that amounts to $17,608 for an individual and $36,156 for a household of four.The vote comes after repeated rejections by the GOP-controlled Legislature after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 allowed states to expand who can get coverage.The constitutional amendment marks the latest setback for Republicans when it comes to ballot initiatives. Voters also approved a minimum wage hike and rejected a right-to-work law pushed by former Gov. Eric Greitens in 2018.“Our campaign couldn’t have happened without the work of countless Missourians across the state who have been working towards expanding Medicaid for years. We would not be here today without the hard work of so many for so long. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank everyone who has worked toward this moment,” organizers of the Yes on 2 campaign said in a Facebook message Tuesday night.The federal government now covers about 65% of Medicaid costs, while the rest comes from the state. But populations covered under Medicaid expansion would have 90% covered by federal funding.An analysis by the Washington University-basedCenter for Health Economics and Policyfound that expansion would add 231,000 adults and 40,500 children to the rolls, costing the state $118 million a year. But that additional cost would be offset by savings elsewhere, as well as an increase in tax revenue because of a boost in spending on health care services. The bottom line: Missouri would save $39 million a year by expanding the program. Supporters also say the increase in federal money flowing to doctors, hospitals and other providers could spur the creation of thousands of jobs.A fiscal note filed by Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat running for governor, suggests the expansionwill either save $1 billion or cost $200 million.BJC HealthCare president and CEORichard Liekwegearlier told the Post-Dispatch that he believes Medicaid expansion would be an economic boost for the state.“It’ll keep small, rural hospitals open that are operating on a thread of an operating margin today,” Liekweg said. “For large systems — like BJC, SSM, St. Luke’s in Kansas City, CoxHealth in Springfield, Mercy Health — it will allow us to continue to keep all of our doors and access points open.”Hospitals bankrolled the “Yes on 2” campaign with more than $10 million in contributions.In the week leading up to the vote, opponents said the added cost would result in less funding for schools, universities and other social service programs.Gov. Mike Parson warned the strain of the pandemic on state coffers made it the wrong time to expand.“I don’t think it’s the time to be expanding anything in the state of Missouri right now. There’s absolutely not going to be any extra money whatsoever,” the Republican governor said.But other states that have expanded the program haven’t seen a massive drain on their budgets. Rather, studies have found that expansions resulted in reductions in uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, which has helped stabilized struggling, rural hospitals.In neighboring Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in January 2014, a2015 Gallup reportshowed the state’s uninsured rate had been cut roughly in half, dropping from 22.5% to 11.4% ― the biggest reduction in the nation.Get local news delivered to your inbox!Jefferson City reporter",2

A blood test confirmed the presence of carisoprodol (a pain killer) and lorazepam (a sleep medication) in her system at the time of the incident.The young Biden will serve five months probation, counting 20 days in rehab toward her sentence. She will also be required to log 12 hours of community service, and pay $2,000 in fines in addition to legal fees. Her license was also suspended for a year.This is not Biden's first run in with the law. She was previously convicted in New York of running a $110,000 credit card scam, and in 2013 she was charged with resisting arrest after allegedly assaulting a police officer in New York.",1
187,"Decade After WikiLeaks Published Iraq War Logs, Assange Is In Prison",-13.0,44.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/10/22/ten-years-wikileaks-published-iraq-war-logs/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,shadowproof,22,"The Iraq War Logs published by WikiLeaks revealed 15,000 civilian deaths that were previously unknown. They also exposed torture that the United States military instructed officers to ignore.“In our release of these 400,000 documents about the Iraq War, the intimate detail of that war from the U.S. perspective,” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange hoped to correct some of the attacks on the truth that occurred “before the war, during the war, and which [had] continued on since the war officially concluded.”“The stated aims for going into that war, of improving the human rights situation, improving the rule of law, did not eventuate,” Assange added. “In terms of raw numbers of people arbitrarily killed, [that] worsened the situation in Iraq.”Ten years after their release, Assange is in Belmarsh prison in London and faces an extradition request from the U.S. government on charges that he violated the Espionage Act when he engaged in journalism.John Sloboda, the co-founder of Iraq Body Count, collaborated with WikiLeaks and analyzed the 400,000-plus U.S. military incident reports disclosed to them by U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning.In September and during Assange’s extradition trial, Sloboda testified that a decade later, “The War Logs remain the only source of information regarding many thousands of violent civilian deaths in Iraq between 2004 and 2009.”Iraq Body Count estimated the reports described 23,000 violent incidents in which Iraqi civilians were killed or bodies were found that were previously unknown. “The majority of these new deaths came from small incidents of one to three deaths”—the very kinds of incidents that attract that least amount of media coverage.“If there are other sources of information or analyses being held within the U.S. government regarding the deaths of civilians in Iraq that were revealed in the Iraq War Logs, they are certainly still being withheld from the public.”Sloboda acknowledged the U.S. government is likely still keeping data on Iraqi civilian deaths secret.“By making this information public,” Sloboda suggested, “Manning and Assange were carrying out a duty on behalf of the victims and the public that the U.S. government was failing to carry out.”Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers in the United Kingdom broke the revelations into three categories:—unlawful killings of civilians—indiscriminate attacks or the unjustified use of lethal force against civilians—horrendous abuse and torture of Iraqis by the Iraqi National Guard or the Iraqi Police Service, torture of Iraqis whilst in UK custody (presumably, whilst in the custody of US and other coalition forces custody as well)[Note: Shiner’s firm represented Iraqis, who were alleged victims of war crimes.]An order calledFrago 242, which the U.S. and the U.K. apparently adopted, excused officers from taking responsibility for torture by Iraqi military or security forces.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ)found““over 300 classified reports in the Iraq War Logs alleging abuse by coalition forces on Iraqi prisoners after the Abu Ghraib scandal.”In the time span covered by the logs, “some 180,000 Iraqis were imprisoned.” Approximately one out of 50 Iraqi males were imprisoned.“More than 1,300 individual cases of torture and abuse carried out by Iraqis on Iraqi prisoners at police stations and army bases” were tallied, implicating coalition forces that likely witnessed or reported on the incidents.Onewar logon alleged detainee abuse from September 27, 2006, indicates no further investigation was necessary because coalition forces were not involved. It details abuse by Iraqi Police.Another war log from August 10, 2006, contains allegations of detainee abuse by Iraqi Police in the form of a “victim summary“:A war log on October 31, 2006,containsallegations shared by a soldier against a platoon’s handling of detainees. It indicates the driver of a vehicle carrying detainees would “call back to warn the soldiers he was about to stop abruptly. The soldiers would hold on and watch as the detainees [were] propelled forward.”Soldiers in the back would then “take turns punching the detainees,” the war log further states.Interrogatorsthreatenedto hand detainees over to the “Wolf Brigade” or “Wolf Battalion.”According toThe Guardian, the Wolf Brigade was “created and supported by the U.S. in an attempt to re-employ elements of Saddam Hussein’s Republican Guard, this time to terrorize insurgents.”“Members typically wore red berets, sunglasses and balaclavas, and drove out on raids in convoys of Toyota Landcruisers. They were accused by Iraqis of beating prisoners, torturing them with electric drills, and sometimes executing suspects.”The Iraq War Logs were a shining example of what media organizations may accomplish when collaborating. The Guardian, Der Spiegel (Germany), Sveriges Television (Sweden), Le Monde (France), Al Jazeera, Channel 4, and BBC Radio all reported on the material.Patrick Cockburn, Middle East correspondent for The Independent, submitted testimony in Assange’s extradition case that addressed the impact of the Iraq War Logs, including how it aided his efforts to document the carnage.“Rereading these documents now, I’m struck again by the constipated military-bureaucratic prose, with its sinister dehumanizing acronyms,” Cockburn declared. “Killing people is referred to as an EOF (“Escalation of Force”), something that happened frequently at U.S. military checkpoints when nervous U.S. soldiers directed Iraqi drivers to stop or go with complex hand signals that nobody understood.”Cockburn highlighted an example that occurred on the outskirts of Fallujah when a woman in a car was killed and her three daughters and husband were wounded.“The U.S. marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of the sun coming off the windshield,'” according to the log.“Another report marks the moment when U.S. soldiers shot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind their sniper position,’ only to learn later that he was their own unit’s interpreter,” Cockburn noted.“These reports are the small change of war, but collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most well-informed journalistic accounts,” Cockburn concluded. “Those two shootings were a thousand times repeated, though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians. More usually, the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists’ caught in the act, regardless of evidence to the contrary.”While presenting evidence that the U.S. government is targeting Assange for his political opinions, Paul Rodgers, professor emeritus at Bradford University in England, highlighted a speech Assange delivered at a Stop the War Coalition Rally in Trafalgar Square on August 8, 2011.Assange referred to the “information [WikiLeaks] revealed showing the everyday squalor and barbarity of war, information such as the individual deaths of over 130,000 people in Iraq, individual deaths that were kept secret by the U.S. military, who denied that they have counted the deaths of civilians.”“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can be started bylies, peace can be started by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can be started bylies, peace can be started by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.",2

Bill Lee is pushing back against claims about his youthvaccinationprogram days after the state's top vaccination official was fired for allegedly sharing factual information with doctors about the legalities of vaccinating un-emancipated minors without parental consent.The Tennessee Democratic Party has called for Dr. Michelle Fiscus to be reinstated, and for the governor ""to recommit the Tennessee Department of Health to carrying out its mission to protect, promote and improve the health and prosperity of people in Tennessee,""WMCreported.Despite what Lee’s office described as ""misleading reporting,"" the state’s Department of Health ""has not halted the Vaccines for Children Program that provides information and vaccine access to Tennessee parents,"" a spokesperson for the governor said in a statement to WMC.""The department is mindful of ensuring parents, not kids, are the intended audience for any outreach efforts regarding medical decisions for children and has simply re-evaluated some tactics like reminder postcards and follow-up communications,"" according to the governor’s office.Fiscus said Monday she was given the option to be fired or resign, but she chose ""to be terminated because I hadn’t done anything wrong."" She toldWTVFshe believed she lost her job to appease GOP state lawmakers after she distributed information to doctors about theMature Minor Doctrine, which permits health care providers to treat certain minors without parental consent, according to the ""Rule of Sevens.""The state health department says the rule allows doctors to treat minors age 14 and older without parental consent ""unless the physician believes that the minor is not sufficiently mature to make his or her own health care decisions."" Fiscus said the health department’s attorney provided a letter about the doctrine based on a 1987 Tennessee Supreme Court ruling and that her job was to explain what is allowable.""While childhood immunization rates temporarily dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are already seeing vaccination rates rebound to pre-pandemic levels and will continue supporting parents who are working to get their families back on track,"" the governor’s spokesperson said.In this image made from video, Michelle Fiscus speaks to the Associated Press, from Franklin, Tennessee, on Tuesday, July 13, 2021.  (AP Photo)The program, which includes immunizations DTap, MMR, Polio, Chicken Pox and Hepatitis B, ""will continue to be successfully administered,"" the statement added. According to the governor’s office, Tennessee ranked among the top 10 states for MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners during the 2019-2020 school year, and 95.3% of 2020-2021 kindergarten students in Tennessee were fully immunized.For more than a decade, Tennessee has had above 90% coverage of kindergarten students receiving childhood immunizations, including DTap, MMR, polio, chicken pox, Hepatitis B, Lee’s office said.Fiscus said that before her termination leadership at the state health department had instructed the department to ""no longer do outreach around immunizations for children of any kind,"" WMC reported. ""That’s infant immunizations, HPV immunization in a state that has one of the highest HPV cancer rates in the country. Flu vaccine outreach in schools has been canceled,"" she said.A health department situation report, first obtained byWSMVin Nashville, said that Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey had recently directed department employees not to hold any immunization event in or on school property or hold any COVID-19 vaccine events at organizations whose clientele are solely children.Sarah Tanksley, a spokesperson for Piercey, told the Associated Press the agency had ""in no way halted the immunizations for children program"" and stressed that the state will continue to support vaccine outreach efforts. Tanksley added the state is ""mindful of hesitancy"" surrounding vaccinations and pointed out the department intends to recognize National Immunization Awareness Month.Only 38% of Tennesseans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, lagging behind much of the nation, according to the Associated Press.State Sen. Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, said the change was ""dangerous and terrifying,"" arguing the move by the state health department provided ""an example of politics leading our public health department. That is a problem. That is an abdication of leadership.""Shelby County Health Department, which serves Memphis and operates independently from the state, said the new state health department rule would not affect their vaccine outreach. Shelby County Schools said it will continue to advise students, parents and families to get the COVID-19 vaccine.Separately, Fiscus’s husband, Brad Fiscus, toldThe Tennesseanthat his wife received an Amazon package containing a muzzle about a week before her firing – thought it’s unclear who sent the item.

Journalists Olivia Beavers and Juliegrace Brufke, in anarticle for The Hill, discuss the possibility of a major blue wave in November and the fears that Republican activists are expressing behind closed doors.Some Republicans are privately expressing what Beavers and Brufke describe as a “growing sense of doom.” A GOP source, presumably interviewed on condition of anonymity, told The Hill, “If the election were today, we would lose the House, the Senate and the White House.”Republicans already lost the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, when Democrats achieved a House majority. That source probably meant to say that Democrats would keep their House majority if the election were held today, and Beavers and Brufke note that in order to retake the House in November, Republicans would need a “net 17 seats.”A House Republican, quoted anonymously, told The Hill, “This is the problem: (Trump) continues to allow it to be a referendum on himself. You can’t do that in a competitive race.”Another Republican in the House told The Hill that the GOP’s 2016 playbook isn’t going to work in 2020, when the U.S. is facing the coronavirus pandemic. According to that lawmaker, “People are looking for reassurance.... Chaos worked great in 2016, (but) they don’t want it in 2020. They want to know that we’re trusting science and doctors on the questions here, and they want to know we’re going to get through it. There needs to be more FDR fireside chats and less Jerry Springer knockdowns.”Some polling released byQuinnipiac Universitythis week shows why some of the Republicans that spoke to The Hill are so pessimistic.According to Quinnipiac, Democrats are highly competitive in some high-profile Senate races. In deep red South Carolina, Quinnipiac found that incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham — who has been a fixture in the Senate since the early 2000s — is tied with Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison at 44%. And in Maine, Quinnipiac found that Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, is trailing Democratic challenger Sara Gideon by 4%. Collins, in the past, was reelected by double digits; now, according to Quinnipiac, she is in danger of being voted out of office.Quinnipiac found that in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leading Democrat Amy McGrath by 5%. That poll was much better news for McGrath than aMorning Consult pollreleased earlier this week; Morning Consult found McConnell ahead of McGrath by 17%. But in South Carolina, Morning Consult found Graham leading Harrison byonly 1%.Of course, poll numbers can change. In 1988’s presidential election, there were summer polls that showed Democrat Mike Dukakis defeating then-Vice President George H.W. Bush — whose poll numbers improved considerably in the fall. And Bush 41 enjoyed a decisive victory over Dukakis that year. But the U.S. was not facing a deadly pandemic in 1988.Interviewed by The Hill, Rep. Liz Cheney expressed confidence that Trump will defeat Biden in November. But what Republicans say publicly and what they say behind closed doors can vary considerably. And another Republican source, quoted anonymously, told The Hill that Trump isn’t going to win over conservative women by expressing “meanness” or attacking a member of his coronavirus task force like Dr. Deborah Birx.“Conservative women want to see empathy and compassion and don’t like meanness,” that GOP source argued. “We are doing really poorly with married, white women. I do not at all understand the Deborah Birx attack at all — not politically and not morally.”",1

Questions like: Will the 158 million fully vaccinated Americans each need a booster shot?Both the FDA and CDC said no on Friday; the fully vaccinated ""do not need a booster at this time.""But both Pfizer and BioNtech officials announced they were seeking emergency-use authorization for a booster because antibody levels in the blood may decline six months after immunization, though studies dispute that, and leading physicians are counseling a go-slow approach.Dr. Celine Gounder, a New York infectious disease specialist, said, ""I think the headline here is that if you have received both doses of the Pfizer, or for that matter, the Moderna vaccine, you are fully protected against severe disease, hospitalization and death, even with the Delta variant.""",1

That's not how anything works. This isn't a hostile takeover of a corporation or even fantasy football. The popular vote winner of each state's presidential election receives the allotted electoral votes. That is the existing law. Enough with the attempted coups.The anti-anti-Trump brigade — those who don't especially like Trump but hate liberals more — argue that Trump's refusal to accept the results of a free and fair election is no different from 2016's hashtag #Resistance movement. Yes, the so-called“Hamilton Electors"" wantedto deny Trump the White House through the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton, whoconceded the morning after Election Day,had nothing to do with this. More importantly, she wasn't an incumbent president desperately clinging to power. The Hamilton Electors also didn't try to install a defeated Clinton as president but a moderate Republican “compromise"" candidate, which is a classic Democrat move.States tightened up lawsagainst faithless electors after 2016so instead of charging someone a measly $1,000 after the fact for a failed coup, the states can remove the faithless elector and replace them with someone who'll respect the will of the people, no matter how dumb. TheSupreme Court upheldthese laws in a unanimous ruling.Trump's unhinged tweets and Miller's elector cosplay can't change the law or the results of the presidential race. However, they do promote the dangerous fiction that the election isn't settled. Trump tweeted after his (second) Supreme Court loss that “We have just begun to fight."" His supporters, who exist in an alternate reality of Trump's own design, are heeding his call, and his incendiary rhetoric, which Republicans ignore and enable, has put a target on the electors' backs.Thereports:In Michigan, Democratic electors have been promised police escorts from their cars into the State Capitol, where on Monday they will formally vote for Joseph R.

195,The second presidential debate was relatively quiet. Did that help anyone?,-12.33,36.33,https://www.mic.com/p/the-second-presidential-debate-was-relatively-quiet-did-that-help-anyone-40154775,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-23,mic,25,"When all is said and done, the award for ""most compelling person on stage"" during Thursday night'ssecond and final presidential debatecould very well go to first lady Melania Trump, who forcefully — and very conspicuously — rejected her husband’s half-hearted advances toward her as the pair posed for post-debate photographs. That alone should tell you all you need to know about the evening's proceedings, and just how much it seemed like everyone involved wished they could be doing something —else.It would be a dramatic understatement to call the debate a low-energy affair, despite it being the last scheduled chance for President Trump and Joe Biden to look one another in the eye and spout carefully rehearsed (or not) soundbites right to one another's face. And yet, with just weeks to go before America finishes voting for the next president of the United States, neither candidate seemed to have much to say on Thursday night, nor did they seem all that interested in saying it. There were no ""breakout moments,"" no jaw-dropping admissions or quintessentially Trumpian boasts, or anything particularly new at all.In part, that can be chalked up to the fact that it feels like this election has lasted decades, not months, and after all that's happened — remember when the president, his wife, and son all got coronavirus anddidn't tell anyone for days? Remember when Biden? — it would be hard for anything to surprise us at this point. Still, given the potential gains from appearing before a massive national audience for the last time together, you would think Trump and Biden would act like they cared about being there.For Biden, the understated performance makes a degree of sense. Ahead in the polls, and running a campaign predicated on not rocking the boat, all he had to do was not screw up. If he landed a punch on Trump, all the better, but his job was to simply maintain what he had. He did have some good moments; his jabs at Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic weren't exactly knockout blows, but they felt solid enough to get Biden's point that Trump has absolutely botched his pandemic response across nicely. It's an obvious point — 223,000 people have died in the U.S., with more to come — but an effective one nonetheless.Trump, on the other hand, was uncharacteristically demure (at least by his standards) for the first half of the debate. And even when he abandoned all pretense of his version of civility toward the end, he still seemed only half-heartedly enthusiastic in his jibes and retorts.In part, it seemed like Trump was struggling to stifle his screaming id in the hopes that he could come off as even moderately ""presidential"" — or at least not like a raving lunatic, which is the sort of thing the ""Suburban Housewives of America"" he sotransparentlyfeels he needs to win over probably don't love to see from him. Consider his performance in thefirst presidential debate, where his overly malicious attacks on Hunter Biden's history of drug addiction onlyserved to give the former vice president one of the best moments of the night, and contributed to Biden'soverall debate win. Trump, meanwhile, saw potential votersrepulsed by his performance in crucial battleground states, likely contributing to his attempt to come off at least slightly less manic this time around.That is, until about halfway through the night, when he either couldn't, or wouldn't continue the charade anymore. He instead reverted back to his pugnacious true self, trotting out his campaign rally boasts like insisting to moderator Kristen Welker,who is Black, that he wasthe ""least racist person in this room.""Even so, it seemed like too little too late to actually make a difference for Trump. His attempt came off as tired and uninspired, his lines of attack were predictable and lacked any real enthusiasm. He was,to use his own words, extremely ""low energy.""All told, it's hard to see how anyone's opinion on either candidate could have been affected by the final debate. (Although it can be hard to see how anyone could possibly still be an undecided voter at this point, too.) If anything, the night was a relative wash for both Biden, who simply needed to not fail, and Trump, who was uncomfortably stuck between wanting to land bodyblows, and wanting to come across as something more than just a brawler.Which brings us back to Melania. For better or worse, when she pulled her hand away from her husband's grip during the post-debate denouement, it was one of the only moments that night where viewers could see someone who, like them, was done pretending.",1

Which begs the question – Would she be apologizing if she was not caught on camera?We’ve experienced an entire year of Covid elitism and hypocrisy. If people are so concerned with the regulations keeping us safe and healthy, shouldn’t someone be demanding her resignation? The Covid-Karens who like to accost strangers in the grocery store should be all over this. Isn’t this “literally the worst??” And the business owners who’ve been forced to shut down or use idiotic, nonsensical standards in order to stay open should be outraged. If you’re facing some sort of fine because you didn’t require your patrons to wear a mask for the four second walk from the restaurant door to their table, I think you should spend a little time looking at Governor Gretchen Whiter and politicians like her.I’m not saying that we should be as dramatic as the left. BUT. I mean, kinda. Because if they can’t live with their own stupid rules, then why should we? And if they think we should be punished when we break a rule, well then I dare say they should be punished as well. I’m not down with this rules for thee but not for me cockamamie. EAT WITH YOUR MASK ON, GRETCHEN.And stop restricting travel and then traveling. If politicians can’t even live up to their own standards, why aren’t they getting any pushback for setting these standards in the first place. And I’m not talking about complaining. Some republicans have voiced their discontent.Okay. But. What are you going to do about it??At this point EVERYBODY knows that a lot of Republican politicians are full of hot air and are prone to inaction. “We should be angry.” Uh. Yeah. We are. We’ve been angry. Is there a step two we’re going to get to, or do we just keep talking about how angry we are…?“It was an honest mistake,” Whitmer said. My twelve year old deflects better than this.Maybe I’ll calm my tits tomorrow, but today I’m not in the mood for live and let live. The hypocrite should lose her job, end of story. Because either she thinks the regulations are important and the rules just don’t apply to her, or she thinks they’re BS rules and there’s no reason for her to follow them. Either way, I say, no ma’am! You’re not better than the citizens you serve, and if you think you are, you’re no longer fit for the position of Governor. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.",0

198,Talkin’ ’bout a Starcity revolution – The San Francisco Examiner,0.0,42.0,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/talkin-bout-a-starcity-revolution/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,sfexaminer,19,".Not to go all “you kids get off of my lawn!” at you, but has anyone else noticed that lately it’s not enough to have a good idea; the idea has to “change the way we live and work!” Even a bad idea, like COVID, changes the way we live and work.In fact, every single technological upgrade, since the first time a caveman rubbed two sticks together, has arguably changed the way we live and work. Every upgrade is going to change our lives, and we eat it up. Bring the change. It’s always for the better, right?But not every new idea can deliver on this, can it?Of course not, but someone in the real estate world really is trying to change the way we live and work. In a world of sound and fury, often indicating nothing, Starcity, a co-living outfit with properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Barcelona (!), stands apart from the myriad would-be change agents. If they can pull off their plans for the next two years, they will indeed change the way many people live and work — but are these changes for the better?Up to now Starcity has been a pretty standard co-living provider, offering furnished rooms in rehabbed homes in San Francisco and other cities. They charge residents a membership fee which covers rent, utilities, internet and common area upkeep/perks. They’re basically streamlined, upscale boarding houses, temporary in nature (memberships can range from three to 15 months), tailor-made for newly-arrived white-collar workers. But this wasn’t enough for Starcity. They’re taking a huge swing next year, and it could result in, in a world of would-be game-changers, an actual game-changer — for a specific type of San Franciscan.At some point in 2021, Starcity will start construction on a project at 457 Minna St. When it’s completed, Starcity Minna will be a 15-story, 270-unit co-living monster, built in modular fashion to keep down costs but festooned with all manner of upscale (and, let’s admit it, youthful) perks: an event space, a bike repair and storage area, a massive rooftop deck.Each level will consist of 18 en-suite units, a “chef’s kitchen,” a dining area that, per online drawings, will double as a laptop-strewn workspace, a media area and a lounge (more laptops). It is a dream come true for a certain type of renter. I’m just not sure Starcity is ready to admit who that renter actually is.The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in funding support services in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerYou may as well lose the drawings of energetic, fashion-forward seniors mingling with their young co livers, Starcity, and technically, I guess the project is aimed at “low- and middle-income residents,” but let’s be honest, here; this is a giant upscale dorm for young tech workers.Imagine the catnip Starcity Minna will be for exhausted techies who’ve been couch-surfing and sleeping in eight to a room in “tech pods?” Imagine getting all of these perks for well below market rent? So what if I have to share a kitchen? I mostly do take-out anyway. Young tech workers, new to The City and at adulthood? They’re the ones, perfectly positioned for the soft landing of grown-up dorm living.Not satisfied with this single revolution, last week Starcity rolled out another game-changer,invest.starcity.com, which expands real estate investment beyond the reach of institutions and high-rolling individuals, offering opportunity to anyone with $5,000 to invest. It’s a chance, Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky says, to “democratize access” to real estate investing, in a city where traditional home-buying is well out of reach for many.With this program, and with Starcity Minna, the company has changed access for renters and investors, while also truly creating “a new way to live and work.”And let’s be clear about that new way to live and work. Is it a revolution everyone wants? Or needs? Starcity Minna is many things, but what it is at its core is a co-working space with bedroom suites attached. Google may have game rooms and fitness centers to keep you at work (“Need your dry-cleaning done? Don’t leave! We’ll do it right here!”); at Starcity Minna, you never have to go to home because you’re already there. Your home office gets lonely; at Starcity Minna, you’re never alone.This is the real revolution, a world where work and home are one, a life where you can still take Zoom meetings in your pajamas and then afterward retire to the coffee station to kibbitz with like-minded peers. It may not be the revolution everyone wants, but Starcity isn’t lying when it claims to be changing the way we live and work.",1

The groups consisted of adult males and females including family units with small children.

200,Omaha protesters paint harsh picture of jail; officials say they did their best in a bad situation,3.0,44.67,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-protesters-paint-harsh-picture-of-jail-officials-say-they-did-their-best-in-a/article_d355a9af-143a-5ad4-98c8-85cf5ee39925.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,omaha,22,"Amanda Humes and Ben Schacht have carefully considered which local protests to attend among several over the past two months.In early June,they attended a vigil for Zachary Bear Heels, who died in 2017 after he was punched and shocked with a Taser by Omaha police officers. Two days later, they marched down Dodge Street to Memorial Park — a week after James Scurlock was killed.Saturday’s gathering, which started at Midtown Crossing and was held to stand in solidarity with Portland and demand justice for Scurlock, was near the married couple’s residence. They trusted the organizers and took part in the peaceful protest.But they didn’t return home until early Monday morning, after little sleep and an overnight stay at the Douglas County Jail.What they learned while there is that the arresting and booking process is not a smooth one.“There was this feeling of hopelessness. It didn’t feel like there was a person in there who was interested in listening or helping,” said Humes, 33. “This feeling that you’re up against this system of processing … you don’t know where you are in that process or how long it will take.”The 120 protesters who were arrested by Omaha police officers Saturday night near 28th and Farnam Streets bogged down the jail’s booking process, despite the fact that Douglas County correctional officers stayed past their shifts and additional officers were called in to handle the influx. Scheduled routine maintenance to the jail’s computer systemonly added to the delays in getting protesters processed and released.Many protesters took to social media or told their family and friends about conditions inside the jail. Some of the allegations included that air conditioning in the cells was turned off, that they weren’t given food and that the cells were overcrowded. Some protesters contended that the system glitches were deliberate.Douglas County Corrections Director Michael Myers said the allegations aren’t accurate.“It was just a perfect storm of events,” he said Monday while showing a World-Herald reporter the areas where the protesters were kept. “I don’t want to discount people’s experiences. It’s frustrating to know that we were doing the best that we could with the resources that we had and the space that we had, and to be demonized like that feels unfair.”Myers said the jail isn’t equipped to handle so many people at one time. Officials had set up a third booking window after the large protests of late May and early June. The change allowed jail workers to book as many as 40 people in one hour, but the Saturday night system reboot jammed up the process.After people are booked, they are patted down and screened for metal or cellphones. They also must turn in any property, other than clothing, visit the medical office and get a booking photo taken, among other steps. Myers said with 100-plus people, all of that takes time.The protesters filled the jail’s 66-chair holding area, two large cells, eight small cells and a courtroom waiting room and small gym that officers turned into sleeping quarters with plastic cots.The holding area has 10 phones, which are free to use, two private toilets and drinking fountains. Sometimes on Sunday, Myers said, the large holding cell doors were opened to allow people to freely walk around. Other times, officers switched out groups to let them use the phones and get water. Protesters dispute that phone access and water were readily available.Riley Wilson, who served as a legal observer for a Scottsbluff attorney, said that at one point, 43 men were in one of the large cells, standing-room only. Wilson and others criticized the crowding based on federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend keeping people 6 feet apart to minimize the spread of COVID-19.“Once we were transferred over to the correctional facility, the biggest, scariest thing for me,” Schacht said, “was being in a pandemic and being crammed together. Masks can only protect you so much.”Myers said if there’s a problem with an inmate, jail workers move the people from the waiting room to the cells for safety, and that’s what happened. Most of the time, he said, the large cells held about 20 to 25 people.“You can’t social distance here,” he said. “We did the best that we could.”All arrestees are given orange, laundered masks, and most of the protesters wore their own masks, Humes said. Correctional officers are also required to wear masks.Many protesters said the capacity of the large cells was 14. A small sign above those cells — numbers 1 and 6 — say “ICE CAPACITY — 14.” Myers said that if the jail is holding arrestees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then only 14 people can be in that cell at once. But these protesters were not arrested on ICE-related charges, so those standards didn’t apply.“ICE has a lot of standards which exceed normal operating standards,” Myers said.At least one transgender person was arrested and placed into a small holding cell alone. Myers said officials usually allow transgender inmates to be with the gender they identify as, and a committee discusses placement so that the inmate and others are safe, but the committee doesn’t meet on weekends.The protesters were arrested on suspicion of a combination of charges, but mostly failure to disperse and obstructing passage. One person was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving, six with obstructing officers, four with resisting arrest and 11 with unlawful assembly, said Omaha Police Lt. Sherie Thomas, a police spokeswoman.“The protesters started walking in the street against the direction of traffic, then there were announcements made advising the crowd that they were unlawfully assembling before arrests were made,” Thomas said in an email.Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza had said Saturday that the protest “leaned toward the potential of getting violent.” When a World-Herald reporter requested more information about that statement, Thomas said “some intelligence was gathered” and declined to give further details.Wilson, the legal observer, said he did not observe any violence by protesters. He said he did see officers push someone off their bicycle and shoot pepper balls. As they arrested protesters from about 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m., they ordered people to get on the ground and then put zip ties on their hands.Protesters sat on a bridge along Farnam Street for a few hours before they were taken to the Douglas County Jail, where they waited again.“It was incredibly slow, and it was really painful,” Humes said. “Both my wrists were swollen and bruised from having to lay there like that.”Once inside the jail, Humes said, she was put into a holding cell with other women.“They all yelled, ‘You’re 46!’ meaning I was the 46th person to go into this room,” she said.Humes said some people were waiting to get their medication, and others coached a woman through an anxiety attack.At some point, the toilet in the women’s cell clogged or overflowed. Myers said that he had not heard about that but that maintenance staff is on hand at all times to fix problems as they arise.Around noon Sunday, Myers said, he authorized his staff to use a paper process to book people and allow them to post their bail because the computers still weren’t working. About 37 people were released during the day Sunday, and 69 people were released between 3 p.m. and midnight, he said. A few protesters had warrants from other counties and weren’t allowed to be released, he said.Myers said he was at the jail Sunday, overseeing the holding area. He said he spoke to a gathering of friends and family outside the jail to address their concerns.Myers said he is proud of the way his correctional officers handled the influx of people.Humes said she was able to pay her $500 bail but couldn’t leave the jail until about 10 p.m. Sunday. She waited for her husband for a couple of hours but then went home. Her husband was released about 1 a.m. Monday.Schacht, Humes and Wilson said they heard officers say that the jail process, charges and financial burden might stymie the arrestees’ future efforts to raise their voices in protest. But they said the situation only bolstered many protesters’ attitudes.“When you hear that, it sure makes you think, this was a very deliberate attempt to send a message,” Wilson said. “If the desired result was to have (protesters) being dissuaded from acting, all they did was intensify their beliefs.”alia.conley@owh.com, 402-444-1068twitter.com/aliaconleyOWHGet the latest in local public safety news with this weekly email.",2
201,Chair of Louisiana Education Committee ousted after 'good slavery' comment in hearing,-16.25,32.75,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/5/19/2031069/-Chair-of-Louisiana-Education-Committee-ousted-after-good-slavery-comment-in-hearing,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-kos-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,dailykos,24,"Republican lawmakers just don’t understand the concept of thinking before speaking. Time after time state officials are found to make comments they allegedly did not realize could come off as racist, but that doesn’t excuse their behavior. In a recent incident, a Louisiana state representative was ousted from his position as chairman of the House Education Committee after making comments around teaching slavery in schools.The comments followed a bill that aimed to put limitations on classroom discussions about racism. While discussing the bill Louisiana state Rep. Ray Garofalo claimed that teaching students ""the good, the bad, the ugly"" of slavery was necessary on April 26. While he quickly attempted to correct himself that he did not mean there was a “good” aspect of slavery, his comments were heard and controversial.Garofalo’s comments quickly went viral with multiple calls for him to step down and he was officially removed as chairman of the House Education Committee Tuesday. In a statement regarding his removal he accused Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder of “sacrificing me to the Black Caucus, who seem to be controlling the Louisiana House of Representatives this term,” theAssociated Pressreported. Failing to understand the issues with his statement, he blamed Schexnayder for allegedly throwing him “under the bus.”While Schexnayder did not discuss details of Garofalo’s removal, Rep. Tanner Magee told the AP that Garofalo was asked to temporarily step down on Monday for the rest of the legislative session, not for the full term. According to Magee, after hearing this Garofalo left the meeting and began telling people he was kicked out of the job. “He was asked to put his personal ambition aside. He refused and left the meeting. Now he’s telling everyone he’s been removed so he can be a martyr,” Magee said Tuesday.Instead of realizing his mistake, Garofalo suggested he lost his chairmanship because he wouldn’t agree to demands regarding the bill. Black lawmakers were upset with not only Garofalo’s legislation but his inability to acknowledge his mistakes and apologize to his colleagues. Like many other stubborn Republicans, instead of accepting his suspension, Garofalo threw a fit. ""I want to be clear. I did not step down voluntarily as chairman.""The bill in question sought to limit conversations regarding racism in the country by prohibiting teaching that Louisiana or the U.S. was “systematically racist or sexist.” Under the bill, teachers were also forbidden to teach information that allegedly “promotes divisive concepts,” such as critical race theory which examines the way race and racism influence different aspects of life.“It is the speaker’s prerogative to choose who he wants to chair a committee,” Garofalo said in a statement. “I have no problem with his exercising his authority, but I will not sacrifice my principles in doing what I know is right. My legislation is about protecting our children, not erasing or rewriting history as Critical Race Theory seeks to do.”Alongside his argument that critical race theory “fuels hate” during the April hearing, Garofalo said that all aspects of slavery had to be taught, including “the good.”“If you’re having a discussion on whatever the case may be, on slavery, then you can talk about everything having to do with slavery: the good, the bad, the ugly,” Garofalo said in an exchange with Republican Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, who asked Garofalo to explain how the bill would play into a classroom. Hilferty noted that “there’s no good to slavery, though.”While he initially tried to backtrack his statement during the hearing, Garofalo did not apologize. Even when the Black Caucus came together to strip him of his chairmanship, Garofalo still did not apologize and defended his words and the bill. This led to meetings between Black lawmakers and Schexnayder which ultimately resulted in Garofalo’s removal.This is far from the first time a Republican state legislator has made racist comments.Daily Kosreported March 10 on a Texas legislator who sponsored a bill that consisted of racist language. The legislator, in this case, claimed to not know the history of “preserve the purity of the ballot box” as terminology used to disenfranchise Black voters after the Civil War. In another incident, aConnecticut lawmakermade a xenophobic comment alleging Asian Americans have never faced racism during a meeting on housing segregation.Watch the comments from the hearing below:",1

Existing law requires insurers to research and report to the commissioner on insurance policies that provided coverage for injury to, or death of, enslaved people.AB 3121 does not commit to any specific payments. It calls for a nine-person task force that will make recommendations for how reparations could happen, whether through compensation or restitution.The task force created by the bill will consist of five gubernatorial appointees and four people chosen by the state legislature. “The Governor shall call the first meeting of the Task Force to occur no later than June 1, 2021,” it states. The task force is instructed to deliver recommendations no more than 12 months from that date.The task force’s powers, according to the law, include:-Holding hearings and sit and act at any time and location in California-Request the attendance and testimony of witnesses-Seek an order from a Superior Court compelling testimony or compliance with a subpoenaRead the full text of 3121here.For those who think slavery did not exist in California, there are these passages — and many others — from the state’s officialHistorical Societyon the subject:California’s constitution proclaimed that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for punishment of a crime, shall ever be tolerated.” Yet archives statewide contain evidence that slavery was practiced out in the open.In 1848 when the gold rush hit, white southerners flocked to the state with hundreds of enslaved Black people, forcing them to toil in gold mines, often hiring them out to cook, serve, or perform a variety of labor. Sometimes fortunes were amassed on the backs of this free labor. Yet California’s place in the nation’s history of slavery is missing from most historical accounts and many are surprised to learn of its practice in the golden state.Among those on the Zoom call for the signing were members of the California Black Caucus, the Chicano Caucus and also Ice Cube, who was singled out specifically by the bill’s sponsor, Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), as “one of our real champions” who has supported the effort. He also got a “thank you” from Newsom just before the signing.Cube later tweeted his thanks to the governor.Thank you Governor@GavinNewsomfor signing AB3121https://t.co/PKUcMtXb69and Thank you@ADOSLosAngelesfor bringing the bill to my attention so we could push from all angles.— Ice Cube (@icecube)September 30, 2020Weber called the bill “ground breaking,” and pointed out the bills were authored last year, long before the death of George Floyd and so many others sparked protests. “A lot of people think we’re responding to the moment,” said Webber, before pointing out that the imperatives go much further back. “We’re responding to the history of California.”The task force can also make recommendations on eliminating state laws and policies that perpetuate discrimination and on issuing a formal apology “for the perpetration of gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity on African slaves and their descendants,” according to the bill.“California has come to terms with many of issues, but it has yet to come to terms with its role in slavery,” said Weber, who chairs the black caucus and introduced the Assembly Bill 3121, said at the bill signing ceremony. “AB 3121 is groundbreaking for the United States, to basically say this state is going to deal with the issue of reparation and we’ll make a difference as the result of that.”In related news, Assembly Bill 3070, also introduced by Weber, was made law on Wednesday by Governor Gavin Newsom. The law combats racial discrimination in jury selection. It establishes a presumption that certain reasons for excluding jurors are proxys for racial discrimination. The law seeks to root out implicit or unconscious bias in jury selection.Newsom also signed AB 979 which requires publicly-held corporations headquartered in California to have at least one director from an underrepresented community by the close of 2021, was jointly authored by Assembly members Chris Holden (D- Pasadena), Cristina Garcia (D-Downey) and David Chiu (D-San Francisco), with Assemblywoman Eloise Gomez Reyes (D-San Bernardino) and Sen. Ben Hueso (D-Chula Vista) as principal co-authors.“The new law represents a big step forward for racial equity,” Holden said. “While some corporations were already leading the way to combat implicit bias, now, all of California’s corporate boards will better reflect the diversity of our state. This is a win-win as ethnically diverse boards have shown to outperform those that lack diversity.”At one point one assmblymember expressed what were likely the sentiments of all present. With a wink to Ice Cube he said, “Today was a good day.”You can watch the signing below.",2
203,Biden Put Climate at the Heart of His Campaign. Now He’s Delivered Groundbreaking Nominees,-10.33,44.67,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17122020/biden-epa-interior-secretary-deb-haaland-michael-regan-climate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,insideclimatenews,21,"President-elect Joe Biden rounded out his climate and environment team Thursday with groundbreaking cabinet nominations at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, agencies critical to his pledge to combat climate change and emphasize environmental justice.Michael S. Regan, who has led a transformation of climate policy as North Carolina’s senior environmental official under Gov. Roy Cooper, was nominated to serve as EPA administrator. He would be the first Black man to run the agency that enforces such bedrock environmental laws as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, regulates power plant and tailpipe emissions and oversees cleanup of the nation’s most toxic dumps.U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblos of Laguna and Jemez, was nominated as thefirst Native American secretary of the interior, which would put her in charge of a department  that manages vast federal land holdings and oversees programs that serve 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives.Both posts require Senate confirmation.Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.A third key environmental official, Brenda Mallory, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, was chosen by Biden to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a key coordinating body that will oversee newly elevated councils on environmental justice. Mallory previously served as President Obama’s top lawyer on the council.Biden’s transition team had previously announced the nominations of other key climate and environment team members: former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm for secretary of energy, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy as national climate advisor and Ali Zaidi, a former Obama administration official now serving as New York’s deputy secretary of energy and environment, as deputy national climate advisor.Last month, Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as his global climate envoy and said he will also sit on the National Security Council.The Biden climate team faces what environmentalists describe as a Herculean rebuilding effort after four years in which the Trump administration has rolled back over 100  environmental regulations, withdrawn the nation from the Paris accord and promoted a fossil fuel agenda at about every turn.Biden put climate change near the center of his campaign, promising a $2 trillion climate and jobs plan for dramatically reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to an economy powered by renewable energy. But his political options will be limited even if he squeaks out a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, with two wins in crucialrunoff racesin Georgia on Jan. 5. Democrats hold only a narrow margin in the HouseWith the loss of one seat in Georgia, Biden could be forced to rely heavily on federal rule-making, which requires deft leadership and executive orders, which are less durable and subject to legal challenge.If confirmed, Haaland will inherit an Interior Department after an aggressive push by the Trump administration to expand oil, gas and coal development on federal lands, along with the taint of a corruption scandal involving Trump’s first Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke.Conflict-of-interest questions have also surrounded the office’s current occupant, David Bernhardt, and legal uncertainty has hung over thecontroversial tenureof William Perry Pendley as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management.Haaland will face the challenge  of undoing dozens of conservative policies only recently embedded in the department’s energy, wildlife and tribal programs.A voice like mine has never been a Cabinet secretary or at the head of the Department of Interior.Growing up in my mother’s Pueblo household made me fierce. I’ll be fierce for all of us, our planet, and all of our protected land.I am honored and ready to serve.Interior’s portfolio also includes a mind-boggling—and contentious—array of duties, from managingone of every five acresin the United States and more than 400 National Park Service units, to protecting endangered species and carrying out the scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey. Interior, with a record of suppressing the rights and taking the lands of Native Americans, also maintains programs for 574 federally recognized   tribes through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Bureau of Education.In Haaland, the president-elect appears to be following through with campaign promises to elevate Indigenous leaders in his administration and to tackle climate change.The congresswoman, who made history two years ago as one of the first two Indigenous women to be elected to Congress, has experience in the fights for both climate and Indigenous causes. And advocates for the environment and for Indigenous rights applauded her nomination.The daughter of military service members, she spent four days in 2016 at the Standing Rock Sioux camps with activists protesting the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline.“Tribes came from everywhere to stand with the water protectors,” said Haaland, calling the effort in aarticleas “an environmental movement that was deep and meaningful,” especially among Native Americans. “It was significant that so many of us came together to protect water, our natural resources.”Haaland, 60, won reelection last month as one of three New Mexico Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives after having served as vice chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, chair of the national parks, forests, and public lands subcommittee and as a member of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the United States.While her work includes keeping climate change at the forefront of the committee’s agenda, she’s also been known to press for clean energy policies that would help maintain jobs and paychecks in a leading state for fossil fuel energy. She has been a supporter of the Green New Deal and a fracking ban, which would put her at odds with Biden.With the Biden-Harris administration, federal climate action is back on the table,” said Zuni tribal member and New Mexico farmer Jim Enote, who’s also CEO of the Native-led Colorado Plateau Foundation and soon-to-be board chairman of the environmental advocacy group, the Grand Canyon Trust.The American Petroleum Institute’s Mike Sommers said in a news release that the oil and gas industry is ready to work with Haaland and the Biden administration on climate change.“In the year ahead, we will continue to advocate for policies that promote technological innovation, advance modern energy infrastructure and support access to natural gas and oil resources—both on federal and private lands—which will be critical to rebuilding our economy and maintaining America’s status as a global energy leader,” Sommers said, emphasizing that the campaign made promises to the energy work force and millions of indirect jobs.Regan may be especially well suited to lead the EPA, an agency that has  been downsized and demoralized under Trump, with his fossil fuel and deregulatory agenda.Regan took over the leadership of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality in 2017 under similar circumstances, following the administration of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, and his top environmental regulator, Donald R. van der Vaart, whom critics have described as a crusading idealogue.“They were taking climate change off websites,” Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said of van der Vaart’s leadership. “It wasn’t about science. It was about customer service and putting polluters first.”He said that “what Regan has done is phenomenal. Our loss will be the country’s gain.”Regan has done “extensive work in the realm of retiring coal plants and addressing the issue of coal ash and legacy pollution,” added Jennifer Rennicks, a policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a resident of North Carolina.She also credited Regan with carrying out Cooper’s broad-based climate agenda that has included an in depthexaminationof how global warming is affecting North Carolina, and an ambitiousclimate action plan. Cooper’s efforts have stood out in the South.There’s been a big focus on “addressing climate change through clean energy and electric vehicles and transportation,” Rennicks said.Cooper’s plan calls for transforming the state’s electrical grid to save energy and make it more resilient; reducing the energy burdens of low-income residents; and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 60 to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, while working toward zero emissions by 2050, among other steps.National groups expressed support for Regan as EPA administrator.Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said that Biden “ran on the boldest, strongest climate policy—one that centers climate justice—in history. As he continues to build his cabinet, perhaps no pick thus far emphasizes this focus as much as Michael Regan.”In North Carolina, Regan’s “attention to addressing environmental justice, cleaning up coal ash, and prioritizing clean energy is exactly what the country requires as the Biden administration seeks to rebuild after the worst administration ever for our environment and the climate,” Brune said.A top energy lobbyist also praised Regan.“Michael Regan has had an impressive rise, from the EPA air program to the public interest community to heading the North Carolina state agency,” said Scott Segal, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who works with energy clients. “He has brought fresh thinking along the way.“Regan understands that tough environmental goals tempered with economic and technological reality produce the best approach on everything from climate change to more local problems,” Segal said. “We look forward to working with him in his new post.”Dennis McLerran, the former EPA Region 10 administrator who left the agency in 2017, said Regan will have to immediately tackle matters critical to returning the agency to its role as an environmental watchdog.“Those include addressing the regulatory rollbacks that have occurred during the Trump Administration and bringing good science forward as the fundamental underpinning of regulatory policies and decisions,” he said.Regan will need to address climate change by restoring programs that address methane emissions and tailpipe emissions along with setting the course for the U.S. to achieve Paris-based emission levels, McLerran said.Bill Muno, former director of the EPA’s Superfund program for the Great Lakes Region from 1995 to 2005, echoed the hope of renewed emphasis on environmental justice, especially near Superfund sites.A recentinvestigationby Inside Climate News, NBC News and The Texas Observer found 945 Superfund sites nationwide vulnerable to climate-amplified hurricanes, flooding, sea level rise and wildfires.“To the degree that there will be a renewed emphasis on addressing sites in EJ communities, that will be a big positive for the Superfund program,” he said. “Hopefully the new administration will provide the funding to support this new emphasis.”Regan was reportedly Biden’s second choice for EPA.After an uprising by environmental justice and progressive groups, Biden passed over the candidate who was long thought to be the favorite for the EPA slot, Mary Nichols, a former assistant EPA administrator and the outgoing chair of the California Air Resources Board.Nichols has deep knowledge and hands-on experience with what is likely to be Biden’s top climate policy challenge at EPA, restoring strong fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles. After Trump jettisoned the single largest step that the Obama administration had taken to address climate, Nichols brokered a deal with five automakers to keep fuel economy improvements on track—an agreement that is thought to be a likely template for a nationwide auto industry deal.But 70 national and California environmental justice groups and other organizations sent a letter to Biden’s transition team last week blasting Nichols as having a “bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.”At the center of their dispute is California’s cap-and-trade program to cut carbon emissions. Minority communities who are already overburdened with pollution say it has allowed them to become sacrifice zones, as polluters take easier steps to meet their obligations, like purchasing offsets.Veloz, a nonprofit electric car advocacy group that Nichols was instrumental in getting off the ground, had an online tribute to her tenure at CARB that seemed designed to address the environmental justice groups’ concerns; they showed a slide of Nichols in the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights, and talked about her work in the 1960s registering Blacks to vote.But opposition to her appointment by the activist groups that had worked hard for Biden’s election proved too difficult to overcome.The controversy shows how environmental justice and climate policy are becoming intertwined as never before, and as the Biden administration takes shape. It also shows how cap-and-trade, once thought to be the most politically viable climate solution, has fallen deeply out of favor. Biden has not talked about it as part of his plan, but activists were determined not to see a California-style cap-and-trade program emerge from Biden’s EPA.“We’re glad to see President-elect Biden listen to frontline communities and pass over … Nichols,” said Lisa Ramsden, a Greenpeace senior climate campaigner.  “In doing so, Biden gave himself the chance to choose an EPA administrator who will prioritize justice for the communities most impacted by fossil-fueled pollution.”",2

By subscribing you agree to ourTerms of UseIrishtimes.comreports: He was later convicted by a jury, after a trial, of charges of raping his step-daughter. His lawyer told the court he does not accept those verdicts.In her victim impact statement, the girl said the family were experiencing financial and other implications from the man no longer being in the home. She said she sometimes felt these were her fault.She said she now suffers self esteem, worry and stress issues. She was unable to sleep and her school work suffered.She said she had broken down when she heard the verdict. “I sometimes feel as if I am at the bottom of the ocean,” she said, “with no light at all.” She does not want to see the man again, the court heard.Last January, the man pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal Court to three counts of defilement of a child under the age of 17 years old on dates between March and June 2017.He had pleaded not guilty one count of oral rape, 12 counts of rape and three counts of defilement of the same girl on dates between 2011 and 2017. He also denied a further count of sexual exploitation of the girl in July 2017.The jury convicted him of all these charges in January. The victim was aged between 11 and almost 16 years old at the time of the offences.Mr Justice Michael White said the offences had been a “serious violation of a child” which involved a very serious breach of trust as the man had been in a position of authority. He also noted the length of time the offences continued and the severity of the abuse.He took into account that the man was an Irish citizen of foreign extraction with very little English and prison would be more difficult as a result. He also noted the man had no previous convictions and had been a good provider.The judge said he was particularly disturbed by the fact that the “intolerable” abuse was happening “as a matter of rote.”“When you think of the nature of the offences, it does not bear thinking about,” said Mr Justice White. The judge imposed concurrent sentences totalling 12 years.A local garda told Vincent Heneghan SC, prosecuting, that the abuse began with oral rape when the victim was 11 years old and the man later began having sex with her “on a highly regular basis” in the family home while the child’s mother was away working.The sexual abuse continued until June 2017 when she was 15 years old. After making a disclosure to members of her family she made a complaint to gardaí in July 2017.The count of sexual exploitation refers to a phone call between the victim and the man, which was heard on loudspeaker by family members in July 2017. The accused invited the child to have sex with him for €200.The court heard the man effectively controlled the victim during the time of the offences in a domestic situation where he was a position of authority.Damien Colgan SC, defending, said his client accepted what he did was wrong and stands over his guilty pleas in relation to three charges of defilement. He said the man does not accept the jury verdicts on the other counts.He said the man had no previous convictions, a good work history and had abided by all his bail conditions. He asked the court to take into account that the man would be serving his sentence as a foreign national in an Irish prison.",0
205,Here’s what Republicans and billionaires really mean when they talk about ‘freedom’,-23.0,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/heres-what-republicans-and-billionaires-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-freedom/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,alternet,25,"America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word. We’d be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning offreedom.TheOregonianreported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they’re on the streets.While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a “free” society.The wordsandlibertyare iconic in American culture—probably more so than with any other nation because they’re so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation’s founding.The irony—of the nation founded on the world’s greatest known genocide (the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slaves—is extraordinary. It presses us all to bringfreedom and liberty toallAmericans.But what do those words mean?If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies—who slap those words on pretty much everything they do—you’d get a definition that largely has to do with being “free” from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you’re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior’s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function.On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that’s been embraced by so-called “democratic socialist” countries—from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia—you’d hear a definition that’s closer to that articulated by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a “second Bill of Rights” to be added to our Constitution.FDR’s proposed amendments included theto a job, and therightto be paid enough to live comfortably; therightto “adequate food and clothing and recreation”; therightto start a business and run it without worrying about “unfair competition and domination by monopolies”; theright“of every family to a decent home”; therightto “adequate medical care... to achieve and enjoy good health”; therightto government-based “protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment”; and theright“to a good education.”Roosevelt pointed out that, “All of these rights spell security.”He added, “America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt’s advice to heart. Progressive “social democracy” has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century—a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s.Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today’s GOP. In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of “more industry in government, less government in industry”—privatize and deregulate—and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent.He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring ’20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like “the right to work” to describe a union-free nation.In the end, the result of the “horses and sparrows” economics advocated by Harding (“feed more oats to the horses and there’ll be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrows”—that generation’s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II).Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular—the only president to be elected four times—the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called “socialist” programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others.The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide—nearly 30,000 inMadison Square Gardenalone—encouraged by wealthy and powerful “economic royalists” preaching “freedom” and “liberty.” Like the Kochs’Freedomworks, that generation’s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts’ chemical fortune) organization was theLiberty League.Roosevelt’s generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right “freedom” rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war.Speaking of “the grave dangers of ‘rightist reaction’ in this Nation,”Roosevelt told Americain that same speech that: “[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called ‘normalcy’ of the 1920s—then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.”Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDR’s New Deal—the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid—we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United States:The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that “freedom” means the government doesn’t provideof the things listed above.Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paulfamously didin a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we’re broke and sick, we’re “free” to die like a feral dog in the gutter.Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP.Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why America’s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest payare almost all in GOP-controlled states.America—particularly the Democratic Party—is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the wordsfreedomandliberty.Independent Media Institute.",0

The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May.Instead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down.Some of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home.But while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it's clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected.The economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies.In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched.In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer.Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily.Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises.If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs.Read more here.Aseparate statementfrom the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing.The value of imports from non-EU countries were £20bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were £18.4bn, the ONS said.The value of goods exported to non-EU countries - £13.7bn - was also higher than to EU countries, at £12.9bn.What is GDP and how does it affect me?Chancellor hints at ruling out 8% pension riseHouse prices to continue rising as supply shrinksUS launches more strikes against Houthis in YemenTaylor Swift makes history at the Grammy AwardsChina gives detained Australian suspended death sentenceHow a Pakistani woman is making history this election.

209,Mind the gap: The basketball world is catching up to the US,0.0,44.33,https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-sports-nba-basketball-59b2b3cf1af82153b21980014c6af991,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,apnews,25,"SAITAMA, Japan (AP) — When the Dream Team era started in 1992, most of the NBA players in the Olympics represented the United States.David Stern knew what would happen from there.“In time,” the former NBA commissioner predicted in 1995, “that will change.”Stern was right. The number of international players in the NBA has steadily risen since -- and the gap between USA Basketball and the rest of the world has tightened as well. There will be more players in this tournament with NBA experience than ever before, with nearly 70 players in the Tokyo Olympics either current or former players in the league. More than four dozen of them played in the league this past season.And only 12 of that group are in Japan to compete with “USA” across their chests.That’s why, when this men’s Olympic tournament opens Sunday, the medal possibilities may be as wide open as they have been since that first team of NBA stars took the court in Barcelona. That group — which featured 11 future Hall of Famers on a 12-man roster — showed the rest of the world how much they had to do to catch the red, white and blue.“The gap is smaller and smaller every year as far as talent is concerned,” U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said.The U.S. is seeking a fourth consecutive gold medal andis the big favorite to do just that according to FanDuel,The Americans are the only team in Tokyo with 12 NBA players. But like Popovich said and Stern anticipated years ago, the talent gap has drastically dwindled.Nigeria, which beat the Americans in an exhibition, has eight NBA players. Australia, which also defeated the U.S. in a warm-up game, has seven. So does France, the first U.S. opponent in this tournament on Sunday and the nation that knocked the Americans out of contention at the Basketball World Cup two years ago. That setback sent the team spiraling to a seventh-place finish, the worst showing in any tournament ever for an American roster composed of NBA players.“I think every team wants to beat us,” U.S. forward Kevin Durant said. “Everybody wants to see us lose, so every game has a little bit more pressure to it.”There’s only one current All-NBA first team player in these Olympics. He doesn’t play for the U.S.Slovenia’s Luka Doncic garnered more first-team votes in the All-NBA voting this season, 55, than the entire U.S. Olympic roster got combined. This is Slovenia’s first time in the Olympics, but with Doncic leading the way, medal talk doesn’t seem misguided.“Slovenians, we know how to fight, man,” Doncic said. “We’re not going to go down easy.”Doncic willed Slovenia to a win in the Olympic qualifying tournament that ended on July 4 and gave the tiny nation a spot in the Tokyo field. And what he’s done in his NBA tenure with Dallas has only shown the world that the buzz he arrived with was more than appropriate.“He’s a spectacular player, as we all know,” Popovich said. “He’s one of the best players in the world. And I emphasize, in the world. He showed himself early on in Europe, and he was a fast study in the NBA for sure. He’s fun to watch. His skills, his competitiveness, his size, his innate basketball IQ is so impressive. You put four hardworking people around him and you’ve got a hell of a team.”Some of what to watch:There are 12 teams in the field; four will have to wait until Monday for their Olympic openers. Sunday’s schedule has Iran vs. the Czech Republic, Germany vs. Italy, Australia vs. Nigeria and then the U.S. vs. France. The Monday men’s openers are Argentina vs. Slovenia and host Japan vs. reigning World Cup champion Spain.The Miami Heat have four players at the Olympics, but only one plays for the U.S. The Heat have three players on Nigeria’s roster (KZ Okpala, Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent Nnamdi), with Bam Adebayo playing for the U.S.The only men’s team in the Olympic field without a current NBA player is Iran. That roster does, however, have a former NBA player — Hamed Haddadi, who appeared in 151 games over parts of five NBA seasons for Memphis and Phoenix. He last appeared in the NBA in 2013.The women’s game is going on the same trajectory as the men’s when it comes to having more international players with WNBA experience in these Olympics than in any previous games. The U.S. has 12 WNBA players on its roster, while Australia has nine current or former WNBA players and Canada has eight.Slovenia coach Aleksander Sekulić, on what Doncic does for a team: “Everything looks way easier and he’s making other players good. Also, me, myself.”More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/Olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2

During the Obama years, Republicans engaged in regular bouts of brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, demanding the administration enact the preferences of the Freedom Caucus. But today,the hostage takers have no demands. So what is the fight actually about?Like aepisode, this debt ceiling fight is about nothing. But it could still do real damage — and it's not only the Republicans who are to blame.The Democratic position is that Republicans should join in raising the debt limit because they share the responsibility for the rising debt — as they unquestionably do. Raising the ceiling shouldn't be a political football, but a routine matter, since the real decisions are made when taxes and spending levels are set by Congress.Escape your echo chamber.

But getting political cover is hardly something worth risking the full faith and credit of the federal government over. If the Democrats could eliminate the debt ceiling problem on their own, surely that would make more sense than joining the Republicans' incredibly risky game.And the Democrats had every chance to do so. They could have included an increase in the debt ceiling in the original reconciliation bill, for example, or passed a standalone debt ceiling raise through reconciliation. They could eliminate the filibuster for debt ceiling bills on a party-line basis, just as Republicans did for judicial nominees — or they could eliminate the filibuster entirely in the same manner. All these choices carry political risks, but they are all within the Democrats' power, and are obviously superior to allowing a default.So why haven't they done any of them? Because they are trying to force the Republicans to take responsibility for their role in the government's fiscal situation, and trying to force them to admit with a votewhat they overwhelmingly admit to the press: that the debt ceiling must be raised, full stop.But that's the thing about being the governing party: You have to govern. If Democrats had wanted to set a positive example, they could have eliminated the debt ceiling entirely as soon as they got the majority. That would have been the right thing to do, and politically wise as well, since it would deprive future Republican majorities of a hostage to take.Instead they're playing chicken in order to prove that Republicans are the irresponsible party.

212,Is the FBI corrupt beyond repair?,33.0,6.67,https://dailytorch.com/2021/02/is-the-fbi-corrupt-beyond-repair/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-torch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,dailytorch,15,"By Thomas Swift JusticeLast week, the most recent slap in the face to the American people came in the form of a corrupt FBI lawyer getting a fine less than seatbelt ticket for falsifying documents to violate the civil rights of American citizens. Unfortunately, this is the latest in a laundry list of issues with the FBI.The most glaring problem with the FBI is its actions during the Russia Collusion hoax. The FBI allowed itself to become the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. There is a slim chance the law enforcement agency did not know it was being used initially, but it had to know it was being used shortly after the 2016 election. The FBI knew in January of 2017, after interviewing the primary sub source of the Steele Dossier, that the dossier was a fraud.Did the FBI stop the investigation and apologize to everyone it wiretapped? No, did the FBI start an investigation into Christopher Steele, the dossier author? No, the FBI doubled down, and started a coverup of its actions, that included the framing of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President Trump’s National Security Advisor.Recent declassifications of FBI documents show that not only did the FBI know the sub source of the dossier could not vouch for the information in the document, but the FBI interviewed Christopher Steele in September of 2017 andfound Steele was biased and, “had statements that conflicted with explanations from two of his sub-sources about their access to Russian officials.” It is important to note, the FBI had been unable to verify anything in the dossier up to this point, despite sending multiple warrants to the FISA Court stating the opposite. What would happen if any “normal” citizen falsified documents and lied to a court?Here was another chance for the FBI to admit it was wrong and fell for a scam. But once again, it doubled down and continued to investigate innocent citizens hoping for a process crime. Does that sound like the actions of a law enforcement agency with integrity? The actions of the FBI during the Mueller Investigation drew further questions about the ethics of the agency.Take the case of Roger Stone, an unofficial advisor for President Trump. Stone was also caught up in the Russia Collusion hoax. Stone spent hours in front of Congress and the FBI during the congressional hearings and investigations. When all was said and done, he was eventually charged with a process crime. Stone had been cooperating with Congress and the FBI and showed no threat. Yet when he was charged, the FBI used an ungodly amount of force to arrest the senior citizen with no criminal record for a nonviolent crime. TheFBI sent over two dozen agentsin tactical gear and vehicles… and a boat. All this for a man with no criminal record or history of violence. To keep this in perspective, the FBI sent more people after Roger Stone than they did for mass murdererWhitey Bulger. The FBI was also kind enough to alert media unfriendly to Stone so the entire arrest could be documented for political purposes. Here, the actions of the FBI seem more inline with politics than justice.Yes, participating in a coup is bad enough, but perhaps the worst of recent FBI conduct was its action or lack of action during the USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal. Larry Nassar was a former USA Gymnastics team doctor and professor at Michigan State University. Over the course of Nassar’s almost two-decade career, he sexually abused atleast 265 young girls. Nassar has since been arrested, tried, and sentenced for his heinous crimes, but dozens of young girls could have been spared had the FBI been bothered.Between the time the FBI was first notified of Nassar’s actions in July of 2015 to his arrest in November of 2016, he continued to see dozens of young girls. What was the FBI doing for almost a year and a half, while young girls were being abused?Olympian Aly Raisman told Savannah Guthriewhen she was finally contacted by the FBI, she asked them “what took so long?” She was told “we wanted to wait until the Olympics were over.” No one from the FBI has come forward to refute her claim.Supposedly, there is aDOJ OIG is investigationinto what happened, but to date it is unknown what has been done or if anyone has been held to account for the FBI’s failure. This is par for the course, as the FBI and DOJ like to discipline themselves nor do they like to let Congress know when they make mistakes.Now the institutionalists on Capitol Hill and the media will say this is only a sampling of the FBI and not representative of the 99%. The problem with that theory is that the FBI tree is rotten from the core. Everyone involved in the Russia Collusion hoax was at the top of the FBI hierarchy. Everyone that lied to the FISA Court and knowingly signed documents that were false, were supposed to be the “best of the best” at the FBI.  One must then ask the question, how did so many unscrupulous people get into the FBI, then advance up the ranks to lead the agency? Is that what the FBI looks for in leadership?The FBI has become what it spent the Cold War fighting. The FBI has become an agency that investigates its political opponents, covers up its crimes, believes it is unaccountable to the people, and acts with impunity. The FBI has become the KGB.",0
213,Wildfires erupt after hottest week in history across parts of the West ignited them,-4.33,45.67,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/wildfires-erupt-after-hottest-week-history-across-parts-west-ignited-n1271603,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-21,nbcnews,25,"Last week featured one of theworst June heat wavesin decades across the West, shattering hundreds of daily records, as well as several all-time hottest temperatures recorded for the month.Death Valley soared to a blistering 128 degrees, and Denver saw a rare hat trick of three 100-degree days in a row.Tucson saw eight straight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city's hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher.All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon.The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area.The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sundayrequired a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Firefor increased firefighting efforts.On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat.Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger.The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest.This will lead to another week with a high risk of wildfires due to the already desiccated landscape void of much precipitation whether falling from the sky or locked in the mostly-melted snowpack.Withground fuels already sitting at highly flammable and record-dry levels, all experts can do is warn people of the impending danger and hope for the best in what has already proven to be an early and destructive start to the Western wildfire season.With climate change making heat waves three times more likely compared to 100 years ago and contributing to the current 22-yearmegadrought, wildfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer into the year. As the gap closes, experts say there isn't so much a defined wildfire season in the West anymore, but instead it lasts year round.Kathryn Prociv is a senior meteorologist and producer for NBC News.",2
214,Why the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act could be the end of internet porn,-18.0,31.0,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/sisea-internet-porn/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-dot-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,dailydot,15,"In an effort to crack down on revenge and child pornography, a pair of senators have proposed legislation that critics say will be the death knell for most internet porn.The bipartisanStop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act(SISEA) is proposed by Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The act requires internet companies to establish standards intended to protect people from sexual exploitation online, a well-known anddevastating phenomenonthat has ruined countless lives.“For years,Pornhuband its parent company Mindgeek monetized rape, abuse, and child exploitation. While these suit-wearing traffickers got rich, their victims have lived with the pain and fear,” Sasse said ina release. “That has to end now. Our bill is aimed squarely at the monsters who profit from rape.”While admirable in purpose, SISEA is written so broadly, and is so burdensome, that most websites would have little choice but to stop hosting pornographic content. If it passes, internet porn could disappear entirely or, more likely, move to servers in foreign countries and the dark web, where protections are fewer and the content more insidious.SISEA requires companies to establish 24-hour hotlines for take-down requests by victims, and demands that sites remove content within two hours of a request. It also bans downloads entirely, as well as re-uploads of content that’s been taken down under the act.It additionally requires the attorney general to create a database of all individuals who don’t consent to having their images uploaded. Internet companies must “ensure that no individual who appears in the pornographic image is listed in the database” prior to allowing content to be posted. For each piece of content, they must upload signed consent forms that include performers’ ages, names, the content the form applies to, and where it can be distributed.Financial penalties for violations are also severe. Sites that host content without a consent form can be fined up to “$1,000 for each day or fraction thereof during which a pornographic image is hosted on the platform.” These funds are earmarked for the attorney general’s office to provide services to victims, including mental healthcare, medical care, and legal services.Further, under SISEA, victims can sue platforms. Such lawsuits would be subject to strict liability, meaning that a plaintiff need not prove actual harm or negligence by the platform to be compensated.Even absent these financial penalties, the 24-hour hotline, two-hour removal window, and database requirements are so onerous and expensive that most, if not all, websites would be forced to stop hosting pornography altogether. This impacts not only the companies themselves, but also the sex workers who make a living on sites likeOnlyFans, which has gained a significant following in the last year.SISEA would likely have a disproportionate impact on marginalized sex workers, such as transgender people and racial and sexual minorities, for whom the internet provides a safer means of earning a living in what is a particularly dangerous profession for such groups.So, a little PSA:#stopSISEA#stopSISEA#stopSISEAThis bill is not only attempting to ""civilize"" the Wild West of our generation; the internet, it also causes widespread damage to it and minority communities that rely on and call it home by slamming down on NSFW content.pic.twitter.com/JMK5ySSefd#stopSISEAthis bill is going to kill sex workers, trans people and bipoc but the people campaigning for it don't care.@AOC@SenGillibrand@SenSchumerPLEASE listen to what sex workers and content creators who are educated on the subject have to say before you vote for it.This bill’s attempt to protect revenge porn and child sexploitation victims uses a ham-handed approach that fails to provide sex workers with the same level of protection. The database allows people to refuse to haveimage of themselves uploaded, but doesn’t apply to sex workers who may want to keep particular images of themselves off the internet. This seems based on the false belief that sex workers aren’t also potential victims of revenge and child porn.SISEA also forces sex workers to reveal their true identities to the government, a less-than-enticing prospect for many.Its provisions even apply equally to both actual and computer-generated images, so SISEA could decimate cartoon,furry, and other CGI pornography—all in the name of cracking down onrevengeand child porn.Sex workers, their allies, and advocates for internet freedom alike have joined voices in opposition to this far-reaching bill. “Now is not the time to target sex workers,” commented one of thousands tweeting#StopSISEA. Many are urging people to contact their representatives in Congress.#StopSISEAplease i need more people to call their senators because mine wont do a damn thing about it🖋 Sign “Stop SISEA” and I’ll deliver a copy to your officials:https://t.co/URaDsrkKVe📨 No. 1 is from Sophie to@GillibrandNY, @RepJohnKatko and@SenSchumer#NY24#NYpolitics#NYpolpic.twitter.com/5ykoHyXB6zThe vast majority of people agree that revenge, child, and sexual assault pornography is a scourge on the internet. But SISEA is, to many, the legislative equivalent of using a hammer to remove a fly from a friend’s forehead.“The moral conservatives of the world are uncomfortable with something that in no way affects them so they are trying to take it away from everyone,”commentedone advocate.",1
215,Biden reverses Trump-era showerhead rule that sought to increase water flow,-4.33,42.33,https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-reverses-trump-showerhead-rule-increased-water-flow-conservation-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,businessinsider,17,"The Biden administration is set to reverse a Trump-era rule that would have loosened restrictions on the water flow from showerheads, an issue that generated complaints from the former president during his tenure in office,according to The Associated Press.The Energy Department is returning to the standard that was approved in 2013, noting that most showerheads already provide an ample amount of water for a thorough wash.Most commercial showerheads are already aligned with the 2013 rule, so the policy change will have little impact among consumers.Showerheads that could generate the additional supply of water that former President Donald Trump sought are not widely available, Energy officials said.Since 1992, federal law has stipulated that showerheads should not put out more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute.However, as newer showerheads were introduced into the market, the administration of former President Barack Obama modified the restrictions to reflect the total amount of water that came out of any nozzles. If a showerhead had three nozzles, for example, no more than 2.5 gallons of water total could be released from all three nozzles per minute.The Trump rule,which was institutedlast December, allowed for each nozzle to release a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute instead of the standard applying to the entire showerhead.The rule change, which would return to the Obama-era standard, is slated to published in the Federal Register next week.The general public will then have 60 days to comment on the proposal before a final rule is devised, according to The Associated Press.Energy officials estimated that the previous rule saved US households roughly $38 a year and believe that returning to the old standard will yield similar savings.Kelly Speakes-Backman, the acting assistant secretary for the department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, touted the move on Friday.""As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchase showerheads that conserve water and save them money on their utility bills,"" she said.Trump, in pushing for the change under his administration, mentioned that his hair needed to be ""perfect.""""So showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out,"" Trump said last year. ""So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect.""Conservation groups were not too keen on the 2020 rule change.Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the energy conservation groupAppliance Standards Awareness Project, told The Associated Press that with four or more nozzles ""you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom.""""At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencing serious drought exacerbated by climate change, there's no place for showerheads that use needless amounts of water,"" he said.Read next",1

Far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid praised the VP hopeful and recited DNC talking points trashing Attorney General Bill Barr’s testimony to the House Judiciary Committee.Reid advanced a wild conspiracy theory that the Barr and the Trump administration will use a “secret police” to scare off Biden voters:Senator, I think one of the things people are afraid of is that William Barr will look the other way if there are violent protests that are attempting to intimidate people that want to vote against Donald Trump or, and/or that he might use his federal secret police force he’s created and cobbled together to intimidate voters who want to vote for Joe Biden. Are you worried about that?Instead of looking at theviolence in citieslike Portland and acknowledging federal officers are there to protect people fromviolent rioters. Reid looks at it in a purely cynical and political way. Of course the Trump administration did not send federal officers to scare Biden voters, he sent them because ofthe failure of these cities’ mayors to lead and protect their citizens.Harris completely ignored Reid’s comments on “secret police” and went straight into her VP pitch:Follow @LifeNewsHQListen, at this point, what I am worried about is that we remind everyone of what is at stake in this election, this election which will be, I do truly believe the most important election of our lifetime. Joe Biden has, for example, outlined a number of plans that are part of his policy to build back better, build America back up to where it can be.It has been widely known thatHarris is on Biden’s VP short list, so she will praise Biden as much as possible in order to make herself look as favorable as possible.  Harris did not want to discuss the real threat of violence in American cities, because that doesn’t serve her self-interest.Reid happily thanked Harris for campaigning for Biden:Thank you very much. And it’s important that you put out some proactive information too, people can look up about what former Vice President Biden is offering on the other side.This just proves that MSNBC has become a propaganda network for the Democratic Party and the Biden campaign. The leftist media never discuss the perspective of Trump and Republicans.",1

The agency is also still permitted to send expecting women to immigration courts.ICE went out of its way to avoid specifying the gender of any hypothetical prisoner in its memo, a deliberate move intended to include transgender males among the group of pregnancy-capable individuals to whom the policy applies,accordingto a senior administration official who spoke to USA Today on Friday.The decision is not so much new as it is a reversal of a 2017 policy enacted by former president Donald Trump, who placed the fight against illegal immigration at the center of his successful 2016 election campaign. Under Trump’s predecessor and Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, ICE had a stated policy of only detaining pregnant immigrants“under extraordinary circumstances.”During Trump’s first two years in the White House, pregnant immigrants were detained 80% more frequently than during the last year of Obama’s presidency, according to a Government Accountability Report released last year.Biden’s version of the policy does expand the period in which illegal migrants can claim exemption from ICE detention, however. While Obama’s policy restricted itself to pregnant women only, Biden’s shield includes those who gave birth up to one year ago, as well as nursing women.",1
218,Why Kamala Harris’ Pearls Have a Special Significance,-5.67,45.83,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/why-kamala-harris-pearls-have-special-significance-180976766/,https://adfontesmedia.com/smithsonian-magazine-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,smithsonianmag,15,"The vice president-elect’s ties to her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, run deep, and her jewelry lets that shineOn August 19, 2020, Senator Kamala Harrisacceptedthe Democratic vice-presidential nomination. When the suit-clad former prosecutor stepped up to the podium to give her speech, she commended the women who fought for the right to vote and the women in her family who nurtured her.“My mother instilled in my sister Maya and me the values that we chart,” she said, smiling at the camera. She added, “She taught us to put family first. [Both] the family you're born into and the family you choose.”Then, she named an important member of her chosen family.“Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha,” she said.Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA)—one of the nation’s oldest black sororities, whose membersincludeluminaries like actressPhylicia Rashadand poetMaya Angelou—had a profound impact on Harris’ life. The vice president-elect joined the esteemed sorority in 1986 when she was a senior at Howard University, a federally chartered historically black university (HBCU), notes Janelle Okwodu in. But Harris’ affiliation with the group didn’t end when she graduated—her line sisters would become close friends, and many of them encouraged her on the campaign trail bymakingdonations of exactly $19.08, a reference to the year AKA was founded.The senator’s tribute to AKA highlighted her affection for the group. In fact, her emotional connection to the sorority runs so deep that she wore a symbol in support of her sisters—a 34”necklacebejeweled with Akoya and South Sea pearls—to her acceptance speech.“The strand of pearls speaks to solidarity among the members,” Glenda Glover, international president of AKA, told’s Daisy Shaw-Ellis in a 2020 article. “It’s a great moment for AKA. For African Americans. For women. Whether she wears pearls or not, it’s an inspiration.”Harris often expresses this solidary and haswornpearls at important events from her college graduation photoshoot to her swearing in ceremony as a United States senator of California in 2017. For this reason, thousands of womenplanto wear pearls on Inauguration Day in support ofHarris.“Pearls represent refinement and wisdom,” Glover told Shaw-Ellis. “We train young ladies to be leaders and to make sure they have the wisdom to lead…and that goes hand in hand with the true meaning of what AKA is all about.”According tomagazine’s Jill Newman, pearls have been a symbol of AKA for decades. Its founders are referred to as the “Twenty Pearls,” and every inductee is given a badge with 20 pearls.The Smithsonian'sNational Museum of African American History and Culture(NMAAHC) has 15 AKAbadges,pendants, medallions andpinsin its collection. Theobjectswere acquisitioned in 2011 along with various AKA-related materials, such as books and magazines, says Michèle Gates Moresi, the museum’s supervisory curator of collections. The DC History Center gave the artifacts to the museum following their travelling exhibition, “100 Years of Service: The Alpha Kappa Alpha Story.”Some highlights from the collections include a, which has a salmon pink and apple green AKA seal at its center. A diamond rests at the peak of the seal, honoring diamond members who wereinitiatedbetween 1938 and 1939. Another item called,Pin for Honorary Member of AKA, is festooned with three green ivy leaves, each of which is adorned with a gold letter, together spelling AKA. The triangularly arranged leaves are affixed to a gold circle border decorated with 20 opalescent pearls.Leadership is a principle that undercuts the “Divine Nine,” a group of nine historically black fraternities and sororities, which is formally known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council. Most of the Divine Nine were created in the early 20th century to foster communities of like-minded individuals and to improve the world around them, as Lawrence C. Ross Jr., author of, toldNPR’s Karen Grigsby Bates in 2020.“You really begin to see development of African American fraternities right around 1906,” Ross said. “A lot of this is tied basically to the idea that college moved from being the place of the elite where they would just go to be able to get a degree as part of the educated class, to a place where college was part of the social and economic movement in society.”Ross also emphasized that these groups were important for building a sense of belonging and accountability.“Black people, and not just black people in the Divine Nine, understand that they are not in college simply based upon their own individual characteristics. And they have a moral responsibility not just to get a degree for themselves, but to also enrich the community,” Ross said. “They recognize the structure [of mainstream society] is intentionally created to denigrate them as second-class citizens. And what they're doing typically in the work of the fraternities and sororities is trying to deconstruct that.”Ethel Hedgeman founded AKA in 1908 at Howard University with similar aims: She wanted to create a support network for black women so that they could uplift themselves and others. According to the sorority’swebsite, Hedgeman and eight of her classmates formed a group that, “fostered interaction, stimulation and ethical growth among members.” Five years later, the group was incorporated, which ensured its legacy. From its inception, the group has focused on learning, providing aid for the poor and advancing civil rights. By the time Harris gave her acceptance speech last year, the group’s numbers had ballooned to more than 300,000 members.“We weren’t just told we had the capacity to be great; we were challenged to live up to that potential,” Harris wrote of her AKA experience in her autobiography,. “There was an expectation that we would cultivate and use our talents to take on roles in leadership and have an impact on other people, in our country, and maybe even the world.”In her acceptance speech, Harris spoke about how she wanted to have this impact, emphasizing that, “Every human being is of infinite worth deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.” She spoke about solidarity, about how it is necessary to work with others to create a better world.Her message resonated with thousands of women across the country, and many of them plan on wearing pearls this Inauguration Day to support Harris. One Facebook group, “Wear Pearls on Jan 20th, 2021,” currently has around 375,800 members from 99 countries.“When you think about a pearl, its created by the roughness, you know, and we have pearls in every color, shape and size,” says Hope Aloaye, founder of the Facebook group. “Pearls are linked to every woman.”Though Aloaye is not a member of AKA, she still believes that championing other women is important and that wearing pearls can publicly display camaraderie, “[We] have women of every color, race, size, ethnicity and vocation,” Aloaye says. “We have one common goal, which is to represent women on the 20th supporting a woman.”Get the latest on what's happeningin your inbox.",2
219,John Pilger: The Most Lethal Virus is Not Covid-19. It is War.,-32.67,11.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/14/john-pilger-the-most-lethal-virus-is-not-covid-19-it-is-war/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-12-14,consortiumnews,23,"Armed Services Memorial.(Geograph/David Dixon)ritain’s Armed Services Memorial is a silent, haunting place. Set in the rural beauty of Staffordshire, in an arboretum of some 30,000 trees and sweeping lawns, its Homeric figures celebrate determination and sacrifice.The names of more than 16,000 British servicemen and women are listed. The literature says they “died in operational theatre or were targeted by terrorists”.On the day I was there, a stonemason was adding new names to those who have died in some 50 operations across the world during what is known as “peacetime”. Malaya, Ireland, Kenya, Hong Kong, Libya, Iraq, Palestine and many more, including secret operations, such as Indochina.Not a year has passed since peace was declared in 1945 that Britain has not sent military forces to fight the wars of empire.Not a year has passed when countries, mostly poor and riven by conflict, have not bought or have been “soft loaned” British arms to further the wars, or “interests”, of empire.Empire? What empire? The investigative journalist Phil Miller recently revealed inDeclassifiedthat Boris Johnson’s Britain maintained 145 military sites – call them bases — in 42 countries. Johnson has boasted that Britain is to be “the foremost naval power in Europe”.In the midst of the greatest health emergency in modern times, with more than 4 million surgical procedures delayed by the National Health Service, Johnson has announced a record increase of £16.5 billion in so-called defence spending – a figure that would restore the under-resourced NHS many times over.But these billions are not for defence. Britain has no enemies other than those within who betray the trust of its ordinary people, its nurses and doctors, its carers, elderly, homeless and youth, as successive neo-liberal governments have done, Conservative and Labour.Exploring the serenity of the National War Memorial, I soon realised there was not a single monument, or plinth, or plaque, or rosebush honouring the memory of Britain’s victims — the civilians in the “peacetime” operations commemorated here.Strechters Bearer Sculpture.(Geograph/David Dixon)There is no remembrance of the Libyans killed when their country was wilfully destroyed by Prime Minister David Cameron and his collaborators in Paris and Washington.There is no word of regret for the Serbian women and children killed by British bombs, dropped from a safe height on schools, factories, bridges, towns, on the orders of Tony Blair; or for the impoverished Yemeni children extinguished by Saudi pilots with their logistics and targets supplied by Britons in the air-conditioned safety of Riyadh; or for the Syrians starved by “sanctions”.There is no monument to the Palestinian children murdered with the British elite’s enduring connivance, such as the recent campaign that destroyed a modest reform movement within the Labour Party with specious accusations of anti-Semitism.Two weeks ago, Israel’s military chief of staff and Britain’s Chief of the Defence Staff signed an agreement to “formalise and enhance” military co-operation. This was not news. More British arms and logistical support will now flow to the lawless regime in Tel Aviv, whose snipers target children and psychopaths interrogate children in extreme isolation. (See the recent shocking report by Defense for Children,Isolated and Alone).Perhaps the most striking omission at the Staffordshire war memorial is an acknowledgement of the million Iraqis whose lives and country were destroyed by the illegal invasion of Blair and Bush in 2003.ORB, a member of the British Polling Council, put the figure at 1.2 million. In 2013, the ComRes organisation asked a cross-section of the British public how many Iraqis had died in the invasion. A majority said fewer than 10,000.How is such a lethal silence sustained in a sophisticated society? My answer is that propaganda is far more effective in societies that regard themselves as free than in dictatorships and autocracies. I include censorship by omission.Our propaganda industries – both political and cultural, including most of the media – are the most powerful, ubiquitous and refined on earth. Big lies can be repeated incessantly in comforting, credible BBC voices. Omissions are no problem.A similar question relates to nuclear war, whose threat is “of no interest”, to quote Harold Pinter. Russia, a nuclear power, is encircled by the war-making group known as Nato, with British troops regularly “maneuvering” right up to the border where Hitler invaded.The defamation of all things Russian, not least the historical truth that the Red Army largely won the Second World War, is percolated into public consciousness. The Russians are of “no interest”, except as demons.The centrepiece of the Memorial comprises two large bronze sculptures, the work of Ian Rank-Broadley, representing loss and sacrifice.(Geograph/David Dixon).China, also a nuclear power, is the brunt of unrelenting provocation, with American strategic bombers and drones constantly probing its territorial space and – hooray – HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s £3billion aircraft carrier, soon to sail 6,500 miles to enforce “freedom of navigation” within sight of the Chinese mainland.Some 400 American bases encircle China, “rather like a noose”, a former Pentagon planner said to me. They extend all the way from Australia, though the Pacific to southern and northern Asia and across Eurasia.In South Korea, a missile system known as Terminal High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, is aimed point-blank at China across the narrow East China Sea. Imagine Chinese missiles in Mexico or Canada or off the coast of California.A few years after the invasion of Iraq, I made a film calledThe War You Don’t See, in which I asked leading American and British journalists as well as TV news executives – people I knew as colleagues — why and how Bush and Blair were allowed to get away with the great crime in Iraq, considering that the lies were not very clever.Their response surprised me. Had “we”, they said – that is journalists and broadcasters, especially in the US — challenged the claims of the White House and Downing Street, investigated and exposed the lies, instead of amplifying and echoing them, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 probably would not have happened. Countless people would be alive today. Four million refugees would not have fled. The grisly ISIS, a product of the Blair/Bush invasion, might not have been conceived.David Rose, then with the LondonObserver, which supported the invasion, described “the pack of lies fed to me by a fairly sophisticated disinformation campaign”. Rageh Omah, then the BBC’s man in Iraq, told me, “We failed to press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough”. Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, agreed, as did many others.I admired these journalists who broke the silence. But they are honourable exceptions. Today, the war drums have new and highly enthusiastic beaters in Britain, America and the “West”.Take your pick among the legion of Russia and China bashers and promoters of fiction such as Russiagate. My personal Oscar goes to Peter Hartcher ofTheSydney Morning Herald,whose unrelenting rousing drivel about the “existential threat” (of China/Russia, mostly China) was illustrated by a smiling Scott Morrison, the PR man who is Australia’s prime minister, dressed like Churchill, V for Victory sign and all. “Not since the 1930s ….” the pair of them intoned.Ad nauseum.Covid has provided cover for this pandemic of propaganda. In July, Morrison took his cue from Trump and announced that Australia, which has no enemies, would spend A$270 billion on provoking one, including missiles that could reach China.That China’s purchase of Australia’s minerals and agriculture effectively underwrote the Australian economy was “of no interest” to the government in Canberra.The Australian media cheered almost as one, delivering a shower of abuse at China. Thousands of Chinese students, who had guaranteed the gross salaries of Australian vice-chancellors, were advised by their government to go elsewhere. Chinese-Australians were bad-mouthed and deliverymen were assaulted. Colonial racism is never hard to revive.Some years ago, Iinterviewedthe former head of the CIA in Latin America, Duane Clarridge. In a few refreshingly honest words, he summed up “Western” foreign policy as it is ordained and directed by Washington.The super-power, he said, could do what it wanted where it wanted whenever its “strategic interests” dictated. His words were: “Get used to it, world.”I have reported a number of wars. I have seen the remains of children and women and the elderly bombed and burned to death: their villages laid to waste, their petrified trees festooned with human parts. And much else.Perhaps that is why I reserve a specific contempt for those who promote the crime of rapacious war, who beckon it with bad faith and profanities, having never experienced it themselves. Their monopoly must be broken.This is a version of an address John Pilger gave to a Stop the War fund-raiser, Artists Speak Out, in London.In 2017, the British Library announced a John Pilger Archive of all his written and filmed work. The British Film Institute includes his 1979 film, “Year Zero: the Silent Death of Cambodia,” among the 10 most important documentaries of the 20thcentury.

220,"With U.S. hospitals overtaxed by COVID-19, huge numbers died from lack of healthcare access",-15.33,34.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/04/30/with-us-hospitals-overtaxed-by-covid-19-huge-numbers-died-from-lack-of-healthcare-access/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-30,salon,25,"In calculating its human toll, a pandemic is similar to a war. The most precise way public health researchers can get a handle on the impact of something like COVID-19 is to compare the number of total deaths recorded in a specific place during the pandemic with death tallies from prior years.That analysis will yield a figure known as ""excess deaths"" — which simply means deaths above and beyond what would normally be expected.That figure captures not just COVID-19 deaths, but the number of people who were unable to access health care at a moment in their lives when a chronic condition was becoming life-threatening. It also includes individuals whose primary cause of death may have been something else, but who were also infected with COVID-19.And now that the dust has settled and the data are being tabulated, America's excess death numbers over the past year are staggering.The importance of tabulating such a dark statistic is twofold: its record-breaking nature is due to both to our largely for-profit healthcare system, as well as government incompetence. Indeed, for decades our government ignored the warnings from public health experts that the U.S. was not properly prepared for the pandemic we are living through now.It's not like no one could saw the pandemic coming. In his book""The Great Influenza"",first published in 2004, John M. Barry presaged the COVID-19 crisis, describing how ""hospitals, like every other industry, have gotten more efficient by cutting costs, which means virtually no excess capacity — on a per capita basis the United States has far fewer hospital beds than a few decades ago.""He continued. ""Indeed, during a routine influenza season, usage ofrespiratorsrises to nearly 100 percent; in a pandemic, most people who needed a mechanical respirator would not get one.""As we have learned first-hand over the last several months, because the healthcare system wasoverwhelmed, getting accuratecause of death datawas itself a work in progress. No doubt huge numbers of cases of COVID-19 may have been missed. In other instances, individualsmay have died at home or succumbed to a chronic illnessthat was written off as COVID when it was not.The one constant comparative data point is death itself from any and all causes. Like births, deaths are something we track with some precision.Hence, one way that medical researchers can get a sense of the scale of the impact of something like COVID is to compare the total number of deaths from all causes during the pandemic and compare it with the same data point over several prior years.Such an ""excess death"" analysis will capture the collateral impact of overwhelmed healthcare systems that were under-resourced long before the pandemic. It will include the people that died as a consequence of opting not to go to the hospital for an unrelated condition for fear of catching COVID-19. While that might not count as a COVID-19 death per se, it tells us something about what happens when we permit healthcare to operate without any margin or redundancy — what is effectively a form of rationing healthcare.According to a recently published study in theJournal of the American Medical Association, which looked at the rate of excess deaths from March 1, 2020, to Jan. 2, 2021, there were 522,368 ""excess deaths,"" as gauged against averages over the same period from 2014 to 2019.At the start of this year, COVID-19 deaths were reported at just over 350,186. By comparing the ""excess rate"" of death with the COVID-19 reported data, linked to its location, we can get some sense of where the public health system had the hardest time holding up under the once-in-a-century strain of a mass death event.The study, produced by researchers with the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond and the Yale School of Public Health, calculated that COVID-19 accounted for 72.4 percent of the excess mortality. The balance may have been ""either immediate or delayed mortality from undocumented COVID-19 infection, or non-COVID-19 deaths secondary to the pandemic, such as from delayed care or behavioral health crises.""While nationally there was a 23 percent increase in excess mortality during the pandemic, New York State, which lost close to 50,000 to COVID, saw the nation's highest spike, with a 38 percent jump in excess deaths — though Mississippi and New Jersey actually exceeded New York State on a per capita basis, according to the researchers.In an editorial that was published with the study,Dr. Alan M. Garberwrote of the importance of grasping the bigger picture, beyond the daily COVID dashboard. ""There is no more visible or alarming manifestation of the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic than the deaths it has caused,"" he noted.""The missteps in responding to an outbreak that not only could be, but largely was, predicted should not give governments confidence that they are prepared for threats that are more speculative and possibly further in the future,"" Garber continued. ""Failure to anticipate the scale of the potential damage from such future catastrophes will only exacerbate the tendency to downplay their importance, making it less likely that governments will prepare adequately. That is why understanding the toll of a pandemic is an important step in the right direction.""In New York City, where COVID killed more than 32,000 city residents, fighting the virus inspired life-saving innovations. It also exposed long-standing healthcare disparities that left some neighborhoods more at the mercy of the highly contagious and deadly virus, according to Dr. Mitch Katz, the CEO of New York City Health + Hospitals.NYC H+H, the nation's largest municipal hospital system, includes 11 hospitals and saw some of the highest patient death counts early on. Over the course of the pandemic, thousands of H+H workers from a myriad of job titles were sidelined by the deadly virus, which took the lives of 53 employees.It was in the throes of this nearly unprecedented public health emergency that H+H found ways to improve patient care while at the same time reducing the exposure of staff to the deadly virus which helped to slow the spread of the virus.""We have done a lot of work from the first wave about putting glass doors in, or glass in the walls to create a window for cameras in the patient rooms — microphones so that patients can be monitored safely without going into the room . . .  and that is a positive development whether there's COVID or some other infectious disease,"" Dr. Katz said during a phone interview. ""So, I think we learned how to make our hospitals safer for the care of patients with infectious diseases.""For Dr. Katz, one of the most sobering discoveries was how pre-existing disparities in the city's private and public hospital infrastructure left some communities so much more vulnerable during the pandemic.""I think the fact that we had so many fewer hospital beds in Queens compared to Manhattan was one of the stark lessons,"" he said. ""That's part of why it was so much more challenging to deal with the pandemic in Queens and Elmhurst Hospitals was because there were so few beds compared to the size of the population in Queens compared to Manhattan and other parts of New York State. The discrepancy in the number of beds I'd say was an issue.""Dr. Katz established a national reputation leading the public hospital systems in San Francisco and Los Angeles before returning home to New York. After years of experience on the frontlines of urban healthcare on both coasts, he believes that the nation's vulnerability to COVID-19 can be traced back to a steady disinvestment in public health that started during the Reagan era.""Yes, the pandemic shows how we have to build up our public health infrastructure so that we are better prepared for what people need,"" he said.As the city, state and federal governments all attempt to regroup after the death of more than a half-million and the infection of well over 30 million, Dr. Katz believes policy makers would be well advised to consult the data not just on COVID deaths per se, but on excess mortality rates referenced by neighborhoods.""Absolutely, and I think we have some sense already of the excess mortality that occurred both among people who had COVID and didn't come forward for testing,"" he said. ""Some of those people were undocumented immigrants or people who were very low income and feared coming forward to a hospital.""Some of that excess mortality we know where people who were having heart attacks or other serious health conditions and didn't come forward for care because they were so frightened of catching COVID from the hospital. So, I think the excess mortality is very helpful frankly it doesn't have to be exact. We can all acknowledge there were a number of people who died and didn't have a COVID test. It's the general population trend that matters.""If America is to get well, which is the first step to escaping the undertow of this pandemic and preparing for staving off the next, we have to uplift these places where regular access to quality healthcare was a socio-economic preexisting condition that helped drive the local body count.Our own individual health is linked to the health of our neighbor. That's not scripture. That's biology.",1
221,"Study finds spike in suicidal thoughts, self-harm during and after pregnancy",-7.0,44.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/new-research-finds-dramatic-growth-in-suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm-during-and-after-pregnancy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,19thnews,25,"Suicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States, and new research shows that people with suicidal thoughts after giving birth dramatically increased between 2006 and 2017, with the biggest spikes amongst people who are Black, lower income, or younger.The study,published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at just under 600,000 privately-insured people. Researchers analyzed the data to track cases of suicidality — suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm — within a year either before or after giving birth.From 2006 to 2017, suicidality diagnoses increased from .2 percent per 100 people to .6 percentper 100. In the same period, cases of deliberate self-harm went up from .1 percent per 100 in 2006 to .2 percent per 100 in 2017. When applied to the approximately 4 million births that take place each year, that means an increase in tens of thousands of suicidal cases and intentional self-harm.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.“Suicidality is something we don’t think about or talk about as much, and it’s a lot more common than I had realized,” said Kara Zivin, a professor at the University of Michigan and the paper’s senior author.Zivin pursued the research based on her own experience — 10 years ago, after giving birth to her son, her postpartum depression made her suicidal. Now, she said, she wants to shine light on an under-discussed topic in public health that has profound consequences.Already, the United States’ rate of pregnancy-related deaths is higher than any other wealthy nation. And suicide is a major concern. According to a 2017 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it accounted for about 6.5 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths.“I was certainly aware of the risks of things like postpartum depression. I never expected the level of illness I had,” Zivin said. “I don’t fully understand it, still.”It’s not clear what is behind the trend, though the researchers argued that it’s likely a combination of doctors more often catching cases of suicidality — which is typically under-diagnosed — and the problem itself growing more common. But it’s hard to know what is driving the increase.Zivin said the study makes a strong case for policy interventions that ensure people can access mental health care during and after pregnancy. For instance, people who have Medicaid as their insurance when pregnant will lose that eligibility after 60 days post-birth in most states — even though suicide a year after giving birth is still considered pregnancy-related. That’s something states or the federal government could address, she said, by extending Medicaid to guarantee insurance for a year postpartum, and making sure people can see mental health specialists.The study found that Black people experienced the largest increase in perinatal suicidality of any single racial group — increasing from .2 percent per 100 in 2006 to .9 percent in 2017. In some ways, that reflects a bigger reality: The nation’s pregnancy-related death rate is far higher for Black people than for White people.That’s still likely an undercount of the gap, said Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and director of its rural health research center. Black women are disproportionately covered through Medicaid, not private insurance. (Kozhimannil was not involved in the study.)The study authors said it’s not clear why Black people experienced such a dramatic increase in diagnoses. But experiences of racism have been linked to physical stress and mental illness symptoms, Kozhimannil noted. And big picture, she added, the data emphasizes why health policy-makers need to emphasize the impact of systemic racism when crafting pregnancy-related health interventions.“It’s not about race, it’s about racism,” she said. “Thinking about it in that way would point to the common root, and might get us in policy discussions further toward valuing the health of Black people in pregnancy.”The authors believe that the paper is even more pressing now. If pregnancy-related suicide was already a problem, experts say it’s one that is likely to only grow, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added new strains to perinatal mental health.As the pandemic worsens this winter, experts are sounding the alarm about a potential spike in suicides. That’s especially a concern for people who have access to firearms, Kozhimannil said; the vast majority of gun deaths each year are suicides, and people who attempt suicide with a gun are more likely to suicide. And right now, more women arebuying firearmsfor the first time.“This is more important than ever in the COVID-19 era,” said Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan and the study’s lead author. “The postpartum isolation people feel will have been compounded by this epidemic.”It’s likely that the study data underestimates the extent of the problem.The study looks only at people with private insurance, who tend to be wealthier. It does not include the almost half of all American births that are insured through Medicaid, which covers lower-income people. People on Medicaid are already more likely to experience the kinds of external stressors that can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety, and more likely not to have a doctor diagnose or help them access treatment.The study also only tracked official diagnoses, even though self-harm and suicidal thought are typically underreported and under-diagnosed.“It shows a big problem and probably undercounts the magnitude of the problem, and the magnitude of the potential disparity,” Kozhimannil said.",2
222,Fighting in Gaza Marks the Start of a More Violent Era,-4.33,42.33,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-05-19/fighting-gaza-marks-start-more-violent-era,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,foreignaffairs,17,"At some point soon, the current military conflict between Israel and Hamas will end. But the ramifications of this latest round of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation—Israeli military strikes in Gaza, Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities, and rising intercommunal violence between Arabs and Jews—will be long-lasting and profound. Above all, it will reinforce the sense among Israelis, Palestinians, and most of the international community that the search for a peaceful resolution to the conflict has come to an end for the foreseeable future.The conflict that began in early May was not planned. It was the culmination of various small but important steps that, while linked, did not make violence inevitable. Yet a combination of domestic Israeli and Palestinian political dynamics, international failures, and worsening relations between the two sides created the right conditions for bloodshed.Yet whatever its accidental quality, the latest round of violence will have enduring consequences. Hamas will emerge from the conflict stronger and the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its president weaker. Violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews will eventually abate, but Arab perceptions of systemic discrimination will grow—as will a belief that a search for equality within Israel is inherently futile. Jerusalem’s symbolic role will also expand, deepening the conflict’s religious dimensions. Among many Israelis and Palestinians, these developments mark the return to an older phase of the conflict. The last two weeks have reinforced a belief that their relationship is again existential and zero-sum, that diplomacy to resolve the conflict is futile and violence inevitable.The current confrontation is unfolding across four theaters. The Gaza-Israeli military bombardment has destroyed civilian infrastructure andkilledmore than 200 Palestinians, 30 percent of them children, and ten Israelis. Ethnonational tensions within Israel have sparked unprecedented intercommunal riots and violence between Arabs and Jews. Palestinians and Israeli police, extreme Jewish nationalist-religious groups, and settlers are in a standoff in East Jerusalem over access to Muslim holy places and the planned evictions of Arab families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. And in the West Bank, tensions are high after Israeli forceskilled fourPalestinian demonstrators and injured dozens more on May 18, a day of protest that engulfed major Palestinian cities. Nonetheless, tensions there remain contained by joint PA and Israeli efforts.These dynamics have been building since Israel invaded Gaza in 2014. That war marked the end of any real hope of striking a deal to end the conflict, as then U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had been working to do. After 2014, relations between both sides worsened and the prospect of a two-state solution gradually diminished.With the realization that a peaceful outcome was impossible in the short to medium term, the Israeli right began to assert itself—especially after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president in 2016. Trump’s policies emboldened many Israeli conservatives and cleared the way for extreme anti-Palestinian policies. Israeli settlers began expanding into new areas of the West Bank, and Israel began routinely confiscating Palestinian land and demolishing homes along the way. By 2019–20, many Israelis had begun to demand the annexation of wide swaths of new territory without granting equal rights to Palestinian citizens. Adding insult to injury, several Arab states also began to normalize relations with Israel, eventually concluding the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020. As Arab states’ solidarity with the Palestinian cause receded, Palestinians themselves felt increasingly abandoned.These pressures were particularly apparent in Jerusalem. After Washington’s 2017 recognition of the city as Israel’s capital, Israel increased the pace of illegal annexation and stepped up its efforts to change the status quo in the Old City’s holy places. Israeli police restricted Palestinian access to the al Aqsa compound, attempted to silence the call for prayer, and began granting access to larger numbers of Jewish Israelis. Authorities also moved to evict Arab East Jerusalemites from their homes and began to assert a more dominant Jewish nationalist-religious agenda throughout the city.Inside Israel itself, the emboldened right wing also took steps to marginalize Israeli Arab citizens. Many among this latter group saw the 2018 so-called nation-state bill—which declares Israel the historic homeland of the Jewish people, establishes Hebrew as the only official language, and asserts that Jewish settlements are a “national value”—as yet another means of discriminating against Israeli Arabs to the benefit of Israeli Jews. Two years later, an amendment that would have added equality for minorities to the law, reducing the chance that it might be used to legitimize legal discrimination against Israeli Arabs, was voted down in the Knesset—Israel’s parliament. Right-wing politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also routinely incite hatred and fear against Israeli Arabs and their representatives in the Knesset. A dramatic rise in crime rates in Arab communities, moreover, compounds already existing socioeconomic problems.Palestinian politics has been plagued by its own series of setbacks. Over the past several years, the PA has severely undermined the public’s faith in its ability to govern. Having held no general elections since 2006, the Palestinian Authority has damaged the rule of law, weakened the judiciary, curtailed media freedoms, and shrunk the space for civil society as organizations lost much of their independence from the government. The result is increasing public discontent and overwhelming demands for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to resign. Hamas’s behavior in the Gaza Strip has been no better. Unbothered by constitutional principles, norms, and rule of law, it has grown increasingly ruthless.Two weeks ago, these conflicting Israeli-Palestinian and intra-Palestinian dynamics finally collided. The earliest and most obvious trigger was Israel’s policies toward Muslim holy places in Jerusalem’s Old City and its demographic battle against Palestinians in the rest of occupied East Jerusalem. This set the stage for small confrontations during Ramadan between Palestinians, Israeli police, and right-wing extremists in the Old City over the changes at Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount) and access to the Damascus Gate.Another flash point was the Shaikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In a pattern repeated throughout the occupied city, many Palestinian residents faced imminent eviction from their own homes by Jewish settlers. East Jerusalemites, other Palestinians, and many Israeli Arabs mobilized in response—launching a series of limited and essentially nonviolent protests.A separate trigger was the Israeli decision to prevent Palestinian elections, planned for May 22, from taking place in East Jerusalem—despite its obligation to facilitate them under the terms of the Oslo accords struck in 1993. The Israeli decision was apparently unrelated to the elections themselves (Israel declared it had no intention of interfering in the process as a whole). Instead, the move was seen as an attempt to deny Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem, even though Israel had already acknowledged such claims in three previous elections. It was this Israeli move that proved most relevant to the timing of the current confrontation.Ostensibly in response to Israel’s decision, Abbas decided to cancel the May PA elections entirely‚ promising to hold them only once Israel agreed to walk back its original plan. This only multiplied internal Palestinian tensions, however. Almost all other Palestinian electoral lists and candidates rejected the decision, including Hamas. Most parties suspected that the real motive was Abbas’s realization that he would lose the race and be forced to share control of parliament with three prominent Fatah defectors: Muhammad Dahlan, Marwan Barghouti, and Nasser al-Qudwa. Abbas’s opponents argued that Palestinians should not grant Israel veto power over their elections. They instead favored forcing Israel to accept a vote in East Jerusalem through nonviolent electoral campaigns and voting drives in al Aqsa and other mosques, churches, and UN and diplomatic missions.The final trigger for the current round of violence was Hamas’s inability to forge a joint alliance against Abbas’s election cancellation, despite widespread opposition to it. Although the group reached out to other electoral lists seeking their support, none wanted to be seen as Hamas’s allies. This dealt a heavy blow to Hamas’s long-term strategy. By reintegrating itself into the PA political process through elections, the group had sought to restore its legitimacy and free itself from the burden of governing the Gaza Strip.With that strategy in tatters, a more militant Hamas leadership took the lead. The Israeli police escalation at al Aqsa and imminent evictions in Shaikh Jarrah provided the opportunity to achieve two goals: The first was to punish Abbas and make him politically irrelevant. The second was to punish Israel for its anti-Palestinian policies in East Jerusalem and its decision to halt elections in the city. In achieving those two goals, Hamas sought to demonstrate to Palestinians and others that while Abbas ran away from a battle over Jerusalem, Hamas would stand with its residents. Indeed, the group was willing to risk war in Gaza to defend the city and the al Aqsa mosque. Eventually, on May 10, Hamas issued an ultimatum: if Israel did not withdraw its police and military personnel from the mosque and Shaikh Jarrah, the group would attack. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas began targeting Israeli towns with rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.Hamas did not unleash the current confrontation. It merely capitalized on rising tensions to make the case for replacing Abbas. Israel’s decision to cancel the election in East Jerusalem and Abbas’s subsequent move to cancel the entire process set off a chain reaction that neither side anticipated. If elections had gone ahead as planned, confrontations in East Jerusalem would have intensified but likely remained nonviolent. Hamas, Fatah, and other electoral lists would have been too busy mobilizing their electoral constituencies against the Israeli police and extremist settlers; Hamas would not have risked a war in Gaza that might have halted electoral preparations, thereby destroying its opportunity to reintegrate itself into the formal political process. Without elections, however, the stage was set for violence.How will the current confrontation affect the prospects for a long-term peace? On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the two-state solution might have received a mortal blow. Given Israeli efforts to marginalize Abbas and the PA, it will not be easy to keep the West Bank out of the next conflict or even the current one. Security coordination between Israel and the PA will not be enough to contain the rising flames. And given the rhetoric around annexation, no right-wing Israeli government will be willing or able to renew a political process that would require negotiations with the PA leadership, even for small incremental steps.Domestically, Abbas will manage to stay in office only as long as he can prevent elections from taking place. Yet with rising popular discontent, the PA security services’ ability to maintain control and quell discontent is diminishing. The PA might find itself the target of an angry public. Abbas, the PA, and the Palestinian national movement will lose what little public trust they still hold. Elections and political reforms are the only means of making the system legitimate and accountable again. Those who reject elections because Abbas will lose or because the process might legitimize Hamas should consider the consequences. Ignoring the problem and keeping Hamas cornered in the Gaza Strip is no solution.There should be no illusion about the role of the international community here. At best, Arab states and others, including Washington, can help manage the conflict only by making the status quo sustainable. They do not, however, have the capacity or political will to force Israel to respect international law or Abbas and the PA to respect the norms of good governance. As hard as it may be, Israelis and Palestinians must do that themselves.",1
223,"Texas Just Passed Its Terrifying, Extreme Anti-Abortion Bill",-16.33,30.0,https://theslot.jezebel.com/texas-just-passed-its-terrifying-extreme-anti-abortion-1846926411,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,theslot.jezebel,9,"On Wednesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbottsigned into lawaterrifying anti-abortion billthat not only seeks to ban almost all abortions, but also includes a provision that would allow someone who, in the words of the bill, “aided and abetted” an abortion seeker to be sued. By empowering private citizens to enforce cruel abortion bans that the state cannot, Texas Republicans have not only found a way to circumvent the Constitution, they have essentially given anti-abortion activists a green light to harass clinics, abortion funds, abortion advocates, and even friends and family members of abortion seekers.Like other bans on early abortion passed in Republican-led states, the unconstitutional ban will likely be challenged in the courts and blocked, but it’s the latter provision that has most worried abortion providers and abortion advocates. They expect they will likely be the target of lawsuits by anti-abortion activists seeking to make them close their doors. As the Guttmacher Institute’s Elizabeth Nash put it in a statement on the bill’s private enforcement mechanism, “By allowing anyone, anywhere to sue people involved in providing or obtaining an abortion, this ban would open the floodgates for lawsuits, bury clinics under frivolous court cases and legal fees, and make it difficult for providers to remain open.”And while the ban on early abortion can and will almost assuredly be sued, the state’s abortion providers and advocates will have to, as constitutional law professor Josh Blackmantoldthe Texas Tribune, “sit and wait to be sued” in order to challenge the private enforcement mechanism. As Blackman put it, organizations like Planned Parenthood “can’t go to court and sue Attorney General [Ken] Paxton like they usually would because he has no role in enforcing the statute.”That Abbott’s signing comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s announcement that itwill take up an abortion case that is a direct challenge tois yet another sign that the ever-more radical and emboldened anti-abortion movement is winning, and that activists have become more honest about their end goal.And get ready for these kinds of bills to be introduced in your state. As Kamyon Conner, the executive director of the TEA Fund, a Texas abortion fund, told Jezebel in a previous interview, “If it happens here, it will happen in other places, because Texas is a place to watch when it comes to abortion access and abortion restrictions.”If there’s ever been a good time todonate to your local abortion fund, it’s now.",1

Joe learned that from his parents and the nuns and priests right here in Delaware, who taught him and inspired in him a passion for justice,”saidCoons. “Joe’s faith is really about our future, about a world with less suffering and more justice, where we’re better stewards of creation, where we have a more just immigration policy and where we call out and confront the original sins of this nation, the sins of slavery and racism. Joe knows these are central issues in this election. And for him, they’re rooted in faith.”Religion is a central fault line in American politics. Biden and Coons are articulating a version of liberal Christianity where faith is defined by private worship and actions to ameliorate the world. This stands in contrast to the conservative Christianity of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.The Trump/Pence version of Christianity is a fusion of religion with reactionary nationalism, where faith is defined by protecting a traditional way of life against foes both domestic and foreign. This way of life can be defined in simple shorthand as a nostalgic idealization of 1950s America, with the need to maintain rigid racial and gender hierarchies. This explains the importance Trump-supporting Christians give to issues like abortion, immigration (threatening because it changes the racial demography of America), and LGBT rights.Current IssueView our current issueIn his speech at the RNC on Wednesday night, Mike Pencesaid, “Let’s run the race marked out for us.

225,EPA guts plan that would have slashed pollution from Utah coal plants,-3.33,46.67,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2020/10/29/epa-guts-plan-that-would/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-29,sltrib,25,"Federal environmental officials have approved Utah’s new plan for limiting coal-fired power plant emissions to address “regional” haze marring the state’s famous national parks, although environmentalists say it’s a step backward when it comes to improving air quality.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s decision,announced Wednesday, applies to PacificCorp’s Hunter and Huntington power plants in Emery County. The revised emission-reduction plan credits the utility’s priorretirement of the nearby Carbon Power Plantand prior emission-reduction investments, concluding it does not need to make any new upgrades at the operating plants in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.“It’s frustrating to have the answer right in front of us and then have politics overshadow the science,” said Kirstin Peterson, owner of Rim Tours in Moab. “The only thing that Utah’s new haze plan does is ensure that we’re going to continue having polluted skies that mar Utah’s tremendous landscapes and harm the health of visitors, wildlife, resources and our outdoor recreation economy.”In authorizing thenew plan, the EPA withdrewthe previous plan approved by the Obama administration in 2016, which had called for expensive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment installed at the plants. Such upgrades would have cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a leading cause of haze, by 75% according to theNational Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA.In 2017, however, a federal appeals court granted a request by the Trump administration to halt the plan.“We appreciate the efforts of EPA to act on Utah’s plan and the many stakeholders who participated in the development of the plan.” Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement released Wednesday by the EPA. “Utah’s regional haze plan has protected visibility in our national parks, supported rural economies and reduced emissions of harmful air pollutants for the residents and visitors to the state.”According to the EPA, Utah’s new plan will reduce missions by 1,879 tons per year relative to the 2016 plan.Conservationists, however, argued the replacement plan does nothing to clean the air.“Smart communities all across the West began moving away from fossil fuels and building new, thriving economies by diversifying and investing in clean energy, outdoor recreation, and long-term, sustainable job prospects even before COVID hit,” said Scott Williams, executive director ofHEAL Utah. “We cannot afford a rear-view mirror approach that puts a dying coal industry ahead of a vibrant outdoor recreation economy that Utah has built.”According to an analysis by NPCA, the Hunter and Huntington plants, which began operating in 1978 and 1974, respectively, are among the nation’s worst in terms of their haze pollution, which affects Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks. The three-unit Hunter plant ranks No. 2 on the list of all pollution sources in the nation, not just coal plants, while the Huntington plant ranks No. 18.“We need leaders with a bold vision, who can see past the politics and industry pressure to come up with a real plan that steers us toward clean energy resources,” said Cory MacNulty, NPCA’s southwest associate director. “We will continue to fight until Utahns and our national parks have the clean air they need and deserve.”",2

John Fritchey speaks in favor of the tax bill.For years, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has defended his aggressive push to land political allies and their friends and family on taxpayer-funded payrolls, but rarely has he waxed as philosophically about it as he did last week in a three-page letter.Facing intense pressure from a federal investigation into ComEd’s bribes-for-favors scandal andan invitation from a House corruption committeeto tell the public what he knows, Madigan’s missive broke two months of near silence. The powerful speaker loudly proclaimed his innocence and tried to reframe his penchant for patronage hiring as a virtue.Not only is “helping people find jobs not a crime,” Madigan wrote, it’s not even “ethically improper” for politicians to make job recommendations.“To the contrary, I believe that it is part of my duties as a community and political leader to help good people find work — from potential executives to college interns, and more,” wrote the 78-year-old Illinois Democratic Party chairman, alluding to some of the very jobs that prosecutors brought up in charging ComEd with crimes. “What an employer chooses to do with that recommendation rests solely with their discretion.”What Madigan didn’t mention when discussing the numerous jobs he’s secured for people during more than 50 years in politics is how that practice has benefited him and what it’s cost taxpayers and electricity ratepayers.The Tribune hasspent the last decadechronicling how it works: Patronage jobs are the lifeblood of Madigan’s political organization. And the people Madigan recommends be hired often serve as foot soldiers on the campaigns for the very legislative seats that allow the speaker to stay in power. In turn, that control of the House is key to helping Madigan bring in clients at his law firm, which handles high-dollar property tax appeals on some of Chicago’s biggest buildings.Starting in 2010,the Tribune publishedthe “The Madigan Rules,” a first-of-its-kind, yearslong investigation that exposed how the speaker built his political empire and law practice, revealing how those two careers repeatedly intersected. The report found that in some cases Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients, though the speaker said his “personal code of conduct” ensured he maintained “high ethical standards.”In 2013, the legislature’s watchdoginvestigated Madigan’s rolein a Metra scandal after the commuter rail agency’s then-executive directorcontended he was muscled outfor not acceding to the speaker’s patronage demands.More recently, Madigan even answered questions about patronage under oath in what he said washis first-ever deposition. During testimony as part of a lawsuit, Madigan made clear he knows the finer points of his vaunted patronage army.Beyond that, the current ComEd probe has put under the spotlight another practice that’s gone on at the Capitol under Madigan: the cycle of House Democratic staffers and friendly lawmakerswho leave and then landa hefty stable of lobbying clients in part based on their perceived access to the speaker. Those lobbyists often become part of a campaign fundraising network that provides money to help Madigan-backed candidates.Though they’re not drawing a government salary, those lobbyists also contribute to the policies enacted in Springfield that affect the pockets of taxpayers.The speaker has not been charged in the ComEd case. He has denied wrongdoing.“As I have said before, I have done nothing wrong,” Madigan wrote in his letter, which explainedwhy he would not appearbefore the House panel looking at the ComEd scandal. “I believe that (the federal) investigation, once all of the facts are made available to the public, will demonstrate that I have not engaged in any improper conduct.”Speaker’s playbookWhile the ComEd investigation represents the gravest threat Madigan has faced to his reign, it’s not the first time his government and political operation has come under public scrutiny.In itsinvestigative series, the Tribune reported that public records showed Madigan’s law firm in 2008 represented 45 of the 150 most valuable downtown buildings ? more than twice what the closest rival represented. Some clients said it’s not that simple to separate the expert tax assistance the firm provides from the political reputation of the man whose name is on the door.At that time, Madigan ally Joe Berrios sat in judgment over property tax appeals that Madigan’s firm filed. Berrios doubled as a state lobbyist, plying his trade inside a Capitol where Madigan held sway. In 2010, Madigan helped Berrios get elected county assessor, giving him power over how all property is valued for property tax purposes. Madigan’s firmdid well on appeals when Berrioswas assessor.The Tribune also found Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients. As a public official, he got a private road behind a shopping mall repaved, helped secure state funding for an expanded tollway interchange and intervened for a developer looking for state cash. In each case, Madigan was a private lawyer for businesspeople who stood to benefit.Madigan said there were no conflicts of interest in the Tribune’s findings, which he described as “strained attempts to link my legislative actions to clients of the firm who might remotely and incidentally ‘benefit’ from such action.”In 2012,the Tribune reportedon how a large operator of assisted living homes signed on with Madigan’s law firm and found itself with several Springfield wins. Nursing homes, pharmacies and other assisted living companies in recent years all have hired the property tax law firm where Madigan is the rainmaker-in-chief. As speaker, Madigan made decisions affecting the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket, the Tribune found.Madigan said he abides by a written personal code of conduct to avoid conflicts on matters involving clients.In addition,the Tribune in 2014documented more than 400 current or retired state and local government employees who worked elections for Madigan, donated regularly to his campaign funds, registered voters for him or circulated candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. From the ranks of those workers, Madigan built the most potent ground game in Illinois politics, which he has used to influence elections in every corner of the state, especially state House races.One of those political workers, Raymond Nice, had a six-figure job at the Cook County recorder of deeds office and later briefly was appointed to a county employee panel. More recently, prosecutors alleged that Nice was designated a subcontractor and had payments funneled to him through a ComEd lobbyist. Nice did little or no work, prosecutors said.Metra scandalThat look at Madigan’s patronage army was spurred by a scandal at Metra over whether the speaker went a step too far in trying to exert his clout as he navigated the intersection of public business and ward-style patronage through his Chicago office and Illinois Capitol suite.Metra CEO Alex Clifford contended his tenure was shortened because he didn’t bow to Madigan’s patronage demands. According to Clifford, the speaker wanted Metra to give a raise to a 13th Ward acolyte who was a labor relations specialist and secure a job for another person who was not identified.Clifford refused. In the end, he walked away with a severance package worth up to $871,000 — a controversy that ended up with public hearings.“I thought it was an ethical and moral character flaw,” Clifford testified about Madigan’s actions.A secret 2014 watchdog reportobtained by the Tribuneconcluded that “insufficient evidence” existed to say Madigan violated the state ethics act or other related laws in the Metra scandal.But Thomas Homer, the legislative inspector general at the time, issued a statement noting that “a decision to close an investigation based on insufficient evidence does not constitute a Good Housekeeping seal of approval or a best practices award.”Madigan, who requested the Metra investigation at the height of the scandal, was quoted in the report as speaking highly of one operative the speaker backed for a promotion.“You can understand that there are many people that are involved with me and campaigns and community service. Among these many people, some are better than others. (He) happens to be one of those who is better than others,” the speaker is said to have told Homer.The report also highlighted how Metra’s then-board chair once entered Madigan’s Capitol office to talk about government issues and left with a yellow Post-it note bearing the names of two workers the speaker wanted to see promoted — moves the board chair later told the Tribune she didn’t make.And the report outlined how Clifford recalled a similar meeting in which a then-Metra lobbyist with strong Madigan ties was spotted carrying two resumes out of Madigan’s office.In his report, Homer wrote that the proximity of Madigan’s discussions first about government issues and then shifting to his favored employees “created the impression among Metra officials that the speaker’s support for Metra’s legislative initiatives may be linked.”“While this may not have been the speaker’s intention,” Homer wrote, “the natural inferences to be drawn by Metra officials should have been obvious.”ComEd probeLong ago, Madigan learned the ways of Chicago-style patronage under his mentor the late Mayor Richard J. Daley. Since then, Madigan has made so many inroads that at least one pocket of government has earned a nickname in his honor.At the city’s Streets and Sanitation Department’s bureau of electricity, Madigan enjoyed such success in placing people that the agency became known as “Madigan Electric.”That nickname has taken on a different context as the speaker has been linked to the ComEd scandal.ComEd has admitted in federal courtthat it sought to influence legislation in Springfield by arranging for jobs and vendor subcontracts for Madigan’s political allies, approved lobbyists and ward operatives even in instances where they performed little or no work.For instance, ComEd allegedly agreed in May 2018 to pay $5,000 a month to retiring 23rd Ward Ald. Mike Zalewski, an ally from Madigan’s Southwest Side sphere of political influence, as part of a “roster” of Madigan associates.Former Ald. Frank Olivo, who represented Madigan’s 13th Ward power base for years, is among those identified as getting a ComEd subcontract.Victor Reyes, the speaker’s onetime ally, a former political operative for Mayor Richard M. Daley and founder of the now-defunct patronage army the Hispanic Democratic Organization, is in a law firm identified as receiving ComEd legal contracts. The deal was set to shrink, but Reyes talked to a Madigan ally to try to save it from the chopping block, according to federal court records and testimony from a ComEd official.One 2019 meeting involving ComEd officials described matter-of-factly how Madigan had named people for decades to hold lower-ranking power company jobs, such as meter readers ? what one speaker ally called part of an “old-fashioned patronage system,” according to federal authorities.As part of an agreement with prosecutors, ComEdis paying a $200 million fine, the largest ever at Chicago’s federal courthouse. In exchange, federal authorities will drop a charge of bribery against ComEd after three years if the power company cooperates.The federal filings on ComEd also include allegations of Madigan clout involving an individual who was well-versed in the speaker’s ways.Juan Ochoa, the former head of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority,told the Tribunefor a 2014 story that Madigan called him to request a raise for the daughter of a former state senator who once represented Madigan’s Southwest Side neighborhood. Ochoa said the daughter was a hard worker who deserved a raise, and she got it after Madigan’s call.“I didn’t feel like he was putting a gun to me but, then again, he is the speaker of the House,” Ochoa explained at the time. “This was someone who is important to the speaker of the House, who to a great extent controlled our legislation and funding.”These days, federal prosecutors have alleged that in 2017, Madigan sought to appoint Ochoa to ComEd’s board of directors.The request was made by longtime ComEd lobbyist and Madigan confidant Michael McClain to then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, prosecutors said.Pramaggiore received internal company resistance and asked McClain if Madigan would be satisfied if she secured a $78,000 part-time job for Ochoa rather than the board seat, but McClain said the speaker would appreciate if she’d “keep pressing,” according to court documents.Around September 2018, having been elevated to an executive post with Exelon, Pramaggiore allegedly reassured McClain: “You take good care of me and so does our friend (meaning Madigan), and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.”Ochoa was appointed in April 2019, but he is no longer on ComEd’s board.Madigan’s ties to the ComEd scandal were on display on two fronts this week.In Chicago, former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who oversaw lobbying efforts,pleaded guiltyto bribery conspiracy for participating in a long-running jobs scheme designed to influence Madigan’s legislative decisions.In Springfield, Democrats and Republicans in the House debated whether the speaker conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The proceedings were part of an evenly split Special Investigative Committee, one that the nation’s longest-serving legislative leader dismisses as a Republican “stunt” to get free media coverage before the November election.DemocratsrejectedRepublican attempts to subpoena Madigan, Marquez and a lineup of the speaker’s associates who allegedly benefited from jobs and contracts.Madigan’s letter to the committee loomed large at a hearing, where House Republican leader Jim Durkin maintained Democrats would have to disregard ComEd’s admissions to believe the speaker “didn’t know what was going on around him.”In his letter, though, Madigan maintained that ComEd’s agreement with federal prosecutors “does not attribute any misconduct to me. It asserts that certain individuals at ComEd hired individuals I purportedly recommended in an attempt to influence me. But let be me clear: that attempt was never made known to me — if it had been, it would have been profoundly unwelcome.”Under oathWhat does Madigan look for when he makes a job recommendation?A Madigan depositionthe Tribunefirst disclosedlast yeargave a few clues. He acknowledged giving recommendations on behalf of a number of members of his 13th Ward organization for government jobs, ranging from the offices of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to Cook County’s circuit court clerk.Madigan knew the whereabouts of his troops so well that when he was asked about a policy analyst at City Hall, the speaker recalled that person, a member of his ward organization, had switched over to a job at a different government agency.“I recommended him to the (Chicago Housing Authority),” Madigan testified.And he was hired, an attorney asked? “He was hired.”Madigan also had a recommendation to replace the retiring Zalewski in the neighboring 23rd Ward seat when the alderman left the City Council: state Rep. Silvana Tabares.Who did you talk to, the speaker was asked?“Rahm Emanuel,” Madigan said.The then-mayor appointed Tabares to the seat.At another point, Madigan was pressed on whether it is his standard practice to recommend precinct captains for positions in various levels of government.“You can understand that many people come to me asking for recommendations for employment, and I render recommendations for employment in both the private and the public sector. I do it in both. But there’s a test that people have to meet,” he replied.“They have to be, to my knowledge, they have to be honest, hardworking people with integrity. And if they are, I’ll recommend to a potential employer the best of my knowledge and my experience with this person, this would be a good worker for your office, a good worker for your business whatever it may be.”rlong@chicagotribune.com",2
227,Paris can learn others’ lessons in loss after Notre Dame fire,0.0,45.25,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2019/0416/Paris-can-learn-others-lessons-in-loss-after-Notre-Dame-fire,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,csmonitor,25,"As dawn broke over Notre Dame on Tuesday, small fires still smoldered. Its ancient timber-framed roof and spire had gone up in smoke. But the cathedral stood firm, an imposing, massive presence that Monday’s blaze disfigured but did not destroy.Parisians were in shock. The spectacular flames had come close to destroying one of their city’s most precious icons and it will take years to restore the building. But the near-catastrophe has reminded a city shaken in recent months by violent social protests of what its citizens have in common: their history.“I’ve noticed that this has prompted a coming together, a sense of solidarity,” says Alain Meunier, who had stopped on his way to work to take a smartphone picture of Notre Dame. “There is a strong collective emotion.”The Notre Dame fire represents a major cultural loss for Paris. But communities around the world, from Warsaw to New York, offer evidence that recovery is possible.Other cities around the world, from Rio de Janeiro to New York to Warsaw, have lost symbolic cultural buildings over the years. How successful they have been in overcoming those losses seems to depend largely on how deeply they have been able to draw on what their residents have in common.French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to that sort of shared heritage on Monday evening, speaking in front of Notre Dame as it burned. “We were able to build this cathedral, and to enlarge and improve it over the centuries,” he said. “And we will rebuild this cathedral, all together; it is certainly part of French destiny.”Mr. Macron’s announcement of an international donation drive to fund the cathedral’s restoration met with quick success. Three of France’s richest people, Bernard Arnault who owns LVMH, rival luxury goods magnate François Pinault, and L’Oreal owner Françoise Bettencourt Meyers have pledged 500 million euros between them and the Paris city government promised 100 million more.The authorities in Warsaw relied on similar patronage in the 1970s when they set about rebuilding the ancient Royal Castle, which had been “a symbol of Poland’s independence and sovereignty” and a powerful element of Poles’ national identity, according to the castle’s curator, Bozena Radzio.That, she says, explains why Adolf Hitler ordered that the fortress should be blown up during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, along with the city’s Old Town that had already been badly damaged in fighting.After World War II, Poland’s new Communist rulers also found the castle too symbolic to want to restore it; its associations with royalty and with a parliament that had drawn up Europe’s first liberal Constitution in 1791 were too strong.They did, however, rebuild the old city in the 1950s, in approximate fashion: They based their plans partly on paintings by the 18th-century Italian artist Canaletto the Younger that had been saved from the castle before its destruction. But the reconstruction of a part of the city that had been almost completely obliterated during the war was very popular among Poles who saw it as new evidence of their survival skills.Only in the 1970s, when the government sought ways of appeasing popular unrest, did the authorities begin to reconstruct the castle in a project 90% funded by private donations from around the world.Again, the architects used a fairly free hand. “Neither the castle … nor the Old Town were rebuilt exactly as they looked before the war,” says Jaroslaw Trybus, former deputy director of the Museum of Warsaw. “The castle before the war seemed quite low and it had bad proportions. It is bigger today and workers used better construction materials.”Authentic or not, the building “has grown so strongly into the cityscape that it is difficult to imagine the place without it, says Ms. Radzio. “Many young people do not even know that it was destroyed during the war.”That is scarcely the case in lower Manhattan in New York, where the iconic World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11,2001, killing thousands, after Al Qaeda terrorists crashed passenger planes into them.But New Yorkers discovered – if only briefly – an unusual unity in the wake of that disaster, setting aside their normal differences.“We all worked together, we refocused. It felt like we came together as city dwellers, thinking of ourselves as being on the same team, on the same side,” says Edy Nathan, a therapist in New York who was just beginning to work with trauma victims at the time.“We were one, and it actually felt sadly amazing,” she adds. “What could we be if we all worked together regardless of our differences?”But such emotional experiences soon evaporated under the pressure of colossal turf fights and clashing opinions about how the Twin Towers site should be rebuilt.The governor of New York at the time, George Pataki, set up a panel to adjudicate between the competing interests jockeying for influence in one of the densest cultural and economic centers in the United States – and to distribute nearly $10 billion in federal funds.These experts ran a global competition for architects and urban planners to submit innovative ideas for both new buildings and new urban spaces on the site.These plans thrilled Tom Stoelker, who remembers the visceral reactions he felt when he was in lower Manhattan that September day, witnessing the burning towers and their collapse. “I immediately thought, ‘Will they rebuild it?’” he says, and was “so inspired” by the prospect of excitingly new buildings that he went back to school and later became a journalist covering architecture around the world.“Yesterday, I thought the same about rebuilding [Notre Dame], and what could be saved,” Mr. Stoelker says.In the end, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the private billionaire developer Larry Silverstein overruled an innovative plan to rebuild the site and chose a more traditional, and often very controversial, approach.“Paris might have an easier time of it … because they’re going to be looking at a restoration,” says Mr. Stoelker. “At Notre Dame, they’re going to be working with something that exists, and in an area steeped in history.”The National Museum of Brazil was steeped in history too. It was Latin America’s largest museum and its biggest repository of archives. But it has not existed since a massive fire destroyed it and most of its contents last September.The museum was housed in a former royal palace amidst an extraordinary park, but it was a largely forgotten and poorly maintained institution. It could hardly be further from the high finance and high politics of Manhattan, or less like the global cultural icon that is Notre Dame.Few Brazilians, save a small group of academic anthropologists and natural science researchers who made the museum their home, appreciated the value of its collection and archives. Sitting in a working class district of Rio it attracted few wealthy visitors, though it was often the first museum that children from poorer areas visited.Underfunded and underappreciated, the National Museum went up in flames shortly before fiercely fought and deeply divisive presidential elections that Jair Bolsonaro won. Brazil had no time to digest its loss before the country was consumed by angry political battles that deepened social divisions and left little space for a common approach to the museum’s possible rebirth.“We have thousands of problems,” says Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima, a professor of ethnology at the museum. “The fire was another tragedy of the numerous tragedies that we are suffering through now, and I don’t believe that Cariocas [Rio residents] have got over it.”“So few people knew about the National Museum,” laments Thaddeus Gregory Blanchette, who earned his Ph.D there. “We still don’t know if we will be able to rebuild everything and the world has moved on.”Dr. Blanchette. “Forty years from now, there is a good chance the National Museum will still be in ruins.”•Monika Rebala in Warsaw, Poland; Harry Bruinius in New York; and Kiratiana Freelon in Rio de Janeiro contributed reporting to this article.",2
228,Auli’i Cravalho on Her New Netflix Film “All Together Now”,-3.0,48.67,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/aulii-cravalho-netflix-film-all-together-now,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,teenvogue,25,"Auli’i Cravalho is afraid she’s going to have seven years of bad luck. Her cat, a tuxedo named Rocco, had just shattered a mirror in her home before our call. Superstition aside, success has a way of following Auli’i, her career marked by arecord-breaking debutin the Disney film.Since the 2016 film, Auli’i continued her foray into the world of acting with a starring role on NBC’s showRise,Disney’sThe Little Mermaid Live!,and guest appearances and voiceovers for projects likeDay by Day,Elena of Avalor, andRalph Breaks the Internet.Up next: The titular role in Netflix’sa teen drama based on the novelSorta Like a Rock Starby Matthew Quick that’s set to release Friday, August 28.“I knew my life was going to change,” Auli’i says candidly about playing Moana on our call. At the time, Auli’i was lauded as not only thefirst Polynesian princess, butthe first teenager to play a Disney Princessin the studio’s history. She was fourteen years old. “I didn't know how drastically, but I did know that my life was going to change after. I also remember being really scared, and I still feel afraid of really just how much more publicity my life gets now.”In her first live-action film, Auli’i portrays Amber Appleton, a hardworking teenager that’s hiding a huge secret from her friends: She’s homeless and trying to help her single mother stay afloat monetarily and emotionally. Despite her constant struggles at home, Amber is able to maintain an aura of positivity, encouraging those around her and striving to reach her dreams. “Oh my God, I'm Amber,” Auli’i tells. “I remember reading the script and realizing Amber and I have a lot of similarities. I think of myself as someone who is very optimistic, almost to a fault, in that I'm not as honest with myself or even with those closest to me when I need a break, or when I need help.”Strength in the face of adversity is admirable, Auli’i notes, but portraying a character that is forced to realize she’s not as strong as she could be without letting her friends help her was an important aspect that drew her to the project — and something that she’s learned to do over the years as her career has skyrocketed.“We all have our chosen family and what really makes them chosen family is relying on them and being as real as possible with your struggles as well as your success in life,” the 19-year-old says. “We all need someone to reach out and check on us every once in a while. You can be that person and you can also be checked on. Allow yourself to be cared for.”Asking for help can be the scariest step, Auli’i says. She speaks from experience, remembering how nervous she was when she told her mom she wanted to see a mental health professional for the first time. “That was so difficult for me, and as teenagers, we’re going through it,” she says. “And Amber especially, someone who is dealing with homelessness as well as wanting to fight for her dreams to go to renowned school like Carnegie Mellon. So it's really important to remember that teenagers and teen stories can have these really deep storylines, and can tackle all of these issues, and can touch upon them because they're real.”And Auli’i’s right. Nearly4.2 million youths and young adultsdeal with homelessness each year. Unlike other teenage films,isn’t afraid to touch upon heavy topics like homelessness, grief, alcoholism, and mental health. It’s a film grounded in realism that helps make the film all the more gut-wrenching to watch. But, among the powerfully real storylines are pockets of purity and positivity that remind viewers of the hopefulness in life. Even the original song “Feels Like Home” by Keegan DeWitt acts as a “beacon of hope,” according to Auli’i.Although she auditioned and didn’t get a role in, director Brett Haley reached out to her for this project. In addition to getting the lead role, Auli’i was involved in the casting process. As someone with a “mixed plate” background (Auli’i is Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Hawaiian, Chinese, and “a little bit of Irish in like, my big toe”) having a diverse cast was incredibly important to her.All Together Nowproves inclusivity is easy — not only in making sure people from varying ethnic backgrounds were represented but in casting and including neurodiverse people. Each person in the cast has their own storyline, their own unique moments that bring them to life in a way that subverts the belief that inclusion is merely having someone appear on-screen a singular time.“We have people who are non-neurotypical as well as differently-abled on our cast, and our friendship and our chemistry just worked as friends,” she says of the casting. “In no ways are those disabilities holding them back as actors, at all. And they're certainly not holding them back in the genuine relationships that I know I have with them, as well.”A part of her inclusion in the casting meant Auli’i was also hunting for her on-screen love interest Ty, who is played by Marvel’sstar Rhenzy Feliz. In the film, Amber and Ty have a not-so-typical teenage romance — at least one that isn’t often represented in Hollywood very frequently. Their romance is subtle, blossoming out of a friendship, and genuine love for each other. “That's the great thing about having good friends, everyone,” Auli’i says jokingly. “Friends can become love interests, but they can't always go the other way around.”Friendships, of course, is at the heart of the film. Amber is a great friend to everyone in her life but refuses to accept the love and friendship in return. For people in a similar situation to Amber, Auli’i says it’s important to be kind and gentle with yourself and not be afraid to reach out and rely on others to help you. “Don't try to build up these really hard walls that you, yourself, will have to break down eventually. Which is easier said than done, for sure. I can attest to that. But the reward of feeling free again, in your own body and in your own mind, it's everything.”Auli’i left high school to go into online schooling during her junior year, but still fondly remembers participating in drama class akin to Amber in the film. Also, like her character, Auli’i grew up in a single-parent household. The actor and her mother are very close (“my mom is still very, very much incorporated into my own team — she's CCd on every email that comes through”) and that dynamic is something she wanted to portray with her on-screen mother played by’s Justina Machado.“There is something really, really special about just growing up with a mom. It's just you two against the world, at least that's how it felt like to me,” she says. “When I met Justina, that's exactly what she brought to the character. Of almost overwhelming love and just wanting the best for your child. But also being in the circumstance that you are, of financial difficulty, and not being able to give everything that you would want. It's heartbreaking. And I love Justina for her portrayal of that.”Having these open and honest conversations about her character's authentic actions is perhaps one of the reasons Auli’i character infeels so earnest and real. It’s this connection to her character that allows Auli’i to give such a moving performance — even if it was her first live-action role. It’s this genuineness that Auli’i brings to not only her roles but her relationships to her fans, many of whom she’s had since voicing Moana four years ago.“I really loved being a voice actor, and giving life to Moana,” Auli’i admits. “I didn't have to worry about my face, and I just naturally kind of have a knack for showing emotion in my voice, which I'm grateful for. But [live action] acting just throws you to the wolves, man. And you have to portray that emotion and get real with it. When you cry and your nose runs, you just gotta let it run.”Although she has ashamedly not watched Beyoncé’s new visual album or heard the magic that is Taylor Swift’sat the time of our interview, Auli’i says her time spent in quarantine hasn’t gone to waste. In between binge-watching seasons ofRick & Morty,taking socially distanced walks to the park, and making her mom’s beloved spaghetti recipe multiple times a week, Auli’i says she’s had time to pick up her guitar and ukulele again. While there’s no word on a debut album release, the actress hasn’t ruled out the transition to a rising musical artist.

229,Kentucky AG Admits Homicide Charges Were Never Presented Shortly After Agreeing to Release Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Recordings,-7.33,48.0,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/09/29/kentucky-ag-admits-homicide-charges-were-never-presented-shortly-after-agreeing-to-release-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-recordings,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-29,atlantablackstar,15,"On the same day Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron agreed to release grand jury recording for theBreonna Taylorcase after an anonymous grand juror filed a motion in court, he quietly dropped a bombshell: he never recommended a homicide charge to the grand jurors to consider against the Louisville Metro Police Department policemen involved in Taylor’s slaying.Cameron agreed to release the recordings on Monday, hours after the grand juror requested all recordings and transcripts from the proceedings be released so “the truth may prevail,” asreportedby The Louisville Courier Journal.“The full story and absolute truth of how this matter was handled from beginning to end is now an issue of great public interest and has become a large part of the discussion of public trust throughout the country,” wrote Kevin Glogower, a lawyer representing the juror, wrote in court documents.The juror, who wishes to remain anonymous, also wants jurors to be allowed to give up their confidentiality so they can speak freely about the proceedings. The request includes any talk about “any potential charges and defendants presented or not presented.”Cameron, likely anticipating that the grand jury proceedings would reveal which charges were not recommended, said in a statement about the grand jury recordings emailed to news outlets on Monday that homicide charges against the three LMPD officers were never on the table.“Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker,” Cameronstated, referring to Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, two other officers who participated in the shooting. Neither of them were charged.“For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.”In last week’s news conference announcing the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, Cameron never mentioned whether that body was presented with homicide charges to consider. In Kentucky, like in many other states, a prosecutor does not have to wait for a grand jury indictment to bring charges against a defendant, nor is a prosecutor precluded from presenting charges to a second or subsequent grand juries if the initial one fails to indict on charges presented.The grand juror’s motion accused Cameron of using the grand jury “as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for those decisions” which planted “more seeds of doubt in the process.”The motion added that Cameron has tried to lay the grand jury’s decision solely “at the feet of the grand jury while failing to answer specific questions regarding the charges presented.”The “Attorney General Cameron attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to them.“The only exception to the responsibility he foisted upon the grand jurors was in his statement that they ‘agreed’ with his team’s investigation that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their actions.”Last week, outrage spread across the nation afterthe grand jury indictedformer Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison on one count of wanton endangerment for shots that hit an apartment next door to Taylor’s home. Taylor died on March 13 after Hankison and two other officers fired shots into her apartment while executing a narcotics warrant related to her ex-boyfriend.Cameron previously had refused to release details related to the grand jury session due to supposed concerns about confidentiality and tainting of a potential jury pool.“We stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool,” Cameronsaid in Monday’s statement.Despite his misgivings, he agreed to release the recordings on Wednesday to comply with an order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who ordered Monday: “The recording of the grand jury proceedings shall be filed in the court file by noon of Wednesday this week.”Cameron, faced with the judge’s order, complied. “The Grand Jury is meant to be a secretive body,” his statement said. “It’s apparent that the public interest in this case isn’t going to allow that to happen. As the special prosecutor, our team has an ethical obligation not to release the recording from the Grand Jury proceedings, and we stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool.”In a statement provided to Atlanta Black Star, Taylor family attorneys Ben Crump, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker called for the release of all transcripts for the proceedings.“Since the grand jury decision was announced, we’ve been saying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case that supported justice for Breonna. That conclusion is supported by the grand juror who came forward to say that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury’s deliberations,” the statement read.“We fully support the call to release the entire proceeding transcript as the only way to know what evidence was presented and how the grand jury instructions led to this outcome. In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect themselves and their property from intruders,” the statement continued.“The police cannot claim their use of force was justified when they wrongly broke into Breonna’s apartment in the first place. We urge the Attorney General to release a COMPLETE and UNEDITED copy of the recording, along with any and all evidence in Bre’s case.”",2
230,These South Florida hospitals will be among the first with the COVID-19 vaccine,0.0,51.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-coronavirus-covid-vaccine-within-weeks-20201118-7edsoqrye5ccpl2x3bci7ofsau-story.html#nt=pf-double%20chain~homepage-top-heads~recommender~automated~-dont-move-popular-rec~7EDSOQRYE5CCPL2X3BCI7OFSAU~5~5~11~11~art%20no,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,sun-sentinel,21,"The new COVID-19 vaccine — not yet approved for use — is on its way to two South Florida hospitals.Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami will be among the first five hospitals across Florida to store the vaccine while they wait for final approval to use it, officials said Wednesday. The vaccine stored by hospitals will be whichever the government approves first, possibly Pfizer’s.The other three hospitals are AdventHealth Orlando, formerly Florida Hospital Orlando, as well as Tampa General Hospital and UF Health Jacksonville. The first vaccines would start arriving in mid-December and another shipment is expected in January.The plan to start supplying hospitals with the vaccine comes as a ray of hope as Florida’s COVID-19 infectionscontinue to rise. The number of new cases has followed monthlong trends of increases across the state, based on health department data. Infectious disease specialists warn that a rate over 5% shows the virus is not under control, and all three major South Florida counties have exceeded that level this month.There will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups.“During the first phase, the vaccine will be available for front-line health care workers in hospitals, long-term-care staff and residents, and first responders,” said Lidia Amoretti, spokeswoman for Jackson Health System.The Florida hospitals were chosen by the state because they’re in heavily populated areas and have the ability to maintain ultra-cold storage. Memorial Regional Hospital has “purchased freezers capable of storing the vaccine at the appropriate temperature,” said hospital spokeswoman Kerting Baldwin.“We put in an order three weeks ago so we would have more capacity. We had a freezer but we ordered another larger one,” said Aurelio Fernandez, the president and chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System. “We saw that Pfizer was getting close so we ordered a larger freezer.”The U.S. will get 40 million vials and the governor told him Florida will get about 2 million of those, Fernandez said. The Pfizer vaccine requires two shots so that means about one million people will benefit from the Pfizer vaccine.Jared Moskowitz, the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday that the deployment of vaccines to hospitals is part of a plan that kicked off earlier this year.Months ago, the emergency management division started “preparing for the vaccine and procured millions of syringes and gauze so that we would have the supplies ready to help deploy the vaccine,” Moskowitz said. “We’re ready to deploy the vaccine. But while we wait to get it, people need to continue to wear masks and do mitigation measures.”Pfizer recently announcedthat an early analysis showed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius until shortly before it is injected.Pfizer said Wednesdaythat new test results show its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, is safe and also protects older people who are most at risk of dying.Another company,Moderna, said Mondayits COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective.The news from both companies puts them on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.One of the main goals of the federal government’sOperation Warp Speedwas to work with drug companies to manufacture the vaccines even before clinical trials were completed, so that millions of doses would be ready to go if a vaccine was successful.Lubby Navarro, director of legislative affairs for Memorial Healthcare System, whose flagship hospital is Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, told Broward mayors at a closed-door meeting Monday that they are seeing a “third wave of increases” of new coronavirus patients.Memorial is one of the five hospital locations in Florida designated to have the vaccine, and “we should be receiving it in a couple of weeks,” she told the mayors, according to records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will manage the distribution, Baldwin said.There is no word yet if the vaccines will be approved for children, or only adults.Staff Writer Cindy Krischer Goodman contributed to this report.",2

232,Losing Culture Wars: How Conservatives Aid the “Trans” Agenda,27.67,19.33,https://thenewamerican.com/losing-culture-wars-how-conservatives-aid-the-trans-agenda/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,thenewamerican,16,"If you want to know why conservatives are batting almost zero in the culture war, consider the recent story about a MUSS (Made-up Sexual Status, or “trans”) activist who suggested rhetorically that all children should be put on puberty blockers. For while attempting to oppose the MUSS agenda, some conservative outlets reporting on the matter did, unwittingly and as usual, enable that agenda.The story was sparked by one Zachary Antolak, a man claiming womanhood who goes by the name “Lauren McNamara” when he’s not going by the name “Zinnia Jones” and who tweeted the following:If children can't consent to puberty blockers which pause any permanent changes even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional evaluation whatsoever?I won’t address the tweet’s substance here, except to say the activist is making a rhetorical argument that wasrefuted wonderfullyby commentator Drew Belsky. For what’s more troubling than Antolak’s sophistry is conservatives’ leftism-born terminology.For example, TheBlaze’s Phil Shiverwrote, among other things, that the activist “arguedin her [sic!] tweet thread that puberty became ‘optional’” due to technology, related Belsky.That “TheBlaze would use female pronouns to describe this man is disgraceful,” Belsky then writes. “‘Zinnia Jones’ was not just ‘born male.’ Hemale and always will be,” he explains.“He cannot be anything else,” Belsky continues. “To call a man ‘she’ and ‘her’ is to be complicit in transgender insanity. It’s twice as damaging when conservatives, who purport to hold the moral high ground, join liberal sexual deviants in pushing the linguistic envelope.”Preach it, brother (except that there’s no such thing as “transgender,” either). I’ve been writing for almost 20 years now about how too many conservatives are “connedservatives” who, while fighting the culture destroyers, cede half the battle before it has even begun by embracing their Newspeak.As to this, Stuart Chase pointed out in his bookthat the side that defines the vocabulary of a debate wins the debate. Yet decade after decade conservatives have obediently parroted the Lexicon of the Left, which is generally originated by left-wing academics and then popularized by left-wing media.Thus have I heard conservatives say not “illegal alien” but “undocumented worker” (akin to calling a rapist an undocumented husband). They also may call semi-automatic rifles “assault weapons,” black Americans “African-Americans,” “sex” “gender” (humans are of one sex or the other;have gender) — and now a man by feminine pronouns.Controlling the language is imperative (which is why our Left manipulates it, as evil forces will do — e.g., the Nazis). Just imagine, for example, that French and German cultures were vying for primacy in a certain region. If the Germans could convince the French to speak German, how severely handicapped would the French be in their culture war?What conservatives do is a bit as if European Jews had said during WWII, using a pejorative the Nazis applied to them, “We[sub-humans] must fight for our human rights.” Or it’s as if we’d proclaimed pep-talk style during the same period, using a pejorative the Imperial Japanese applied to Americans, “We hairy white apes will show ’em who really has the brains!”In the MUSS agenda’s case, its activists’ central claim is that you can be an opposite-sex member (or another “gender,” as they put it) just by willing it. And referring to a man using feminine pronouns is. We’re essentially saying, “We accept your ‘identity,’ but…” But what?You’ve lost.Thus proceeding is to buttress the MUSS agenda claim that certain people have a biologically induced brain-body sex mismatch requiring a biological remedy, as opposed to a psychological issue requiring a psychological remedy. It’s to say, “Your ‘cure’ is real — just don’t offer it to kids with the same problem.”Aside from being a bit confused, the issue is also that too many conservatives are scared, afraid to truly transgress against political correctness’s tenets. We have to “respect” a person’s identity, right? (OK, then I identify as Oh Great and Superior Master).So they’re left arguing against the extremes of political correctness — within the framework of political correctness. They’ll fight over the Left’s corollaries after accepting the Left’s propositions.Now perhaps it’s obvious why G.K. Chesterton observed that the “business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.”When conservatives accept the Left’s words when using words to battle the Left, well, it’s a bit like using the Left’s voting machines when trying to win an election.",0

235,Trump showerhead rule on more water flow goes down the drain,-3.67,43.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/7/16/22580481/trump-showerhead-rule-more-water-flow-goes-down-drain,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,chicago.suntimes,25,"WASHINGTON  — So much for Donald Trump’s quest for “perfect” hair.The Biden administration is reversing a Trump-era rule approved after the former president complained he wasn’t getting wet enough because of limits on water flow from showerheads.Now, with a new president in office, the Energy Department is going back to a standard adopted in 2013, saying it provides plenty of water for a good soak and a thorough clean.The rule change will have little practical effect, since nearly all commercially made showerheads comply with the 2013 rule — the pet peeve of the former president notwithstanding.The Energy Department said the action clarifies what’s been happening in the marketplace. Showers that provide the extra supply of water desired by Trump are not easily found, officials said.Since 1992, federal law has dictated that new showerheads should not pour more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. As newer shower fixtures came out with multiple nozzles, the Obama administration defined the showerhead restrictions to apply to what comes out in total. So if there are four nozzles, no more than 2.5 gallons total should come out among all four.The Trump-era rule, finalized in December, allows each nozzle to spray as much as 2.5 gallons, not just the overall showerhead.A proposed rule change, set to be published in the Federal Register next week, reverts to the Obama-era standard. The public will have 60 days to comment before a final rule is developed.The change will ensure that consumers continue to save money while reducing water use and paying lower energy bills, the Energy Department said. Officials estimated that the Obama-era rule saved households about $38 a year, and the Energy Department expects similar savings by reverting to the 2013 standard.“As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchase showerheads that conserve water and save them money on their utility bills,’’ Kelly Speakes-Backman, acting assistant secretary for the department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, said Friday.While publicly talking about the need to keep his hair “perfect,” Trump made increasing water flow and dialing back longstanding appliance conservation standards — including for light bulbs, toilets and dishwashers — a personal issue.“So showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out,’’ Trump said at the White House last year. “So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.”But consumer and conservation groups said the 2020 rule change was silly, unnecessary and wasteful, especially as the West bakes through a historic two-decade-long megadrought.With four or five or more nozzles, “you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencing serious drought exacerbated by climate change, there’s no place for showerheads that use needless amounts of water.”DeLaski and officials at Consumer Reports said there’s been no public outcry or need for change. The Energy Department’s database of 12,499 showerheads showed 74% of them use 2 gallons or less water per minute, which is 20% less than the federal standard.A 2016 test of showerheads by Consumer Reports found that the best-rated showerheads, including a $20 model, provided a pleasing amount of water flow and met federal standards.The Energy Department also is proposing to remove the definition of “body spray” adopted in the 2020 final rule. The rule allows “body sprays” to circumvent congressional intent to promote water conservation simply based on orientation of the water flow — a side spray rather than overhead.",1

237,“Overdue”: Biden sets Aug. 31 for US exit from Afghanistan,0.0,46.0,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/08/overdue-biden-sets-aug-31-for-us-exit-from-afghanistan/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,denverpost,25,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Thursday the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan will end on Aug. 31, delivering an impassioned argument for exiting the nearly 20-year war without sacrificing more American lives even as he bluntly acknowledged there will be no “mission accomplished” moment to celebrate.Biden pushed back against the notion the U.S. mission has failed but also noted that it remains unlikely the government would control all of Afghanistan after the U.S. leaves. He urged the Afghan government and Taliban, which he said remains as formidable as it did before the start of the war, to come to a peace agreement.“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said in a speech from the White House’s East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”The administration in recent days has sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a military solution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said to those calling for the U.S. to extend the military operation. He added, “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.”The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump’s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced U.S. troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban.With U.S. and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growing speculation that U.S. combat operations have already effectively ended. But by setting Aug. 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itself some cushion to deal with outstanding matters.The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintaining security at the Kabul airport and is still ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military operation.Biden said that prolonging U.S. military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw U.S. troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Biden said. “The status quo was not an option. Staying meant U.S. troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having to send more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the U.S. war comes to an end.“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” he said. U.S. forces killed bin Laden in 2011.U.S. forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the U.S. epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war.Remaining U.S. troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced U.S. military mission.Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan’s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government’s supporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-U.S. Afghanistan power structure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and other support.Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving the sort of stability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn’t exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission hasn’t failed — yet.”Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the U.S. withdrawal is complete.The White House says the administration has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January.Still, the president faced Republican criticism following his speech.“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,” said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”John Kirby, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that the U.S. military is considering several overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, he said, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are not so high that they can’t be handled with a range of installations.“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Biden said. “There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.”Biden noted that as a senator he was skeptical about how much the U.S. could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He was somewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the U.S. objectives were completed long ago.“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time,” Biden said. “The second reason was to eliminate al-Qaida’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.“That’s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”—Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City and Lolita C.

238,"In Promoting New Nuclear Power, Biden-Harris Back Fiction Over Science",-27.67,31.33,https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/11/13/in-promoting-new-nuclear-power-biden-harris-back-fiction-over-science/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,counterpunch,25,"Nuclear fuel assemblies being inspected before entering a pressurized water reactor in the United States – Public DomainAlthough possibly a sad comment on his predecessors, incoming U.S. president, Joe Biden, is offering the most progressive climate policy so far of any who have previously held his position.As Paul Gipe points out in his recent blog, theBiden-Harris climate planuses the word “revolution” right in the headline — a bit of a departure from the usual cautious rhetoric of the centrist-controlled Democratic Party.But ‘revolution’ is proceeded by two words which let us know we are still lingering in conservative ‘safe’ territory. They call it a “clean energy revolution”, which Gipe rightly refers to as “focus-group shopped terminology.” He goes on:”Clean energy is a term forged by Madison Avenue advertising mavens in the crucible of focus groups. It ‘polls well,’ as they say. It means one thing to one interest group, something else to another. So it’s perfect for politics in America.“To environmentalists, it means wind and solar energy, often only those two forms of renewable energy, and sometimes only solar. It also means good times to the coal and nuclear industry. (Ever hear of ‘clean coal’?)“So clean energy is one of those misleading words that party leaders and, importantly, fundraisers can use to elicit money from donors of all stripes. Why say renewable energy, when you want to raise money from the coal and nuclear industries?”The Biden-Harris energy plan hits all the right notes in its opening paragraphs, focusing on a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and emphasizing infrastructure, international collaboration and the protection of poor communities of color, who suffer the most harm from unfettered polluters.As we know from his public statements, Biden will bring the US straight back into the Paris Agreement on climate and sees the climate crisis as the “number one issue facing humanity”. The Paris Agreement isn’t enough, but the US absence weakens it further.Still on the right track, the Biden-Harris climate plan looks to the rights and wellbeing of workers and jobs creation. It will adhere to “science, not fiction” and recognizes that energy efficiency has an essential role to play.And then it goes very badly — if predictably — wrong.In the section entitled “Biden’s Year One Legislative Agenda on Climate Change,” the document proclaims “We have to get rid of the old way of thinking,” then reverts precisely to that, clinging on to nuclear power as a necessary component of its plan.So the Biden-Harris agenda lists small modular reactors under its “game-changing technologies.” In a way, that’s correct. Diverting money into small modular reactorsbe game-changing. It will put us firmly on the road to climate failure.The good news is that nuclear power does not play much of a role in the Biden-Harris plan. But the bad news is that, when it comes to nuclear power, the Biden camp has indeed chosen fiction over science.A bullet point called “Identify the future of nuclear energy” reverts right back to the failed Obama “all of the above” approach to “look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies”, instead of recognizing that nuclear power, a failed 20th century technology, does not have a future.As Amory Lovinspoints out, this “low-carbon” approach is a perpetual mistake made by politicians and seized on and influenced by the nuclear industry — to look only at carbon savings, and not at cost and time as well.“Costly options save less carbon per dollar than cheaper options,” Lovins writes. “Slow options save less carbon per year than faster options. Thus even a low- or no-carbon option that is too costly or too slow willachievableclimate protection. Being carbon-free does not establish climate-effectiveness.”When you look at the precipitating drop in renewable energy costs versus the ever soaring nuclear ones; when you examine how you can reduce more carbon emissions faster and more cheaply with renewables than nuclear; and when you observe the real life examples of countries whose carbon reductions are greater after investing in renewables rather than clinging onto nuclear; then the only reason to include nuclear power in a climate plan is political.The Biden-Harris platform will likely continue to listen to the old school. After all, it’s who they know. But if they really want that revolution, they should open their eyes to the reality on the ground.A recent article in the Socialist magazine,pointed to an example in the Netherlands where a decision was made not to expand an existing nuclear power plant and instead build two offshore wind farms. Although the Fukushima disaster slightly influenced the decision, at the end of the day, as the article pointed out, it was all about “the law of value”, in other words, money. “With the declining cost of renewable energy, nuclear power simply does not make economic sense,” it said.In an important new study out of Sussex University in the UK —Differences in carbon emissions reduction between countries pursuing renewables versus nuclear power— the researchers concluded that choosing nuclear crowds out renewables and vice versa. This means that continuing to use old uneconomical nuclear plants — or investing in new ones — actually hampers renewable energy development, and thereby progress on climate change, and results in smaller carbon reductions and at a much higher cost.The study notes that, “per dollar invested, the modularity of renewables projects offers quicker emissions reductions than do large-scale, delay-prone nuclear projects,” the same point made by Lovins. And, as the study also says, the more we use renewables, the more improved their performance, exactly the opposite of nuclear which sees “rising costs or reduced performance with the next generation of technology.”This last is an important point for the Biden-Harris energy team to note. By including so-called new nuclear, they are dooming themselves to wasting both time and money better spent focused on renewables. Small modular reactors will not, as their plan asserts, come in at “half the construction cost of today’s reactors.” They will be far more expensive in relation to the electricity they would eventually produce. And of course they would arrive too late, and in too small a quantity and generate too little — and very expensive — electricity to make any difference to climate change at all.Biden-Harris must look at empirical data, not listen to spin doctors and establishment cronies who will keep them anchored to the status quo, thus deferring the very energy revolution they claim they will lead. If Biden-Harris remain in favor of action on climate AND for nuclear power, then they are part of the problem, not the solution.is the editor and curator ofBeyondNuclearInternational.organd the international specialist at Beyond Nuclear.Use code 30years for 30% off all Merchandise!Dismiss",1

Now, the school year will start virtually on Sept. 8, as officialsconsult with public health expertsand consider whether to welcome students back in a hybrid fashion starting Nov. 9.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement Wednesday that the decision was ""rooted in public health data and the invaluable feedback"" received as officials polled families on their concerns leading up to an ultimate decision previously planned for the end of August. But two Chicago Public Schools leaders, Chief Executive Officer Janice Jackson and Chief Education Officer LaTanya McDade,said in a statementthat they decided to make the call now to afford parents and families ""ample time to plan.""""As educators and dedicated education professionals, we all want students to be in school, but at this time, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) believes that current COVID-19 transmission trends would not allow us to reopen schools in a safe and responsible manner given the sheer number of people we serve every day,"" Jackson and McDade said.The announcement comes as the debate over whether schools should open amid the pandemic is intensifying ahead of the traditional start to the school year across the country.President Donald Trump, who has long lobbied for students to return to school, in a Wednesday interview on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" repeated claims that children are ""virtually immune"" from COVID-19.""If you look at children, children are almost – and I would almost say definitely – but almost immune from this disease,"" Trump said.An increasing number of public school systems – such as those in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles – have announced plans to at least start their school year with virtual learning.

240,Fauci Refused to Coauthor Paper With Wuhan Scientist Daszak Claiming COVID Was Not Made in a Lab,15.67,33.0,https://nationalfile.com/fauci-refused-to-coauthor-paper-with-wuhan-scientist-daszak-claiming-covid-was-not-made-in-a-lab/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-05,nationalfile,25,"Last Updated on June 5, 2021Peter Daszak, the man behind the EcoHealth Alliance, was behind research into coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, and helped funnel money from Anthony Fauci’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) towards their research,as National File reported.In fact, Daszak has been very open with the research conducted at said labroratory, which has been suggested as a potential source for the COVID-19 outbreak.National File reported this weekon the emergence of a video from Daszak from December 2019, where he boasts about manipulating coronaviruses in the lab. “Coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily,” Daszak said in the interview posted to YouTube. “The spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.”Yet despite this open admittance into the manipulation of coronaviruses, Daszak has been one of the loudest voices against the “lab-leak” theory, dismissing it as a “conspiracy theory,” and organising multiple actions trying to shut it down. In February 2020,he was behind a letterfrom multiple scientists rubbishing the theory, and only one week later,coauthored a paper from the NEJMwhich stated that “scientists tell us that SARS-CoV-2 did not escape from a jar,” contrasting the outbreak to the Greek myth of Pandora’s Box.This paper, in fact, shows further ties between Daszak and Fauci. Recently published emails show that Fauci, in fact, was given access to the paper beforehand, and even asked if he wanted to coauthor the paper.2/ That was the first public effort to use a big scientific journal to steer attention from the lab. A week later, Daszak did so again, with an@NEJMpaper insisting the virus had to be natural.Guess who saw the paper in advance and was asked to coauthor it?Dr. Anthony Fauci.— Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson)June 3, 2021The first part of the email fromGreg Folkers,Fauci’s Chief of Staff at the NIAID, is redacted, but likely contains some discussion regarding the upcoming paper. “So the question to you – do you want to be a part of this? ie [sic] be a coauthor,” Folkers asks Fauci. “I would vote no – it wud [sic] look weird to add you as a coauthor now. Plus, plate too full,” he continues. “I agree,” Fauci curtly replied. “I will not be a co-author.”As National File reported,Daszak had praised Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory, despite further emails showing that he was initially concerned about such an event having occurred:“As the PI of the R01 grant publicly targeted by Fox News reporters at the Presidential press briefing last night, I just wanted to say a personal thankyou [sic] on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Daszak said. “From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus’ origins,” he continued, expressing his wish to thank Fauci in person.Only a few months after that email, Fauci helped restore funding to Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, which President Trump’s administration had cut off over fears that the organisation had indulged in the potentially deadly “gain of function” experiments that led to the COVID-19 outbreak.Despite the treasure trove of thousands of emails from Fauci being legally obtained from Freedom of Information Act requests, Big Tech has worked to shut down access to these emails from the general public.The Informed Consent Action Network was locked out of their Twitter account twice in 24 hoursafter they publicized that they had acquired 2,957 emails sent from Anthony Fauci between February and May of last year. Following National File’s reporting, their account and two tweets were restored,with Twitter claiming that they had done so “in error.”",1

It was a Saturday, and he’d slept in. The night before, he had gone drinking by the beach with some friends. They’d sipped cheap apple liqueur, listened to Billie Eilish on his boom box. Now Jere (pronounced “yeh-reh”) needed to clear his head. He was supposed to spend this gray fall day on campus, finishing a group physics project about solar energy. The 22-year-old took a walk around the lake near his apartment outside Helsinki. Then, feeling somewhat refreshed, he jumped on the bus.The day went quickly. Jere caught up with his friends, many of whom he hadn’t seen since the pandemic began. They chatted about their Christmas plans, ordered pizzas from a favorite local spot, and knuckled down to work in the cafeteria.This article appears in the June 2021 issue.Subscribe to WIRED.At around 4 pm, Jere checked Snapchat. An email notification popped up on his screen. His hands began to shake. The subject line included his full name, his social security number, and the name of a clinic where he’d gotten mental health treatment as a teenager: Vastaamo. He didn’t recognize the sender, but he knew what the email said before he opened it.A few days earlier, Vastaamo had announced a catastrophic data breach. Asecurity flawin the company’s IT systems had exposed its entire patient database to the open internet—not just email addresses and social security numbers, but the actual written notes that therapists had taken. A group of hackers, or one masquerading as many, had gotten hold of the data. The message in Jere’s inbox wasa ransom demand.“If we receive €200 worth of Bitcoin within 24 hours, your information will be permanently deleted from our servers,” the email said in Finnish. If Jere missed the first deadline, he’d have another 48 hours to fork over €500, or about $600. After that, “your information will be published for all to see.”Jere had first gone to Vastaamo when he was 16. He had dropped out of school and begun to self-harm, he says, and was consuming “extreme amounts” of Jägermeister each week. His girlfriend at the time insisted he get help; she believed it was the only way Jere would see his 18th birthday.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoDuring his therapy sessions, Jere spoke about his abusive parents—how they forced him, when he was a young kid, to walk the nearly 4 miles home from school, or made him sleep out in the garden if he “was being a disappointment.” He talked about using marijuana, LSD, DMT. He said he’d organized an illegal rave and was selling drugs. He said he’d thought about killing himself. After each session, Jere’s therapist typed out his notes and uploaded them to Vastaamo’s servers. “I was just being honest,” Jere says. He had “no idea” that they were backing the information up digitally.In the cafeteria, Jere grabbed his bag and told his friends he’d turn in his portion of the physics project the next day. On the bus ride home, he frantically texted his best friend to come over. Then his mother called; as the adult listed on his old account, she’d received the ransom note too. She and Jere were on good terms now, but if she got involved she might learn what he’d said in his sessions. Then, he says, he’d probably lose her from his life completely. He told his mother not to worry. That afternoon, he filed an online police report.Jere poured himself a shot of vodka, then two or three more. He found his vape pen and took a Xanax, prescribed to him years earlier for anxiety. He’d stored a few pills in his bedroom drawer just in case, but he never believed he’d need them again. He passed out shortly after his friend arrived.The next morning, Jere checked Twitter, where he was both horrified and relieved to learn that thousands of others had received the same threat. “Had I been one of the only people to get the mail, I would have been more scared,” he says.Vastaamo ran the largest network of private mental-health providers in Finland. In a country of just 5.5 million—about the same as the state of Minnesota—it was the “McDonald’s of psychotherapy,” one Finnish journalist told me. And because of that, the attack on the company rocked all of Finland. Around 30,000 people are believed to have received the ransom demand; some 25,000 reported it to the police. On October 29, a headline in theread: “Vastaamo Hacking Could Turn Into Largest Criminal Case in Finnish History.” That prediction seems to have come true.If thescale of the attackwas shocking, so was its cruelty. Not just because the records were so sensitive; not just because the attacker, or attackers, singled out patients like wounded animals; but also because, out of all the countries on earth, Finland should have been among the best able to prevent such a breach. Along with neighboring Estonia, it is widely considered a pioneer in digital health. Since the late 1990s, Finnish leaders have pursued the principle of “citizen-centered, seamless” care, backed up by investments in technology infrastructure. Today, every Finnish citizen has access to a highly secure service called Kanta, where they can browse their own treatment records and order prescriptions. Their health providers can use the system to coordinate care.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoVastaamo was a private company, but it seemed to operate in the same spirit of tech-enabled ease and accessibility: You booked a therapist with a few clicks, wait times were tolerable, and Finland’s Social Insurance Institution reimbursed a big chunk of the session fee (provided you had a diagnosed mental disorder). The company was run by Ville Tapio, a 39-year-old coder and entrepreneur with sharp eyebrows, slicked-back brown hair, and a heavy jawline. He’d cofounded the company with his parents. They pitched ­Vastaamo as a humble family-run enterprise committed to improving the mental health of all Finns.For nearly a decade, the company went from success to success. Sure, some questioned the purity of Tapio’s motives; Kristian Wahlbeck, director of development at Finland’s oldest mental health nonprofit, says he was “a bit frowned-upon” and “perceived as too business-minded.” And yes, there were occasional stories about Vastaamo doing shady-seeming things, such as using Google ads to try to poach prospective patients from a university clinic, as the newspaperreported. But people kept signing up. Tapio was so confident in what he’d created that he spoke about taking his model overseas.Before “the incident,” Tapio says, “Vastaamo produced a lot of social good.” Now he is an ex-CEO, and the company he founded is being sold for parts. “I’m so sad to see all the work done and the future opportunities suddenly go to waste,” he says. “The way it ended feels terrible, unnecessary, and unjustified.”Tapio grew upin a “peaceful and green” neighborhood in northern Helsinki during a bad recession. His mother, Nina, was a trauma psychotherapist, and his father, Perttu, a priest. His grandparents gave him a used Commodore 64 when he was 10, which led him to an interest in coding. Something in his brain resonated with the logical challenge of it, he says. He also saw it as a “tool to build something real.”The obsession endured: In middle school Tapio coded a statistics system for his basketball team, and in high school he worked for the Helsinki Education Department, showing teachers how to use their computers. Rather than going to college, he set up an online shop selling computer parts—his first business, funded with “a few tens of euros,” he says. A couple of years later, at age 20, he joined a small management consultancy.The idea for Vastaamo came to Tapio when he was working with the Finnish Innovation Fund, a public foundation that invests in solutions to social and environmental problems. The fund sent him on a survey of health care systems in Western Europe. Being his mother’s son, he noticed that the Netherlands and other countries seemed to do a better job of providing mental health services than Finland did; the public system at home was known for patchy coverage and long wait times. Ever the coder, he wondered whether a web-based counseling service would help. It could sell vouchers to cities and towns, which could distribute the vouchers for free to residents. People could use the service anonymously. They wouldn’t have to worry about the stigma of seeking care, and they’d have access anytime, anyplace.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIn 2009, the Finnish Innovation Fund backed Tapio’s idea with an initial grant of about $12,000. He and his parents used the money—along with more than $13,000 of their own savings—to start Vastaamo, Finnish for “a place where you get answers from.” Tapio registered the company as a social enterprise, meaning that the bulk of its profits would be poured back into its mission to improve mental health services. He would own around 60 percent, and most of the remainder would belong to his parents. Perttu would serve as CEO.Clients could send a message to Vastaamo, and within 24 hours they’d get a personal response from a qualified therapist. (Wahlbeck, of the mental health nonprofit, notes that such services aren’t regulated by the government.) But counseling by internet “was not enough for customers,” Tapio says. Many of them needed access to in-person therapy.One way to meet that need was to grow Vastaamo into a network of brick-and-mortar clinics. Tapio planned to digitize whatever he could, from bookings to invoices to medical records—everything but the appointment itself. The idea was that independent therapists would join Vastaamo to avoid dealing with their own administrative headaches. Freed by automation, they’d have more time to spend with clients (and rack up billable hours).To deliver on this vision, Vastaamo needed an electronic medical record system, but Tapio didn’t like the options he found. Either the systems bristled with irrelevant features or they were too tightly tailored to a different area of medicine. The lack of good software, Tapio says, was one of the “main reasons” nobody had done what Vastaamo was about to attempt.A Vastaamo clinic location in Espoo, near where Jere lives.Rather than use an existing system, the company designed its own. It launched in late 2012, around the same time Vastaamo’s first in-­­person clinic opened, in the Malmi district of Helsinki. Tapio wouldn’t go into technical detail about the system, but in court documents he suggests it was browser-based and stored patients’ records on a MySQL server. More important for Vastaamo’s­ purposes, the interface was easy to use. When therapists applied for a job at the company, they heard all about how much it would quicken their work.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoBut the slick exterior concealed deep vulnerabilities. Mikael Koivukangas, head of R&D at a Finnish medtech firm called Onesys Medical, points out that Vastaamo’s system violated one of the “first principles of cybersecurity”: It didn’t anonymize the records. It didn’t even encrypt them. The only thing protecting patients’ confessions and confidences were a couple of firewalls and a server login screen. Anyone with experience in the field, Koivukangas says, could’ve helped Vastaamo design a safer system.At the time, though, fears of a breach were far from Tapio’s mind. The summer after Vastaamo’s first clinic opened its doors, he took over as CEO and set the company on a path toward expansion.In 2014 there was a change in the regulations around Vastaamo’s business. The Finnish Parliament decided to split medical information systems into two categories. Class A systems would connect with Kanta, the national health data repository, so they’d need to meet strict security and interoperability standards. Anyone who planned to keep their patients’ records in long-term electronic storage would have to use a Class A system.Smaller organizations, the kind that kept vital records in manila envelopes and filing cabinets, would be allowed to use Class B systems. These weren’t as tightly regulated, in part because they wouldn’t make very interesting targets for a hacker. Class B operators would simply self-certify to the government that their setup met certain requirements. “The government” being, in this case, a single man—Antti Härkönen—whose purview includes all 280 Class B systems in Finland.The new law gave Vastaamo several years to adopt a Class A system. The problem, Tapio says, is that the Finnish government hadn’t specified how psychotherapy practices should format their data. Vastaamo could build a Class A system and plug into Kanta, but there was “no way to stop, for example, general practitioners at health care centers or occupational health physicians from accessing” therapy records, he says.Outi Lehtokari, Kanta’s head of services, pushes back against this claim. “Tapio might have misunderstood how Kanta works,” she says. Patients can choose to restrict access to their information.In any event, on June 29, 2017, Vastaamo registered a Class B system. As Tapio tells it, the company was eager to upgrade to Class A as soon as the government released formatting specs for psychotherapy. But that didn’t happen. Instead, when the specs came out, Vastaamo kept on going with its Class B.Tapio says that Finland’s “supervisory authorities” then signed off on the system “numerous times” in the years ahead. Härkönen, who is one of those authorities, says that to monitor all the Class B systems carefully would be “mission impossible” for him. He adds, however, that there should be more “proactive inspections.”By 2018, Vastaamo was operating nearly 20 clinics and employing around 200 therapists and staff. By the end of 2019, annual revenue had risen to more than $18 million. The company drew the interest of Intera Partners, a Finnish private equity firm, which bought out the majority of Tapio’s and his parents’ stakes. Tapio took home nearly $4 million from the deal.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWith each new clinic that opened, the original process repeated: Härkönen reviewed Vastaamo’s self-certification and gave the thumbs-up. More patient data flowed into the MySQL server. And the reservoir behind the dam rose a little higher.Tapio first heardfrom the hacker on September 28, 2020. The demand was 40 bitcoin, around half a million dollars at the time. The message came to him and a pair of developers he’d hired in 2015, Ilari Lind and Sami Keskinen. Lind was responsible for maintaining the company’s IT systems, including its servers and firewalls; Keskinen was the data protection officer.According to a statement Tapio made to Helsinki District Court, he immediately notified various government authorities, including the police. Lind sifted through Vastaamo’s network traffic logs but reported finding no evidence of a hack. Tapio hired a security company called Nixu to investigate further. Two days later, Tuomas Kahri, COO of Intera Partners and chairman of the board of Vastaamo, sent an email to Tapio to thank him for his diligence in handling the breach. Kahri would later say that some of his own loved ones had been targeted in the attack.In early October, Tapio got another shock. Keskinen and Lind called with a confession: Just before they’d joined Vastaamo, they had been arrested as part of a security breach at Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Lind had discovered that he could download Tekes’ entire database, containing information on as many as 20,000 companies, by changing the URL on a funding application. He informed Tekes, which fixed the vulnerability—but he also notified Keskinen, who downloaded the database. There was a pretrial investigation for aggravated fraud, breach of confidentiality, and burglary, but the prosecution could not establish that Lind and Keskinen had used the database for financial gain.Tapio says that if he had known about the two men’s histories, he would never have hired them. (Keskinen and Lind declined to comment.) As it was, though, he had more pressing problems to worry about.On the morning of Wednesday, October 21, the hacker posted a message on Ylilauta, an anonymous public discussion board. “We have attempted to negotiate with the Ville Tapio, the CEO of vastaamo, but he has stopped responding to our emails,” they wrote in English. Until they got their 40 bitcoin ransom, they were going to leak 100 patient records each day. The first batch was already up on a Tor server. Anyone who wanted to could go read them.The hacker started emailing with Henrik Kärkkäinen, a reporter at the newspaper. To prove they were the real McCoy, they uploaded a file to the Tor server called “henrik.txt”—a snippet of their exchange. In emails to Kärkkäinen, the hacker scorned Vastaamo: A company with security practices that weak was the real criminal, he recalls them writing. They claimed to have been sitting on the stolen database for 18 months, unaware of its value.When Ylilauta’s moderators removed the posts, the conversation migrated to Torilauta, a popular discussion forum on the dark web. The hacker took on a name: ransom_man. At least one desperate person offered to pay the full 40 bitcoin. Another wrote, in English, “I have discussed about very private things with my therapist and will literally kys myself if they are released.” They had their bitcoin ready: “I can send it in minutes, I’m constantly refreshing this page.” About 30 payments ended up going to the hacker’s Bitcoin wallet, according to Mikko Hyppönen, the chief research officer at F-Secure, a global cybersecurity company. It is unclear whether ransom_man actually deleted anyone’s information.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe hacker did follow through on another promise, however. On October 22, they leaked 100 more patient records. Some belonged to politicians and other public figures. They contained details about adulterous relationships, suicide attempts, pedophilic thoughts. The next batch came around 2 am the following morning. The hacker also put all the records they’d leaked so far into a single file called “Vastaamo.tar.”And then something strange happened. Ransom_man replaced the first “Vastaamo.tar” with a much bigger one. It was 10.9 gigabytes—the entire leaked database. This file also contained a Python script that the hacker had used to organize the therapy records. The 10.9 GB upload seems to have been a mistake, because it disappeared in a matter of hours, along with the entire Tor server. Some speculated that Vastaamo had paid the 40 bitcoin, though company officials denied it.One victim had their bitcoin ransom at the ready. “I can send it in minutes,” they wrote. “I’m constantly refreshing this page.”Either way, ransom_man soon changed tactics and started extorting individual patients. This was unusual. Most of the time, cybercriminals go after institutions, according to Hyppönen. He knew of only one earlier instance of patients being singled out—in late 2019, after a breach at the Center for Facial Restoration in Miramar, Florida. (Since the Vastaamo attack, he adds, two other hacks have also targeted patients of plastic surgery clinics.) “Most attackers want money, and health care data is not directly monetizable,” Hyppönen says. But with real-world examples of the crime paying off, he adds, “it could become more common.”Vastaamo reacted by offering patients a free counseling session. Therapy continued as normal. One patient says her therapist advised her to consider that not everything being said in the news was true. Some patients picked up a physical copy of their records, to learn what had been stolen, and others joined Facebook groups dedicated to victim support. Jere, however, opted not to; he wanted to minimize his online presence. He changed his phone number and purchased credit protection. He never seriously considered paying the hacker, he says, because “there was absolutely no guarantee they would obey” their own terms.A Vastaamo clinic location in Turku.On the Mondayafter the breach became public, Tapio went to Vastaamo headquarters in Helsinki. He’d been summoned there by Tuomas Kahri, the Intera COO who a month earlier had thanked him. Instead of speaking to Tapio face to face, Kahri had a consultant hand him a letter. It said that Tapio’s contract as CEO was terminated.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoHours later, the company announced Tapio’s dismissal. Shortly after that, in response to a legal motion filed by Intera, the Helsinki District Court ordered the temporary seizure of $11.7 million worth of the Tapio family’s assets—exactly what Intera had paid for its share of Vastaamo. Kahri declined several requests to comment on Intera’s claims, but they’re described in public (albeit redacted) court documents.In its filings, Intera says it became aware of two previously unreported breaches at Vastaamo, in late 2018 and the spring of 2019. The second date fell shortly before the buyout went through. “Based on the information received so far, it is reasonable to assume that Ville Tapio was aware of the breach,” Intera argues. Not only that, but he “sought to conceal” it. Intera wanted to dissolve the transaction and reclaim the purchase price.Tapio, as the defendant, submitted written testimony in rebuttal. He claims to have been blindsided by the news of the 2019 breach. The reason he didn’t find out about it at the time, he writes, is that Keskinen and Lind—the “system architects”—never told him about it.On the morning of March 15, Vastaamo’s servers crashed and the patient database was replaced with a blackmail message. Tapio notified staff of the crash at 11:18 am, but no one appears to have discussed the possibility of a breach in either of the reports submitted to the government.According to Tapio’s testimony, ­Keskinen and Lind—who shared an administrator account—told him that the crash might have been caused by some minor adjustments they’d made shortly beforehand. But he says that Nixu, the cybersecurity company he hired in September, found something else: The shared account read the ransom message and deleted it.In Tapio’s version of events, then, whoever was using that account covered up the March breach. And the reason they did it, he contends, was to conceal a vulnerability they’d created themselves—one that had left Vastaamo’s patient database “without firewall protection” for more than a year.There were supposed to be three levels of security surrounding the database, Tapio tells me: one firewall at the network level, which blocked connections from the public internet; another around the individual server that stored the patient database; and the server configuration itself, which prevented connections from outside accounts. In November 2017, Lind spent a few hours configuring the server to allow remote access. Tapio believes that Lind and Keskinen wanted to be able to manage the server from offsite, and that instead of going to the trouble of setting up a VPN, they simply peeled back the firewalls.“Those are two professionals that know much more about the network and firewall and server management than I,” Tapio says. “I was not responsible.”Keskinen and Lind have not testified in the Intera case. They declined to comment on Tapio’s numerous allegations. Until the dispute is resolved, the $11.7 million that Intera wants back—the fortune that Vastaamo built—will remain frozen.In early Januaryof this year, the Vastaamo patient database reappeared on at least 11 anonymous file-sharing services across the public internet. The file contained all the same records as before but was a fraction as big, so it spread easily. Without an accompanying message, the motivations for the upload are hard to discern—but it did appear fewer than 48 hours before Vastaamo’s board was due to discuss the company’s future. Was this a spiteful push to bring the company down?Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIf so, then it was a success. On January 28, Vastaamo was put into liquidation, and it filed for bankruptcy two weeks later. In early March, its staff and services were transferred to Verve, a provider of occupational welfare services. The acquisition did not include Vastaamo’s customer data, and Verve will use a Class A system.Almost immediately after the hack happened, Parliament fast-tracked legislation that would allow victims like Jere to change their social security numbers in case of a serious breach. But patients were spooked, one counselor told the newspaper. “Not everyone who needed help may have sought treatment,” he said. Some argue that therapists should never be able to enter session notes into Kanta; now more than ever, patients will not risk having their data travel beyond the consultation room.In wider medicine, Koivukangas says, the Vastaamo scandal has highlighted the “unmet demand” for electronic medical record systems that are scalable, easy to use, and—crucially—secure. This is an area ripe for disruption, he says, and “prior to this breach, many thought with good reason that Vastaamo would’ve been one of those disruptors.” Until the market­place improves, he says, expect more bespoke solutions, and more breaches.Unless ransom_man is caught and the Finnish authorities sort out everything that happened at Vastaamo, it will be impossible to know exactly how “the incident” began. Would it have happened, for example, if Finland had been more proactive in policing electronic medical systems? Or if Tapio had implemented a more secure system? What’s clear is how it ended—in the most painful way possible for tens of thousands of patients. As more health care systems across the world go digital, the risk of that outcome rises.“Being honest about my mental health turned out to be a bad idea,” Jere says. He worries about identity theft, about some debt collection company calling him out of the blue and demanding tens of thousands of euros. He worries that his history of teenage alcoholism, so well documented on the web, will make it hard for him to find meaningful work as an adult. And he still worries that his mother may read his file one day. It’s somewhere in the ether, accessible to anyone.Subscribe now.mail@wired.com.",2

244,Sarah Palin's Facebook grift,-14.33,41.33,https://popular.info/p/sarah-palins-facebook-grift,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,popular.info,18,"Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for Vice President, is not the cultural icon she was a decade ago. In March, she appeared on ""The Masked Singer,"" where she sang ""Baby Got Back""dressed in a pink bear costume. So how is Palin making ends meet?One source of income, it appears, is her Facebook page, which has 4.5 million followers. An investigation by Popular Information reveals that, since May 4, Palin's Facebook page has linked to an obscure right-wing aggregation site called Analyzing America 280 times.The page is owned by Joshua Riddle and David Rufful. The pair claim to have founded Analyzing America ten years ago, but only purchased the domain in 2018. The site has been criticized for ""extreme right-wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and propaganda."" Last year, the siteimpliedthat Hillary Clinton might have murdered Jeffrey Epstein.Each time Palin's Facebook page shared a link to Analyzing America, it appends something called a UTM code. A UTM code is a way for publishers to know precisely how much traffic comes from a particular source. It looks like this:Analyzing America and other websites keep track of their visitors through special software — most commonly Google Analytics. Normally, if Palin's Facebook page shared a link from Analyzing America, it would show up on Analyzing America's Google Analytics dashboard as referral traffic from Facebook. It would be difficult to segregate out the traffic referred from Palin's Facebook page from any other Facebook page.By appending the UTM code, Palin's Facebook page solves this problem. Now Analyzing America can know exactly how much traffic Palin sent to their site. But Palin has no access to the data. So absent a relationship between Palin and Analyzing America, it would be pointless for Palin to append the UTM code. But the UTM code allows Analyzing America to pay Palin for sending traffic to its website.If this sounds familiar, that's because it is thesame methodThe Daily Wire, the website founded by right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro, used to boost its traffic. The Daily Wire was paying Facebook pages controlled by Mad World News, a noxious site that has built a huge audience on racist and violent content, to link to The Daily Wire. That scheme ended earlier this month after it wasexposed by Popular Informationbecause it violated Facebook's rules.Under Facebook's policy, Facebook pages cannot ""accept anything of value to post content that you did not create."" This rule, however, appears to be routinely violated by right-wing websites to artificially inflate the popularity of unreliable, low-quality content.""After an initial investigation, we found there’s enough evidence to merit a deeper review. In the meantime, we are taking temporary enforcement action and demoting the Page posting this content,"" a Facebook spokesperson told Popular Information.The Washington Times has significantly boosted its presence on Facebook through an undisclosed relationship with a large Facebook page called ForAmerica, which has over 7.85 million followers.Since October 8, 2019, ForAmerica has posted 1,360 links to The Washington Times. Over a recent one month period, June 9 to July 9, links to The Washington Times constituted 67% of all links posted by the ForAmerica page. This data comes from research conducted by the global civil organization Avaaz and provided exclusively to Popular Information.The Washington Times has only 692,000 followers on its Facebook page. But, since October, its relationship with ForAmerica has allowed it to dramatically increase its distribution on Facebook. Engagement with Washington Times content on the ForAmerica Facebook page frequently exceeds the engagement with Washington Times content everywhere else on Facebook combined.The evidence strongly suggests that The Washington Times is paying ForAmerica to post its content. Each link shared by the Washington Times includes a UTM code.ForAmerica is owned by a non-profit organization calledAmerica Inc. It is a sister organization to the Media Research Center, a right-wing organization dedicated to exposing the ""liberal bias"" in the news media. (ForAmerica and Media Research Center share the same address.)It is unclear what ForAmerica does other than operate a large Facebook page that links to The Washington Times. On its website, which is primarily a feed of its Facebook page, the organization says its ""mission is to advance freedom, prosperity and virtue, one click at a time.""Facebook told Popular Information that it has not yet established there is a paid relationship between ForAmerica and The Washington Times.Paying for traffic isn't the only thing that Analyzing America has in common with The Daily Wire. Analyzing America also operatesa clandestine network of Facebook pagesto promote its content. While these pages list a variety of owners, they all post the same content from Analyzing America at the same time.The pages in the network include Trump & The Great America (2.1 million followers), Chicks on the Right (1.3 million followers), Young Cons (998,000 followers), The Comical Conservative (2.2 million followers), Rush Limbaugh and the EIB Network (728,000 followers), and Red Symposium (162,000 followers).The pages list a variety of owners, including Young Conservatives LLC and Gregory Lawrence Burright. Three of the pages list no owner at all. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the centralized control of all six pages.Facebooksaysthat ""[w]hen we find domestic, non-government campaigns that include groups of accounts and Pages seeking to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing while relying on fake accounts, we remove both inauthentic and authentic accounts, Pages and Groups directly involved in this activity."" That appears to be the case here.But Facebook has previously taken a very narrow interpretation of this policy.Last October, Popular Information exposed more than a dozen large Facebook pages that were exclusive posting content from The Daily Wire in a coordinated fashion. Facebook said it didn't constitute coordinated inauthentic behavior because there were ""real people"" operating each page.

The export ban against those two companies had a devastating effect on the companies because it meant they couldn't get access to Google software, Qualcomm chips, and other Western technologies.It's not clear if the export ban will be as damaging to DJI as it was to Huawei and ZTE. Not only has DJI dominated the drone business for years, but Chinese companies dominate significant parts of the drone supply chain. So DJI might not have as much trouble sourcing components from domestic supply chains. Still, the announcement will certainly make it difficult for DJI to maintain its dominance of the drone business outside of China.The Trump administration's other major target is SMIC, a Shanghai company that owns and operates semiconductor foundries. In the past, SMIC has counted Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments among its American customers. When rumors began to circulate about an SMIC export ban a few months ago, Qualcomm reportedlybegan making plansto shift its semiconductor business away from SMIC. Qualcomm's biggest foundry partners are Samsung and TSMC, so it likely won't have too much trouble moving away from SMIC.The US government's focus with the SMIC listing is to prevent the Chinese company from getting access to the newest generations of semiconductor fabrication technologies.""Items uniquely required to produce semiconductors at advanced technology nodes—10 nanometers or below—will be subject to a presumption of denial,"" the US wrote in astatementannouncing the restrictions. The US is concerned that selling cutting-edge semiconductor equipment to SMIC will allow it to fall into the hands of the Chinese military.",2

It comes as conservative pundits and politicians have conflated critical race theory with schools’ diversity and inclusion efforts and anti-racism training, among other ideas.Receive our in-depth coverage of education issues and stories that affect North Texans.Or with:By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy“Just try to remember the concepts of [House Bill] 3979,” Gina Peddy, a Carroll administrator, said in the recording obtained by NBC News. “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust, that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives.”A teacher responded: “How do you oppose the Holocaust?”The author of a similar Senate bill, Sen. Bryan Hughes, denied that this was a proper interpretation of the new law.State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, wrote on Twitter that “Southlake just got it wrong.”“School administrators should know the difference between factual historical events and fiction,” Hancock wrote. “No legislation is suggesting the action this administrator is promoting.”Carroll ISD Superintendent Lane Ledbetter issued an apology to Southlake families late Thursday. He said the district recognizes that “there are not two sides of the Holocaust.”“As we continue to work through implementation of HB3979, we also understand this bill does not require an opposing viewpoint on historical facts,” he wrote. “As a district we will work to add clarity to our expectations for teachers and once again apologize for any hurt or confusion this has caused.”The comments stirred outrage. Texas Democratic Party Co-Executive Director Hannah Roe Beck condemned actions she called “terrifying.”“We’re seeing books banned, educators reprimanded for teaching authentic history, and kids deprived of their right to learn about the world they’re growing up in,” she said in a statement. “Texas Republicans are censoring education to pander to rightwing extremists -- and putting Texas families and kids in danger while they do.”The DMN Education Lab deepens the coverage and conversation about urgent education issues critical to the future of North Texas.The DMN Education Lab is a community-funded journalism initiative, with support from The Beck Group, Bobby and Lottye Lyle, Communities Foundation of Texas, The Dallas Foundation, Dallas Regional Chamber, Deedie Rose, The Meadows Foundation, Solutions Journalism Network, Southern Methodist University and Todd A.

248,The Air Force wanted to mothball over 100 planes. Here’s what Congress says it will permit.,0.67,46.33,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/04/the-air-force-wanted-to-mothball-more-than-100-planes-in-its-inventory-heres-what-congress-says-it-will-permit/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-04,defensenews,24,"WASHINGTON — Congress is seeking toblock the Air Force from retiringany of its A-10 Warthog attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones this fiscal year.On Dec. 3, the House and Senate Armed Services committees put forward the conference report of the fiscal 2021National Defense Authorization Act— a final version of the defense bill that includes input from both chambers. The bill is expected to be approved by Congress sometime next week and will then move to the desk of President Donald Trump, who hasthreatened to veto it.This year’s NDAA contained policy provisions on everything fromthe Pentagon’s organizational structureto military bases named for Confederate officers. For the Air Force, the biggest concern was whether Congress would greenlight the divestment of more than 100 aircraft, which service leaders said would free up funding for modernization priorities that include space technologies and the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept (which was recently updated to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control).Lawmakers have opted to let the Air Force retire some bombers, tankers and cargo planes, but they stridently protected others like the A-10 and Global Hawk from any reductions.Here is a breakdown of what the Air Force wanted to send to the boneyard, and how Congress responded:A-10:Congress’ battles with the Air Forceover the venerable A-10have been legion over the past decade, with the service seeking to retire the entire fleet in the mid-2010s. In FY21, the Air Force sought a more modest adjustment — the retirement of 44 A-10s, or about three squadrons worth of aircraft,leaving about 237 Warthogsto fly close-air support missions in the next decade.But Congress put the kibosh on that as well, stipulating in the NDAA that no funding be used to divest or retire any of the 281 A-10s currently in the Air Force’s inventory.Bombers:The Air Force hoped to retire 17 of its oldest B-1s, which leaders said were putting strain on the fleet due to the manpower needed to keep them running. In the defense bill, Congress repealed an existing law that requires the Air Force to maintain at least 36 combat coded B-1 aircraft — essentially agreeing to a reduction to the B-1 fleet.However, lawmakers put several new stipulations in place: The Air Force must maintain 92 bombers of any kind in its primary mission aircraft inventory. The service must place four retired B-1s in storage so that they can be reclaimed if necessary. And it cannot remove any B-1 maintenance billets, ensuring that the B-1s that stick around will get the time and attention needed to keep them flying.ISR fleet:Congress also rejected the Air Force’s plan to retire all the Global Hawk Block 20 and 30 surveillance drones — a total of 24 aircraft — which would have left RQ-4 Block 40s and the U-2 spy plane around to conduct the high-altitude surveillance mission.Over the past decade, the Air Force has tried multiple times to divest its Global Hawks and U-2s, with Congress refusing to permit the retirement of either aircraft. In response, Congress has stipulated a list of requirements the Air Force must meet before lawmakers consider that request. Specifically, lawmakers have asked for certifications from the Defense Department that the Air Force is developing a cost-effective way to replace the RQ-4 or U-2, or a waiver from the defense secretary stating that a better but more expensive capability is in development.Neither has been received, lawmakers wrote in the conference report.“The conferees understand and acknowledge that modernizing airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will necessitate divestment of legacy systems,” the conference report stated. “However, the conferees remain concerned about the Air Force’s continued inability to execute an ISR acquisition and replacement plan that appropriately manages operational risk to the global combatant commanders, as well as the service’s failure to comply with current public law.”Tankers:The Air Force wanted to divest 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in FY21, but the NDAA sketches out an alternative plan — one that forbidsany KC-135 retirementsover the next three years.Congress will allow the Air Force to move down to 50 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY21, 38 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY22, and 26 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY23.The Air Force currently has 56 KC-10s that are considered primary mission aircraft, so the language would allow the service to retire six aircraft in FY21 and a total of 30 tankers over the next three years, a source familiar with the bill told Defense News in June, when the House Armed Services Committee released identical language.Cargo planes:The service hoped to retire 24 C-130Hs, most of which would be directly replaced by 19 C-130Js that are set to be delivered in FY21. While the NDAA does not address the issue directly, it sets a minimum airlift aircraft inventory at 287 aircraft, including 230 combat-coded cargo planes.The report also included a provision that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring only Air National Guard airlift assets.Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

Ron Wyden (D-OR). President Joe Bidensignedthe American Rescue Plan Act into law in March. It directs the Treasury Department to distribute billions of dollars in stimulus funding to local and state governments.Those funds can be used to improve broadband access, but the bill severely limits the eligibility criteria for such projects. The bill says that only unserved or underserved communities can use the federal funding to improve broadband access, asnotes. According to the Federal Communications Commission, communities with internet speedsof under 25 Mbps downand 3 Mbps up are underserved. That definition has remained the same since 2015.Wyden says those speeds are not nearly fast enough for current needs, calling that benchmark ""woefully outdated."" He wants communities where speeds are less than 100 Mbps up and down to be classed as underserved and to be eligible for upgraded internet infrastructure under this plan.“The mass adoption of video calling, streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive apps by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that miserly speeds and data caps are holding back telework, remote education and telehealth capacity,” Wyden wrote ina letterto Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to telework and engage in remote schooling while sharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”Wyden went on to argue that a failure to address concerns “will further expand the digital divide and jeopardize our ability as a nation to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as you finalize the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Final Rule, I urge [Yellen] to clarify that underserved locations include anywhere affordable, reliable broadband of at least 100 Mbps symmetric is not available."" Wyden added that ""to be accessible, broadband must also be affordable.""Other lawmakers have been pushing the FCC to upgrade the definition of high-speed broadband to 100 Mbps up and down. Earlier this month, California announced a budget plan thatearmarked $9 billion for internet infrastructure, noting that ""service at speeds below 100 Mbps is not enough for households who are juggling the demands of distance learning, telework, and accessing health care online.""",2

The best hunting has been west of the ridge in the flooded grain fields and along the White, Cache, L’anguille, Black, and lower White rivers. The ducks are liking large expanses of water and avoiding the smaller pot holes and sloughs. Locally Horseshoe  and Midway hunters are off to a nice start and will only get better with colder weather. The AGFC surveys report only 25 percent of the expected birds have arrived so the best is still ahead.Christmas time brings both Santa and ducks.Deer hunters are enjoying a good season in spite of early season warm weather.  Crittenden County has harvested 140 deer so far.The state total that includes archery, muzzle loading, and modern gun is over 140,000 deer so far and there is still a month to go in some zones.Always check the free AGFC Hunting Guidebook because there are many zones and the regulations very in the zones.The bucks are in full rut and this is a good time to take a trophy. Lakeside Taxidermy has taken in several very nice deer to mount. Be careful when caping the deer and Never cut in front of the front shoulders.Don’t forget about all the small game available to hunters  that does not get a lot of attention. If you run beagles for rabbits, the season runs all February. Speaking of dogs, squirrels dogs are a great way to get that young hunter in the woods and let the hunting bug bite him. Don’t forget quail, even though there are not many left in the Delta.Shooting preserves have these sporty tasty birds and they test your wing shooting.This is fun for both the kids and the daddies. I am a living testament for these kinds of hunting, both as the boy and the dad.I have not heard from any duck picking services. This is important information to pass on to my readers.

Haaland was most recently therepresentative for New Mexico's first congressional districtafter being elected in 2018, and she previously served as the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of New Mexico. As a member of the Laguna Pueblo, Haaland will be the first Indigenous person to hold a presidential cabinet position.Biden famously saidhis presidency would offer ""time to heal""in his acceptance speech. This recent appointment similarly signals a collective healing following the government's history of broken treaties and violence toward Indigenous people. As interior secretary, Haaland will be responsible for managing and conserving tribal lands, as well as national parks and natural resources. She will also work to undo the Trump administration'sdesecration of public landsand help carry out Biden'scomprehensive climate plan, among many other duties.""It would be an honor to move the Biden-Harris climate agenda forward, help repair the government to government relationship with Tribes that the Trump Administration has ruined, and serve as the first Native American cabinet secretary in our nation's history,"" Haaland said in a statement shared with.The news was celebrated by congresspeople and celebrities alike. ""Much love to all our relatives for which this moment is long overdue,""Ava DuVernay tweeted, whileRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, ""This is a big deal. Historic appointment. A visionary Native woman in charge of federal lands. Unequivocally progressive. Green New Deal champion. Exquisitely experienced . . . Sister, you are going to do such a great job. I am so proud of you and the movement.""The nomination is a momentous win for representation, and its significance to Indigenous communities cannot be underplayed. In a press statement, Nikki Pitre, the executive director of theCenter for Native American Youth, described the moment as ""historic"" and ""groundbreaking."" Pitre said, ""Native youth look to her as more than a role model, but as an Aunty, because we trust her and are continually inspired by her leadership."" Crystal Echo Hawk, the founder and executive director ofIllumiNative, also described feeling a sense of trust in Haaland's leadership. ""She is the visionary and powerhouse leader needed to safeguard our lands and our future,"" Hawk said, adding, ""This appointment is a victory in our collective fight against systemic racism and discrimination. However, the fight is far from over. Native peoples must be represented in all departments and all levels of the US government.""Just two years ago, back when she was running for Congress, Haaland spoke to POPSUGAR about theimportance of representation in government. ""I think that diversity is the most important thing right now for elected offices, because we need everyone at the table. We need everybody's input on how to solve the issues that are plaguing our society,"" she said. ""It's been evident to me that having a first Native woman would help to move the conversation forward in maybe a different way than it has.""Now that she has been formally selected by Biden, Haaland will have to be confirmed by the Senate. Theupcoming Georgia runoff electionson Jan. 5 will determine which party controls the Senate.",1

It was captured on video. It lasted nine interminable minutes. It ignited our righteous indignation—an oil fire floating on an ocean of grief.Mostpeople felt this way about the video of the murder—yes, murder—of George Floyd last year. The officer responsible, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of three counts on Tuesday for snuffing out a man’s life over the course of those nine excruciating minutes.Some observers, though, seem less concerned about the murder of George Floyd and more concerned about—well, it’s hard to say what they are concerned about. Some of them are claiming that the trial was a set-up. Rigged. That the jury had it in for Chauvin. Or that Chauvin didn’t really matter because therealvillains were Joe Biden and Maxine Waters and Don Lemon, who somehow managed to pressure the jury into convicting Chauvin on all counts. Probably because they were afraid of cancel culture.It is possible to stipulate all sorts of things here:Yes, President Biden and Rep. Waters both made statements they shouldn’t have. Watersencourageddemonstrators to get “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin weren’t convicted, which wasn’t an explicit call to violence but was at least unwise. Bidensaidthat the evidence was “overwhelming” in his view and encouraged the jury to reach “the right verdict” without making explicit what the right verdict was. Neither should have said what they said. Political leaders should be circumspect when offering public commentary about ongoing trials—or better yet, should altogether refrain from commenting. Still, as violations of norms go, these seem more like misdemeanors than felonies. And most importantly: There is no evidence that they swayed the jury.Yet by fixating on all of this, the Extremely Online right has been doing something interesting in the hours since the verdict was announced. They’re not willing to be pro-Chauvin, exactly. Well, most of them, anyway. You don’t see a lot of affirmative defenses of Chauvin being mounted, or a lot of folks proclaiming his innocence.But there is an awful lot of anti-anti-Chauvinism.

Data from the U.K. suggests it is about 50% more transmissible. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have predicted it will become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March.The Louisiana Department of Health is doubling down on efforts to increase surveillance for new and more contagious variants of the coronaviru…“This number is going to keep going up and up and up,” said Kanter. “This variant is going to continue to circulate, it’s going to continue to take hold in Louisiana and drive transmission.”The confirmed cases announced Tuesday highlighted the precarious position Louisiana and other U.S. states find themselves in amid a rollout of vaccines that is slower than initially hoped. As state and local officials rush to vaccinate residents, the transmissibility of the new variant threatens to outpace the effect of inoculations.The state has increased its surveillance of the faster-spreading coronavirus variant. Prior to Jan. 25, the state sent just five samples every other week to the CDC for genome sequencing to identify variants. Since then, the CDC increased that number to between 10 and 22 samples.But to understand how quickly the variant is hopping from host to host, the state would need to sequence hundreds of genomes, said Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University who has studied viruses for over four decades.None of the confirmed or suspected cases came from the CDC’s genome sequencing. Those cases were flagged by a certain PCR test that also spits out data suggestive of a variant.That particular PCR test, manufactured by Thermo Fisher, is not used all over the state, according to health department officials. That may be a reason why the variant cases have so far only been identified in Region 1, which includes New Orleans, and Region 5, which includes southwest Louisiana.Mutations are the result of small copying errors that occur during the virus replication process. Most of those mutations are inconsequential, said Garry.But every so often, a mutation makes the virus more successful in accomplishing its goal: to infect cells and use them to replicate.When a certain group of mutations starts appearing in large numbers, that’s an indicator that something about them is beneficial enough that it’s increasing the spread. Scientists call this group of mutations a variant. The B.1.1.7 variant has 17 different mutations, the most concerning being a few that alter how easily the virus can slip into cells using its spike proteins.When Ricky Salvaggio signed up for the Moderna vaccine trial in July, he didn’t think it was a big deal. A retired pharmacist, the 66-year-old…With Mardi Gras approaching and restrictions relaxing at some businesses, experts who track the evolution of viruses worry it may create ideal conditions for the virus to hop from person to person.“We’re giving the virus a free-rein playground to operate in,” said Garry. “There are not going be parades and things like that, we won’t see people congregate the same way, but whenever people get together in a situation where they are not wearing masks and in a crowded space, that is an opportunity for this virus to infect a bunch more people.”Other more infectious variants, such as the South African variant and the Brazil variant, have not yet been found in Louisiana, but they have been detected in other states.",2

The action will affect a wide range of industries -- in particular, thetech industry.Biden's""Promoting Competition in the American Economy"" executive orderconsists of 72 directives for federal agencies. Regarding the tech industry, the president ordered the Federal Trade Commission to establish rules on surveillance and on the accumulation of data, to bar unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces and to prevent restrictions on allowing independent repair shops and DIY repairs on people's own equipment, also known asright-to-repair.It also seeks torestore Obama-era net neutrality rulesand calls for greater scrutiny of mergers, singling out ""dominant internet platforms.""""No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies,"" Biden said in Friday's press conference. ""Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism. It's exploitation.""Biden's wide-ranging executive order comes as tech companies have been under greater scrutiny from politicians and government agencies for buying rivals instead of competing with them.Facebook's acquisitions of photo app Instagramand messaging app WhatsApp, for instance, have been the focus of antitrust complaints against the company. Last week, a federal judge dismissed lawsuits filed by theFederal Trade Commissionand a group of state attorneys general that accused the social media giant of engaging in anticompetitive practices. The FTC can file an amended complaint.Biden's executive order also goes after how tech companies gather a trove of personal data as part of their business. That's been an issue for Facebook and Google, among others.The order also calls for regulation of companies that operate ""dominant online retail marketplaces"" that sell their own products as well as those of other businesses, encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to apply laws that bar unfair competition on such platforms. This kind of enforcement would likely focus on Amazon, whereabout 44% of e-commerce in the UStook place in 2020. The FTC's new chair, Lina Khan, mapped outa legal theory for regulating Amazonwhile a student at Yale Law School. Amazon hasasked the FTCto require Khan to be recused from investigations into the company, arguing she wouldn't bring objectivity to the process.Federal lawmakers have also singled out web retailers that run a marketplace where they sell goods alongside other businesses. Of a slate offive proposed antitrust laws, one seeks to make it illegal for a company to compete unfairly on its own platform, favoring its own products above those of other companies.Facebook and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Biden's order calls on the Federal Communications Commission to enact a number of measures toimprove competition and transparency among broadband providers, includingrestoring net neutrality rulesthat were undone under the Trump administration. The 2015 rules, adopted under former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, preventedbroadband providers from blocking or slowingaccess to the internet or charging for faster access.The American Civil Liberties Union praised Biden's order but also urged the president to appoint a fifth FCC commissioner to help spur action. TheFCC is currently deadlockedwith two Democrats and two Republicans.""We applaud President Biden for urging the FCC to take actions that will restore net neutrality and help to lower broadband costs and ensure necessary transparency,"" said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the ACLU, on Friday.But for the agency to achieve those goals, we need a full slate of FCC Commissioners. Biden must appoint a fifth FCC Commissioner immediately.""",2
256,Derek Chauvin Convicted on all Charges in Death of George Floyd,1.0,46.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/derek-chauvin-convicted-all-charges-death-george-floyd,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,voanews,24,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of all charges Tuesday in the death of George Floyd nearly a year ago.Chauvin had been charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.After hearing closing arguments Monday, the 12-member jury – comprising six white people and six people who are Black or multiracial -- spent about 10 hours over two days discussing information from the three-week trial before coming to a decision.In their final arguments, a prosecutor accused Chauvin, who is white, of killing Floyd, an African American, by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. A defense attorney, Eric Nelson, contended that Floyd died partly from drug use and that Chauvin was following his police training in the way he arrested Floyd last May on the curb of a street in Minneapolis.Prosecutor Steve Schleicher summed up the case against Chauvin, who held down the handcuffed Floyd as Floyd lay prone on a city street and gasped — 27 times, according to videos of his arrest — that he could not breathe.“He was trapped…a knee to his neck,” Schleicher said, with Chauvin’s weight on him for nine minutes and 29 seconds.“George Floyd was not a threat to anyone,” Schleicher said. “All that was required was some compassion, and he got none.”“No crime was committed if it was an authorized use of force,” Nelson argued.“The state has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” the legal standard for a conviction, the defense attorney concluded as he asked the jurors to acquit Chauvin of murder and manslaughter charges.Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby convenience store.The routine police investigation of a minor case last May 25 and Floyd’s subsequent death have resulted in one of the most consequential U.S. criminal trials in years.Chauvin pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison.Last week, Chauvin invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and did not take the witness stand. Under U.S. law, the prosecution must prove the allegations against defendants, and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Trial judge Peter Cahill told the jury not to draw any inference on Chauvin’s innocence or guilt from his declining to testify.After dismissing the jury Monday, Cahill criticized Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who is Black and a member of Congress since 1991, for recent remarks regarding the trial. Waters told protesters in Minnesota to “stay on the street” and to become “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin is found not guilty.“I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that’s disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,” Cahill said.Despite Cahill’s plea, U.S. President Joe Biden Tuesday described the evidence against Chauvin as overwhelming.“I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict,” Biden said during an Oval Office meeting with Latino lawmakers. “I think it’s overwhelming in my view. I wouldn’t say that unless the jury was sequestered now.”As the case nears its end, authorities in Minneapolis are bracing for possible street protests after the verdict. Many stores are boarded up to prevent a recurrence of the damage and looting that took place after Floyd’s death almost a year ago.“We cannot allow civil unrest to descend into chaos. We must protect life and property,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said Monday. “But we also must understand very clearly, if we don’t listen to those communities in pain and those people on the streets, many of whom were arrested for speaking a fundamental truth that we must change, or we will be right back here again.”Protests, some of them violent, broke out in many cities in the United States and throughout the world after Floyd’s death. The Black Lives Matter movement was at the forefront of the demonstrations, but thousands of people who had no previous connection to the Black-led protests joined in to condemn Chauvin’s actions, and more broadly, police treatment of minorities.The same issues raised by Floyd’s death came to the forefront in the community again when a now-resigned police officer in a Minneapolis suburb fatally shot a 20-year-old African American man during a traffic stop on April 11.Meanwhile, Republicans in the U.S. Congress said they planned to hold a censure vote Wednesday over comments made by Representative Maxine Waters of California.On Saturday, Waters was in the Minneapolis suburb where another Black man had been killed by a police officer earlier this month.Waters told protesters who had gathered in Brooklyn Center over the death of Daunte Wright that she wanted to see a murder conviction against Chauvin. She added, “We gotta stay on the street, we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational, we’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”On Monday, Judge Cahill called Waters’ comments “abhorrent” and that and they could lead to a verdict being appealed and overturned.The Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

257,COVID-19 vaccine inequity: Inside the cutthroat race to secure doses,-5.0,46.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/covid-19-vaccine-inequity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,denverpost,25,"PARIS — No one disputes that the world is unfair. But no one expected a vaccine gap between the global rich and poor that was this bad, this far into the pandemic.Inequity is everywhere: Inoculations go begging in the United States while Haiti, a short plane ride away, received its first delivery July 15 after months of promises — 500,000 doses for a population over 11 million. Canada has procured more than 10 doses for every resident; Sierra Leone’s vaccination rate just cracked 1% on June 20.It’s like a famine in which “the richest guys grab the baker,” said Strive Masiyiwa, the African Union’s envoy for vaccine acquisition.In fact, European and American officials deeply involved in bankrolling and distributing the vaccines against coronavirus have told The Associated Press there was no thought of how to handle the situation globally. Instead, they jostled for their own domestic use.But there are more specific reasons why vaccines have and have not reached the haves and have-nots.COVID-19 unexpectedly devastated wealthy countries first — and some of them were among the few places that make the vaccines. Export restrictions kept the doses within their borders.There was a global purchase plan to provide vaccines for poorer countries, but it was so flawed and underfunded that it couldn’t compete in the cutthroat competition to buy. Intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority. Rich countries expanded vaccinations to younger and younger people, ignored the repeated pleas of health officials to donate their doses instead and debated booster shots – – even as poor countries couldn’t vaccinate the most susceptible.The disparity was in some ways inevitable; wealthy nations expected a return on their investment of taxpayer money. But the scale of the inequity, the stockpiling of unused vaccines, the lack of a viable global plan to solve a global problem has shocked health officials, though it wasn’t the first time.“This was a deliberate global architecture of unfairness,” Masiyiwa told a Milkin Institute conference.“We have no access to vaccines either as donations or available for us to purchase. Am I surprised? No, because this is where we were with the HIV pandemic. Eight years after therapeutics were available in the West, we did not receive them and we lost 10 million people.”“It’s simple math,” he said. “We have no access. We have no vaccine miracle.”___The World Health Organization has duly updated its epidemic playbook after every outbreak, most recently with Ebola in mind. Then, as often in the decades before, an emerging illness was largely contained to countries lacking robust public health services, with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions and limited travel connections.For years, the WHO assessed countries’ readiness for a flu pandemic: The United States, European countries and even India ranked near the top. The U.S. readiness was 96%, and Britain at 93%.On Jan. 30, 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak in China to be a global emergency. It would be months before the word “pandemic” became official.But that same day, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, or CEPI, was planning for the worst. CEPI announced “a call for proven vaccine technologies applicable for large scale manufacturing,” according to minutes from its scientific advisory group. CEPI said it would be critical “to support the strategy for global access” early in the game.CEPI quickly invested in two promising coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna and CureVac.“We said very early on that it would be important to have a platform where all countries could draw vaccines from, where there’s accountability and transparency,” said Christian Happi, a professor at Nigeria’s Redeemer’s University and a member of CEPI’s scientific advisory committee. “But the whole idea was that we thought rich countries would fund it for the developing world.”Happi said officials never expected the pandemic would strike first and hardest in Europe and the U.S. Or that their assessment of preparedness in the world’s most advanced economies would prove horrifically optimistic.Global health experts would soon come to realize that rich countries “could sign a piece of paper saying they believe in equity, but as soon as the chips are down, they will do whatever they want,” he said.On March 16, five days after WHO first described COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” the novel mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna was injected into a trial participant for the first time.By then, the disease was tearing through the elderly populations of Europe and the United States.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were the first companies to come out with an mRNA vaccine, devising methods of mass production almost on the fly. Scientists at Britain’s Oxford University also came up with a vaccine with a more traditional platform, and Bill Gates brokered a deal for them to partner with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company with global reach but no experience in vaccine production.On April 30, the deal was confirmed: AstraZeneca took sole responsibility for the global production and distribution of the Oxford vaccine and pledged to sell it for “a few dollars a dose.” Over the next few weeks, the U.S. and Britain secured agreements totaling 400 million doses from AstraZeneca.The race to make and secure vaccines was on, and the United States and Britain were leagues in front of the rest of the world — a lead they wouldn’t lose. Still, both countries would see life expectancy decline by at least a year in 2020, the biggest drop since World War II. In the European Union, 22 countries saw their average lifespans cut short, with Italy leading the list.___But as grim as the situation was, all those countries had a major advantage: They were home to the pharmaceutical companies with the most promising vaccine candidates, the world’s most advanced production facilities, and the money to fund both.On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed and promised to deliver vaccines against coronavirus by New Year’s. With unparalleled money and ambition behind the project, Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui was more confident than his counterparts in Europe that a vaccine was in the offing. He signed contracts almost without regard to price or conditions.“We were frankly focused on getting this as fast as humanly possible. If I had to redo it, I probably should have voiced more of a global dimension,” said Slaoui. “The operation had focused, which was frankly also part of its success, on staying out of the politics and making the vaccines.”The idea of including clauses to ensure that vaccines would go to anyone besides Americans wasn’t even considered.At the same time, the U.S. repeatedly invoked the Defense Production Act — 18 times under the Trump Administration and at least once under Biden. The moves barred exports of crucial raw materials as factories were ramping up production of the as-yet-unapproved vaccines — and eventually, of the vaccines themselves.But it also meant those materials would run low in much of the rest of the world. The U.S. stranglehold would lift only in spring 2021, and only partially.Operation Warp Speed supercharged the global race to secure vaccines, but it would still take another two weeks until COVAX — the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility — was formally announced as the entity to ensure equity, with the Serum Institute of India as the core supplier for the developing world.COVAX had the backing of the World Health Organization, CEPI, vaccines alliance Gavi and the powerful Gates Foundation. What it did not have was cash, and without cash it could secure no contracts.“Operation Warp Speed signed the first public deals and that started a chain reaction,” said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator for supply. “It was a like a rush on the banks, but to buy up the expected supply.”Some involved in the COVAX project flagged India as a potential problem early on, according to minutes of meetings in late spring and early summer of 2020.India’s government had blocked exports of protective gear, but many global health authorities who hadn’t fully grasped the extent of pandemic nationalism found it unimaginable that the country would block vaccines when the world was counting on them. Also, India had so far been spared the waves of death that were sweeping across Europe and the Americas.A separate plan put forward by the government of Costa Rica and the World Health Organization to create a technology-sharing platform to expand vaccine production foundered. Not a single company agreed to share its blueprints, even for a fee — and no government pushed them behind the scenes, according to multiple people involved in the project.On the global scale, the one organization that could have pushed for more technology sharing was the Gates Foundation, whose money to WHO nearly matches that of the U.S. government.Instead, Bill Gates defended stringent intellectual property rights as the best way to speed innovation. His foundation poured money and influence into the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which also failed to generate the money or influence needed to ramp up production outside already existing hubs.In the United States, meanwhile, manufacturing and the trials went on in parallel, which is where taxpayers and the companies took enormous risks that paid off for both.But in retrospect, Slaoui said, given the sheer amount of taxpayer money involved, each time they signed new contracts the U.S. and other countries could have pushed companies harder to share their knowledge, if only for the duration of the pandemic.“From a geopolitical standpoint, it’s critical that they do that,” he said.Nowhere was the situation more dire than Africa. In February, WHO’s African expert in vaccine development, Richard Mihigo, was among many who said the continent’s experience with other pandemics had uniquely prepared it for a complex vaccine deployment.Five months later, contemplating the plight of a continent that gets 99% of its vaccines from abroad, Mihigo adds a rueful footnote: “One of the lessons we learned from this pandemic is how badly prepared we were in vaccine production in the region and how dependent we were on imports.”Those imports have only barely begun to materialize — and they are insufficient to meet even the limited goals of the COVAX initiative to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.___From the start, the coalition of organizations that created COVAX found themselves fighting the last war.The plan was designed as an international pool to spur demand for vaccines and treatment of diseases with a relatively small global footprint, said Winnie Byanyima, head of UNAIDS.Something like Ebola. But the coronavirus pandemic looked nothing like an Ebola outbreak.“That itself was a structural weakness,” she said.Although the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had between them set aside billions for vaccinating the developing world, that money was intended to go to countries and was out of bounds for a global vaccine sharing plan like COVAX, said Mike Muldoon, managing director for innovative finance at the Rockefeller Foundation.Meanwhile, governments competed to secure contracts for vaccines by the hundreds of millions.On Dec. 8, Britain became the first country to formally authorize a start to widespread vaccinations, injecting 90-year-old Margaret Keenan with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Six days later, the United States started its own vaccinations. And on Dec. 26, the EU followed suit. China and Russia had been vaccinating even before releasing data from their homegrown inoculations.The Western companies with the most promising doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, had by then been churning out vials for months before formal approval, based on pledges from the wealthy countries that an enormous market awaited. Those doses were stockpiled in Europe and North America and a small number of countries, like Israel, that paid a premium.COVAX pleaded for cash to do the same. Instead, it got pledges.“As time passed and it became clear which vaccine candidates were going to be the leading contenders and which were most likely to succeed, the governments that had resources went and bought the supplies,” CEPI chief executive Dr. Richard Hatchett told the AP. “COVAX was not in a position to do that.”Months later, when COVAX finally had the money to sign deals for global supplies, Hatchett acknowledged they were at the end of the line.The lack of capital available to vaccine makers to boost their capacity outside the small number of existing manufacturing hubs was also “a lost opportunity,” Hatchett said.“We approached the international financing institutions, including the World Bank and the (International Finance Corporation) about making those investments and they were not willing to do that,” he said. CEPI ended up investing about $1.5 billion, far less than what a major financial institution might have been able to commit.COVAX missed its own goal of beginning vaccinations in poor countries at the same time as rich ones. It finally delivered vaccines on Feb. 24, to Ghana, a load of 600,000 AstraZeneca doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and transported by UNICEF planes.By that date, 27% of the population in Britain had been vaccinated, 13% in the U.S., 5% in Europe — and 0.23% in Africa, in countries that had secured their own bilateral deals after growing impatient with COVAX delays. The rift was growing by millions of doses every day.And pharmaceutical plants were beginning to crumble under the promises they’d made.AstraZeneca announced repeated delivery cuts to Europe. Pfizer’s production briefly slowed. A fire at a Serum Institute construction site prompted a letter to Brazil warning that “supply to you cannot be guaranteed in the foreseeable months.” Moderna supply cuts soon followed to Britain and Canada.In the United States, officials tossed millions of corrupted doses of vaccine from the Emergent Biosolutions plant in Baltimore after discovering that workers had inadvertently blended ingredients from the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. An untold number of doses were never produced because of new restrictions meant to prevent errors. Many of those vaccines were intended for export.So COVAX had to hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine being produced in India would come through, because it had secured few of the innovative mRNA doses that are now considered the most effective against the coronavirus variants. The initial refrigeration requirements were daunting, and the price was higher than the traditional vaccine candidates.The mRNA vaccines are widely considered a scientific and manufacturing triumph — and a risky bet. Never before approved for use against any disease, they are now considered a hugely promising medical innovation and a potential gamechanger against infection.But by the time it was clear the mRNA doses were a viable alternative, even in poor countries with limited cold chain, the available supply had been snapped up in Europe, the United States and Canada. And India, in the throes of its own COVID-19 surge, diverted its vaccines for its own use.According to the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a grouping of human rights organizations advocating for broader sharing of vaccines and their underlying technology, the coronavirus has created nine new billionaires. The top six are linked to the successful mRNA vaccines.For Byanyima, of UNAIDS, this is a travesty and a sign that the world has learned little in the decades since the AIDS pandemic was brought under control in the United States, only to kill millions in Africa because treatments were unaffordable: “Medicines should be a global public good, not just like a luxury handbag you buy on the market.”COVAX has delivered only 107 million doses, and now is forced to rely upon uncertain donations from countries that may prefer to donate directly to the needy, so they can receive the credit.A readout from its June board meeting slipped in an acknowledgement that it needed to better interpret and respond to market conditions and “the reality that a higher risk appetite is needed in a pandemic setting.”___For the pharmaceutical industry, mRNA is the ultimate confirmation that hard work and risk-taking is rewarded. And those companies keep tight hold on the keys to their successful vaccines.When Moderna and Pfizer created new production lines, it was in the insular European and American manufacturing networks that had as much stake as anyone in both ensuring that the injections meet the highest standards and keeping promises not to abuse intellectual property.Many public health officials have pushed for technology transfer during the pandemic. Initially resistant, the Gates Foundation has changed its position in favor of sharing.Dr. Clemence Auer, the EU’s lead negotiator for vaccine contracts last summer, said the question of compelling pharmaceutical companies to suspend their vaccine intellectual property rights to increase the worldwide supply of coronavirus vaccines never even came up.“We had a mandate to buy vaccines, not to talk about intellectual property, ” Auer said.“The global community should have had this discussion back in 2020 but that didn’t happen,” he said. “Maybe we should have done it last year, but now it’s too late. It is spilled milk.”CEPI includes equity clauses in the vaccines that it invests in, among them the successful Moderna candidate, but has yet to invoke them during the pandemic. Some include requirements to make a vaccine available to populations in need at affordable prices, as is the case in CEPI’s Moderna contract. But Moderna was first available exclusively in wealthy countries and even now only limited amounts are going outside Europe and the United States.A separate push to lift intellectual property restrictions on vaccines and medicines has also gone nowhere in the World Trade Organization.And WHO is reticent to criticize donor nations or the pharmaceutical companies. The U.N. health agency works by consensus and needs them for other aspects of global health — and for its own continued existence. The Biden administration has reversed Trump’s decision to defund and leave WHO, but the damage has been done.“A lot of these multinational organizations, these plans, these coalitions, they don’t have teeth to enforce what they think is a fair and equitable way to distribute resources,” said Dr. Ingrid Katz, an infectious disease researcher at the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. She said the key question is whether vaccines and essential medications are a commodity or a right.“If it’s going to be a commodity, we’re going to keep walking down this road every time we have something like this,” she said.And if it is all going to rely on the generosity of rich countries, a lot of people are going to die. Four million have died already.In all, at the recent Group of Seven meeting of wealthy nations pledged to donate 850 million doses, compared with the 11 billion that WHO says will be needed to end the pandemic.A close look at the G-7 promises of donations shows that most aren’t expected to be delivered until well into 2022. The Biden administration fell short on its pledge to send 80 million doses abroad by the end of June: By mid-July, at least 44 million doses had been sent, including 2.5 million to Canada, which has already given at least one vaccine dose to more of its population than any other country. Africa has yet to receive its doses from the United States.___Oceans away from the deprivation of the developing world, 7-year-old Russell Bright and his 5-year-old brother went to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans to get their shots — part of a trial for young children. Maybe they got the vaccine; maybe they got the placebo.Wearing a Spider-Man mask, Russell said he longs for a vacation trip to the water park and then a return to school without having to wear masks and stay at arms’ length from his friends.“Both me and my wife are already vaccinated,” said his father, Adam, “and so the sooner I can get them vaccinated and to feel comfortable being outside, not having to wear a mask, I thought the easiest way to get it is to go through the trial.”Scientists agree that children are at low risk from COVID-19. But that hasn’t stopped richer countries from stockpiling precious vaccine supplies to inoculate the young, even as poor countries have few or no shots to give.A recent meeting of WHO’s vaccine allocation group disbanded with nothing accomplished, because there was no vaccine to allocate. “Zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of J&J vaccine,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor at the organization.“Every single one of our suppliers is unable to supply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk,” Aylward said.Both Trump and Biden administration officials reject the notion that the U.S. or any country would share vaccines until they’d protected their own. And they both note that the U.S. bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, topping the world in confirmed cases and deaths.“We had a responsibility to what I say, ‘put on our own oxygen masks before helping others,’” CDC Director Rachelle Walensky said in May.But a plummeting jet takes all passengers with it, whether or not they are wearing masks. And the failure to provide vaccines across the globe ensures that COVID-19 will continue to spread, and mutate, and sicken, and kill.“It speaks volumes about where we are as a globe when you have the source of decision-making sitting with very few people who have a lot of wealth and are essentially making life and death decisions for the rest of the globe,” Mass General’s Katz said. “Every month that we lost put us further and further behind.”___Maria Cheng reported from London, and Aniruddha Ghosal from New Delhi.

258,Amazon’s plans to buy MGM recall the studio’s origins,1.0,40.33,https://forward.com/culture/470292/amazon-mgm-louis-b-mayer-rocky-james-bond-purchase-hollywood-lion/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,forward,25,"Leo the Lion in 1928Photo by Wikimedia CommonsAmazon has nabbed a lion in winter.The retail and entertainment giant announced Wednesday that it would acquire MGM, the storied movie studio for $8.5 billion, giving them the keys to franchises likeJames Bondand Rocky, and landing the flagging studio around $3 billion more than its valuation. If all this consolidation seems like a product of the 21st century’s rapacious online monopolies, it’s actually true to the spirit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s multihyphenate origins.It all started with a few Jews. Samuel Goldwyn (né Goldfish), a Polish immigrant, who founded Goldwyn Pictures in 1916, produced a raft of silent films, standing out from the crowd of upstart studios with a striking production card featuring a real-life lion encircled in a crest.In 1924, Marcus Loew, who owned a chain of theaters, bought Goldwyn’s outfit. This was part of the old “vertical integration” system, wherein production companies also controlled distribution and owned the cinemas showing the films. It was a bit of anantitrust issue,but onerecently vanquishedright as Netflix began snapping up theaters. Loew acquired Goldwyn to diversify his slate of pictures after buying Metro Pictures Corporation a few years before.So, so far we have the Metro and the Goldwyn part of MGM. Where does the last M come in? Louis B. Mayer, who helped start Metro, but struck out on his own with Louis B. Mayer Pictures, came to Loew asking to be bought — in exchange,Mayerbuilt on his success as producer alongside the wunderkind Irving J. Thalberg.These men came to embody the Hollywood Golden Age with classics like “Gone with the Wind” and “The Wizard of Oz.” Their way of doing business — what Mayer termed, was recently brought to life in David Fincher’s“Mank.”We also have these two to thank for the Oscars, whichMayer began in order to spurn Hollywood unions.But fortunes rise and fall. Over the years the house that Mayer (and Goldwyn and Loew and Thalberg) built changed quite a bit to stay in the game. It paired with United Artists. It changed hands between businessman Kirk Kerkorian, Ted Turner, an Italian conglomerate. It even filed for bankruptcy in 2010.While the studio is responsible for some of the most iconic images in film, for many decades its story was one of fighting to survive and stay relevant. Leo the lion had some lean years, and now Amazon has the lion’s share.Let’s just hope that Jeff Bezos isn’t the new James Bond.PJ Grisar is a Forward culture reporter.

259,Democrats Keep These Inconvenient Facts From Constituents,15.67,30.67,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/04/02/fight-left-wing-lies-with-facts-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-02,dailysignal,25,"A couple of years ago, I gave a speech before a conservative, predominantly white audience. I couldn’t help but notice a tall, heavyset black man, arms folded, standing in the back. From time to time, I would look at him, only to see him frown and shake his head, I assumed disapprovingly, when I made what I considered important points.After the speech, he came up to me. “I am angry,” he said. “Not at you—at myself. I thought I was well-informed. I read the news. I watch the news. I now see I’ve been manipulated by the party that I voted for all my life.”He then ticked off some of the points I made in my speech that he said surprised or even shocked him.He said he had no idea that (according to a 2004 Thomas B. Fordham Institute study) 44% of Philadelphia public school teachers send their own school-age kids to private school. Yet the Democratic Party adamantly opposes school vouchers, which would give K-12 children of urban parents a chance at a better school.He did not know that Democrats, including President Barack Obama, tried to end the Washington, D.C.,Opportunity Scholarship Program. It is a lottery that allows fortunate parents to opt out of their local public school for a better private school. The program is so popular that there are far more parents who want to participate than there are seats.“What’s more important, ” he asked me, “than making sure are kids arewell-educated?”He did not know that, in 1965, 25% of black kids were born outside of wedlock, versus 70% today, a phenomenon that cannot be attributed to slavery and Jim Crow. He did not know that Obama once said, “Children who grow upwithout a fatherare five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.”He said he was unaware that out of the approximately 390,000 slave owners in 1860, no more than a “handful” were Republican, according to conservative Dinesh D’Souza.He did not know thatmore Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did Democrats. Nor did he know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than did Democrats. He did not know that Democrats founded the Ku Klux Klan and that one of its goals was to stop the spread of the Republican Party.He said he was unaware that, before 1938, when the first federal minimum wage law was enacted, a black teenager waslikely to be employed than a white teenager.He did not know that, according to Harvard economist George Borjas, illegal immigration creates winners and losers. But the big losers are low- and unskilled American workers of color who compete against low- and unskilled illegal immigrant workers—who place downward pressure on the wages of the native-born.The man did not know that, according to The Washington Post, in recent years, more unarmed whites have been killed by the police than unarmed blacks. He was unaware of studies, including one by a black Harvard economist, that found the police more hesitant, more reluctant, to pull the trigger on a black suspect than on a white suspect. He did not know that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, police killings of blacks declined almost 80% from the late ’60s through the 2010s, while police killings of whites have flatlined.He did not know that, about racism, then-Sen. Barack Obama said: “The previous generation, the Moses generation, pointed the way. They took us 90% of the way there. We still got that 10% in order to cross over to the other side.” This would be the same Obama who, when he became president, said: “The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives—you know, that casts a long shadow. And that’s still part of our DNA that’s passed on. We’re not cured of it.”According to MSNBC political analyst Steve Kornacki, 43,000 votes in just three states would have switched the winner from Joe Biden to Donald Trump. This means all Republicans need to do is change the minds of a small percentage of the electorate.The man at my speech proves this is more than doable.DISTRIBUTED BYCREATORS.COM",1
260,Congressman Roger Marshall defeats Kris Kobach in Kansas Republican Senate primary,0.67,46.33,https://www.kansascity.com/article244717957.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-04,kansascity,17,"Congressman Roger Marshall defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas Republican race for U.S. Senate Tuesday, a victory driven by a party establishment that considered the OB-GYN from Great Bend the best chance of continuing 81 years of uninterrupted GOP control of the state’s Senate seats.Marshall and Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state, fought bitterly in the primary, engaging in intense mudslinging over who was the true conservative and staunchest ally of President Donald Trump.The Associated Press called the race for Marshall shortly after 9 p.m. According to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, Marshall had 39% of the vote to Kobach’s 26% with three-quarters of precincts reporting.Bob Hamilton, a Kansas City area businessman who spent millions of his own wealth to blanket the airwaves with ads, had 19%.“Keeping the Republican majority is at stake, that the Republican majority in this country may well go through Kansas and we are the backstop” Marshall told supporters Tuesday night.Marshall took a call from Trump in front of supporters, putting him on speakerphone. Trump, who declined to endorse during the primary, congratulated Marshall on an “incredible race.”Marshall, a second-term representative who represents the state’s vast 1st District, will face Democrat Barbara Bollier in the general election. Bollier, a former Republican and current state senator from the Johnson County community of Mission Hills, is poised to wage the most competitive Democratic challenge for Senate in Kansas in years.“It’s clear to me that we need change in Washington, and we need to end the era of hyper-partisanship and division. People just want our elected leaders to work together to get things done. That was obvious before this pandemic, and it’s even clearer now,” Bollier said in a statement.The election culminates a stunning fall for Kobach, an informal adviser to Trump who carved out a national reputation as an immigration hardliner. Kobach had staked his chances of electoral redemption on a primary victory after he lost the 2018 governor’s race to Democrat Laura Kelly.But groups with ties to national Republicans spent millions urging voters to reject Kobach for fear that he would again lose to a Democrat if nominated. The effort resulted in brutal TV ads highlighting how he hadn’t been chosen for a position in the Trump administration and his campaign had paid a volunteer who posted on white nationalist websites.“I voted for Marshall. I just like information that I had,” said John Bevan, an 85-year-old retired school administrator in Newton. “Kobach, I had questions about him … there’s a lot of publicity coming out saying that he couldn’t make Trump’s cabinet and other things, financial things, dealings that he had.”Money flowed into the race on all sides. In the final eight days before the election, outside groups booked $2.5 million in pro-Marshall and anti-Kobach TV ads, according to Medium Buying, which tracks ad purchases. A pro-Kobach group bought $419,000 in air time while a “meddling” group running ads likely to prop up Kobach purchased $2.3 million in air time.“Republican voters have chosen to put their best foot forward and given us the best chance to send a common sense conservative to the Senate,” said David Kensinger, a longtime Kansas Republican strategist.The Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law described the victory as the “first skirmish to stop Chuck Schumer’s brazen Senate power grab was fought tonight in Kansas” — a reference to TV ads run by a group linked to national Democrats designed to boost Kobach in the primary. The SLF spent $2.1 million supporting Marshall in the race.National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young said he was “more confident than ever” the Kansas seat would remain in Republican hands.Kobach, acknowledging defeat, immediately urged Republicans to back Marshall.“We will hold this seat and I will do everything I can to make sure that happens for the Republican party,” Kobach said during his concession speech.The general election will pit doctor against doctor as the coronavirus continues to grip Kansas and much of the nation. Both Marshall and Bollier feature their medical backgrounds prominently in their campaigns and are likely to lean on their credentials as they try to connect with voters this fall.Marshall has talked about how he’s delivered thousands of babies and even tried, unsuccessfully, to be listed as “Doc Roger Marshall” on the ballot. Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist, originally pitched her slogan as “Washington is sick, send a doctor” before the pandemic emerged.“Clearly, Dr. Marshall takes away the doctor card from Bollier, and she uses it all the time, on the (Kansas) Senate floor, the House floor, and in her commercials,” Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, said in a statement in July.Despite their shared profession, the two physicians have sharply split over their response to the coronavirus. Marshall has campaigned in-person throughout the state, shaking hands and often going maskless. Bollier has rarely left her home, instead hosting virtual campaign events over Zoom.Still, Bollier assembled an extraordinary fundraising machine that shattered previous records for Democrats in Kansas. Bollier left the Republican party in 2018 over frustrations with Trump and GOP hostility toward LGBTQ rights. As a candidate, she has mostly sidestepped Trump.“On the campaign trail, she has proven herself as a capable and compassionate leader who will always put Kansans first,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, a group that works to elect Democratic women.National Republican groups, which rallied to Marshall’s side during the primary, are likely to again come to his aid in the fall. Some Republicans also predict Marshall will muster a stronger, more competitive campaign against Bollier than Kobach would have.“It’s going to help Republicans up and down the ballot,” Kelly Arnold, a former Kansas Republican Party chairman, said. “I know Congressman Marshall will have the resources and invest those resources into our get out the vote campaign … to make sure not only Roger Marshall is elected but all of our candidates.”The Kansas City Star’s Bryan Lowry and The Wichita Eagle’s Michael Stavola contributed reporting.This story was originally publishedAugust 4, 2020, 8:58 PM.",2
261,Marjorie Taylor Greene says HIPAA shields her from vaccination questions. It doesn’t.,0.0,45.0,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/21/marjorie-taylor-greene/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-hipaa-shields-her-vacc/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,politifact,25,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has been an outspoken critic of vaccines and masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. After she tweeted that the disease was a threat only to people who are obese or over 65 — very inaccurate medical guidance — Twitter banned her for 12 hours.Greene held a news conference and was promptly asked if she herself was vaccinated.""Your first question is a violation of my HIPAA rights,"" Greene saidJuly 20. ""You see, with HIPAA rights, we don’t have to reveal our medical records, and that also involves our vaccine records.""HIPAA is theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and it contains rules governing the privacy of medical information.But the law has no bearing on whether Greene can be asked about her medical history, according to both legal experts and official HIPAA guidelines. Whether she answers is a matter of personal choice, not the law.TheU.S. Health and Human Service Departmentsummarizes HIPAA as setting ""rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information."" This mainly targets insurance companies and health care providers, which are among the parties the law calls ""covered entities."" These entities can’t share your health records without your permission. If they do, they face stiff penalties.Notably, employers are not on the list of covered entities.Greene described HIPAA as though it conferred a special protection against being asked about her medical history. Mark Rothstein, a University of Louisville law professor specializing in HIPAA, said Greene is mistaken.""It is not a general shield that permits individuals to avoid disclosing their own health information,"" Rothstein said.""Individuals often must disclose their health information, or authorize the disclosure by a HIPAA covered entity, when applying for employment, life insurance, etc.,"" Rothstein said. ""The individual does not have to release the health information, but then they may not be hired or offered insurance.""On the specific matter of vaccination status, employers arefree to askworkers if they have gotten the shot. That means any member of the public, including the media, can ask the question of a government official who works for them.""That is not a HIPAA violation, and employees may decide whether to provide that information to their employer,"" theHHS said.Greene’s director of communications, Nick Dyer, told us, ""Congresswoman Greene’s medical records, including her vaccination status, are none of the media’s business.""Greene said questions from reporters about whether she’s been vaccinated violate her HIPAA rights.That’s not true. HIPAA gives people the right to control how hospitals and insurance companies share their medical records, but it gives no blanket protection against being asked health questions, or having to answer them.Employers may ask employees if they are vaccinated, without running afoul of HIPAA, according to federal guidelines.Greene can sidestep the question as a matter of personal choice, but not because of HIPAA.We rate this claim False.",2

Trump also slammed that recovery as tepid and made several other claims that includedanother implicit criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman,whom he appointed.Did you hear the latest con job?

266,What happens if Trump refuses to concede the election to Joe Biden?,-5.1,44.2,https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2020/11/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-the-election-to-joe-biden.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,syracuse,25,"What happens if President Donald Trump refuses to concede the election? Every major news outlet projected Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential race on Saturday, with 290 electoral votes to Trump’s 214; Biden also won the popular vote by 4.5 million votes (and counting).Trump has repeatedly claimed voter fraud without providing any evidence andfiled lawsuitsover mail-in ballots in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. But his attempted legal challenges, and recounts in states like Wisconsin and Georgia, arenot expected to change the overall outcome.Biden claimed victory Saturday and vowed to be a president for all Americans beginning Jan. 20, on Inauguration Day. The president-elect has also already begun making moves to get his administration started, announcing a coronavirus advisory board on Monday -- the same day Ben Carson, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, tested positive for Covid-19.Other leaders, including former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton,George W. Bushand Jimmy Carter, have all recognized and congratulated Biden as the soon-to-be 46th president of the United States. Bush, the last Republican to hold the nation’s highest office before Trump, said Sunday that “this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.”Yet Trump’s team still has not started the transition process to ensure a smooth transfer of power to Biden. The Associated Press reports the General Services Administration, tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect, has not started the process and has given no guidance on when it will begin.What happens if Inauguration Day rolls around and Trump is still refusing to leave the White House? Do squatter’s rights apply at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?The 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is clear: “The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of their successors shall then begin.”Voxnotes that Trump could (and should) follow tradition and attend Biden’s inauguration, much like how Biden, Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016. But if Trump opts to stay in the White House until Biden is sworn in, Biden has the right to order the Secret Service to physically remove Trump like any other trespasser.“...The United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,” Biden’s campaignsaidFriday.But don’t expect Trump to be dragged out of the building like WikiLeaks founderJulian Assangewas from the Ecuadorian embassy last year.“There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed inSeptember.Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also promised to keep the military out of any election disputes.“This isn’t the first time that someone has suggested that there might be a contested election,” he toldNPR. “And if there is, it’ll be handled appropriately by the courts and by the US Congress. There’s no role for the US military in determining the outcome of a US election. Zero. There is no role there.”Dec. 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes, including recounts and court contests, at the state level. The Electoral College formally votes Dec. 14, and then Congress counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6, two weeks before Inauguration Day.The New York Postnotes that if the election is somehow still in dispute, things could get complicated: Some states could deliver two sets of electoral votes and Vice President Mike Pence, who serves as president of the Senate, could opt to throw out both sets of votes from those states. If neither candidate has 270 electoral votes, then Congress would vote for president and vice president; the House of Representatives would need a majority by 26 votes to choose a president and the Senate would need at least 51 votes to determine the VP.In that unlikely scenario, if the Senate somehow chooses a vice president but the House doesn’t pick a president, the vice president-elect serves as president until all is resolved. If neither body of Congress can successfully vote by Inauguration Day, then the presidential line of succession takes effect and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would serve as president until a new president is chosen.ButABC Newsnotes no presidential candidate in modern history has ever refused to concede. Even Al Gore conceded to Bush in 2000 after a recount in Florida ended 36 days of uncertainty.“I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College,” Gore said. “And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”But will it take Trump longer than Gore to admit defeat?The White House has not indicated Trump plans to concede — “That word is not even in our vocabulary right now,” campaign manager Jason Miller said Monday onFox Business— and Vice President Pence said Monday the race “AIN’t over” yet.“Told @VP Team Today: ‘It ain’t over til it’s over .. And this AIN’T over.!’ @RealDonaldTrump has never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” Pence’s official Twitter account said Monday.Trump also repeated a number of dubious claims about results in Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia on Monday.“The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted.Told@VPTeam Today, “it ain’t over til it’s over.. and this AIN’T over!” President@realDonaldTrumphas never stopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted! 🇺🇸The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated.

267,Was the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Mother of All War Crimes?,10.25,34.5,https://www.fairobserver.com/more/international_security/hans-georg-hiroshima-nagasaki-dresden-hamburg-bombing-war-crimes-history-news-15001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,fairobserver,21,"This year marks the 75thanniversary of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is reason enough to mull over its meaning and its implications. In a recentarticlefor Fair Observer, Peter Isackson has made a strong case that the annihilation of the two Japanese cities by American bombers represents the “mother of all war crimes.” Given the long history of atrocities committed during times of war, I find this a rather bold statement that should not go unchallenged.The case for the defense rests on two claims. First, the demonstration of American nuclear capabilities heralded in a period of stability, which quite likely saved Western Europe’s nations from being overrun and conquered by the Soviet Union and subjected to its rule. Second, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are far from exceptional as war crimes go, if indeed the bombing of the two cities was a war crime at all.In my younger years, in a very different world, I served for a couple of years in the German air force. I never flew a plane. I spent most of my time on duty in a tower close to the border to what at the time was the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic (CSSR), a member of the Warsaw Pact and a satellite of the Soviet Union. We did electronic surveyance of the CSSR airspace, following Czech and Slovakian fighter planes as they performed their exercises as best as they could (more often than not they couldn’t, lacking basic motivation). It was a tedious job, boring as hell, particularly when the weather was bad and the pilots were grounded.Excitement, however, surged once a month, when we waited for the arrival of Russian long-range bombers. They took off from Minsk in what at the time was the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Their mission: attack the towers along the West German border with the CSSR and the German Democratic Republic. We saw them coming, small dots on our radar screens. When they were in front of our tower, there was a small red blip, a fleeting flicker, and we knew if this had been— an actual real-life attack — we would all be dead, gone up in smoke in a small nuclear mushroom.At the time, we did not think much of what had just happened. It was part of a game, along the lines of MAD magazine’s “Spy vs Spy” — inane, a waste of time, and somehow not very real. It was not until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the regime in Prague and the unraveling of the Soviet empire that we learned that the game had been much more serious and potentially deadly than what we suspected. There were plans on the other side of the border to overrun West Germany, conquer Western Europe and subject it to Soviet rule. Among thescenarioswas a nuclear attack on Bonn, West Germany’s sleepy capital, designed to decapitate West Germany’s political elite.What prevented the Soviets and their toadies from carrying out their plans was not human compassion but a realist assessment of the distribution of military forces and the resolve of the Western allies to use them. At the time, this was called MAD — mutually assured destruction. It was grounded in the notion that any attack on the part of the Soviets would immediately trigger a full response of Western nuclear forces, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Soviet Union. The leadership in Moscow was fully aware of this logic. They did not like this “balance of terror,” but they ultimately submitted to its logic. Others, by the way, did not.Andrey Gromyko, the Soviet Union’s long-term foreign minister,claimsin his memoirs that at one time, Chinese leader Mao Zedong tried to get the Soviet Union to launch a nuclear attack on the United States, arguing that “his country could survive a nuclear war, even if it lost 300 million people, and finish off the capitalists with conventional weapons,” thus guaranteeing the triumph of communism. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets were not convinced and increasingly distanced themselves from Beijing.The logic of mutually assured destruction fundamentally altered the behavior of great powers, at least with respect to each other. It is to be hoped that the logic of the “balance of terror” is going to be enough to keep the US and China level-headed in the future, despite rapidly growing tensions between the two.Unfortunately enough, war crimes are the norm rather than the exception when it comes to armed conflict. The claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are ontologically different rests on a technological assumption. For some reason, nuclear weapons are fundamentally different from conventional ones. I am not sure what constitutes the basis of this assumption. Take the firebombings of the German cities ofDresden and Hamburgduring the Second World War, which cost the lives of tens of thousands of ordinary people — women, children, the elderly. Take the massacre ofBabi Yar, in Ukraine, where in two days nearly 34,000 Jews were killed by German. Or, going back further in history, take the death toll during the Thirty Years War, which cost the lives of half of the population of what is today Germany.Massacres of the most atrocious form are hardly an invention of the 20thcentury, as Goya’s renditions of the barbarities visited on his fellow countrymen during the war against the French between 1808 and 1814, depicted in most horrifying detail. This was a war against an enemy that invaded the country in the name of the Enlightenment and revolutionary fervor. Or, as the Germans would say,— If you don’t want to be my brother, I will smash your skull.For the victims of war crimes — more often than not civilians — it probably does not really matter how they were killed and why they were killed. It is quite understandable — human all too human, as Nietzsche would say — that horrendous deeds provoke retribution. The firebombing of German cities, the rape of German women caught be advancing Soviet armies — both are understandable given the atrocities committed by Germans during the war, in the name of Hitler and the Third Reich. Most Germans, or so most recent research suggests, were more than comfortable supporting a regime that guaranteed them a modicum of prosperity. Few asked where it came from.For that, Germans were punished in the most horrendous fashion. Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and Cologne and many other towns and cities went up in flames, leaving behind a landscape hardly different from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Hamburg was named Operation Gomorrah, after the Biblical city destroyed by “sulfur and fire” for its sins, and,accordingto historian Keith Lowe, was on completely different level than the German raids on Coventry and London, “comparable with what happened in Nagasaki.” It was a just retribution for the crimes committed in their name, a retribution for the tens of millions of victims who paid with their lives for Hitler’s ambitions to conquer the world.I would suggest that the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the retribution for the crimes committed by Japanese forces, in the name of racial superiority hardly different from Nazi ideology, against the peoples subjugated during the war. I have grave doubts that the victims of the Nanjing massacre or of the hundreds of young Asian “comfort women” pressed into sexual slavery by Japanese forces would consider the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a war crime, but rather than an act of just retribution for Japanese atrocities committed during the war.Whether or not the United States was justified in meting out redistribution is a different question. After all, given America’s self-declared status as a leading Christian nation, it should perhaps have heeded the words of the Bible exhorting believers not to take revenge, “but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’ says the Lord” (Romans 12:19). But then, Americans have a tendency to pay lip service to the scripture while doing the opposite in real life.The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was one of these turning points in history that define a whole epoch. It demonstrated, once and for all, humanity’s ability to destroy itself. Had Hitler been in a position to get hold of “the bomb,” he surely would have used it to obliterate London, Moscow, perhaps even New York. The same goes for Stalin, only this time it would have been Berlin that would have gone up in a mushroom. If the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime, it was nothing more than another episode in a long history of atrocities committed in the course of wars, not more, not less — an episode which reaffirms once again the sad reality that the veneer of civilization is merely skin deep.We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.Per MonthThe current stage of liberal democracy generates myriad grievances that fuel resentment, providing a basis for new waves of populist...Unfortunately, more often than not, the environmental consequences of a healthy diet are disastrous, particularly in the case of avocados.One of Europe’s favorite fruits contributes to the destruction of biodiversity and natural habitats.",1
268,Can America Restore Its Democracy?,-11.67,42.0,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/john-feffer-us-election-2020-results-joe-biden-donald-trump-american-democracy-news-15277/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,fairobserver,21,"You know about the five-second rule. According to conventional wisdom, food that has dropped on the floor can be safely eaten if retrieved within five seconds. Some scientists have even set upexperimentsto confirm this folk saying. Of course, all bets are off if your toast falls on the floor buttered side down and you haven’t mopped the kitchen in recent memory.Today, after a contentious election and with the results of the presidential race still uncertain, we are all now looking down at the ground. It’s been four years since Donald Trump dropped the buttered toast of our democracy onto the floor. After four years face down in the dirt, can our democracy be picked up, dusted off and restored to some semblance of integrity?Thepollsmade it look like Joe Biden would be an easy winner, maybe even in a landslide. The Democrats were expected to retake the Senate. The huge number of early votes — nearly 100 million — suggested that the 2020 turnout would be the greatest in more than 100 years. The Democratic Party is supposed to benefit from more souls at the polls.The polls were off. If Joe Biden wins, he will do so by a slender margin and only after considerable legal wrangling by both parties. The Democrats are now a long shot to win control of the Senate. And the huge turnout has translated into Donald Trump getting more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, more in fact than any Republican candidate in history.Texas did not go blue. Neither did Florida or Ohio. The Republican Party went all in for Trump, and he delivered beyond his base. But Arizona may have flipped, and Georgia might as well. If the infamous “Blue Wall” holds — at least Wisconsin and Michigan if not Pennsylvania — then Biden will become the next president.Still, who in their right mind would want to lead the United States at this perilous moment? The pandemic is surging. The economy hasn’t climbed out of its hole. Donald Trump has applied hisscorched-earth approachto both foreign and domestic policy. The Republican Party has demonstrated that it delights in playing dirty, refuses to compromise for the national good and embraces the most malign of Trump’s many fictions from the uselessness of masks to the myth of climate change.Exit polls, meanwhile,reveala country divided by more than just party affiliation. Democrats, for instance, overwhelmingly want to contain the current pandemic while Republicans want to focus on reopening the economy. This dynamic explains why so many Trump voters believe the president better handles both the economy and the pandemic, even if the evidence of his mismanagement is obvious to everyone else.Trump’s “law and order” message also proved influential among Republican voters, despite the president’s blatant violations of law and disruptions of order. Heck, according to a recent judicial ruling, even the president’s Commission on Law Enforcementbroke the law!Perhaps the most sobering conclusion from the election is that nearly half the country is indifferent to the actual mechanisms of democracy. They just don’t care that their president refused to endorse a peaceful transition of power if he loses. They don’t care that he has derided the very act of votingby insisting, as he did early Wednesday morning, on enlisting the Supreme Court in an effort to stop the counting of the remaining ballots (except in those states, like Arizona, where he hopes to catch up). Nor do they see anything wrong with the Republican Party’s efforts to keep certain groups of people away from the polls.That doesn’t bode well for the future of American democracy, especially if the country continues to abide by the Electoral College. For the last several decades, US presidential elections have resembled Groundhog Day — and I don’t mean the movie. Why should one groundhog determine the length of winter? Don’t the other groundhogs get a vote? Likewise, why should a voter in Pennsylvania matter more than a voter in Maryland or Wyoming?Trump is not the only culprit here. The ground was dirty before he dropped our democracy on it. The Democrats and their patronage systems, like Tammany Hall in New York and Richard Daley’s machine in Chicago, set some dismal precedents. But now it is the Republican Party that, to preserve its governing majority in the absence of a popular mandate, is warping the rules of the game and breaking the few rules that remain.Let’s say that Biden ekes out a victory. What’s the damage report on Trump’s four-year assault on democracy? After the 2016 election, the pundit class asserted that one man, however powerful, could not tear down the 250-year-old edifice of American democracy. There was much talk of “guardrails” and “adults in the room,” all of which were supposed to contain the ungovernable id in the White House.Over the course of four years, however, Trump systematically disposed of the supposed adults in the room — Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis, John Kelly — in favor of yes-men and one or two yes-women. In addition, through executive orders, judicial appointments and obsessive Twittering, he moved the guardrails so that he could steer America wildly off the road.Just before the 2018 midterm elections, Iwrote, “it would be poetic justice if what’s left of the mechanisms of democracy — voting, the courts, and the press — can still be used to defeat a potential autocrat, his family, and all the putative adults he’s brought into the room to implement his profoundly anti-democratic program.”Over the last two years, those mechanisms were in fact on full display. Despite Trump’s full-court press, the judiciary has represented an important check on his power,blockingsome of his attacks on immigrants, hisefforts to withholdhis financial information and tothrow out ballots. The mainstream media, meanwhile, continued to nip at Trump’s ankles. The New York Times, for example, published one expose after another about Trump’srecord on the pandemic, histaxes, hisfinancial relations with Chinaand so on.And now the voters have had their say. Despite all the efforts by the Republican Party to suppress the vote, around67% of eligible votersturned out this year, the highest percentage since 1900. Trump supporters did what they could to push against that tide. Theyintimidatedvoters. TheydisruptedDemocratic Party events and eventried to run a Biden busoff the road in Texas. Theyrestrictedthe number of ballot drop-off locations. The post office, run by a Trump appointee,ignoreda court order to locate 300,000 mail-in ballots at risk of not being delivered. But voters gonna vote.Let’s also salute all the people who have made that vote possible. Despite the pandemic, tens of thousands of people showed up to staff polling sites and count ballots. Then there are all the volunteers who participated in get-out-the-vote campaigns by knocking on doors, making phone calls, sending texts and doing grassroots fundraising to keep the operations going. Democracy, in other words, is not just about the politicians and the voters. It requires an immense effort by a veritable army of people. They, not the candidates, are the winners of the 2020 election.Trump is not done. Even if he doesn’t get his presumed entitlement of four more years, he has two more months to trash his frat house of a presidency before turning it over to the next administration. That means more executive orders like the recent ones thatopened upAlaska’s Tongass National Forest to logging andremoved workplace protectionsfrom federal civil servants. If Biden manages to take his place in the Oval Office, he’ll likely face a Republican-controlled Senate that will block his every move, just like Republicans adopted ano-compromise positionafter the election of Barack Obama.Certainly, Biden aims to reverse many of Trump’s executive orders with his own ones. That will work in the foreign policy realm, for instance recommitting the United States to the Paris climate accords. But any domestic orders will face court challenges, and suddenly the Republican Party’s strategy of pushing through an unprecedented number of federal judges takes on an even more ominous cast. Popular will be damned. The Republicans will rely on senators, lawyers and judges to institutionalize Trump’s legacy.Unlike 2008, the Democrats will be hard-pressed this time to claim an overwhelming popular mandate after such a close election. Trump voters, meanwhile, are not going away. They’ll continue showing up with guns. They’ll refuse to wear masks. They’ll spread fake news and outlandish conspiracy theories.They’ll also challenge the federal government — now led by an adversary, not an ally — at every turn. Remember the 2016 standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, when a bunch of right-wing extremists seized government property and faced off against law enforcement? Expect an uptick in outright confrontations between federalists and anti-federalists during Biden’s presidency.Let’s face it: The democracy that Donald Trump dropped on the floor suffered a great deal from the experience. It’s going to take more than an election to put it right.We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.Per MonthJoe Biden offers a reset to the Obama years — a bronze age at best, but one that at least...The international community is happy that the American people have taken down the world’s biggest bully.Authoritarianism has been on the march for years, but people-powered revolutions are pushing regimes toward democracy on nearly every continent.",1
269,The Lies Tearing America Apart,13.33,30.67,https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2021/01/13/the-lies-tearing-america-apart-n2583038,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-13,townhall,25,"Last week, the Capitol was breached by a group of fringe Trump supporters who had bought into a series of lies: the lie that President Donald Trump lost the election due to proven voter fraud and irregularity; the lie that the Electoral College results, legally certified state by state, could be overturned by Congress or the vice president; the lie that Trump would remain in office if only some sort of armed rebellion were to prevent the election certification by Congress. Those were lies. And those lies had deadly consequences.Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans don't believe those lies. Which means we should be able to unify around certain basic truths: that Joe Biden is legally president-elect of the United States; that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and those who participate in it should be punished to the full extent of the law; that broad claims regarding invasion of rights ought to be backed by compelling evidence.But we won't.That's because while the Democratic Party and the political left agree that Joe Biden is president-elect, they absolutely disagree with both the fundamental precept that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and the even more fundamental precept that claims require evidence. We saw that this summer when Democratic Party officials made light of riots spreading across the nation in the name of yet another lie -- the lie that America is systemically racist, rooted in slavery and Jim Crow, and replete with bigoted police dedicated to endangering black lives. Democrats demanded no evidence to support those claims; in knee-jerk fashion, they simply repeated ad nauseam untruths about the existential threat to black Americans in the United States. Which means that for the Democrats and the political left, violence is fine so long as it supports their narrative, and un-evidenced claims are fine so long as they support an agenda.In order to defend such violence, the political left has mobilized behind another convenient and advantageous lie: the lie that the Capitol riots represent all conservatives and Republicans. Paul Krugman of The New York Times suggested that the ""putsch was decades in the making,"" chalking up the rioting to ""Republican elites"" since before Ronald Reagan. The Washington Post amplified a nutty post from the chairman of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada into a referendum on a ""long-festering struggle within the Republican Party over conspiracy theories, purity tests and fealty to the rule of law."" Members of the media gleefully hunted for Republicans to blame for the Capitol riots, calling for the deplatforming of brand-name conservatives and cheering on social media crackdowns.Lies are dangerous. And double standards are perhaps the most dangerous form of lying: They grant the bravery of purity to those most willing to defy decency, prompting similar spasms of cruelty and malice from the other side. The solution to our national crisis of conscience isn't bad-faith political purges or repetition of tiresome falsehoods about the nature of the United States. It's truth.But truth is more a shield than a sword. And we are now in the age of swords, wielded aggressively by those with little principle but an unending sense of their own moral superiority.",1
270,"The Child Tax Credit Is a Proven Boost to American Families, So Why Are Conservative Democrats Trying to Stop It?",-24.0,28.67,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/the-child-tax-credit-is-a-proven-boost-to-american-families-so-why-are-conservative-democrats-trying-to-stop-it/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,counterpunch,25,"American families have struggled for decades to make ends meet withwages simply not risingas fast as the cost of living and a government social safety net that has been so deeply decimated that the U.S. nowspends less on childrenthan nearly any other wealthy nation.This year there was a small glimmer of hope that such a trend might be halted and even reversed. Democrats, using their razor-thin control of the Senate and marginal control of the House,passed an expanded child tax credit(CTC) in March 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan that not only increased the tax refund received by families with young children but also began sending thema monthly advanceinstead of making them wait until they filed their annual tax return.By any measure, the amounts are embarrassingly modest and only offer an increase of $1,000 to $1,600 over the entire year. Families whose incomes are low enough to qualify and have children aged 6 through 17 are now receiving $3,000 a year instead of $2,000, while those with children younger than 6 are getting checks that add up to $3,600 a year.Putting cash, however small an amount, into the hands of ordinary Americans is a win-win proposition for all but the most conservative pundits. As the 2020 CARES Act unemployment benefits—amounting to a $15 an hour wage—demonstrated, the economy as a whole is buoyed when people have more money in their pockets to spend on basic necessities. And, just as importantly, thebenefits helped the most vulnerable, particularly Black and Latino workers, to stave off financial ruin.Now, the monthly CTC payments are already showing similar promise.The Center on Poverty and Social Policyat Columbia University documented “a notable drop in child poverty” after just the first month of payments. Additionally, the benefits are particularly helpful for Black and Latino children, who the center estimates have twice the poverty rate of white children. Still, because the CTC relies on tax returns filed in the previous year, white children benefited more than children of color as their families were “more likely to have filed taxes.”TheU.S. Census Bureaualso found that after just one month of payments, food insecurity among vulnerable families dropped significantly, and families receiving checks also had less difficulty paying for weekly expenses. So convincing are the expanded CTC’s proven benefits that nearly 450 economists wrote anopen letter to Congressurging them to extend the program.The CTC payments benefit roughly39 million American familieswho are currently receiving monthly checks of up to $300 per child per month. Meanwhile, thecost of child carein the U.S. is exorbitant, averaging at about $1,300 per month for infants and nearly $900 per month for preschool-aged children. For families with multiple children and parents in low-wage jobs, child care is simply out of reach, and the modest CTC payments don’t even come close to covering the costs.At the same time,child care workers are so underpaidthat in the wake of the pandemic, more than 120,000 have simply quit their jobs nationwide. Even the U.S. government is so concerned that theTreasury Department issued a reportadmitting that “the existing child care system in the United States, which relies on private financing to provide care for most children… fails to adequately serve many families.”This is not a new problem. In a2014 speechat the White House Summit on Working Families, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that, “in 31 states, decent childcare costs more than in-state college tuition,” and that “there are other countries that know how to do childcare well.”Child care is such an important factor for families with young children that the latestHarris Poll surveyfound that 76 percent of working parents felt that child care decisions were a major factor in their employment decisions.The cost of raising a child is estimated to benearly a quarter of a million dollars—a sum that is wildly out of reach for low-income families. Combined with persistent wealth and income inequality, it is no wonder that, as per a recentCDC report, 2020 was “the sixth consecutive year that the number of births [in the U.S.] has declined.”One 2009 study concluded thatcheaper child careis the key to reversing falling birth rates. There are two simple ways to make child care cheaper: heavily subsidize the child care industry (the U.S. government, after all, subsidizesfossil fuel and agricultural industries), or put more money into the hands of parents with children.Currently, the expanded CTC benefits are valid only for a year, and some Democrats want to make them permanent. But President Joe Biden wants them extended for onlyfour yearsvia a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill called theBuild Back Better Act. And some conservative Democrats want to roll back the expanded benefit right away.Accountable.USidentifies nine House Democrats and two Senate Democrats opposing the extension of an expanded CTC. Of these 11 naysayers, eight are millionaires.In spite of its clear benefits, the CTC is in very real political danger of being rolled back.Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is one of its biggest proponents,said,“There’s nothing bigger than this… if you just want to look at the impact of a child’s life, this is the biggest thing that we’re doing.” Indeed, it’s hard to argue against helping vulnerable American children, but some Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) are managing to do so as they stand in the way of the current iteration of the CTC.Manchin in particular has adopted a posture far closer to the Republican way of thinking: that benefits aimed at wealthy interests are good for the nation, while benefits to vulnerable individuals are effectively “entitlements.” Using Republican-favoredbuzzwords, Manchin recently said that while he supports theCTC in theory, “anything that can be added should be means tested,” and that it is important that the U.S. not turn into an “entitlement society.” Onecritic explainedthat “‘Means testing’ is just a nicer way to say, ‘We want people to jump through more hoops, so fewer people can get help.’”The West Virginia senator exudes such hubris in opposing his own party that in aNew York Timesinterview earlier this year, he essentially dared Democrats to try to oust him, saying, “What are they going to do, [are] they going to go into West Virginia and campaign against me? Please, that would help me more than anything.” With friends like Manchin, Republicans can sit out the discussion and haveno clear policy positionon the matter.With many progressive Democrats going on the defensive to protect the expansion of the CTC, some are going on the offensive in trying to get money into the hands of low-income and middle-income Americans by other means. Minnesota Democratic RepresentativeIlhan Omarin July introduced a guaranteed income bill that would ensure individuals making up to $75,000 a year receive $1,200 monthly checks. The SUPPORT Act, backed by progressive stalwarts such as Cori Bush (D-MO) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), includes running a pilot program initially to prove that monthly payments would have a positive impact on families.Such approaches embody the opposite of thetrickle-down economic modellong championed by many establishment economists in the face ofprogressive opposition. Now, the trickle-down model is so discredited that even Biden hasexplicitly rejected it. Rather than infusing the top tiers of society with money, tax breaks and subsidies, based on a fantasy that those riches will eventually reach the bottom tiers, policymakers are getting on board with direct benefits to vulnerable Americans. Whether or not the CTC survives Washington’s political wrangling remains to be seen, even as tens of millions of Americans rely on it.Use code 30years for 30% off all Merchandise!Dismiss",0
271,Biden's First 100 Days Have Been a Tale of Two Presidencies,-22.67,37.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/biden-first-100-days-progressive-speech-congress-infrastructure-economy-war,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-04-29,inthesetimes,25,"As President Biden reaches the100-day mark of his first term, we can discern two prominent features of the new administration.The first is that, when it comes to non-defense spending in the federal budget and non-defense related appointments, progressives have been pleasantly surprised. Biden’s Covid relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, includedgrowthin a slew of social programs, from expanded unemployment insurance to a beefed-up child tax credit, direct temporary payments, and assistance for food and housing. The people advising Biden in the White House include Cecilia Rouse, Bharat Ramamurti, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, who have demonstrated support for a progressive economic direction.And, the administration has been subject to pressure from Democrats in the Senate on a variety of matters relating to foreign policy. Examples include pleas for relaxation of intellectual property rights that are hampering India’s ability to cope with an explosion of Covid-19cases, and calls to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia’s slaughter of Yemenis. That is not to say Biden has yet to move much beyond the Obama administration, only that the pressure from Democrats is now coming from the left, not just the center.Before Biden took office, these developments might have seemed less plausible in light of the narrowness of the Democrats’ majorities in both the House and the Senate, but that narrowness has proven to come with some offsetting influences.Holding a razor thin majority in the Senate has promoted unity and discipline in the Democrats’ caucuses, which tend to afford centrist Democrats less leeway to perform their traditional rites of conservative independence. The fact that Republicans retain strong institutional support from the Supreme Court, Trump’s federal judges, the Electoral College and gerrymandered state legislatures has made the political stakes clear, illustrating that Democrats cannot afford to lose another election. This has helped motivate Biden’s party to undertake action that under other circumstances might have been written off as too bold or moving too fast.Yet despite their structural advantages, it’s also the case that Republicans have weakened their position in two ways. By indulging the riotous (and deeply discrediting) demonstration at the U.S. Capitol on January6, as well as the patently absurd noises coming out of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and their co-thinkers, the GOP has proven itself a partymore interestedin extremism than governing. The other self-inflicted wound is that, by indicating no interest at all in any sort of bipartisan deals on legislation, Republicans have just encouraged Democrats to go their own way. Why pretend to seek compromise with those who a) condone lunacy, or b) betray no interest in compromise?The upshot for progressives in all this has been a lot of good stuff in the non-defense component of Biden’s federal budget, including the embrace of achildren’s allowance, and all manner of other initiatives in the name of pandemic relief and economic stimulus, with hardly a whisper about the formerly feared specter of the national debt. Biden’s proposed budgetincludesincreases for education, social services, science and the environment. And his infrastructure proposals, theAmerican Jobs PlanandAmerican Families Plan, contain a host of progressive priorities, from investments in affordable housing to paid family leave.These shifts to the left haven’t been borne solely out of a personal transformation by Biden. Rather, tireless organizing by progressive groups outside the halls of power has helpedpull the administrationtoward bolder action, especially on issues around climate. And a leftward tilt within the Democratic caucus on economics, led by progressives such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, has helped spur the administration’s openness to big spending packages.The expansion of deficit spending tends to give rise to tight labor markets, which is the source of upward pressure on wages.I’ve argued beforethat this is the most important issue in public policy. What does a tight labor market look like?It looks like employers complaining about an inability to attract job applicants.It looks like bosses offering people bonuses just to show up for job interviews.Both of these dynamics are now coming into play. Workers of course need other help too, especially in the realm of union organizing rights as would be provided by thePRO Act, but this is still a very good development.The openness to deficit spending reflects an important turn in thinking about economic policy. For those interested in the underlying, arcane theoretical issues involved, John Jay College Associate Professor of Economics Josh Mason wrote awell-regarded review of the subject. In a nutshell, the new turn in policy reflects a de-emphasis on​“supply-side” factors such as labor force participation and savings, towards more attention to the​“demand side,” which simply means spending by households, governments and business firms. When the economy is below full employment — and it is still way below it — more spending begets still more spending, along with employment.My qualification to the enthusiasm on the Left is that there has yet to be a parallel revolution in economic theory. As John Maynard Keynes said in his landmark​“General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,” economic theory from obscure scribblers eventually ends up in the mouths of those with actual responsibilities for policymaking — so it matters.For all the welcome empirical research by economists on the minimum wage, non-competitive labor market conditions, unionization and the absence of a link between deficit spending and inflation, there is no parallel rise of a theoretical leadership. The’ columnist Paul Krugman, scourge of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns, ain’t it. He is often on progressives’ side, but is usually bringing up the rear. The so-called Modern Monetary Theory is successful as an academic school of thought, but its tribunes have yet to be welcomed into the new administration. The vacuum in theoretical leadership means that in the future, we could again be plagued with the same bad arguments about the perils of deficits.On foreign policy, the pickings for progressives are slimmer. In a recent interview, thinker Noam Chomsky, who has a strong reputation for being right about basically everything, described the current posture of the Biden administration as​“dangerous.”Two of the most important issues now facing the country are: re-entering the nuclear deal with Iran to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, and waging a full-court press on behalf of India and under-developed countries as they struggle with the still raging pandemic.While Biden has promised to reinstate the agreement with Iran, the administration appears to be slow walking the process, evidently for the sake of gaining some advantage. The case for pressuring Iran on​“weapons of mass destruction” — shades of the Iraqi campaigns of the1990s carried out by another Democratic president — was always fallacious. The concern was never really over any threats to use such weapons against the United States, which would lead to Iran’s annihilation — something the Iranian government could not fail to understand. Rather, it has been about curbing Iran’s political sway in the region, for the sake of Israel and other U.S. allies.The situation in India, with the virus rapidly spreading and deaths skyrocketing, might be likened to a potential holocaust. Some might blanch at that expression, but whenpotentially tens of millions of lives are at riskdue to policy misfeasance (Trump), malfeasance (the Modi regime), and nonfeasance (Biden), I fail to see how the language could be too strong.Former President Trump’s protectionist instincts led him to embrace policies thathampered exports of vaccinesto countries such as India.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, meanwhile, hasheld mass ralliesshirking the need for social distancing, and his government has forced Twitterto censor criticism of his policies.Biden has been susceptible to Trump’s vaccine hoarding impulses as well, though he has lately shown some flexibility, allowing the shipment of certain Covid-19treatments and materials to India. There is still much more to do in the matter of intellectual property restrictions that constrain vaccine production and distribution outside of the United States.In our own hemisphere, the Biden administration has shown a stubborn insistence on supporting an unelected leader of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, over the democratically elected President Nicolas Maduro. Biden’s moves so far also show little sign of a thaw in relations with Cuba, displaying some retreat from the Obama administration.Still, there are some glimmers of hope. Some action has been taken to curb Saudi Arabia’s bombardment of Yemen, though the administration could go further to stop the war. Biden announced a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan (albeit by September). And there is the shift mentioned above in commitment to come to the aid of India, with Biden promising to deploy additional supplies to the country including therapeutics, test kits and ventilators.When it comes to Biden’s defense budget proposal, the fact that it includes an increase means it’s a step in thewrong direction. However, an increase of1.6% (as Biden proposes) is what advocates of non-defense spending describe as​“flat funding,” i.e. given expectations of modest inflation, it amounts to little or no real increase. What’s really at issue is not a misguided increase — it’s a failure to cut the defense budget.Then there’s the issue of immigration, where Biden hasdisappointedmany progressives by failing to rescind all Trump-era restrictions, and not opening the border to more migrants, while also keeping the current broken system in place. We should expect more pressure on the administration to ramp up from activists in the coming months.In general, our narrow escape from the threat of a neo-fascist consolidation of power has, so far, brought greater returns than expected. It could hardly be otherwise. Democratic leaders would have to be fools to fail to realize that if they don’t deliver the goods, their party could be consigned to permanent minority status. Similar collapses at the state level would follow, and the United States would be a very different place.For now though, we have some space to breathe, even as more fights loom.

He had good reason to tell the truth. His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said one lie, and it is go to jail. Still, the FBI had another take on the man. It appears that the agency may not have had Trump in its sights first.Almost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen’s home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man was spying for a foreign government. The court has just released hundreds of pages of documents, including the numerous heavily redacted search warrants and related materials that led up to that raid.The agents had been interested in Cohen’s business interests far earlier than indicated, since July 2017. That was what led to the Manhattan raids, not Trump’s activities. The FBI obtained Cohen’s Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid.Before a raid can occur, the FBI must give the judge enough proof of specific crimes to convince him or her to sign the warrant.The FBI covered itself by submitting eight different application, affidavits, and search warrants amounting to reams of related pages. The agency must also list the suspected crimes, and they did, according theCourthouse News Service:‘…the FBI had probable cause to justify the raid on the grounds of suspected bank fraud, money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.’The FBI walked away with over four million electronic and paper files in their raid on Cohen, the Courthouse News Service reported:‘The FBI’s raid on Cohen’s home, hotel and office yielded more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.’Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis released a statement the night prior to the search warrants being served on his client. He wrote:‘Only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.’The released documents revealed that the FBI was especially interested in Cohen’s links to the Ukrianian-born Russian oligarch linked to President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Vekselberg.Cohen was not the only link to Ukrainian oligarchs. Davis was the co-counsel to this one, Dmytro Firtash. It appears that Trump’s television attorney Rudy Giuliani had also been recently tied to the Russian mobster, Semion Mogilevich. The stew just keeps getting thicker and thicker, spicier and spicier.Davis claimed that Firtash was an “innocent man.” However, the Obama administration indicted him for playing a part in “an international titanium scheme,” the Courthouse News reported.Cohen had set up a shell company named Essential Consultants LLC. He had also set up a bank account with a First Republic bank in conjunction with the shell company just one month prior to the 2016 presidential election. Earlier, Cohen said the company was involved in real estate. He lied.A FBI agent wrote this about Cohen:‘Specifically, the account was not intended to receive – and does not appear to have received – money in connection to real estate consulting work; in addition, the account has received substantial payments from foreign sources.’and other media encouraged U.S. District Judge William Pauley III to release these documents with an open-records request in October. This was months prior to the judge sentencing the president’s private attorney to three years in prison for a  “veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Then last month, Pauley wrote:‘These applications implicate the familiar tension between public access to judicial records and the integrity of law enforcement investigations —interests arguably magnified by the intense scrutiny of Cohen’s criminal case by the media, the general public, and even the president of the United States.’attorney David McCraw wrote:‘Simply put, the public interest in knowing the underlying bases for the investigation could not be higher.’Judge Pauley let the government to release redacted documents, because there are ongoing investigations. Cohen has said that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump.No related posts.",0

It’s a first step in Mr. Christianson’s push to become more weather-resilient.“I don’t know about climate change,” Mr. Christianson says. “But I think the weather is going to be more extreme going forward.”The severe flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields, bridges, and roads. But the extreme weather is also starting to sway residents’ thinking about climate.It’s a sentiment that is percolating here in rural Nebraska. With the state still in recovery mode, many Nebraskans say it’s early for them to start contemplating the long-term implications of last month’s epic flood, the most widespread in memory. But as such extreme weather events pile up, some say they are beginning to change hearts and minds here – not politically but practically.“This [flood] didn’t come out of nowhere but it went beyond almost anyone’s expectations,” says Tyler Williams, an educator with the extension service at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which works with farmers. “So I definitely think people in the agricultural world are thinking: ‘All right. I’ve got to fix something, do something different.’”Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers themselves, especially those involved with the small but growing regenerative farming movement.“Conversations were already happening before the flood,” says Graham Christensen, a fifth-generation farmer and president of GC Resolve, a grassroots community-development business. “But after the flood a lot more folks are like, ‘Yeah, I have never seen that; my dad has never seen that; my grandpa has never seen that. This is a pattern that’s emerging.’”The movement, which focuses on the health of soil, emphasizes techniques like planting cover crops as a way to keep more roots in the soil, beyond the corn and soybean plants that many farmers raise in rotation. These roots keep more nutrients in the soil, make it easier for water to drain (which improves flood resilience), and keep more water stored in the soil (which improves drought-resistance). That’s key for farmers like Mr. Christianson here in Fremont.Just don’t call it climate change.“We are not necessarily going around and saying, ‘Hey, climate change, climate change, climate change!” says Mr. Christensen of GC Resolve, who travels the state preaching regenerative agriculture. “We’re more focused on rallying around the solution, which is better soil-health principles.”The term climate change has become so politicized that it’s not readily accepted in rural America, even with the extreme weather. Most pastors in the state are afraid of addressing the issue for fear of splitting their congregations, according to a 2015 University of Nebraska-Lincoln report.A couple comes out of a Lynch, Nebraska, donation center with six gallon jugs of emergency water because the floods have intermittently made their water unsafe. Does the extreme weather imply climate change? “No,” she answers. “No,” he answers, then gives a short lecture on avoiding preconceived ideas.Skeptics have a point. Last month’s flooding was the result of such a fluky combination of snow, rain, frozen ground, and rapid melt that even warming advocates admit that it alone may not be a harbinger of change to come. But previous events – flooding of the Missouri River in 2011, an increasing number of intense rain events, and one of the 10 coldest Februaries on record – have residents reassessing the future.“It’s getting to the point where it’s hard to ignore,” says Kim Morrow, a behavior change expert at Verdis Group, a sustainability and climate resiliency advisory group based in Omaha.When Yale University social scientists assessedpublic opinion about climate changelast year, they found that 64% of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening. That was up 6 points fromtheir 2014 survey– a rise consistent with the slow change in a swath of red states from Idaho to Kentucky – but still 6 points behind the national average.The Yale research also reveals an urban-rural split. In Lancaster County, home of Lincoln and the university, 72% of people said change was happening. In rural counties farther west, barely half do.“Yes, I think it’s still political and divided, but people are beginning to change,” says the Rev. Richard Randolph, senior pastor at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. He has submitted to this year’s Nebraska-Kansas annual conference of the United Methodist Church a petition calling on churches to become better informed about global warming and to set goals for reducing their carbon footprints. “For the most part, I pastor a church that’s moderate to progressive theologically. Andy Alexander, director of the Collaborative Ministry Office at Creighton, a Catholic university in Omaha, is not seeing much of a shift at all. “People are skeptical about that kind of thinking, which they call projection,” he says. Even if they acknowledge they need to be more prepared for chancier weather in the future, they’re not making a link between their present practices and warming.“I don’t hear people saying our use of fossil fuels is leading to this problem,” he says. And they’re not making the broader connections Pope Francis has made between warming’s impact on the poor and the selfishness and greed that keeps nations from reducing that impact by changing their ways, he adds. “I don’t hear anybody saying that.”",2

He also worked as an attorney in.He'll need to work on rebuilding faith in the department after President Trump, some critics say, turned it into a passive recipient of his most controversial policies.If confirmed, the former presidential nomination candidate would be the first openly gay person approved by the Senate to a cabinet position.At 38, Mr Buttigieg was one of the youngest in the large group of Democratic wannabes who sought the chance to run for the White House in the early primaries.He had undergone a meteoric rise having only been the mayor of a small Indiana city before his presidential run.But the success he scored in some of the first contests to choose a contender to Mr Trump in January marked him out as unexpectedly popular.Likely to be working extensively with Mr Buttigieg and John Kerry will be Ms Granholm, who if confirmed will have the task of moving the country towards achieving the requirements of the Paris Accord, which Mr Biden has said he will rejoin as soon as he is inaugurated.The 61-year-old was Michigan's first female governor between 2003 and 2010 and was a strong supporter of Mr Biden's presidential bid, having worked with him in 2009 during the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler.Democratic governor of Rhode Island and a lawyer with a background in venture capital.Ms Raimondo has launched successful workforce training programs in her state.Ms Fudge has served in the House of Representatives since 2008, for Ohio's 11th congressional districtIf confirmed, she would be the second black woman to lead the department.Mr Walsh was elected mayor of Boston in 2013.He has backed both a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave and said he wants to expand union membership.After working as a federal appeals court judge since 1997, Mr Garland was nominated by Barack Obama to be a US Supreme Court judge in 2016.His nomination was blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Mr Cardona is currently the education commissioner for Connecticut.As a former teacher, his appointment would fulfil Mr Biden's pledge to choose a professional educator to lead the education department.Mr Vilsack led the US Department of Agriculture under Barack Obama, for both terms of his presidency.He was also Iowa's governor from 1999 until 2007.Mr Burns spent more than three decades as a US diplomat honing his specialities in Russia and the Middle East, including a period as ambassador to Russia.Under President Obama, he was deputy secretary of state.Mr McDonough was the White House chief of staff throughout the whole of Barack Obama's second term and also served as the president's deputy national security adviser.While he has a long history of working in national security roles, he would be the second non-veteran to head up the department.The US ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama has been chosen to run the agency overseeing American foreign humanitarian and development aid.If confirmed by the Senate, UK-born Ms Power will head a US agency which has an annual budget of about $20 billion.Mr Biden called the 50-year-old, who was born to Irish parents and grew up in Ireland before becoming a US citizen in 1993, ""a world-renowned voice of conscience and moral clarity.""The graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School worked as a journalist during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and served as UN ambassador from 2013 to 2017.The former assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency will run Mr Biden's ambitious climate plans across federal government.She had previously worked for the Obama administration in the Office of Air and Radiation, and brought into action a plan to set national standards to reduce power plant carbon emissions.The plan was later discarded by Donald Trump.Mr Biden's nominee to become the next US ambassador to the United Nations served as Barack Obama's top diplomat on Africa from 2013 to 2017.In the role, she led US policy in Africa south of the Sahara during the West African Ebola outbreak, during which thousands of people died but many lives were saved by international intervention.She will take on a job that Mr Biden plans to restore to a cabinet level. The first black woman to occupy the role was Susan Rice, under Mr Obama.She'd be the first woman appointed to this position.Ms Haines served as deputy director of the CIA in the Obama administration before succeeding Tony Blinken as Mr Obama's deputy national security adviser.She, too, is a former aide to Mr Biden.Deb Haaland, a Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico since 2019, would be the first Native American Cabinet secretary.The member of the Pueblo of Laguna, would also be the Native American first to oversee the department, whose jurisdiction includes tribal lands.Kate Bedingfield, who Mr Biden has chosen as White House communications director, was his campaign spokeswoman.She will be part of a team that includes veteran Democratic spokeswoman Jen Psaki as press secretary.The economist at Princeton University has been nominated as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.She would be the first black woman to lead the council, which advises the president on economic policy.She was a member of the council under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011.Mr Biden has proposed the current chief executive of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank as head of the Office of Management and Budget.As a daughter of Indian immigrants, she would be the first Asian heritage woman to run the OMB.She is expected to face a tough confirmation hearing process when it reaches the Senate.",2
277,"In still-unsettled Fourth District race, Jesse Mermell leaves door open to a recount request",1.67,48.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/03/metro/with-votes-still-being-counted-mermell-leaves-door-open-recount-request-fourth-district/?p1=HP_Feed_ContentQuery,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,bostonglobe,25,"FRANKLIN — Trailing in a preliminary vote count, Jesse Mermell on Thursday did not rule out seeking a recount should she fall short to Jake Auchincloss as the Fourth Congressional District’s contentious Democratic primary stretched through another day.Mermell, a former Brookline selectwoman, also raised doubts about the vote count itself, charging that there may be uncounted ballots beyond those that were tallied in three municipalities on Thursday under a court order.She repeatedly declined early Thursday afternoon to specify in which towns or cities she believes there may be additional ballots left from Tuesday’s nine-way primary to succeed Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III. But she called the possibility of votes falling through the cracks “deeply concerning.”AdvertisementIn a twist, the number of still-uncounted votes later grew. Secretary of State William F. Galvin dispatched members of his office to Franklin, where officials said there were 3,000 ballots that had to be counted — far more than the approximately 600 the town’s clerk had initially estimated.State and local officials were huddled in a Franklin school gymnasium into Thursday night, combing through remaining ballots while Auchincloss held a roughly 1,400-vote lead, according to preliminary results.“We’re focused on making sure every vote is counted, and discussion of anything beyond that would be incredibly premature,” Mermell said earlier Thursday outside Newton City Hall, where she donned a mask with the phrase “Vote” repeated 12 times on it.“No one wants a recount, particularly in the middle of a pandemic when we all want to be focused on the important task of getting rid of Donald Trump in November,” she said. “But as we know all too well, it matters who’s representing us.”A website,massrecount.org, was live as of Thursday afternoon, offering a way to sign a district-wide recount petition for the Fourth District primary. At the bottom of the site it said: “Paid for by the Committee to Elect Jesse Mermell.”AdvertisementAsked about the website, Mermell spokesman David Guarino acknowledged soliciting signatures, describing it as a move “out of an abundance of caution,” given the tight deadline to file a petition by Friday. He said no decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon “on requesting further counting.”Mermell, however, had to first close enough of the gap to legally be able to force a district-wide recount, which requires the margin to be within 0.5 percent. A spokeswoman in Galvin’s office said it also does not have the legal authority to accept electronic signatures for recount petitions.Anunofficialtally updated Thursday by the Associated Press showed Auchincloss, a moderate Newton city councilor and Marine veteran, with 33,433 votes, putting him 1,377 ahead of Mermell, a progressive Brookline Democrat. Only Franklin had yet to publicly report its results by Thursday evening, when Auchincloss had a 1-point lead.The new totals reflected 129 votes Mermell netted after Newton and Wellesley updated their own preliminary results Thursday. A judge hadapproved a petitionfrom Galvin to allow officials in those two communities and Franklin to continue tallying what was initially estimated to be 1,450 uncounted votes from Tuesday’s primary.In Wellesley, where officials tallied roughly 100 uncounted ballots, Mermell netted five votes, picking up 18 votes to Auchincloss’s 13.In Newton, she netted 61 more, earning 222 additional votes and Auchincloss getting 161 more out of roughly 750 officials counted there. Newton’s city clerk said it also had 500 additional ballots that had been counted earlier, and were being added to its preliminary count.AdvertisementIt’s in Franklin, however, where the calculus changed. The town clerk’s office initially told Galvin it had 600 ballots left to count, but state officials, fearing the estimate was “inconsistent” with the number of mail-in ballots residents had requested, arrived to perform an inventory. Officials ultimately identified more ballots across the town’s eight precincts, totaling roughly 3,000, said Debra O’Malley, a spokeswoman for Galvin’s office.Auchincloss had won each of the municipalities that border Franklin, and he was expected to perform well in the Norfolk County town,leaving it unclear how the extra ballots would reshape the margin between the two candidates.“As the final votes are being counted, we as candidates must be conscientious in allowing Secretary Galvin to take the lead and ensure that the will of the voters is heard in the 4th Congressional District,” Auchincloss said in a statement Thursday night.Given the primary’s heavily divided nine-way field, Mermell Thursday eveningfaced a steep climb to not only close the gap with Auchincloss, but to gain enough votes to potentially force a recount across the district’s 34 cities and towns.Under state law, a campaign can file a petition by Friday, with at least 500 signatures, for a district-wide recount, but only if the margin between first and second place is within 0.5 percent.AdvertisementIf the margin is larger, a campaign can also ask for more narrow recounts at the precinct or city ward levels, needing to file only 10 signatures with each request.“We are focused on getting every vote counted today,” she said.During the primary, Auchincloss was often on the defensive against his more progressive rivals, who sought to frame him as ill-suited for the solid-blue district after he was previously enrolled as a Republican and worked for the state GOP and Governor Charlie Baker’s 2014 campaign. (Auchincloss later re-enrolled as a Democrat after winning his Newton City Council seat in 2015.)Mermell was, by far, Auchincloss’s most relentless critic, saying last month that the Newton Democrat was “someone who has been indefensibly out of step with this district time after time,” citing controversialpast comments and social media posts.She often used Auchincloss as a foil, framing the primary as a two-way race and him as someone who “does not represent our values.” On Thursday, she declined to say if she would support Auchincloss, should he be the nominee.Auchincloss’s backing of Baker, an abortion-rights-supporting, socially liberal Republican, did not appear to be a check against him in the more moderate Bristol County communities that anchor the district’s southern end, said state Representative Patricia A. Haddad, a Somerset Democrat and Auchincloss supporter.Preliminary results showed Auchincloss winning Fall River and all of its immediate neighbors. When Baker won reelection in 2018 by 33 points, he got 71 percent of the vote in Bristol County, a 42-point margin over his Democratic opponent.Advertisement“People don’t go to the extremes” in this region, said Haddad, the Massachusetts House’s third-ranking Democrat.“I very much reflect my district, which is progressive at times and conservative at times,” she said. “I just really thought [Auchincloss] was a good fit, for the whole district.”Mermell carried the district’s wealthy northern suburbs, winning Brookline, Wellesley, Dover, Needham and Newton, preliminary results show.She was bolstered by endorsements from some of the state’s highest-profile Democrats, including US Representative Ayanna Pressley and state Attorney General Maura Healey, and the consolidation of support from onetime candidates Dave Cavell of Brookline and Christopher Zannetos of Wellesley, who suspended their campaigns in August.But she struggled to carve out enough support as the district stretched farther south. In Attleboro, Fall River, and Taunton — three of the district’s largest communities outside the Boston suburbs — Mermell finished fourth, fifth, and sixth, respectively, unofficial results show.Newton City Councilor Becky Walker Grossman placed third in the primary, with more than 26,000 votes, and Natalia Linos, a Brookline epidemiologist who entered the race only in May, finished fourth, preliminary results indicated.Ihssane Leckey, a former Wall Street regulator from Brookline, and Alan Khazei, a cofounder of City Year and a Brookline resident, followed. Zannetos, Brookline attorney Ben Sigel, and Cavell rounded out the voting.Julie Hall of Attleboro beat David Rosa in the district’s Republican primary, according to unofficial results. Whichever Democrat emerges will be heavily favored on Nov. 3 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by 24 points in the 2016 presidential election and Barack Obama by 16 points four years earlier.Hall, an Air Force veteran and a former Attleboro city councilor, said in a statement Thursday that “whoever wins the Democratic Primary will arrogantly assume this seat is already won.”“They will ignore the majority of voters who know that the free market is the only place that will help our economy recover from the COVID-19 shutdown, make health care affordable, and our economy greener,” Hall said.Matt Stout can be reached atmatt.stout@globe.com.

""This is not Saigon,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arguedon CNNSunday morning, rejecting comparisons to the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 two years after U.S. troops were pulled out. But even as he spoke, helicopters were rushing toevacuatepersonnel from the U.S. embassy in Kabul.'Forever war' in Afghanistan resulted in fewer terror attacksAnd behind the broad news of bedlam were voices of thousands reduced to living in abject fear with the Taliban's arrival; many, if not most, of them women who face a crushing and uncertain future of subjugation under a famously mysogynistic regime.""Keep us in your prayers,"" a terrified woman hiding in Kabul texted her sister, an Afghan-American living in the United States, as terrorists raged through the capital. That was her last message.A brief history of Biden's Afghanistan decision-making since taking office makes one thing abundantly clear – the disaster that unfolded Sunday didn't have to happen.After 20 years of war, there was palpable frustration by most Americans with the failure of three successive presidents to achieve anything other than a stalemate in Afghanistan. George Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 drew valuable military resources away from the Afghan fight.One outside chance for peace, however, was apledgeby Taliban leaders last year to open negotiations with the Kabul government. President Donald Trump used this as an excuse to pull all but a few thousand troops out of Afghanistan.This July Fourth, America will leave Afghanistan independence in its death throesBiden could have conditioned any further drawdown on good faith efforts by the Taliban to reach a peaceful settlement with Kabul. But over theobjectionsof military leaders who warned that the Afghan government would collapse without U.S. security assistance, Biden decided in April toendmilitary involvement by September.He promised troop withdrawal wouldn't be hasty. But, in fact, most were gone by early July. (The largest U.S. airbase was abandoned so suddenly that Afghan troops couldn't evenfigure outhow to turn the electricity back on.)It was a choice with disastrous consequences. Any incentive for the Taliban to negotiate peace was gone. A security umbrella of U.S. air cover that had staved off battlefield defeats for Afghan troops evaporated. (A small Afghan air force with pilots overworked and targeted for assassination has not been up to the task.) And crucially, the morale disintegrated among frontline Afghan troops already poorly fed, denied pay and deprived of bullets and fuel. Hundredssurrenderedwithout firing a shot.Biden needs to learn the lesson of Operation Linebacker""Brother, if no one else fights, why should I fight?"" one Afghan soldier said, according to a Washington Postreport.A Taliban offensive that began with vacuuming up countless district centers manned by small numbers of security personnel in July accelerated inAugustto the capture of all major cities north, south and west until insurgents reached the gates of Kabul.Shortly before those fighters reached the city, Biden had ordered5,000U.S. troops into Kabul to assist evacuating U.S. personnel, and it was unclear Sunday just exactly what was developing on the ground there.But here is where there is no ambiguity:► Since the Taliban offensive, a growing humanitarian crisis has unfolded with250,000people fleeing their homes, all in the midst of a pandemic.

279,The world’s happiest people have a beautifully simple way to tackle loneliness,-1.25,36.25,https://qz.com/1591563/the-danish-have-designed-a-simple-way-to-cope-with-loneliness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,qz,25,"Toad, a 20-year-old Danish woman living in Copenhagen, has been lonely her whole life. She is autistic, and as a child, did not have any friends. When she moved from the country to the city, not much changed. “They says it’s a phase, but a phase becomes a life,” she says, surrounded by six other young adults in a cozy apartment in Copenhagen—all of whom are working on becoming less lonely.Toad is among the attendees ofVentilen, or “friend to one” in Danish, a 20-year-old organization set up to bring 15-to-25-year-olds together twice a week with two or three volunteers. Together, the people in the group play games, make meals, go to the cinema, and build the human connections that many feel they lack.“I try to fight my depression by being less lonely, not with medicine,” Toad says.Christian, who is 23, says he too suffered in high school. Though he had two friends with whom he spoke regularly, he rarely saw them in person. He tried anti-anxiety medicine, but coming off it was hard. Then his aunt found Ventilen on Facebook and recommended he try it. “It’s helped me to open up,” he says. “I don’t feel lonely the same way.”Ventilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another. There are 15 gathering places for people aged 15-25, and six KOMsammen, or “Fit for Friendship” places, which focus on food and movement for those aged 15-30. The essential services its venues offer are straightforward, and yet can be so elusive: a place to go, things to do, and people to do them with.While Ventilen has been around for decades, its simple yet novel approach is getting more attention asgovernments everywherewake up to the prevalence, and cost, of loneliness. A recent Kaiser Family Foundationstudy showedthat 22% of Americans, 23% of Brits and 9% of Japanese adults said they felt lonely all the time. When theBBC asked 55,000people about their experiences with loneliness,33% of respondentssaid they were “often” or “very often” lonely. Among those aged 16-24, the figure was a shocking 40%.Vivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, has declared loneliness an “epidemic,”noting thatit was dangerous both in its own right and because of its links to deep societal problems such as addiction and violence: “It’s prevalent, it’s common, and the studies Julianne [Holt-Lunstad] and others have done have shown arobust association with illnessesthat we actually care about, including heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety, and very importantly, longevity.”Indeed, Holt-Lunstad’s researchshows that being disconnected poses comparable danger to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and is more predictive of early death than the effects of air pollution or physical inactivity.According to Julie Vorsaa, volunteer coordinator for Ventilen, the idea for the organization can be traced back to 1999, when two volunteers (whose names no one remembers) were working for a help line. They noticed a lot of people weren’t as much in need of help as they were in need of friends. They were lonely, and the help line could only be a band-aid, not a cure. They formed a support group called Bright Point, aimed at facilitating IRL conversation. But when people came together, no one talked. The idea seemed destined to fail.Then someone had the idea of introducing games. “They had a catalyst, and they started to talk over the game,” she says. Later, the group added the idea of making meals, and then exercising. “They found out food was a good thing to bring people together,” she says. “You talk when you eat. It’s more cozy.”Since 2011, Ventilen, which gets funding from the government and private donors, has been measuring its results. Through 2017, nearly 700 people had participated in Ventilen (55.7% men, 44.3% women), with the average age being 20.9. According to its self-reported survey, 70% of participants said they felt less lonely after coming, while 74% reported higher self-worth after coming. Sixty-four percent said they were better at social situations, and 80% said they were more likely to meet other people.About one in 10 young people in Denmark reportthat they are lonely.While this may seem surprising in a country that isfrequently ratedone of the happiest in the world, it mirrors data from around the world showing a spike in loneliness among the young as well as the old.While some arguethere is no new crisis of loneliness, Murthy says a few things are contributing to raised awareness of the problem. More people are talking about it, creating a snowball effect, while research is showing its ill effects on health and well-being. “It’s not new—people have been lonely for hundreds of years,” he says. “But I think the fact that it is an almost universal experience makes it easier for people to be open to thinking about it, even if they don’t want to talk about it.”The program is not without challenges. Many lonely people may be too intimidated to come to a venue; some who come won’t return. But designating a space for gathering and having activities to bring people together is an effective way to tackle loneliness, says Claire O’Shea, a campaign manager for the UK’s Campaign to end Loneliness. “You can’t just bring a roomful people together, you have to find a common purpose,” she says. “It takes the pressure off finding something to say, and that’s talking about the moment, or the activity.” She citesMen’s Sheds, an organization that promotes community spaces for men to “connect, converse and create.” They gather in areas—empty offices, portable cabin’s, warehouses, garages, and in one case, an out-of-use mortuary—to do things like woodworking, metalworking, and repairing and restoring things. They’re also there to be together.Because as anyone knows, you can be in a room filled with people or a city and be plenty lonely.When I first ask to go to a Ventilen in Copenhagen, Vorsaa tells me it will not be possible. Privacy is paramount, and the individuals themselves do not even register their names. (They give their gender, age, and whether they are employed and/or in school.) “It is a safe space,” she explains. It can be very hard to realize you are lonely, and even harder to admit it because of the social stigma. More people will come if they do not have to give personal information.But when we meet in the Ventilen offices, a volunteer reports that a group is happy to speak with me. We bike over to Nørrebro, one of Copenhagen’s most diverse neighborhoods, to a comfortable apartment with a small kitchen and eating area, as well as a sitting room with a coffee table. The group has already shopped for lunch and cooked it together before sitting down for games.Some are clearly shy, but open up gradually to paint painful portraits of what it’s like to feel very alone. Tuned in to a hyperconnected world via social media and gaming, they report wanting the friends and connections they see but feeling that such relationships are out of reach, for reasons varying from chronic pain to video game addiction, social anxiety, and a pervasive sense that they simply do not have the muscles to form social bonds.Simone, 20, says she has been depressed since she was 10. “I am used to it,” she says. “That’s the worst part.” When her two best friends moved away,  she explains while crying, she reverted to a life of only working and sleeping. She developed chronic pain because she did not move enough. “I didn’t want to leave my home because I didn’t need to, and everyone was very busy.”A nurse at a pain clinic told her about Ventilen and she decided to try it. It’s been positive for her, she says, in part because being more active means she’s not in as much pain. She still takes anti-depressants, and still has severe social anxiety, she says. “My heart is racing just talking to you.” But she enjoys coming. “It’s a reason not to go home and go to bed.”The group is not designed to address addiction or severe mental illness, and screens participants accordingly. “We see a lot of people with mental illness and it’s fine,” says Vorsaa.  “But if the mental illness overshadows the group, if it’s too big, it’s not the place.”New participants come half an hour before their first group session to meet with a volunteer who makes sure the person is a good fit for the group. They pay for their own meals, since being part of a group means paying your own way.Kasper, who wears glasses and is slight, has suffered with depression and anxiety. High school was very isolating, he says, and he took a break afterward. But he found he lacked the skills he needed to help himself. “In my life I had chosen to be so isolated so I didn’t know how to communicate.”He spent a lot of time online, which he says made everything worse. “I think it gets worse with the internet,” he says. “We always look at the perfect picture on the internet.” Being part of a group through Ventilen has helped. “I’ve made some good friendships,” he says thoughtfully. “It’s been good for me.”In addition to the groups, Ventilen is now working in 43 schools to train high-school teachers about how to be more supportive of students. “Young people hate going to school,” says Vorsaa. Many feel constantly left out, particularly since so much high-school work is done in groups. Students voice anxiety about being the last to be picked, or feeling that others are being forced to work with them.They feel “it’s a game of musical chairs and they will lose every time,” she explains.Having a place to go and people to see outside of school offers a reminder that they needn’t always feel that way. “What I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimate solution to loneliness lies in each of us,” Murthy says. “We can be the medicine that each other needs.”Giving young people a room of their own, and something to do in it, is a good way to get that started.Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",1

The event—titled ""Supercharge: Women All In""—will ""bring together thousands of women to laugh, sing, dance, and celebrate women's political power,"" according to the group's website.Fonda traveled to North Vietnam in 1972 as part of an anti-war protest that saw her pose for photos with enemy troops on an anti-aircraft gun. The photo sparked outrage among Vietnam veterans, earning her the nickname ""Hanoi Jane."" Fonda's public appearances remain subject to controversy—a group of Ohio veterans called on the actress to donate her $83,000 speaking fee to the families of fallen soldiers ahead of a May appearance at Kent State University.Harris and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have criticized President Donald Trump on veterans' issues in recent weeks. During a September ""veterans roundtable,"" Biden criticized Trump for ignoring ""the bounty on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan,"" referencing a slew of June reports that claimed Russia bribed the Taliban to kill U.S. servicemen. One day before the roundtable, Marine Corps general Frank McKenzie—who oversees military operations in the region—told NBC News that a review of U.S. intelligence failed to corroborate the alleged bounties.Harris promoted the roundtable in atweet, saying American veterans ""sacrifice so much for our nation and deserve our respect and gratitude, both while on active duty and after."" The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment on her upcoming appearance with Fonda.Fonda has long supported Harris financially, contributing nearly $6,000 to the Democrat's Senate campaign since 2016. The actress also gave $1,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in June after donating a combined $10,300 to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Democratic governors Steve Bullock (Mont.) and Jay Inslee (Wash.), and billionaire Tom Steyer during the presidential primary.Saturday's event will also be attended by Warren, twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). It will feature a ""yelling room where participants are encouraged to scream out their emotions,"" according to event organizers.Supermajority was launched in 2019 by a group of progressive activists, including former Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza. The group has raised $2.5 million in 2020, with$2 millioncoming from liberal billionaire George Soros's Democracy PAC. Supermajority aims to train and mobilize ""a community of all ages, races, and backgrounds to fight for gender equality together,"" according to its website.Fonda in 2017saidshe does not regret her trip to Hanoi during the Vietnam War but does regret the infamous photo with North Vietnamese troops. She added that while she is not ""proud of America today,"" she is ""proud of the resistance.""""I'm proud of the people who are turning out in unprecedented numbers and continue over and over again to protest what Trump is doing.

284,"Rey Rivera’s friend, former Baltimore employer pushes back on Netflix’s ‘Unsolved Mysteries'",0.0,45.0,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-rey-rivera-netflix-inaccuracies-20200805-zxmiq4ppp5euxhbcm23ksgezva-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,baltimoresun,24,"The former employer of Rey Rivera is pushing back on his portrayal in Netflix’s popular “Unsolved Mysteries” reboot, which raised questions about his involvement in Rivera’s 2006 death.Porter Stansberry, who has not spoken publicly about the case since the first days of Rivera’s disappearance, told The Baltimore Sun that he was “shocked and hurt” by the show’s insinuations.“The reason I’ve never commented about Rey’s death publicly first and foremost is because I never thought there was any mystery about why or how he died,” Stansberry, who runs an investment newsletter business, said in a phone interview.Rivera, 32, was missing for a week before his body was found in a room at the base of the Belvedere Hotel, having apparently crashed through the roof after a fall.The episode hitNetflixon July 1, and people interviewed for the show, including Rivera’s brother, Rivera’s wife, and the retired Baltimore homicide detective who worked the case in its first weeks, said Stansberry refused to cooperate with police and instructed his employees not to talk to detectives.The episode never accuses Stansberry of foul play, but viewers were clearly pointed to Stansberry as a shadowy figure who existed off screen and might know more than he was saying.“It’s completely untrue,” Stansberry said of the claims. “I did everything I could to help,” he said, including meeting with a detective in late June 2006.“He had every opportunity to say this,” Rivera’s widow, Allison, told The Sun regarding Stansberry previously not commenting. They haven’t spoken since June 2006, she said. “The fact is: [Rivera’s death is] truly a mystery. There’s just no answers.”But a second friend, Brad Hoppmann, who said he knew Rey Rivera since childhood and remained close with him up until his death, also believes the story has been twisted.“This is a real conversation the world can have about mental illness and help people get help when they need it,” Hoppmann said, “and it turned into a murder mystery where they’re accusing people of being involved.”Netflix did not respond to repeated messages sent to its public relations department, and the producers did not respond to messages sent through its website.Riverawent missing on May 16, 2006, and a guest at his North Baltimore home said he darted out and never returned. Three then-co-workers discovered a hole in a sub-roof of the Belvedere Hotel in Mid-Town, and Rivera’s battered and decomposing body was found inside.The mystery of his death was covered in the media at the time and was the subject of a 2018 book, “An Unexplained Death: The True Story of a Body at the Belvedere,” bylocal author Mikita Brottman.The show presents questions about how Rivera could have accessed the building’s roof, while his family members say he was not suicidal and did not have any known mental illness. His cellphone and glasses were found on the roof, relatively undamaged, which a retired homicide detective who worked the case said appeared “staged” to him. An engraved money clip he carried was never located.Rivera also left behind a note, which contains strange comments including references to Freemasons and Stanley Kubrick. “I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets,” it says.Though police said the circumstances pointed to a likely suicide, the medical examiner’s office ruled the death “undetermined,” saying there was not enough information to render a conclusion about whether it was a homicide, suicide or accident.Rivera’s case wasfeatured as the first episode of the new season of “Unsolved Mysteries,”and reached No. 1 trending on Netflix, leading to discussion and speculation on social media.Stansberry said he has received death threats, and his family has been harassed online. He said he’s even been questioned by friends and potential business partners.“It’s horrific,” Stansberry said. “You can’t even imagine what it’s like to tell people I had nothing to do with my friend’s death.”Stansberry and Rivera went to high school together in California and were water polo teammates. Rivera, an aspiring screenwriter, had moved from Los Angeles with his wife to take what Stansberry says was an entry-level position at his company writing a financial newsletter called the “Rebound Report.”When Rivera went missing, Stansberry said, he hired a private investigator, offered a reward and personally helped look for Rivera. Once the body was found, Stansberry said this week, “we were all sad and shocked by the fact that Rey killed himself, but once we saw all the facts and his financial pressures, it wasn’t much of a mystery.”In the show, retired Baltimore homicide detective Michael Baier and Rivera’s wife say that after Rivera’s body was found, Stansberry refused to return calls from investigators and put a “gag order” on employees to keep them from talking.“It’s completely a lie,” Stansberry said. “It’s not a matter of opinion. It’s a lie.”He said only that employees were told to refer media inquiries to a spokesperson. He said he personally spoke with a detective on June 23, 2006, which was after Baier was reassigned and when another detective, Marvin Sydnor, had the case. Sydnor did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday, but Stansberry’s attorney Charles Curlett said he had spoken with him recently.Allison Rivera said Tuesday that her information about Stansberry not cooperating came from Baier.Stansberry says the show is wrong that Rivera worked for him at the time of his death and that Rivera had left the job six months earlier on his own accord.“He resigned voluntarily — no ill will. He said he didn’t want to write in the newsletter world anymore” but didn’t have a solid next move lined up, Stansberry said.At the time, Stansberry’s company was beingsued by the Securities and Exchange Commissionfor selling fraudulent stock tips to investors in 2002, before Rivera joined the company. After a trial in 2005, U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis ruled in 2007 that “Stansberry’s conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, making statements that he knew to be false,” andissued a $1.5 million fine.Stansberry said there’s no connection to those proceedings and Rivera.Of particular interest in Rivera’s case is who placed a phone call to him that apparently precipitated him leaving his home.Allison Rivera has said the call came from the switchboard of Agora Publishing, and the specific caller could not be determined. Agora, a global publishing company headquartered in Baltimore, has several subsidiary companies, including Stanberry’s, and at the time all calls routed through a main switchboard.A police spokeswoman on Tuesday said the call came from an “owned subsidiary company of Agora Publishing,” but declined to provide additional details, saying it was an open investigation.Stansberry asserts that while the call might have come from someone at Agora — he says Rivera was doing freelance work for another Agora subsidiary after leaving Stanberry’s firm — it could not have come from his company.“Every person in our company who had worked with Rey was on the Eastern Shore at the time that call was made, having a corporate retreat in St. Michael’s,” Stansberry said. “No one in my company was in town when Rey disappeared. The idea we were calling him from our switchboard is ridiculous.”Stansberry said Rivera had also asked him previously if he was in leadership of the Freemasons, which Stansberry said he thought was a joke. He said when Rivera’s family and friends were searching for him, Rivera’s wife told him that the Saturday before he went missing, Rivera was “morose and would not get out of bed.”“She told me she was very worried about his mental state at the time he disappeared,” Stansberry said. “I’m not the only friend Rey approached and said things that were very odd.”Allison Rivera has said that her husband was in good spirits, though anxious about work. She said Tuesday that she couldn’t recall if she had such a conversation with Stansberry.Hoppmann, Rey Rivera’s childhood friend, said not long before his death Rey repeatedly asked him about being a member of the Freemasons and discussing the film “Eyes Wide Shut.”Hoppmann, who also worked for Stansberry at one time but says they are not close, said the week before his death Rivera asked to be able to visit his top-floor apartment in Jersey City alone. Rivera had a key to the place, but then returned it.“He was acting really, really weird,” Hoppmann said.Brottman, the author of the 2018 book about Rivera’s death and a resident of the Belvedere, said the Netflix show interviewed her for hours, and that she told them the roof was easily accessed, and not a difficult task to reach as the show asserted. In her book, she explores the various theories and concludes that Rivera likely had a mental break and jumped from the roof.“I think if they’d included my interviews it would have closed down a lot of speculation because it would have been obvious that a lot of avenues and angles had already been explored at length,” Brottman wrote on Reddit.Stansberry said the case is being sensationalized.“I think what’s really sad about this is that there are people in Hollywood who will do anything to craft a story to get attention, even when it comes to destroying someone’s reputation and trying to sensationalize the tragedy of a death of a 32-year old man,” Stansberry said.",2
285,The 2020 Election Result Completely Discredits The Democratic Leadership,-22.67,33.83,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/11/the-2020-election-result-completely-discredits-the-democratic-leadership,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,currentaffairs,25,"As of the time of this writing, Joe Biden has a lead in enough states that, if present trends hold, he will narrowly win the presidency. This would be a huge relief, because Donald Trump is amonstrosityand four more years of his authoritarian leadershipwould bean utter disaster for workers, immigrants, and the climate. I would be hugely relieved if Joe Biden became president,not because I think his presidency will in any way be goodbut because it averts the worst possible catastrophe.But even assuming Biden is sworn into office, Election Night 2020 was a rude awakening for Democrats, because many of them were hoping to see Donald Trump resoundingly repudiated by the electorate. This did not happen. Turnout massively increased in this election (a greater percentage of eligible voters turned out than in any electionsince 1900), but this was not because the public rose up in unison to defeat Donald Trump. In fact, millions who didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 voted for him this time. Biden actually appears to have done faramong certain constituencies than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Some heavily Hispanic parts of South Texas that broke overwhelmingly for Clinton split far more evenlybetween Biden and Trump. Trump managed tomake inroads among voters of colorthat I am certain the Biden campaign never thought was possible.The fact that this election is so close is a serious indictment of the Democratic Party leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead from a pandemic that the Trump administration has handled with the grossest incompetence. My colleague Eli Masseysums things upaccurately:If Joe Biden couldn’t thrash Trump under these circumstances, God only knows how he could have won if COVID-19 hadn’t happened. Trump has been an abysmal president. His approach to climate change threatens the lives of countless human beings. The case against him should be open-and-shut. Yet the Democratic Party lost to him once and has come close to doing it again. How?I have already seen some Democrats on social media blaming the voters. Americans just must be more irredeemably stupid and racist than we thought. I do not think this attitude is correct or helpful. Why are the native Spanish speakers of Miami and South Texas less enthusiastic about Biden than they were about Hillary? Do we simply blame them for “not knowing their own self-interest”?The answer to what is going on is not actually mysterious. The left has been saying it over and over ad nauseum: the Democrats have failed to offer a compelling alternative. Joe Biden has been an uninspiring corrupt corporate candidate. He’s been, incredibly, less politically competent than Hillary Clinton. He opposes policies that are hugely popular with voters. He’s been unable to generate enthusiasm—we rightly criticized Trump for holding giant rallies in the middle of a pandemic, but we also know Trump is right that Biden couldn’t hold giant rallies even if he was willing to pay people to come.Democrats have taken voters of color for granted. We know this. My colleague Malaika Jabali, in “The Color of Economic Anxiety,” documented how Black voters in Wisconsin felt completely unseen and unheard by the Democratic Party. My colleague Briahna Joy Gray has spent the entire election cycle warning that Joe Biden was treating voters of color like they wereobligated to vote for him. The Biden campaign’s outreach to Latino voters was infamously abysmal, sometimes not even rising to the level of being patronizing. It was just lazy and insulting, such as Biden pulling out his iPhone andplaying the song “Despacito” for 15 seconds.There were reports that his campaign didn’t even consider these voters “part of the path to victory” and therewere warnings before the electionthat this was going to cause problems:Politicoreports. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee “in spite of, not because of” his Latino outreach,Politicowrites, but more than 20 Latino political operatives say his luck may not hold in the general election.Indeed, it did not hold, because it turns out you need more than luck. You also need hard work, and there was little sign throughout the campaign that Biden’s team was actually putting in the work necessary to resoundingly defeat Trump. The Biden campaign seemed to be coasting on a sense of self-assurance, convinced that Donald Trump couldn’t possibly be reelected. Some of us were horrified when we realized how little campaigning Biden was actually doing; there was a period where Trump’s campaign was knocking on a million doors a week and Biden’s was knocking on zero. The Biden campaign’s messaging was all over the place. He completely screwed up the first presidential debate, sounding weak and incoherent. As with Clinton, there was no clear set of things that Biden was telling voters he would actuallyfor them. I do not know if anyone could name Biden’s signature promises, beyond “not banning fracking,” “not passing the Green New Deal,” and “not wanting Medicare for All.” These points he hammered consistently.Trump did not do well either in that first debate (both improved in the second debate) and it was notable how bad Trump’s own campaign was. His messaging was incoherent (was Joe Biden an Antifa-loving socialist or a corrupt Washington elite?) and hewasted giant piles of his campaign cash. He lost the powerful populist rhetoric that swept him into office in the first place, in favor of attacks on Biden’s ne’er-do-well son Hunter, a strange issue to choose for an electorate focused on the pandemic and the economy. Trump made serious missteps and often seemed desperate. Defeating him should have been a cakewalk.It was truly shocking to see many Democrats learn absolutely nothing from 2016. I tend to be politically cynical, but to seeof the lessons learned was remarkable. The central points that I and others on the left have been emphasizing over and over since that election were:This last point should have been one of the absolutely central lessons from 2016, an election in which Trump outperformed his polls and shocked the nation. But, incredibly, thecomplacency of 2016returned in 2020. I was rather shocked myself, because I thought we had all learned thatpolls canunderestimate Trump’s support, since many Trump voters don’t like to admit they’re Trump voters (and some are QAnoners who probably think pollsters are part of the socialist globalist pedophile-cannibal ring). I spent monthsarguingwith people who insisted that the polls had been “fixed” since 2016 and the same thing that happened once could not happen twice. I even heard this from leftists skeptical of Biden, and I suspect that there was a certain “wishful thinking” bias creeping in. Nobody on the left wanted to have to actually work to get Biden elected, because he was transparently awful, so there was an inclination not to question polls showing Biden with a comfortable lead.The polls were not reliable, just as they were not reliable in 2016. Dave Wasserman of thesays they have “rarely led us more astray.”FiveThirtyEight’s final Florida average, for instance, put Biden ahead in the state by 2.5 points. As of right now, Trump is winning the state by 3.4 points. The site put Trump ahead in Texas by 1.1 according to the polls, but he’s winning right now by 6.1. In Ohio, Trump was ahead in the polls by 0.8, but he’s winning by 8 points. Though it appears Biden will win, pollsactually led to predictions of a “Biden landslide,” and it’s obvious that this was not only a complete mirage, but hugely irresponsible to even discuss. When people falsely assumed Biden was this far ahead, they could wrongly assume that the Democrats had everything under control and all the average person needed to do was keep scrolling Twitter and checking to make sure everything was still in hand.I have warned people beforenot to ever listen to polling pundit Nate Silver, and this election showed exactly why. He offered people the reassuring observation that for Trump to win would require a serious polling error of the kind unlikely to occur. Well, a serious polling error did occur, and though it may not have beenenough to give Trump the win, it is obvious that these sorts of statements from people like Silver put the country at risk by downplaying the possibility of Trump seriously outperforming expectations. Silver, as I noted in my analysis, is always careful to hedge by saying that he’s only commenting on what isprobable, but this actually shows why his work is extremely unhelpful. He predicts that anything could happen (even a big polling error), so that whatever happens, he can say “I predicted that.” Indeed, when I asked him if a Trump victory would mean his analysis was useless, he told me that it wouldn’t, because a Trump victory was one of the set of things he said could happen. This means that he has carefully made sure he never issues a “falsifiable” prediction. But it also means that taking his probabilities as meaningful commentaries on reality is very, very dangerous. The best approach to an election you want to win is to assume you’re likely to lose and do whatever it would take to reverse that outcome.Let’s be very clear: the Democratic Party screwed this election up massively. Trumpactually did better than he did in 2016in areas with high COVID-19 deaths. Union members in Ohioappearto have gone for Trump, and most of the people who saw the economy as the top issuevoted for Trump, even though this should theoretically be the issue on which the Democratic Party is strongest.Now, Democrats are not going to take the Senate. The candidate that the leadershiphand-picked to run againstMitch McConnell (instead of progressiveCharles Booker) got crushed. Themassive amountthat was spent to defeat Lindsey Graham went nowhere, predictably. The Democratssquandered money on pitifully unpersuasive messagesin races that they should have been able to win. Theyfailedto flip Republican target seats in the House and even lost important seats. Even though a popular progressive policy, the$15 minimum wage, attracted overwhelming support in Florida, the Democratic candidate did not.The fact that there were many voters in Florida who voted for both Donald Trump and a $15 minimum wage should be a puzzle for the Democratic leadership. Why do they support a candidate who opposes the very thing they seem to support? Fox Newsrecently publishedresults of polls of voters confirming that large numbers support government-run healthcare, restrictions on gun rights, the preservation of abortion rights, and a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. How, then, could Donald Trump, a person who is doing exactly the opposite on all of these issues, come so close to winning reelection?There is nothing surprising here, however, to anyone who has read, say,Thomas Frank’s, or who was paying attention to Michael Moore’s warning in 2016that Trump would win. (Current Affairsalsoexpressed its concern.)Current Affairscontributing cartoonistMatt Lubchanskyputs it well when they say “if I were the opposition party candidate or candidates I would simply espouse policies with broad-based support that improve people’s material conditions in clear and accessible language.” That’s exactly what hasn’t happened, and heads need to roll in the party over this. Pelosi, Schumer,Tom Perez: these people need ousting.They have failed.It makes me terribly sad to think about how differently this could have gone. We had a candidate, Bernie Sanders, who wasuniquely well-positionedto counter Trump’s messaging. But as my colleague Luke Savageputs it, “Democratic elites expended more energy, conviction, and zeal to defeat Bernie Sanders, his movement, and Medicare For All than they did to defeat Donald Trump.” Sanders had a formidable organizing apparatus, an agenda designed to address ordinary working people’s basic material concerns, and even aproven effective Latino outreach strategy. I, andother writers for this magazine, have spent the past four years warning that not only are candidates like Biden going to tank the Democratic Party’s long-term electoral prospects, butthe leftthat can plausibly restore Democratic political fortunes. As Joe Biden (potentially) flounders and staggers across the finish line and centrist Democrats lost house seats, a reported26 out of 30 nationally-endorsed Democratic Socialists of America candidates won their races. DSA candidates tend to win inunexpected placesbecause they put in the work and have a message designed to appeal to a broad base of voters. (“If we win, you won’t have to worry about money when you need to go to the doctor” is an argument that people can be enthusiastic about making on the doorstep, as compared with “If we win, the parasitic private insurance industry will be preserved but we will make several important tweaks to Obamacare.”)There is anargument madethat the left cannot win because being called a “socialist” hurts Democratic candidates, with Joe Biden having been wounded by this attack. But I think that misunderstands the problem. Being called a socialist does hurt, if you acknowledge that being a socialist is bad and are put on the defensive about it. But every Democrat is hit with this attack, even if they are obviouslya socialist (which Biden clearly isn’t). The best approach is not to try to meekly insist that the socialist charge is a lie, but to lean into it, to say “What of it?” and to explain why the socialist agenda is reasonable and moderate. If you think that can’t be done, just have a look at Bernie talking to Trump voters orspeaking at a Fox News town hall. He doesn’t run away from the label, he explains what it means to him, and then the audience ends up going “hm, that actually sounds pretty reasonable.” At the debates this cycle, Biden and Harris’ worst moments were when they defensively insisted that they didnotsupport the job-killing Green New Deal. They would have done much better if they’d replied: of course I support the Green New Deal, because itcreatesjobs, and if you don’t understand that, you’re an idiot. Instead of asking me to disown the Green New Deal, why don’t we ask why the Republicans are content to let the planet burn? Democratic defensiveness makes it seem as if they’re shifty, and looks like an acknowledgment that Republicans are right that socialism and the Green New Deal are bad. Disowning socialism makes you look weak. Embracing it makes you look cool and tough.I do not want to dwell too much in the counterfactual fantasy of a Bernie-Trump race, but it does need to be emphasized that Joe Biden’s failure to effectively fight Trump—a man whose closing argument to the country was a video of himdancing to the YMCA—shows the urgent need for something fresh, new, and real. No more pretending that candidates we all know are bad are actually secretly competent and have a plan. No more pretending that “I’ll cancel a certain amount of student debt for people who run a business for three years in a disadvantaged community” is a serious plan to deal with the student debt crisis. No morelofty words covering up detestable deeds. People can see through that crap, and they’re tired of it. There is no mandate for centrist politics in this country. No flood of Republicans is going to defect from Trump to support Biden if Biden just pledges his love of fracking enough times.Assuming Biden staggers over the finish line, we have got to spend the next several years building a very different Democratic Party, in order to avoid some horrible neo-fascist like Tom Cotton or Dan Crenshaw taking the presidency in 2024. Biden will likely do very little, and will be relatively unpopular from the moment he takes office. The Republican senate will obstruct him, and he will use them as an excuse to avoid doing even the limited number of things we might reasonably have hoped for from him. It may be a sort of non-presidency, and that is alarming in some ways and advantageous in others. It is alarming because we urgently need action to be taken on climate change, and Biden is likely going to sit uselessly twiddling his thumbs, growing steadily more unpopular and reminding the country why they don’t like the Democratic Party. It is advantageous because it gives us a few years to try to build an authentic left alternative and fill the leadership vacuum.These are going to be critical years for the left. We must build institutional power. We have to pressure the Biden administration in every way we can. We need to unionize as many workplaces as possible. Everyone who cares about the future of the country should be a dues-payingDSA member. Strong independent media organizations that can combat right-wing lies and present left arguments compellingly to a mass audience need to be built and buttressed. (Organizations likeand this magazine are doing our best to fill this need and could really use yoursupportin these coming years.) We will not have much time: the 2020 map shows us that the Biden presidency is doomed if the right regroups, because even if Trump is voted out, “Trumpism” is alive and well and has mass appeal.The Democratic Party establishment fundamentally does not know what it is doing. This was proved definitively in 2016. This year, what we have learned is that is not only incompetent, it is also unteachable. It will not get better, not even in response to this calamity. If it’s up to the people currently in charge of the party it’d be Harris/Buttigiegin 2024. Nothing will change unlesschange it, which it is now our responsibility to do. A Biden presidency is a relief, but only a small one. It is also a burden, because it means that we must now act fast to totally change the party, before it is too late. There can be no relaxing and “going back to brunch.” Our work is cut out for us.",1
286,‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?,-0.33,43.67,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,theguardian,25,"Nick Pope spent the early 1990s investigatingUFOsfor the British ministry of defence. Sequestered in a rarely visited government office – the “metaphorical basement” – he well remembers how his field of work was regarded.“I would walk down the corridor and people would whistle the theme music to either Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Twilight Zone,” Pope told the Guardian.Towards the end of his spell at the MoD, a new science fiction show featuring a pair of FBI alien hunters was also growing in popularity. “I do recall the X-Files theme tune being whistled, too,” he said.In the nearly two decades since then, attitudes towards UFOs have slowly been changing, especially in America where the subject matter has gone from the margins to the mainstream, with even former president Barack Obama opining on their potential existence.Rebranded by governments and enthusiasts as “UAPs”, or unidentified aerial phenomena, 2021 has seen arguably the first ever serious discussion of unknown flying things. In June the Pentagon is set to releasea highly anticipated reporton what it knows about UAPs, and the excitement about that disclosure has been fueled by a slew of witnesses coming forward to share their experiences with the 60 Minutes news show in May.Obama was among many public figures to add his thoughts on UAPs and the Pentagon report this month.“There’s footage and records of objects in the skies, that we don’t know exactly what they are, we can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory,” Obama said inan interviewwith CBS. “They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”The sincerity of the discussion around UAPs – “I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously,” the Republican senator Marco Rubio told 60 Minutes – is a far cry from the jeers Pope once faced.So what has changed in America?“In the last three years it has been elevated above just hearsay and segued into hard evidence,” said Pope, who is now based in Arizona, said. “Not just the testimony from military pilots who’ve been involved in encounters with these things, but radar data and the infra-red camera videos that everyone’s seen.”In recent years a series of government videos showing UAPs, have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong objectflying through the skynear San Diego in 2004.This April photos and videos taken by navy personnel wereleakedonline, showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky, and in May leaked military footage showedan oval flying objectnear a navy ship in San Diego – an apparent UAP hotspot.Members of the navy saw UAPs so frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told 60 Minutes.“Every day,” Graves said. “Every day for at least a couple years.”For Ted Roe, who runs the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, a non-profit where pilots or others can report their experiences with UAPs, this was merely confirmation of what he already knew.“That doesn’t surprise me at all,” Roe said. “Somewhere in the world every day this is happening – it manifests steadily, daily. And from my private conversations with current and former military fliers I feel that the reports that I get – as far as pilot reports – are clearly the tip of the iceberg.”But for all the apparent easing of taboo around UAPs, Roe says there is still a stigma.“Nobody is willing to risk their careers or reputation on this subject, even now,” Roe said. “Pilots won’t contact us until they retire. I’d say it’s almost 50-50, the cases I get, that are more recent, versus those that happened years ago and they didn’t want to talk about because they would lose their flight status, and because they were worried about their careers.”The government – all governments – have previously been reluctant to even acknowledge that they monitor UAPs.In 2007 the US defense department launched an “Advanced aerospace threat identification program” to investigate UFOs. The effort was so secretive that the public was only made aware of it 10 years later, aftera New York Times investigation.As leaked or officially published footage has spread, however, demands for transparency from the public and politicians has grown, prompting the CIA torelease thousands of documentson UAPs in January 2021.Rubio, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, has been a particularly loud voice, and he was part of a group of elected officials who succeeded in thrusting theIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021into the $2.3tn coronavirus relief spending bill signed into law by Donald Trump in December.That act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence”, and “a detailed description of an interagency process” for reporting UFOs. The report must be handed over by 25 June.“Men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are reporting encounters with unidentified aircraft with superior capabilities,” Rubio toldthe Tampa Bay Timesin mid-May.“We cannot allow the stigma of UFOs to keep us from seriously investigating this. The forthcoming report is one step in that process, but it will not be the last.”The flurry of recent videos and the imminent release of the report has ignited an excitement around unidentified flying things not seen for years. Pope warned, however, that after years of furtiveness from intelligence agencies, people should not expect the government to releaseit knows about these mysterious objects in the sky.“The report must be unclassified, but it could have a classified annex, so there’s a strong possibility that any earth-shattering facts will be in that classified annex, rather than the unclassified report,” Pope said.He added: “So people should be excited, but not too excited. They should be pragmatic, and a little expectation management might be useful.”",1
287,"Lies, Damn Lies, and Inflation",-12.75,33.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/inflation-covid-mmt-austerity-economy-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-18,inthesetimes,25,"There are two basic ways to interpret economic news. One is the academic way, in which every development is weighed and scrutinized and plugged into various models in a more or less genuine attempt to intuit what is happening in the chaotic complex system we call​“the economy.” This is what honest economists do, and sometimes they develop new theories that end up causing enormous shifts in global history, many years downstream. This is not the kind of economics we are talking about now, in2021.The other way of approaching economics is the political way, in which each new piece of economic data is hammered and squeezed and molded into a form that serves a preexisting political agenda. This is economics as an instrument to serve politics, not vice versa. This is, unfortunately, the way that most people experience​“the economy”: not as something to be understood, but as something to be either squeezed for all its worth, or something that is squeezing you for all you’re worth. Karl Marx and Adam Smith may have been honest economists in the first category, but most of their disciples in governments have been firmly in the second.It is important to understand this distinction when we discuss economics, lest the discussion go off in two different directions. While academic economists and journalists peer at the past year’s bizarre economic contortions — a historic collapse followed rapidly by a historic government-fueled rebound leading to an uncertain future — and conclude (honestly) that they don’t really know what’s happening, political actors are already sharpening their knives to go to war over what happens next.In terms of political economy, the question now is whether we are poised to enact a new New Deal — a huge increase in government-funded social spending to finally try to turn the tide on inequality that has been building for more than40years — or whether we are instead poised to swing back towards austerity, a brutal budget-balancing to​“make up for” the large spending bills enacted during the past year’s lockdowns. Despite the fact that the trillions of dollars the government spent in several relief bills has successfully staved off whatwould have beenanother Great Depression (and has caused a boom in financial asset prices that is making rich people richer), the institutional preference of the Republican Party is, always, for austerity. The political case for austerity is going to be made no matter what. And inflation is going to be the primary tool used to make it. The honesty of this analysis is beside the point.Along with the contentions​“raising the minimum wage destroys jobs” and​“raising taxes hurts the economy” canards, a key part of the right wing economic gospel is that increasing government spending is bad because it leads to dangerous levels of inflation. Never mind the fact that right-wing economists have been steadily predicting this outcome since the recovery from the2008recession, and it has never come true. They will continue to predict it.Now, inflation is actually here. Never mind the fact that the Fed believes that inflation can be kept under control, and that more government spending is in order — all popular media coverage of inflation occurs in the frame of fear. A little evidence of inflation combined with a lot of fear of inflation will be the formula for turning inflation into a political weapon in service of austerity.You should get ready to hear two primary messages. The first, with each passing month of inflation, will be:​“OUT OF CONTROL government spending is causing inflation that will EAT UP YOUR SAVINGS and cause prices to SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL and we must immediately STOP all new spending and also CUT ENTITLEMENTS.” In this way, longstanding Republican priorities — namely, cutting government spending on everyone except the rich — will be shoehorned into a prescription for today’s (mostly imaginary) problems, without mentioning that the GOP was pushing the same prescription a decade ago when the problems were the opposite.The second message you will hear, which may be a bit subtler, will be:​“This is caused by Modern Monetary Theory, a wacky theory that Democrats embrace, and all this inflation proves that the theory is a failure.” Political speech is about caricatures. The caricature of MMT is:​“These fools think the government can print as much money as it wants with no consequences, but we all know that that will cause runaway inflation.” If you know a little about MMT, you may object to this characterization by understanding that, in fact, MMT specifically focuses on inflation as the signal to tell us how much the governmentspend. That doesn’t matter. It is too nuanced for the caricature, and in politics, the caricature can become far more important than the reality.What percentage of Republicans who hold strong opinions on​“Critical Race Theory” do you think have actually studied critical race theory outside of the caricature? Exactly.It will only take a shift of a single seat in the Senate and a small handful of seats in the House to make the idiotic Republican economic caricatures into the reigning economic orthodoxy of the United States Congress. At that point, the opportunity for transformative change is finished. And even if Republicans don’t manage to win back control of Congress in the midterms, there is the danger that the caricature becomes influential enough to scare Democrats back into the deficit-fearing hole where they have spent most of the past half century.Every last thing happening right now counsels strong, fast action. Get the money out the door now or risk losing any chance at major debt-fueled government spending programs in the foreseeable future. That means the obliteration of any hope for turning around the rise in economic inequality, the single most damaging trend in America in my lifetime.Most Americans are economically illiterate. This is not an insult to them. It is just an observation of fact, and the completely predictable outcome of our nation’s unwillingness to engage in any widespread form of economic education that is not soaked in free market jingoism. For political purposes, nobody knows what MMT is. But they do know enough to fear inflation, because inflation makes stuff cost more, and nobody likes that. Therefore the weaponized rhetorical power of inflation will tend to overwhelm whatever it is being deployed against. And we know that it will be deployed with full force against the possibility that the American welfare state could be permanently expanded. That always makes rich people scared that they’ll have higher taxes, and therefore they will wage war against it.We are now in a race to give people new government benefits before they get tricked out of wanting them. Every month that inflation ticks up, the lies will get louder, and the task will get harder. Spend the fucking money now. There is no time to waste.I hope you found this article important.

Hopefully we’ll have vaccines and other therapeutics.”The partners will probably be able to make as many as 2 million doses per year by the end of next March if the drug cocktail obtains regulatory approval, Anderson said. That’s about the number of new Covid-19 cases identified worldwide in the past week.The necessity for a multipronged approach to treat Covid-19 has come into focus as potential safety issues emerge in late-stage trials of some promising vaccines and treatments. Eli Lilly this week paused a study of its own Covid-19 antibody to investigate such a concern.The U.S. has already secured hundreds of thousands of doses of experimental Covid antibody treatments, federal health officials said earlier this month, before the Lilly trial was paused. At that point they expected to have 1 million doses on hand by the end of the year. Trump touted Regeneron’s antibody cocktail as a cure, saying he’d make the drugs he took available for free to Americans.Read more from Naomi Kresge.Medicare to Pay Labs More for Fast Tests Turnaround:Medicare is adding performance bonuses to its Covid-19 lab payment policy.

Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson earlier Saturday — arrived with ropes, a crane, and pry bars to wrench the artwork off the plinth where it had stood on Charlottesville’s West Main Street since 1919.Local observer Molly Congerdocumented the processon Twitter.“Getting right down to business, not even taking the cherry picker off the truck,” Conger wrote.Lewis, the famous American adventurer who was sent by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the land west of the Mississippi River in 1804, was a local hero born in Charlottesville’s Albemarle County.The bronze statue cast to honor the Lewis and Clark expedition includes the two men and Sacagawea, their Shoshone guide and interpreter.In recent years its design has been criticized for its portrayal of Sacagawea, who appears in a crouching position behind the standing white men — which activists have seen as disparaging.But some historians contend that her posture shows her in action as a tracker and is not meant to place her in a subservient stance.Charlottesville’s Lewis and Clark Exploratory Center has offered to take the statue — but the city council has not yet decided to accept its plan.",1
291,Femicide Is a Growing Issue in the United States,-6.33,41.67,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/femicide-is-a-growing-issue-in-the-united-states,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,teenvogue,25,"The killing of 20-year-oldVanessa Guillén, a Mexican-American Army specialist who disappeared from Fort Hood, Texas onApril 22, whose remains were found more than two months later on June 30, has spurred conversations about violence against women in the military. Hundreds of women, in what has been called the “military’s #MeToo moment,” have shared stories aboutsexual harassment and assault, illustrating a culture of violence within the ranks of the U.S. military.Before her disappearance, Guilléntold her familythat she had been sexually harassed. News of her experience with sexual harassment spurred other women service members to share their own stories under the hashtag#IAmVanessaGuillen. After her remains were found, acriminal complaintreleased by the Department of Justice alleges that fellow soldier Aaron Robinson murdered Guillén at Fort Hood, dismembering and burying her body with the help of his girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar. On July 1, Robinson died by suicide. Aguilar has been charged with tampering with documents or proceedings and has pleaded not guilty.As Vanessa Guillen’s murder, horrific in its own right, has helped uncover a pattern of violence within the military, it also reveals a larger global epidemic of violence against cis and transgender women.Femicide, generally understood to mean themurder of women for being women,a term often applied abroad, is a global issue thatsignificantlyimpactsBlack,Indigenous, poor, and migrant women. It’s oftentimes thought of as violence relegated to peripheries, border cities like Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, or endemic to regions like Latin America or Africa. The truth is that femicide is an ever-present andgrowingcrisis in the United States.There are various typesof femicide, and it can be hard to collect data on these killings because some countries don’t collect information that could categorize them as so, according to the World Health Organization. Compounding that difficulty is that various places define the word differently — for some, femicide means the killing of womenthey are a woman, while for others it’s any murder of a woman. Some countries, like Mexico, havepassed lawsagainst femicide, giving a legal meaning to the term: the murder of a woman can be classified as a femicide if her killing was motivated by gender. The U.S. hasn’t adopted a standardized definition for the term but the federal government tracks domestic violence killings.The Violence Against Women Actpassed in 1994recognizesdomestic violence as a national crime.While there's no consensus on what qualifies as femicide, this kind of violence has been on theriseglobally. In Latin America, El Salvador and Honduras are consistently among the countries with thehighestfemicide rates globally, while Mexico saw a145%jump in femicide cases between 2015 and 2019. Last year,South Africadeclared femicide a national crisis when nearly 3,000 women were murdered between 2018 and 2019.These numbers are shocking, but often ignored are the rising rates of femicide in the United States.In 2018, 114 women were killed in Los Angeles County, the highest number since the beginning of the decade, according to aanalysis. That report found that “women are less likely than men to be killed in a shooting, but more likely to be beaten, stabbed or strangled.”The number of women killed in the U.S. has been steadily rising since 2014, according to the most recently available data fromViolence Policy Center, and 1,948 women were killed by men in 2017. Women under 29 and women of color, includingtrans women, are disproportionately murdered—Black and Native American women experienced thehighest ratesof homicide between 2003 and 2014, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disappearance of Native American women is a critical problem—nearly5,600 were reported missinglast year, according to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center and this is violence that haspersisted over centuries and permeates communities.And, so far in 2019, at least26transgender or gender non-conforming people were killed in this country.Women Count USA: Femicide Accountability Projectis an online database organized by Dawn Wilcox, a nurse who tracks femicide in the U.S. Of the 1,838 women and girls killed in2018the majority were killed by current or formerpartners, according to the organization.There are stories and names behind these numbers.Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salauwas a 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist heldcaptiveand sexually assaulted before being killed in Tallahassee.Nina Pop, a Black trans woman who was stabbed to death in Missouri, andDominique “Rem’mie” Fells, a Black trans woman whose body was found near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania, were both murdered this year.Guillén's name, too, is on that list.The day Guillén's killer died, her family held a press conference demanding answers from military authorities. Vanessa Guillén's sister Lupe Guillén gave a gut-wrenching speech condemning the military for sidelining the family during their investigation and for failing to protect her sister, who she says experienced sexualharassment. “My sister Vanessa Guillén was sexually harassed yet nothing was done,” shesaid. “She deserves respect. She deserves to be heard because if this can happen to my sister, it can happen to anyone else.”After finding her remains, the Army Col. Ralph Overland, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and Guillén’s regimental commandersaidin a statement that Guillén's killing “devastated” everyone. The Army website says an “Army Regulation 15-6 Investigation” is being conducted into claims of sexual harassment, the “standard method of investigation” into such allegations.The rage you hear in Lupe’s voice is one shared by thousands searching for truth and justice for their slain loved ones. It’s a rage and desperation commonly experienced by relatives of femicide victims.ByP. Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara DelgadoRecognizing femicide as an issue in this country means understanding how it's linked to violence against women globally.A powerfulvideosurfaced in February, a few months before Guillén's remains were found, of Yesenia Zamudio, the mother of 19-year-old María de Jesús “Marichuy” Jaimes Zamudio, a Mexico City university student who died after falling from a window in2016.Her death was ruled a femicide, and her mother says Marichuy was thrown from the window.“I have every right to burn and to break,”saidZamudio during marches against femicide. “I’m not going to ask permission from anybody, because I am breaking for my daughter."" Zamudio, who has become a fierce advocate against gender violence, was addressing a crowd in Mexico City during a demonstration honoringIngrid Escamilla, yet another woman brutally murdered in Mexico. “This has destroyed our lives. Unfortunately, we are many mothers that feel this pain,” she said in a separateinterview.Authorities have yet to arrest anyone in connection with Marichuy's death, though Mexico City’s Human Rights Commission found that the investigators hadfailedto conduct a fair investigation. While Mexico’s political corruption and impunity presents challenges specific to the country’s relatives of femicide victims seeking violence, the rage of a mother, of a sister, of the community of a woman disappeared and murdered certainly has global resonance.Guillén’s family and their lawyer Natalie Khawam aredemandingan independent congressional investigation into her disappearance and killing; in July, the militaryannounceda panel of civilian consultants would investigate ""command climate and culture"" at the base where Guillén was killed. Her family also calls on congress to create an independent agency that would handle reports from military members who are victims of sexual harassment and assault. #IAmVanessaGuillen demonstrates the power of solidarity against sexual harassment, yet reckoning with gender violence in this country also means recognizing how entrenched patriarchal violence is, and how it extends beyond the military’s ranks.",1
292,GOP senators push double-decker welfare program,20.75,18.75,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/gop-senators-push-double-decker-welfare-program/,https://adfontesmedia.com/conservative-review-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,conservativereview,12,"President Trump needs to be reelected in 2020, but the Republican Party makes it harder to do so when they mimic the lunatic Left.As a grassroots conservative, the most frustrating thing to have to deal with come election time is to promote a candidate or back a Republican for reelection to gain or maintain a majority, when you know darn well that candidate or incumbent could backslide into the stupid and inexplicable positions owned by the Left.We actually have a president who has identified the problem when he famously said, “America will never be a socialist country.” We are at a point in time where the Left is no longer hiding the fact that they are socialists and unfortunately too many of the American populace are already, or on their way to being convinced, that top-down government control of their lives is exactly what they’ve been waiting for.But why oh why do we have to sit here and watch the Republican Party champion socialism while we have the winning message that socialism will destroy America?I could not believe my eyes when I read that Senators Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, actually proposed a paid family leave act with the acronym “CRADLE.” Who read that and didn’t think, “cradle to grave?” And as we are trying to point out how terrible socialism is, the senators, their aides and their mouthpieces in the media are trying to make the program less terrible by saying it’s “revenue neutral.”It’s no problem, they tell us. See, the money will come out of the person’s own Social Security account and it’ll be like taking some vacation pay early, that’s all. And besides, the American people want it so we should make sure we’re out in front on this issue, you know, to show we care.They’re going to build another socialist program off of another socialist program. A double-decker.And here I thought theSSA Trusteeshad been telling the American people that Social Security will be depleted by 2034 and Social Security Disability Insurance sooner than that? I thought that as conservatives we’re supposed to encourage people to rely on themselves and not the federal government? I thought that Social Security was the first big socialist program that the progressives foisted upon us and we are still trying to figure out how to keep the promises those lying progressives made? I thought that this socialist program was in trouble the minute people started living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65?What about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any to speak of?The example put forth to sell this plan discussed new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn. But wouldn’t it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money? They would be the ones who also haven’t worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either.Provided there were such a thing as a “Social Security bank,” which there isn’t.The Washington Examinerpoints outthat particular concern of mine isn’t going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties.So it’s another welfare program. But I thought the Republicans are saying it’s not another welfare program?Just saying, why do the people who put considerably less into the system automatically get more out of it percentage-wise?Why do Republicans do this? Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities? We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents who struggle. We, as Republicans, get beat on the head every single time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements, but we never fight back with the fact that we have so many programs between the federal and state government intended to be used as safety nets when they are needed and then gotten the hell off of when people can do it themselves.But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremely shaky welfare program and some Republicans are gleeful because it doesn’t start up a new tax.It will tax our Social Security system, which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income. Yet Republicans think starting up another progressive social program on top of it will benefit future generations.How so?#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px}/* Add your own MailChimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */",0

So make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America.”The McCloskeys face felony charges for brandishing firearms at a large group of demonstrators who broke down a fence to protest through their gated neighborhood in June. They have becomeFox Newsfixturesover the summerand have used the platform to accuse St. Louis prosecutor Kim Gardner of not being objective in pressing charges against them. The unlawful use of a weapon charge carries a sentence of one to four years in prison and fines of up to $5,000.While declining to charge some rioters wrapped up in racial injustice protests after George Floyd’s death, Gardner referenced the McCloskeys in a campaign email,telling supporters they “pointed guns at peaceful citizens.”She also admitted tonot disclosing 2017 and 2018 travelpaid for by activist organization Fair and Just Prosecution but said the connection hadn’t influenced her work.During their prime-time TV appearance, part of four days of convention programming, the McCloskeys warned thatlaw and orderproblems weren’t isolated to city centers.The issues were trickling outward into the suburbs, they said.The McCloskeys, themselves attorneys, joined former Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann at the convention in sharing their “cancel culture” experience. Sandmann successfully sued theWashington Postand CNN this year for millions of dollars over their coverage of his 2019 stand-off withNative American elder Nathan Phillips.",1

The shopping district—one of the finest in the Dallas-Fort Worth area—is home to quaint boutiques, fine jewelry stores, and even a selection of parks and green spaces equipped with water fountains. And on Friday, Nov. 6, the family-friendly space was overrun with demonstrators protesting against any declaration of President Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 presidential election.The protest, organized on social media by a pair of young women who call themselves the Patriot Sisters, attracted areported75 people, many of whom brandished “Thin Blue Line” American flags and signs emblazoned with the words “TRUMP 2020.” One woman strummed a guitar and sang religious songs, while other protesters prayed and declared that “voter fraud should be stopped in the name of Jesus.”The group also attracted supporters of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, including one man carrying a cellphone on a selfie stick, which he used to record the protest while chanting religious declarations interspersed with statements about child-trafficking and pedophilia—dog whistles used by QAnon adherents.“We will not lose this nation and allow human trafficking to continue,” the man carrying a selfie stick said in avideotitled “Prayer Rally for TRUMP! #Trump2020 #PrayForTrump #TheGreatAwakening.”“We will not lose this nation and allow pedophilia to continue…we declare that no darkness will triumph in these last days. Praise you, Jesus,” he said. (The Great Awakening is a term associated with QAnon, as well as with religious-right activists who believe God is using Trump to bring spiritual revival to the U.S.)The Patriot Sisters run popular Instagram and TikTok accounts, which they have used to promote the anti-mask movement, anti-Black Lives Matter rhetoric, and pro-Trump propaganda and misinformation. They have even made apostusing the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which was hijacked by QAnon followers to push falsehoods about the purported exploitation of children by liberal elites.While they may not necessarily be ardent supporters of QAnon, the Patriot Sisters’ attraction of some of the conspiracy theory’s impassioned followers not only emphasizes the recently formed overlap between evangelical Christians and QAnon, but also highlights the current state of despair festering within the movement – a despair centered around a single question:What now?Election night was supposed to signal a key moment in Q’s long-touted reckoning.The anonymous prophet fueling the QAnon movement spent years flooding the internet with unfounded conspiracies, proclamations about the so-called deep state’s cabalistic control of the United States, and Trump’s role as the anointed savior fighting off the forces of evil. The posts began on the infamous discussion board 4chan in Oct. 2017, where an anonymous poster claimed to have “Q clearance” granting him access to classified information at the Department of Energy, including nuclear secrets. Q quickly amassed a large following through his posts (known as “Q drops”), and the movement grew among right-wing circles.QAnon eventually morphed into a virtual cult where supporters claim that a cabal of elite pedophiles made up of Hollywood actors, Democrats, and other high-ranking officials is behind a global child sex-trafficking ring. The unfounded conspiracy theory also alleges that Trump is planning a day of reckoning known as “The Storm,” during which thousands of these deep state actors will be arrested. Many believed that the supposed reckoning and the eventual defeat of the deep state would begin with Trump’s victory in the 2020 election.Joe Biden’s victory served as a body-blow to the movement’s ardent followers.Q’s final drop before the election was on the morning of Nov. 3, and featured an Abraham Lincoln quote from 1863, in which the former president declared “that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.” The drop also bore the image of an American flag and a YouTube link to the theme song of the 1992 film “The Last of the Mohicans.”  TheYouTube linkwas viewed more than 35 million times and features more than 28,000 comments, mainly from loyal followers of the QAnon movement.“This is the Q message board today,” read one comment. “A genius way to get past the sensors. Seeing all the recent comments makes me proud win or lose. WWG1WGA.” (The code denotes QAnon’s best-known slogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”)While Q’s followers gathered in earnest to witness a reckoning that never came, Q himself was mysteriously silent. Even the operators of the websiteQ Alerts, which keeps track of the Q drops, attempted to reassure followers regarding their prophet’s suspicious absence. “Q has been dark for 9 days. At times Q strategically goes dark for days, weeks or in some cases months. Be sure you have some type of Q Alerts in place so you are notified when Q drops again. If your browser shows a red bell icon at the bottom/right, that is a great place to start.”Q’s disappearance (which lasted for nine days until the anonymous figureresurfaced again on Nov. 12) coupled with Trump’s defeat in the presidential elections, led to a range of responses from his followers. Some stood their ground and doubled down on the conspiracies, while others began to question whether they themselves had been fooled. Followers (known as Anons) flooded forums, Telegram chats, and Q-friendly spaces to discuss the events, share their despair, and seek comfort from others.“We Have (sic) been told time & again Trump wins in the end!! Don’t give up so easily, if you believe don’t give up,” one poster told a QAnon group of several hundred members on Telegram. Another responded that “giving up is NOT an option for me!!”This is not the first time that QAnon believers have faced disappointment. One of the initial claims of the conspiracy theory was that Hillary Clinton would be arrested and imprisoned in 2017. When that did not happen, QAnon followers recalibrated and decided that Clinton had been placed under house arrest and was wearing an ankle bracelet. Even her appearances in public only emboldened them to raise the stakes and claim that the deep state had replaced her with a clone.Then in 2018, Q claimed that Republicans would dominate the midterm elections and reclaim the U.S. House of Representatives. This, of course, did not come to pass, and while this likely impacted some of Q’s followers, the movement only continued to grow over the next couple of years.Q’s nine days of silence during a critical time in the supposed reckoning left a power vacuum within the cesspool of conspiracies on 8kun, the message board formerly known as 8chan that has been linked to white supremacy, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, various other hate crimes, and multiple mass shootings. Following three mass shootings in 2019 (Christchurch, New Zealand, in March; Poway, California, in April; El Paso, Texas, in August) where each ofthe assailants used 8chan as a platform to post their manifestos, 8chan went offline in August 2019 and rebranded in Nov. 2019 as 8kun.While 8kun quickly became a home for Q’s posts, the site saw a surprising shift on Election Day. Shortly following Q’s Nov. 3 drop, Ron Watkins—son of 8kun owner Jim Watkins—revealedthat he was “resigning as the admin of 8kun effective immediately.” According to theWashington Post, Watkins resigned to focus on his “health and marriage” and that he had “no thoughts or insight” into why Q had not posted in over a week.Given that Watkins was one of ahandful of people who could verify Q’s drops, several fake Q posts appeared over the following days which caused mass confusion among Anons before being discredited. Others spammed the forums with biblical passages comparing Moses’ miraculous parting of the Red Sea to QAnon’s ongoing fight against the deep state. The posts served the purpose of preying on vulnerable believers who were seeking answers for Q’s temporary disappearance.For some Anons, their determined and whole-hearted support for the baseless conspiracy theorycost them their marriages and destroyed their families. Those who have gambled on Q being a harbinger of light against the forces of evil cannot afford to turn back now, lest they realize they had sacrificed their loved ones to follow an anonymous internet troll. Faced with little alternative, many have doubled down on their beliefs and converged onto their last resort: unfounded conspiracy theories alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.Major Patriot—a popular twitter account belonging to a QAnon supporter—was among the first totweet out words of encouragementto his 168,000+ following, claiming that everything was going according to plan for the Trump administration despite the election results:I want to encourage any of you who may be alarmed about what is happening in our nation…Have Faith in God, our President and THE PLAN.  Rejoice now in VICTORY.  Do not worry.  Do not be afraid.  THERE IS A PLAN.  IT IS A GOOD PLAN.  IT IS BEING EXECUTED — and it will not fail.Many Anons followed suit, including some of the most prominent QAnon-related accounts on social media. They began to share disinformation surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Some pushed doctored videos and fake stories about ballot stuffing, while others propagated hashtags such as Stop the Steal, as well as the alleged ballot “watermarks” conspiracy theory.Everything happens for a reason and It’s far from over.@realDonaldTrumpis still the current sitting President of the United States of America. That alone with Election Fraud in plain sight (America is Watching) in lock-step with MSM, I can guarantee you Justice will prevail.pic.twitter.com/z2qKiUu1fA— QAnon Report ⭐⭐⭐ ?? (@QAnon_Report)November 8, 2020The QAnon accounts pushing Trump’s disinformation campaign were not limited to the United States. Amazing Polly, arguably the most outspoken QAnon supporter in Canada, has beenactively pushing the election fraud narrativeon Twitter. Polly, who appears to live in Ontario, is also a vehement anti-vaxxer and believes that COVID-19 was a planned event that helped enable a globalist coup—a claim sheadmits she inheritedfrom far-right conspiracy-monger Alex Jones.There was also a significant amount of Q-related activity from European followers of the movement, primarily in Germany, Italy, and France, as well as the United Kingdom. It has primarily been embraced by conservatives and the far-right, many of whom view Trump as a potential savior from leaders such as Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Emmanuel Macron.As Anons continued to amplify unfounded claims of widespread election fraud, some viewed the election aftermath as a renewed call to action. Philadelphiapolice arrested two armed men on Thursday Nov. 5, who were targeting the Convention Center where vote-counting was taking place. The two men were found in a Hummer with adecal on the rear window bearing the QAnon slogan WWG1WGA.The arrest is a stark reminder that the FBI has labeled QAnon as apotential domestic terrorism threat. QAnon supporters have beencharged with terrorismfor driving an armored truck to the Hoover Dam and blocking traffic for several hours,faced murder chargesfor the March 2019 slaying of Gambino crime family underboss Frank Cali, andkidnapping chargesafter a QAnon supporter attempted to kidnap one of her children who have been removed from her custody.The potential for violence has not stopped influential Q-adjacent accounts from pushing the election fraud conspiracies on social media. Midnight Rider, another prominent QAnon account with more than half-million followers, has been actively amplifying messages from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Michael Flynn, who served as national security advisor for the first three weeks of Trump’s presidency before resigning.Emboldened by Trump’s defiance and hisadministration’s refusal to concede the election, the accounttweetedon Nov. 11, “Losing never felt so good!”While the QAnon movement has been fueled by despair and denialism in the aftermath of the election, the movement is not without its small victories.Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was declared the winner in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, becoming the first QAnon supporter to win a U.S. House seat. She was followed shortly thereafter by mixed martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz, a fellow QAnon supporter who was elected to Huntington Beach City Council. (Author note: Right Wing Watch covered Ortiz’s campaign, including his support for the QAnon movement,here.)“Q is a patriot, we know that for sure,” Greenesaidin a 2017 video, which has since been deleted. “There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the President to do it.”The congresswoman-elect has spent the last week propagating voter fraud claims and falsely asserting that Trump won the election. She even designed a petition titled “Stop the Biden Steal,” which she hosted on her campaign website. Now the most visible and influential QAnon supporter in American politics, Greene hastargetedeveryone from President-Elect Biden to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while also asserting that her husband’s experience at the ballot box reflects an ongoing “absentee ballot scam.”Joe Biden isn’t President-elect. That’s a media falsehood.We CAN NOT allow CCP Joe to have National Security Briefings with these SERIOUS allegations.The Presidency is not for sale to the Communist Chinese!#BidenCrimeFamilyhttps://t.co/e8n6oRndou— Marjorie Taylor Greene ?? (@mtgreenee)November 12, 2020These prominent accounts are merely a handful of the accounts linked to QAnon that have been flooding hashtags and posts on social media. According to the non-profit research group Advance Democracy, QAnon-related accounts were responsible for approximately 10 percent of the tweets amplifying hashtags such as #StopTheSteal.QAnon followers have also beenspotted at several pro-Trump Stop the Steal rallies, and have joined forces with other far-right groups in promoting the upcoming Million MAGA March in Washington, D.C., on Saturday (aka the March for Trump, Stop the Steal DC). Q followerswill be joined by other MAGA loyalists, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and white nationalist “groypers,” as well as professional conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.By Nov. 12, Anon’s rejoiced at their fabled leader’s return to 8kun. At 9:32 p.m. Eastern Time, Q posted an American flag along with a short message aimed at rallying his digital troops.  “Nothing can stop what is coming. Nothing!” Q wrote.Q followed up with a pair of cryptic posts, which amounted to a series of open-ended questions followed by a link to the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators. While Q’s posts may distract his followers, many of whom are simply relieved that their leader has returned, it remains unclear whether the QAnon fantasy will able to sustain itself over the coming months as the disappointments continue to pile on.Angela MerkelDonald J.

Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign before joining Biden’s 2020 campaign, who will be a senior adviser and the chief spokesperson for Vice President Harris. In addition, Ashley Etienne, a former aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will be Harris’s communications director and Elizabeth Alexander, who worked for Biden while he was in the Senate before serving as his press secretary while he was vice president, will be Jill Biden’s communications director.Psaki, who currently oversees communications for the Biden presidential transition, previously served fortwo years as White House communications director under President Barack Obama, and as State Department spokesperson under then–Secretary of State John Kerry. A graduate of the College of William and Mary, Psaki has also been a CNN commentator and a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.In a tweet, Psaki not only congratulated the members of the new team she will now lead but also pointed out the cultural significance that six of them are working mothers:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.Psaki will not be the first woman to serve as White House press secretary, of course. That distinction goes toDee Dee Myers, who held that position for the first two years of the Bill Clinton administration. More recently, Donald Trump has had aquick succession of three womenin the role: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephanie Grisham, and the current occupant, Kayleigh McEnany. But this is the first time the entire senior team is composed of women.In his announcement, Biden also signaled his desire to have a less combative relationship with the White House press corps (perhaps easier said than done), one that would be in contrast to the highly toxic relationship during the Trump years, which began with Sean Spicerlying about the size of Trump’s inauguration crowdand is ending with McEnany refusing to answer a question from a CNN reporter by saying, “I don’t call on activists.” (That reporter, Kaitlan Collins,respondedby saying, “I’m not an activist and you haven’t taken questions since October 1….

Kim Reynolds has included 41 of Iowa’s 99 counties in her state disaster declaration, according to the Associated Press. Several rivers in the region — including the Missouri and the Mississippi — have swelled to dangerous levels, flooding small towns and breaching more than a dozen levees.Three people have died as a result of the floodwaters and two men in Nebraska have been missing since Thursday, according to the Associated Press.Emergencies have been declared in 74 cities and 65 counties according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, and water levels are expected to rise with more rain expected and snow continuing to melt. According to the National Weather Service, 9 million people across 14 states are still under flood warnings.Vice President Mike Pence is traveling to the Midwest Tuesday to survey the damage in Omaha, Nebraska, where hundreds of homes have been damaged and tens of thousands of acres covered in water, according to the Associated Press.Devastation has been particularly concentrated in eastern Nebraska. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency described the flooding as one of“the most devastating disasters in recent history.”Towns like Fremont have been completely surrounded by water, making relief and rescue efforts particularly challenging.Pilots have been flying supplies in to people who are stranded,according to local media. Video footage from an airplane show fields and roads in the area completely submerged.

297,Top Facebook Exec Refuses to Say Whether Company Amplified Insurrectionists Ahead of January 6,-11.67,35.33,https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2021/10/top-facebook-exec-refuses-to-say-whether-company-amplified-insurrectionists-ahead-of-january-6/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-10,motherjones,25,"In this April 14, 2020 file photo, the thumbs up Like logo is shown on a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Jeff Chiu/APAfter a long, very bad week for Facebook, the company sent one of its top executives, Nick Clegg, to make the rounds on the Sunday shows. Though, he didn’t make things better for the company. Notably, he couldn’t—or wouldn’t—even answer a simple but crucial question: Did Facebook amplify violent rhetoric ahead of the January 6th insurrection?CNN's Dana Bash: ""Did the algorithms that are in place amplify pro-insurrection voices ahead of Jan. 6? Yes or no?""Facebook's Nick Clegg: ""I can't give you a yes or no answer to the individual, personalized feeds that each person uses.""pic.twitter.com/MwLUwiYkLI— Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona)October 10, 2021Former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen recently revealed how the social media giant knew its algorithms could spread hate and misinformation, warning that Facebook chose “profit over safety.” She claimed that the company’s decision to dissolve its civic integrity unit and roll back protections prematurelycontributedto the spread of hate and misinformation that undergirded the insurrection at the US Capitol.But when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Clegg, who is Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, about Haugen’s claims, specifically about how the company’s algorithms boosted content ahead of January 6, he gave a roundabout non-answer. He said that if the company removed Facebook’s current algorithm, which amplifies posts with more “meaningful social interactions,” that would perpetuate “more, not less, hate speech, more, not less, misinformation.”Bash then put him on the spot: “My question is specifically about January 6. Did the algorithms that are in place amplify pro-insurrection voices ahead of January 6th? Yes or no.” “I can’t give you a yes or no answer,” he finally conceded, before pivoting to argue that the responsibility for the insurrection was on “the people who broke the law.”Haugen, who has already testified before Congress, is set to go this Thursday before the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. She has filed numerous complaints to the Securities and Exchanges Commission alleging that Facebook “misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6th insurrection.” She has also called for more oversight of the social media giant, though, as my colleague Ali Breland recentlyargued, even her proposals fall short on the sort of structural overhaul Facebook needs.",1
298,Pregnant health care workers could get Pfizer vaccine after FDA emergency authorization,-0.67,44.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/pregnant-health-care-workers-could-get-pfizer-vaccine-after-fda-panel-votes-for-emergency-authorization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-10,19thnews,25,"A top government panelvoted in favor of granting an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine candidate for people 16 and older, including those who are pregnant — a major step toward administering the first round of COVID-19 immunizations in the United States, and a notable departure from how British regulators addressed the pregnancy question.The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee’s recommendation will now head to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to accept that advice. If the FDA grants emergency authorization, some Americans could start receiving vaccines within a matter of days, and the majority will likely be women.Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are an interim way to make drugs available in crises, but they require less safety and efficacy data than does full government approval. At Thursday’s meeting, government scientists emphasized the need to track the health of people who receive the initial Pfizer vaccines, monitoring both their level of immunity and what kind of adverse reactions they have. Pfizer is planning to seek full government approval next spring, after submitting more vaccine data.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.Still, the authorization has major implications. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines be given to health care workers — particularly those in direct contact with people who have contracted the coronavirus — and residents of nursing homes. State governments will be charged with distributing vaccines to eligible residents. But there won’t immediately be enough vaccines to cover everyone, even in those groups.Women will likely constitute the majority of immediate beneficiaries. About 20 million Americans work in health care, and 75 percent of those workers are women. More than two-thirds of the nation’s 1.3 million long-term nursing home residents are women.Notably, the FDA advisory committee did not explicitly prohibit giving the vaccine to pregnant people otherwise eligible for the vaccine. That leaves open the door for health care workers who are pregnant and breastfeeding during the initial vaccine distribution — an estimated 330,000 people — to get the two-shot regimen when  their states and hospitals receive the vaccine. Pfizer’s large-scale vaccine trial excluded those who were pregnant or breastfeeding.“We have really no data to speak to risks specific to pregnant women or fetuses, but also no data that would warrant a contra-indication to use in pregnancy at this time,” Doran Fink, an FDA deputy director who specializes in vaccines, said at the meeting. “In the interest of allowing women of child-bearing potential who would consider vaccination, who are in the population approved for use under an EUA – they would be free to make their own decision, in conjunction with their health care providers.”During the meeting, government officials acknowledged the particular challenge posed by vaccinating pregnant people, especially those who are more likely to be exposed to the virus through work.“The early indication is there may be a higher risk of preterm delivery for pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared to women without COVID-19, but there’s ongoing efforts to assess those and other pregnancy-related risks,” Aron Hall, a CDC scientist, told the panel.On Thursday, Pfizer said it expected to have data by mid-December about whether animal trials of the vaccine would have negative repercussions on the reproductive system — something known as “reproductive toxicity” — which is an important question for pregnant people taking the vaccine.And though Pfizer excluded pregnant people from enrolling in the study, 23 participants became pregnant during the trial, according to company data. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were in the placebo group.That information isn’t enough to draw larger-scale conclusions. The FDA has required that Pfizer track and submit regular data about how people respond if they get the vaccine while pregnant, including whether they develop any adverse events. The company also intends to launch studies on pregnancy and the vaccine next year.Immediately, it’s likely that states and local health care systems will have to decide how to distribute a limited supply of vaccines. They could determine on their own whether to treat pregnant health care workers as part of the immediate priority immunization group.Medical groups, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option of taking the vaccine. The technology behind Pfizer’s vaccine, messenger RNA, isn’t known to cause special problems for either pregnant people or their fetuses. (Messenger RNA is also the basis for the Zika vaccine.)In anop-ed published this weekat Stat News, three medical ethicists argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option to take any early vaccine, factoring in their risk of on-the-job COVID exposure.“A restrictive policy would not only deny pregnant and lactating individuals the opportunity to work with the same protection afforded their co-workers, but would further strain available human health resources over the next few months, when pandemic cases — and the need for health care — are peaking,” the authors wrote.",2

301,Computer hackers stole thousands of Lightfoot administration emails. Here’s a look at some of what they leaked online.,0.0,43.67,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-lightfoot-administration-hacked-emails-closer-look-20210514-havyv352lfegrklmfi76a25wfi-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-05-14,chicagotribune,25,"Hackers recently stolea cache of thousands of city of Chicago emailsthat were electronically transferred from Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to the Jones Day law firm.City officials have declined to comment on individual hacked emails: “Reporting on materials compromised during a third-party vendor data transfer makes all of us less safe and encourages future bad actors to use nefarious means to gain information.”The hacked emails, now visible online, were sent or received by four former city employees over a two-year period and offer some insight into the inner-workings of the Lightfoot administration — how some decisions are made, who was involved and what they were thinking.Here’s a closer look:‘Crap spot is putting it mildly, dude’Some of the emails show Lightfoot advisers were at times stuck between the mayor and their own ideas on certain issues. One example of the administration’s internal decision making involved Lightfoot’s campaign promise of imposing civilian oversight on Chicago’s police department.As a candidate,Lightfoot promised to pass a police oversight plan during her first 100 days in officebut she has not yet introduced a proposal. Lightfoot has sincebacked awayfrom a plan endorsed by the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability, thatshe once supported.Following last summer’s civil unrest spurred by the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, political consultant Joanna Klonsky emailed top staff members just before 5 p.m. on Saturday, May 30. She said the mayor had requested a resolution condemning Floyd’s death and calling for justice.Lightfoot officials began drafting the resolution over the weekend. At one point during the flurry of correspondence that followed, policy chief Dan Lurie said such a resolution should have a policy attached to it, not just words, or it might set the “wrong tone otherwise.”Lurie said the mayor’s office should include a civilian oversight proposal, and askedformer Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Susan Leefor her thoughts. “We cannot include GAPA,” she responded.Lurie said it’s the “obvious policy response” that “everyone will ask” about, so a failure to commit on the issue in a resolution “might actually fail on votes and public opinion at the same time.”“We can say something vague about committing to the value of more civilian oversight but nothing specific about GAPA,” Lee countered.In response, Lurie said: “OK. Realize you’re in a crap spot Susan. Just voicing concern that this might not help things. But know she asked for it so I’m cool sending it on with addition of some oversight language.”Her answer: “Crap spot is putting it mildly, dude.”On the evening of June 2, Lightfootgave a televised speechfrom her City Hall office and promised to implement a series of long-stalled police reforms, some of which had been languishing for years.Sign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekday afternoons.“It is essentially dead”The “crap spot” email isn’t the first time the topic of moving forward with a proposal on civilian police oversight came up in the emails.In March 2020, Lee asked Lightfoot’s chief of staff Maurice Classen about the civilian oversight plan once supported by Lightfoot.“What should we do with GAPA? I know there is no bandwidth for this but if we don’t do this in April, it is essentially dead for 2020 and probably 3 more years,” Lee wrote ahead of the April 2020 City Council meeting.“Not all deadlines are created equal.”How to respond to a federal consent decree which requires an overhaul of the Chicago Police Department, is an ongoing issue at City Hall. Officialsare often faulted for failing to meet deadlinesthough the city emphasizes it’s improving.In one exchange between former deputy corporation counsel Caryn Jacobs and former Lightfoot deputy press secretary Pat Mullane, Jacobs took issue with the proposed plan to steer the narrative on efforts to catch up on missed consent decree deadlines. Jacobs suggested downplaying the deadline response issue.“Why would we emphasize the 55% failure rate? We want move away from these kinds of metrics. Indeed, in talking points that I wrote for the police, we say that not all deadlines are created equal,” she wrote.‘Indoor dining’Early in the pandemic, Lightfoot and Governor J.B. Pritzker repeatedly clashed in private on COVID-19 mitigation measures.They mostly presented a unified front in public. Behind the scenes, however, Lightfoot’s City Hall team last summer considered defying Pritzker’s indoor dining ban. Top staff members even scheduled a meeting to discuss how such a move would play out.“There has been some discussion that the City should permit indoor dining in restaurants, even if otherwise prohibited under state order. The purpose of this call is to discuss what it would mean for the City to do so and how this would be operationalized,” one staffer wrote in June 2020 to top-ranking Lightfoot administration officials.The plan never came to fruition butLightfoot was publicly critical of the governorwhen he closed indoor dining again in the fall.“I am very, very focused on getting our restaurants reopened. If we look at the various criteria that the state has set, we are meeting most if not all of those. So that’s a conversation that I will have with the governor,” Lightfoot said at a June news conference about the city’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution sites. “But I want to get our restaurants and our bars reopened as quickly as possible.”‘Reforming these communities’One of former corporation counsel Mark Flessner’s top deputies, Caryn Jacobs, was asked to weigh in on a statement about the mayor’s position on aspects of police accountability and curbing violence in communities. In her note, she commented on “reforming these communities.”“I actually agree with the idea of reforming these communities. God knows values such as intact families, education, work ethic, religion, etc. are the building blocks of success in all societies,” she wrote. “As young people, we think this is old fashioned. As we mature, we see it is not only true, but that the alternatives lead to chaos.”gpratt@chicagotribune.comTwitter@royalpratt",1
302,Geography and money will be key as Marshall and Bollier vie for Senate seat in Kansas,2.67,43.67,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article244743007.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,kansascity,17,"Republican Rep. Roger Marshalldefeated former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobachin Tuesday’s GOP Senate primaryby dominating Wichita and his political home base of western Kansas.The results suggestDemocratic nominee Barbara Bollierfaces a steep challenge in limiting Marshall’s support in the state’s largest city. Staying competitive in Wichita is likely crucial for Bollier to have a shot at becoming the first Kansas Democrat to serve in the U.S. Senate since the 1930s.Both sides scrambled Wednesday to set the terms of the fight. Republicans had expected a close primary race, but Marshall instead easily dispatched Kobach on Tuesday night.“I think we’ll have the resources to protect our fort and build out our territory,” Marshall said in an interview Wednesday. “Tell our story of a fifth generation farm kid who became a first generation college student … I think when we share that story it resonates.”But Marshall, a Great Bend OB-GYN, received softer support in the Kansas City area, offering Bollier a potential weakness to exploit.Bollier, a state senator and retired anesthesiologist from Mission Hills, said Tuesday voters want someone with “common sense and a voice of reason.” She moved swiftly Wednesday to intensify her outreach to Republicans, releasing a new ad with Tom Moxley, a former Republican state lawmaker and rancher from Council Grove in central Kansas.“I have never voted for a Democrat for U.S. Senate in my lifetime,” Moxley says in the ad. “But I’m going to vote for Barbara Bollier.”Bollier, who didn’t face a competitive primary,has been a fundraising machine.She has set records for Kansas Democrats and her campaign said Tuesday she is heading into the general election with $4.5 million on hand compared to Marshall’s roughly $1 million as of mid-July.“After an expensive and bruising primary, Marshall will face a formidable opponent in Dr. Barbara Bollier, who has been building a strong grassroots campaign, a broad coalition of support, and a massive resource advantage for the general election,” said Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Democrats.Still, Republicans believe their party, which holds a significant registration advantage over Democrats, will quickly unite around Marshall.“As of today Barbara Bollier has a lot more money than Roger Marshall does, but Roger Marshall has a lot more voters. It is much easier for Roger Marshall to get a lot more money in the next 90 days than it is for Barbara Bollier to get a lot more voters. And the person who finishes with the most voters wins,” said David Kensinger, who has managed statewide campaigns for Sen. Pat Roberts and former Gov. Sam Brownback.With all precincts reporting, Marshall had 40% of the vote to Kobach’s 26%. Advance mail-in ballots may trickle in the rest of the week, but Marshall’s margin of victory was greater than the number of ballots that may be received.Statewide, Marshall won 158,486 votes as of Tuesday in the 11-candidate GOP primary, deflecting super PACs and rival campaigns that spent millions in attacks ads. Bollier won 152,891 votes in a Democratic primary rout against an opponent, Robert Tillman, who spent less than $3,200 in the race.Marshall won every county but one west of Emporia, taking some with an outright majority. In Sedgwick County, where Wichita is located, he trounced Kobach 47 percent to 26 percent.“If you look at that map, west of Topeka is Marshall country,” Marshall said. “I think we’re the favorite, but we’re going to have to have a good plan and execute it really well.”Marshall won Johnson County, the state’s most populous, but by a narrower margin: 33% to Kobach’s 25%. He lost Wyandotte County and most other eastern counties.The weaker GOP support for the congressman in those areas may offer Democrats an opportunity. But many Kobach supporters will still likely show up in November to vote for Marshall. Bollier will also have to work to limit Marshall’s support in Sedgwick County.Chris Pumpelly, a Wichita-based Democratic consultant, said Bollier will have to follow Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s model and invest time and resources in the Wichita area. Kelly, previously a Topeka state senator, won the governor’s office in 2018 in part by winning Sedgwick County.“To be successful, Sen. Bollier has to follow the path that has already been established, investing in Sedgwick County, driving out turnout in Democratic areas and Democratic women,” said Pumpelly, who worked on Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple’s successful 2019 campaign. “I’m confident her team has the experience and wisdom to do that.”He said Bollier’s message focused on the pandemic will resonate in Wichita.“I think that Wichitans, especially, are feeling a lot of the pain of what’s going on in the economy with our aviation taking a hit,” he said. “What Dr. Bollier needs to do is speak in the language of authenticity … of compassion.”The Kansas Democratic Party on Wednesday previewed how it plans to attack Marshall this fall, releasing a memo labeling the race a “contest between polar opposites.” It highlights Marshall’s health care voting record and accuses him of failing to protect Kansas farmers during the United States’ trade war with China — suggesting Democrats will try to cut into Marshall’s rural support.Republicans will mine Bollier’s voting record for lines of attack. Kobach told reporters before polls closed Tuesday that while Bollier will paint herself as a moderate former Republican, she has taken a “radically left” position on many issues. He called her “radically pro-abortion.”“So the task for Republicans is going to be very quickly to educate voters about her votes. It’s a very issue-based campaign, not a personal attack,” Kobach said.Bollier said she will always support the right of people to have a private physician-patient relationship. Legislators don’t belong in that relationship, she said.“I also have always represented my constituents well and that’s why they kept electing me. So his word choice wouldn’t ring true,” Bollier said. “I have been about the majority of the people and what they’ve wanted in the state.”This story was originally publishedAugust 5, 2020, 1:02 PM.",1

304,Here's why you should wear a mask even after getting COVID-19 or the vaccine,0.0,46.67,https://www.cnet.com/health/why-you-should-wear-a-mask-even-after-getting-covid-19-or-the-vaccine/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnet-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,cnet,25,"This month, thePfizerandModerna vaccines were authorizedby the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in the US. Since Dec. 14, theCOVID-19 vaccinedoses have started being administered throughout the states. If you think that after you receiveboth doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, you won't have to worry aboutwearing a maskor social distancing, think again.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it's important tocontinue following the protection guidelines in placewhile experts learn more about the protection theCOVID-19 vaccinesprovide, the possibility of vaccinated people continuing to spread the disease and more about immunity and reinfection if someone has recovered from COVID-19.Here's what health experts and the CDC have to say about why you need to continue wearing a mask and social distancingafter you get the COVID-19 vaccine.COVID-19 vaccines are safe, even without long-term dataThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines come in two doses -- the first shot starts building protection, while the second shot is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer against thecoronavirus,according to the CDC.The first shot has beenproven to be highly effective, Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer of Wexner Medical Center, told CNET. He said the second dose amplifies the protection and will extend the life of immunity.After you receive the second shot, your body needs time to build the protection needed to fight the virus. It could take up to two weeks foryour COVID-19 vaccineto begin protecting you against the coronavirus,according to the CDC. During that time, it's important to keep yourself and those around you safe by continuing to socially distance and wear a mask when around people outside your household.You may not get full protection from the coronavirus right away.Because the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are both so new, there's not enough evidence at this point to know if people can still carry the coronavirus pathogens and pass them along to others without being infected themselves.""This gives enough time for the virus to grow in the respiratory passages and spread the infection to others, all while the body is fighting its own infection, aided by the vaccine,"" Gonsenhauser told CNET.There's a lack of data that shows whether or not a vaccinated individual canspread the virus after becoming infected, and a person could potentially be anasymptomatic carrier, he added.""While the vaccine is highly effective, there's still a slim chance -- 5 to 10% -- that after someone gets vaccinated, they could become infected,"" Gonsenhauser said. However, more data could become available as scientists and doctors learn more about the effects of the vaccine on COVID-19.COVID-19 reinfection: Can you get the coronavirus more than once? What we know so farUntil experts fully understand the protection a COVID-19 vaccine provides, it's important to continue wearing a mask and following social distancing protocols,the CDC says. This can help prevent the coronavirus spread among communities of people until more of the population is vaccinated against the coronavirus.Wearing a mask is ""adding on the protection of the vaccination,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy,said Dec. 14 on a CBS radio affiliate. The CDC says that together, wearing a face mask and getting vaccinated willoffer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19.""The immune response, including duration of immunity, to COVID-19 is not yet understood,""the CDC says.More research is needed to determine how likely you are to get reinfected, andthe CDC says""it's not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.""The defenses the body gains against the virus during and after infection seem to fade relatively quickly, making it difficult to achieveherd immunityover a longer period of time,according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former professor of Harvard Medical School who is renowned for his work on thehuman genome and HIV/AIDS.""The bigger concern is someone becoming reinfected with the same variant of COVID-19, not getting sick themselves, but still being contagious to others. You can get infected twice and be asymptomatic the second time around, and still carry it and transmit it to other more vulnerable people around you,""said John V. Williams, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh.So far, there have been very few cases ofreinfection of the coronavirus. In fact, reported cases of reinfection with COVID-19 remain rare,according to the CDC. However, if COVID-19 is like other types of coronaviruses, such as the common cold, reinfection will become more prevalent as time goes on,according to Scientific American.Reinfection of COVID-19 is a possibility.It's going to take months or longer for enough of the population to be vaccinated to start seeing case numbers go down substantially. Therefore, it's important to continue wearing masks whenever you're around people outside your household.""If after getting vaccinated, people stop wearing their masks, other people who haven't been vaccinated could start thinking masks aren't necessary anymore,"" Gonsenhauser said of social behavior. If those unvaccinated people have the virus, they can spread it faster by not wearing a mask.COVID-19 vaccine card is not an immunity passport. Here's the differencePeople in smaller groups are less likely to wear masks when together,according to a Vox surveyfirst published in November. Thirty two percent of respondents said they don't wear a mask when attending a sit-down gathering.""Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives,""the World Health Organization says. If 95% of the public wears a mask, tens of thousands of lives could be saved,according to a Nature Medicine studyfrom October.Despite theCOVID-19 vaccines being proven safe, some Americans may avoid vaccination. Incorrectcoronavirus vaccine mythsand other misinformation have falsely claimed that the vaccine will include government-tracking microchips or be forcefully administered by the military. This is not true.Some may be wrongly concerned that the vaccine was developed too quickly to be safe. Both vaccines in the US haveundergone extensive clinical trialsand have been proven to be 94% and 95% effective, well over the 90% efficacy threshold required.While a vaccine won't completely stop the pandemic in its tracks, it's the direct route toherd immunity. However, in order to get there, more people will need to get the coronavirus vaccine. And, due to a limited number of doses, not everyone is able to get the coronavirus vaccine all at once. In fact,depending on which group you're in, you may be waiting until at least April to get the vaccine,according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert -- if not later.If a significant portion of the population refuses to take the vaccine, we will likely not see numbers of new cases decrease as rapidly as we'd like, says Gonsenhauser. He says he and other medical providers are doing everything they can to remind peoplehow safe the vaccine is-- from bringing relatable and accessible information to communities who have different oppositions to distrust the vaccine, to help them make better-informed decisions.Some people may think it's okay not to wear a mask after getting COVID-19.Currently, there's not enough information at this time to determine if or when the majority of the population can safely stop wearing masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus,the CDC says, but it will likely come down to the numbers.When there are enoughobservable changes, such as cases dropping and the threat levels of community spread sharply falling. When that happens, medical experts can redetermine the need for mask-wearing. However, it could be well into 2021 before that happens.""We would need to see a dramatic decrease in the number of new cases per 100,000 of the population after enough vaccines have been administered,"" Gonsenhauser said.For more information, here are theCOVID-19 vaccine side effects and what we know so far, andhidden medical charges you could encounter after getting the vaccine. Also,here's where you can get the COVID-19 vaccine when it's your turn.",2
305,Some Texas Democrats ready to walk as GOP digs in on voting,-5.0,45.0,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-texas-voting-c05ff78698d843674ec917085f6cc6da,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,apnews,25,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The possibility of Texas Democrats staging a second walkout to again stop one of America’s most restrictive new voting measures grew louder Saturday, as hundreds of people waited hours to rail against the GOP’s plan in the largest turnout this year at the state Capitol.As Republicans made clear they intended this weekend to advance a new election bill — which would prohibit 24-hour polling places, ban drop boxes and stop drive-thru voting — some Democratswho broke quorumin May are now describing it as their best, if not only, option again.Texas is among several states with GOP-controlled statehouses where Republicans have rushed to enact strict voting laws in response to former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. A second walkout by Texas Democrats would mark a high-stakes escalation of their efforts to deny Republicans a major priority, and in turn, put more pressure on President Joe Bidento act on voting at the federal level.Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic former Texas congressman who isconsidering challenging Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022, said he has already offered help, saying he was ready to raise money “literally to feed and house the legislators” if they go that route.“Should we stick around? Hell no. For what?” Democratic state Rep. Jarvis Johnson said. “There’s nothing being done in earnest. There’s nothing be done with the utmost respect for one another.”For weeks, Democratic leaders in the Texas Househave said they are not ruling out another revolt, but have also expressed hope of weakening the bill during the 30-day special session. Johnson, however, believes a large number of his colleagues are ready to deny Republicans a quorum for a second time, though most continue speaking cautiously.“You may know my next move, but you can’t stop it. You never knew when Mike Tyson was going to throw the uppercut, but you knew he was going to throw it,” he said.Another walkout may merely buy more time: Abbott could keep calling more 30-day special sessions until voting measures are passed. Paychecks for nearly 2,000 Capitol staffers could also be on the line, because Abbott vetoed funding for the legislative branch following Democrats’ late-night walkout. He has signaled he will restore that funding this summer — if lawmakers are around to put a bill on his desk.Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the elected head of the governing body for the county where Houston is located, said Abbott was “extorting” lawmakers to get the legislation passed. Hidalgo said she was would support Democratic legislators breaking quorum again to block the bill’s passage.“It is very important to me to recognize voting rights should be above politics,” Hidalgo said. “We can do that with all manner of issues, but not voting, not democracy.”The last time Texas Democrats left the state to deny a quorum was 2003, when they decamped to Oklahoma and New Mexico to try to block new GOP-drawn voting maps. They were gone more a month, but ultimately, Republicans passed a new redistricting plan.On Saturday, both the House and Senate were expected to advance the revived voting bills, whichno longer includetwo of the most contentious provisions: prohibiting Sunday morning voting, when many Black churchgoers go to the polls, and language that would have made it easier for a judge to overturn elections.Hundreds of opponents packed overflow rooms at the Capitol and waited for hours to testify. It was the biggest turnout against a bill this year in Texas, where COVID-19 concerns have dampened crowds.Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes defended the election proposals as refining and improving the voting process, and said newly added provisions increase early voting hours and provide opportunities to fix rejected ballots.“Your ballot is sacrosanct,” Hughes said. “Everything else in the election process should be bathed in sunshine.”Nacal Tate said she woke up at 4 a.m. to drive from suburban Dallas to Austin to testify against the bill, even though it meant missing her grandniece’s birthday party. She was joined by June Jenkins, president of an NAACP chapter in Collin County.“Hopefully the impact of what we do today will be worth the sacrifice of what we needed to sacrifice,” Jenkins said. “My compromise is to kill it.”Acacia Coronado is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.Report for Americais a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.",2
306,‘Constitutional carry’ comes to Texas. The trend in five charts.,-4.33,44.67,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2021/0602/Constitutional-carry-comes-to-Texas.-The-trend-in-five-charts,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,csmonitor,25,"Soon, most adult Texans will be able to openly carry a handgun in public. No background check or training necessary.It will be a major expansion in gun rights, one that Texas is uncharacteristically late in arriving at. About 20 other states already have “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) laws, including Vermont.Vermont is an outlier, having never regulated gun possessionin its history. It’s legal to carry a concealed handgun in all 50 states, though most require a license, training, and a completed background check. In Texas, for open or concealed carry, residents generally need to pass a written exam and a shooting proficiency test, complete four to six hours of training, and submit their fingerprints.When Texas changes its gun laws, the United States takes notice. But “permitless carry” already has been adopted in 19 other states. What are the effects so far?The new permitless carry law awaiting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature would nix that requirement, essentially making permits – and the training and paper trails that come with them – optional. Only those already barred from carrying a gun would be excluded.It’s one trend in a rapidly changing gun rights landscape. Nineteen of the states with permitless carry adopted the laws in the past decade, due in great part to National Rifle Association lobbying efforts. (Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee thanked the group in atweetafter signing the bill into law.)“Part of it is simply exploiting the fact you have some very conservative state legislatures that are very receptive to this kind of thing,” says Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York, Cortland, who studies gun politics.But other states have been moving in the opposite direction. Liberal states like New York and California have passed new gun control laws – often following high-profile mass shootings – that include banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requiring background checks on all gun sales. President Joe Biden is alsosupportingvarious gun control measures.In that sense, the growth of permitless carry is also “an ideological push in the opposite direction,” says Dr. Spitzer.Handgunlaw.usSupporters of permitless carry argue that it helps protect citizens’ Second Amendment rights and makes the public safer.“Every law-abiding Montanan should be able to defend themselves and their loved ones,” said Gov. Greg Gianforte when he signed Montana’s permitless carry bill into lawin February.But the laws have also conjured up visions of Wild West-era lawlessness, and provoked fears of increased crime and violence. When Oklahoma adopted its constitutional carry law in 2019, local news reported that not much happened afterward, “at least on itsfirst weekend.”Law enforcement officials have publicly opposed permitless carry in many states. The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police did, as didall the county sheriffsin West Virginia. The public, including Republicans and gun owners, also often opposes scrapping permits.In Kansas and Missouri, local law enforcement, government officials, and certified gun trainers told researcherswith the Urban Institutein 2018 they mainly disapproved of permitless carry because training would no longer be required.“Law enforcement was concerned with accidental shootings, or increased firearm thefts if guns are not secured properly,” says Paige Thompson, a researcher at the Urban Institute.“It’s [also] very difficult for them to determine whether someone is ineligible to carry a firearm without a permit because there’s no [state] background check,” she adds, or “background checks for private sales.“DMN/UT Tyler March 2020 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety February 2016 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety March 2019 poll, University of Iowa March-April 2021 pollSo who’s right? Does permitless carry increase safety, or violence? Since the laws are only a few years old, researchers say more time is needed to see if they have a notable effect on public safety.“There hasn’t been much research on permitless carry,” says Andrew Morral, leader of the Gun Policy in America study initiative at the Rand Corp.“Most of the research has been done looking at ‘shall issue’ concealed carry laws versus ‘may issue’ concealed carry laws,” he adds.In “shall issue” states, applicants generally get permits if they meet the requirements. In “may issue” states, meanwhile, law enforcement has some discretion to deny permits to certain individuals. It’s here, where research has been building for decades, that experts are beginning to draw some conclusions.John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has been studying gun policy for decades, says it took about 20 years “before I was able to draw a strong conclusion about the impacts of the laws.”His conclusions, outlined in a2019 paper, include the findings that more permissive gun carry laws are associated with rates of violent crime that are 13% to 15% higher 10 years after adoption. Other research has tied more permissive gun carry laws toincreasedfirearms homicides.For permitless carry laws specifically, crime statistics show little significant change – at least that can be attributed to the laws themselves.Alaska Department of Public Safety, Arizona Department of Public Safety, U.S. Census Bureau“It has been difficult to study [permitless carry law] effects given the short timeline,” says Dr. Spitzer.And to the counterargument, he adds, “there is no evidence that civilian gun carrying has any beneficial effect on suppressing, stopping, or reducing crime.”An analysis of several thousand gun policy studies by the Rand Corp.last yearfound that evidence that concealed carry laws increase homicides and other kinds of violent crime is limited at best, but mostly inconclusive.“The research is improving in this area,” says Dr. Morral. Unfortunately, he adds, “I don’t think the data is improving. In some ways the data is moving backwards.”The FBI, for example,changed the programit uses to collect local crime data this year. The new program will allow for more detailed reporting, but reporting is voluntary. Dr. Morral and othershave concernsthat participation will drop off and there will be less data to study.For now, it’s hard to deliver a conclusive verdict on what effect permitless carry laws have on public safety, if they have an effect at all.Rand surveyed a range of experts – including academics, advocacy groups, and legislative staff – on how adopting permitless carry nationwide could affect public safety, for example.Responses diverged significantly.RAND Gun Policy Outcome ExplorerIn its next term, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case concerning a restrictive New York concealed carry law, its first big Second Amendment case in more than a decade. The court has to date ruled only that the Second Amendment protects having a handgun in the home for self-defense.This casecould see that protection expanded to handgun possession outside the home.The gun rights landscape could thus be poised for even greater change. Whichever direction the statistics and research take, politics will continue to play a powerful role.“Over a considerable period of time, [the evidence] was murky enough that the theoretical arguments against [permissive carry] laws were not powerful enough to stop them,” says Dr. Donohue.“Now the political dynamics are so powerful that even with the evidence becoming more clear, the political dynamics are dominating the best empirical evidence.”",2
307,Medicaid Expansion Has Passed Every Time It’s Been on the Ballot,-12.67,39.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/06/medicaid-expansion-has-passed-every-time-its-been-on-the-ballot/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,washingtonmonthly,25,"It’s never a good idea to put too much stock in issue polls. As we’ve seen time and time again, the wording of the question often determines the outcome. But when it comes to health care—and especially Medicaid expansion—we don’t need polls, because even voters in red states are making it clear that they are not aligned with Republicans.On Tuesday, Missouri became the seventh state to expand Medicaid since Donald Trump was inaugurated. All but one of those states (Virginia) did so by referendum at the ballot box. Youcan nowadd Missouri to the group of orange states on this map.The 53 percent of Missourianswho votedto expand Medicaid probably did so for a variety of reasons, like the fact that an additional 230,000 people will gain insurance coverage, or the fact that a refusal to expand the program has contributed to the closing of 10 rural hospitals in that state since 2014. There’s also this concern:“Quite frankly, Missourians are sick and tired of not getting their fair share. They pay their taxes, they’ve seen now 37 other states use that money to expand access to health care. Meanwhile, our economy’s clearly ailing here,” Jack Cardetti, the campaign’s spokesperson, said last week.As Sarah Kliffexplains, the group that is behind the strategy of putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot is the Fairness Project. So far, they’ve had a massive impact, expanding the program to cover an additional one million low-income Americans. Their next target is Florida, which, if passed, would add coverage for an additional 800,000. Republican governors and legislators have fought these gains every step of the way. But Medicaid expansion has passed whenever it has been put on the ballot.The lesson here is that, even as Trump and Republicans ask the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, their own constituents in red states are telling them that they support a critical element of what that legislation accomplished. A party that actually cared about what American voters want would be paying attention.",1
308,The Only Fact about 9/11 that Really Matters,19.0,24.0,https://amgreatness.com/2021/09/10/the-only-fact-about-9-11-that-really-matters/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-10,amgreatness,25,"Twenty years. A generation.What is left to be said?Haven’t we said it all? The names, the images, the stories of tragedy and heroism.The lives lost, the lives changed forever.God willing, the stories will be told for as long as there is someone to tell them—the individual tales that so encapsulate the things upon which our civilization is founded. The police officer, the firefighter, the chaplain, the office colleague who went back just one more time, the one who ran up the stairwell after the second impact, just to make sure that another innocent life, the life of a stranger, a colleague, a friend, a loved one, was rescued. The stories of those who died, sacrificing their lives in what our Lord and Savior instructed us is the ultimate act of love; “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.”The West—our civilization—is unique and the greatest of all civilizations that have ever existed because it rejects the cultural selfishness of the East, where the collective decides what is of import and the individual is, ultimately, expendable. Likewise it rejects the culture of the Middle East, where all that matters is power, whose tribe or clan is the most feared, or which can destroy the most.Ours is such a peculiar civilization in that it eschews the natural instinct to parochialism and power—jettisoning the seemingly genetically obvious “Me First!” instinct—replacing it with the exhortation “servus,” I am your servant, unto death if necessary. The mere fact that our Christian world’s greatest symbol is the Cross, a barbaric tool of torture and death, is remarkable. The persecuted are the saved. The persecuted are chosen. The persecuted, those marked for death, have already won. Forever.For these reasons, I choose to see the heart of 9/11 this way, as the greatest affirmation since the Civil War of our Christian heritage and the Christian values built into the founding of this, the greatest nation on God’s Earth, peopled by the greatest and most self-sacrificial and grace-filled citizenry in the world. But this should be obvious to anyone who loves America and understands that the West truly is the apotheosis of human culture.But remarkably, there is something missing in the conventional wisdom about September 11, an undeniable fact that the “elite” denied then and, incredibly, denies even more robustly today.Man is fallen. He cannot be “perfected.” Ask anyone who actually lived under a regime which sees as its putative objective, the creation of a “better” man, be it Robespierre’s Paris Commune (a realinsurrection), Lenin’s “Workers’ Paradise,” Mao’s China, or Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge.Man can choose—individually—to fight his innate and basest tendencies, but his natural state has been the same since the first Neanderthal prized his neighbor’s mate or coveted his hunting trophies and killed to obtain them. It matters not where or when it is, Man is always a fallen creature. Ask those herded into the concentration camps of the Balkans less than 30 years ago, or the Yazidi girls sold into sexual slavery by ISIS after Obama so precipitously withdrew our forces from Iraq just a decade ago.And this is the most important lesson on the anniversary of the events from that sunny Tuesday morning 20 years ago. Evil is real. It lurks in the hearts of men, it walks the Earth and will until Judgment Day.It is remarkable to think that 9/11 didn’t forever convince our “betters” of this truth. The imagery of people jumping from the Twin Towers to their deaths, the towers collapsing—the devastation jihadis brought to New York, D.C., and Pennsylvania. But it didn’t. Nor did the manual decapitation on camera of U.S. citizens, the mass murder of Egyptian Christians on the shores of an ISIS-controlled Caliphate, or even the broadcast immolation of a Jordanian pilot captured by those calling themselves warriors for Allah. Yet now we witness those self-same “experts” declare their hope for an inclusive Taliban government that will strive for “legitimacy.” This is worse than cretinism, it is a psychotic level of self-delusion.Evil is real. It walks the Earth today and it must be met with courage and brute force until it is crushed, just as it was when we entered the White House to serve a commander-in-chief who vowed to destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS. Which we did in just five months, despite being told by Obama that it was a “generational threat” which we just had to get used to enduring. And now, just eight months after President Trump left the White House, the jihadis who protected and gave succor to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden not only control Afghanistan, they have $83 billion worth of weapons Biden gave them, as well as new allies who also hate us, including the world’s greatest Communist dictatorship, China.Thanks to delusional, feckless cowards in Washington, there will be another 9/11 and only those who understand thetrue lessonof 20 years ago can save us from it.",0

In September 2020, DeSantis revoked social distancing restrictions for bars and restaurants, while in April he officiallybannedvaccine passports through an executive order which prohibits businesses from requiring proof of Covid-19 vaccination.In May, DeSantis went one step further andannouncedhis intention to pardon everyone in Florida who had been charged with breaking Covid-19 restrictions on face masks and social distancing.Over 38,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Florida since the start of the pandemic, while the US as a whole has recorded over 600,000 deaths – the highest in the world. Cuba, meanwhile, has recorded 1,843 deaths.",0
310,Greg Hansen: Arizona's old way of recruiting didn't work. Maybe Sean Miller's new approach will.,0.0,37.33,https://tucson.com/sports/greghansen/greg-hansen-arizonas-old-way-of-recruiting-didnt-work-maybe-sean-millers-new-approach-will/article_4a88aba6-5f1e-5425-bb9b-fcff77d0b7a2.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/arizona-daily-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,tucson,25,"Take your pick for college basketball 2020-21: Remy Martin or Alex Barcello? As Arizona State football coach Herm Edwards would say “Hello?”In the Rivals150 Prospect Rankings of 2017, Arizona point guard signee Barcello (No. 118) was ranked ahead of Martin (No. 128), who is an AP preseason All-American and has become the presumptive Pac-12 MVP for the coming season.Barcello averaged 9.3 points per game at BYU last year.Under any author, analyst or group dynamic, college basketball’s recruiting rankings are imprecise. Isn’t that a much gentler term than, say, “full of holes?”Over the last five years, Arizona signed five-star recruit Emmanuel Akot, who was more like a 2½, and five-star guard Justin Simon, who could do everything but shoot, which is like signing a quarterback who couldn’t hit a dump-off pass.Kaleb Tarczewski arrived at Arizona as a five-star center and left as a EuroLeague player. Rawle Alkins was a five-star signee. Once the lights came on at McKale Center, it took about five minutes to realize Alkins lacked the size, scoring ability, ball-handling and general excellence to be anything more than a three-star player. But he did dunk with authority whenever the rim was left unguarded.Unfortunately, ranking 18-year-old basketball players with a star system — one through five — is the best we’ve got. It is more aptly a 2-U system: unreliable and unconvincing.When Duquesne signed point guard T.J. McConnell to the Class of 2010, he was not given a rating byRivals.com, which meant he was a no-star prospect.Wildcats guard T.J. McConnell kisses the floor before leaving it for the last time in the second half during a game against Stanford on March 7, 2015.By the time McConnell played his final game for Arizona in 2015, he was one of the few who reached a five-star level under Sean Miller. It wasn’t the star system that mattered; it was that McConnell was a winner — an achiever — in a category with some of the previous hugely underrated Wildcats such as Jud Buechler, Steve Kerr and Solomon Hill.It is under such qualifications that I report Arizona’s men’s basketball Class of 2021 is, in an Arizona context, historically low.Worrisome? Yes. Since the evaluators/scouts atRivals.combegan their ranking system 19 years ago, Arizona’s Class of 2021 is rated lower than any previous UA team in the Pac-12.And don’t forget that Arizona’s three signees all basically play the same position — shooting guard. Arizona and most schools already have them in excess.Arizona’s recruiting class is ranked No. 27 nationally byRivals.com. That’s not a colossal failure, but it is sixth in the Pac-12 and, as Miller likes to say, not “Arizona good.” As I researched two decades ofRivals.comrankings, I cannot find another Arizona team ranked worse than No. 3 in the league.The Pac-12’s 2021 rankings are a jolt of reality to many UA fans. The top half looks like this:1. Oregon (seventh nationally);2. Stanford (12th);3. UCLA (15th);4. Colorado (19th);5. USC (20th);6. Arizona (27th).Not only that, the Wildcats don’t have a player ranked in the Pac-12’s top nine. The conference’s 10 highest-rated players are these guys:1. Harrison Ingram, Stanford (ninth nationally);2. Peyton Watson, UCLA (17th);3. Nathan Bittle, Oregon (19th);4. Isael Silva, Stanford (26th);5. Will McClendon, UCLA (37th);6. Reese Dixon-Waters, USC (49th);7. Lawson Levering, Colorado (57th);8. Quincy Allen, Colorado (68th);9. Jackson Grant, Washington (71st);10. Shane Dezonie, Arizona (84th).More? Gonzaga has two players ranked higher than Dezonie, according toRivals.com.Do what you want with this data, but there’s a growing feeling that Arizona’s decline in recruiting can be traced to the September 2017 morning when the FBI knocked on the doors of Miller and assistant coach Book Richardson and began a reputation-staining investigation into the UA’s recruiting practices.According toRivals.com, the UA’s Class of 2020 — players who are college freshmen today — included just one of the Pac-12’s 10 leading recruits: guard Dalen Terry, who was ranked No. 51 nationally. The list begins with USC’s Evan Mobley, Stanford’s Zaire Williams, ASU’s Joshua Christopher and the Sun Devils’ Marvin Bagley.That’s right, two Sun Devils. That hasn’t happened since the 1970s.It follows another unusually low-ranked UA Class of 2018, led by No. 34 Brandon Williams, which put him behind Oregon’s Bol Bol and Louis King and USC’s Kevin Porter. Williams was the only Wildcat in the Pac-12’s top 10 in the Class of ’18.Brandon Williams averaged 11.4 points per game for UA in the 2018-19 season, then spent last year wearing street clothes to Wildcats home games after having surgery for his longtime knee issue.Miller was surely the first to understand Arizona’s recruiting influence has diminished in the United States. He creatively went to Europe and, with the clock ticking, brought in prospects from Estonia, Turkey, France and Lithuania.Those prospects are not routinely rated by the American recruiting services, or at least not with much accuracy. Lauri Markkanen, for example, was given a four-star ranking once he appeared on the UA’s Class of 2016 list. That was below Arizona’s five-star recruits Alkins, Simon and Terrence Ferguson. And Ferguson chose not to play college basketball.Oops.Miller has tried to combat the lack of an Arizona-good freshman class by being one of the most prolific coaches in the transfer market, acquiring Nevada’s Jordan Brown, Georgetown’s James Akinjo, Seattle’s Terrell Brown and Kentucky’s Jemarl Baker.The only trouble with that is Miller’s previous transfers have mostly been fill-out-the roster types: Stone Gettings, Ryan Luther, Chase Jeter, Max Hazzard, Justin Coleman, Dylan Smith and Mark Tollefsen.Many fans are seduced by anyone Miller recruits, whether it be a big man from Duke or a point guard from Alabama. But as much as anyone in college basketball, Arizona has found that the quality of the transfer pool is often strained.To his credit, Miller recognized that the “old way” of roster management in college basketball was no longer sustainable. The one-and-dones, the two-and-outs and the quick-to-transfer players impacted Arizona as much as any school in the country.So Miller has gone mostly to Europeans and to transfers. Some of his critics will be pleased to know that the three players in Arizona’s Class of 2021 — Shane Nowell, K.J. Simpson and Dezonie — do not appear to be one-and-done prospects bound for early entry to the NBA. For the past few seasons, critics have implored Miller to recruit those who will stick in the program for three or four years.More Christian Kolokos and fewer Stanley Johnsons.More Nick Johnsons and fewer Nico Mannions.At its highest level, college basketball in 2020 requires a new model of roster management. While the UA’s Class of 2021 is ranked below nontraditional powers Colorado and Stanford, it is a move in a new direction. And that’s good.The UA has won just two NCAA Tournament games since 2015.

311,‘I’m Not Changing My Mind’: New York Fires Unvaccinated Health-Care Workers,-3.67,45.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/new-york-fires-unvaccinated-health-care-workers.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-09-30,nymag,25,"On Tuesday morning, hours after New York’svaccine mandate for health-care workerswent into effect, Deborah Conrad was pretty sure she’d lost her job. The 46-year-old physician’s assistant, who works at United Memorial Medical Center in Batavia, has refused to get the shot and was one of tens of thousands of unvaccinated New Yorkers whose employment hung in the balance after the state’s order went into effect at midnight. Conrad’s co-worker told her she was no longer on the schedule for next week and her email seemed to have been shut off.“I’m assuming I am no longer employed. It’s my understanding that there is no notice or letter going out,” said Conrad. A spokesperson from Rochester Regional Health, the system that operates Conrad’s hospital, said that 99 percent of its employees had complied with the mandate, but did not respond to questions about firings. Conrad said that she would not let the mandate influence her decision not to get the shot. “A lot of people I work with felt forced into getting vaccinated. But I’m not changing my mind. I’m not better off than any of them, I just feel very strongly.”On Wednesday,Governor Kathy Hochul’s office indicated that a major crisis had been averted at hospitals, some of which prepared for a staff shortage. In a press release, the governor’s office said no facility has closed because of the requirement. Catholic Health system in Western New York postponed a number of elective surgeries on Monday while it assessed its staffing levels, but by the end of the day the system had achieved 100 percent compliance with the mandate, according to a spokesperson for the network, and dodged being short-staffed. On Thursday, Albany Medical Centertold Spectrum Newsit closed two emergency urgent care centers temporarily in order to reallocate staff to its main campus.The state’s largest health care employer, Northwell Health, was the first to confirm that it had fired about two dozen managers on Monday for not getting the shot. While Northwell, which employs 76,000 people statewide, has begun the process of firing the rest of its unvaccinated staff, it would not provide numbers on just how many workers it would lose. Erie County Medical Center had suspended about five percent of its hospital workforce, or 176 employees, in addition to 100 staff members at its long-term care facility. The employees will have 30 days to comply with the mandate before they are fired, according to a spokesperson. Hochul has said that health care workers fired for refusing thevaccinewill not be eligible for unemployment insurance without a valid accommodation signed by a doctor.Hochul had declared a state of emergency and said that she would deploy National Guard troops with medical training to help at hospitals across the state Monday night, if necessary. After a last-minute surge that inoculated 3,000 public hospital employees, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that roughly 10 percent of the city’s public-hospital workforce, or about 5,000 people, remained unvaccinated and were not allowed to work. (On Monday, a federal appeals court ruled that the city’smandatefor nearly all public-school employees can proceed. De Blasio gave themuntil the end of the day on Friday to get at least one dose of the vaccine or else they would be suspended without pay come next week.)The state’s mandate has seemed to push up vaccination rates. Statewide 87 percent of hospital workers have received at least one dose, up from 84 percent last week, but lower than the governor’s initial estimate of 92 percent. Nursing homes, however, did hit 92 percent compliance, up from 70 percent when the mandate was first announced in August. Staff at home care and hospice need to be vaccinated by October 7 or else they too will face termination.While most states have resisted implementing mandates, health-care workers in Rhode Island, Oregon, Maine, and Washington, D.C., are also now required to be vaccinated. On Monday, a hospital system in Delaware said that it had fired 150 people for not complying, according to the. Novant Health hospital system in North Carolina said that it had fired 175 employees, according to theAssociated Press.New York’s health-care mandate is facing at least eight lawsuits. Last week a federal judge in Utica issued a temporary restraining order that allowed health-care workers with religious exemptions to continue working until at least October 12. Jillian Dobrzenski, a 34-year-old nurse at Catholic Health, is among those who have a religious exemption, but said that her choice to remain unvaccinated was based on a range of factors, including that she had COVID last December. If the religious exemption isn’t extended beyond October 12, Catholic Health said unvaccinated employees will be placed on unpaid leave for 30 days, after which their employment will be terminated.“I’m not ready to not be a nurse anymore and this would basically eliminate me from being a nurse in the entire state,” Dobrzenski said. “We would probably be okay on savings for at least a handful of months. After that, I already have an RN license to work in the state of Florida and it looks more and more each day like we’ll probably end up selling our house and moving.”By submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us.",2
312,AOC and Squad prepare resolution to block Biden selling $735 million worth of bombs to Israel,-8.0,44.33,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9597317/AOC-Squad-prepare-resolution-block-Biden-selling-735-million-worth-bombs-Israel.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,dailymail.co.uk,25,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezand Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, are preparing to introduce a resolution that would blockJoe Biden's $735 million sale of bombs to Israel during the growing conflict with Hamas.It is part of The Democratic Squad's effort to put increasing pressure on Biden in his response in dealing the violence which has lasted 10 days and killed more than 200 people.An early draft of the joint resolution of disapproval (JRD) wasobtained by Jewish Currentsand is co-sponsored by Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, the two other squad membersIlhan Omarand Ayanna Pressley, as well as Representatives Mark Pocan, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Pramila Jayapal and Betty McCollum.'At a time when so many, including our President, support a ceasefire, we should not be sending 'direct attack' weaponry to Prime Minister Netanyahu to prolong this violence. It is long past time to end the US policy of unconditional military arms sales, particularly to governments that have violated human rights,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an email calling on her congressional colleagues to support her bill.The squad-backed resolution would halt the transfer and sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Small Diameter Bombs from the U.S. to Israel. Both bombs are outfitted with special guidance systems intended to hit specific targets.They announced their move on the day Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he wanted a 'significant de-escalation' and said he wanted an eventual ceasefire.But Netanyahu defied Biden's request and said he would continue attacking Hamas.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  (left), Rashida Tlaib (right) and other Democrats will introduce a resolution that would block Joe Biden's $735 million sale of bombs to Israel in the midst of their growing conflict with HamasBiden held an intense, nearly eight-minute conversation with Tlaib on the tarmac in Dearborn, Michigan on Tuesday. She criticized Biden's response to the conflict and said US-bought explosives shouldn't be used on schoolsOn Tuesday, Tlaib confronted Biden when he landed in Dearborn, Michigan for a tour of a Ford plant.'Palestinian human rights are not a bargaining chip and must be protected, not negotiated,' Tlaib told him, according to her congressional office.'The U.S. cannot continue to give the right-wing Netanyahu government billions each year to commit crimes against Palestinians,' she continued, an aide told NPR.Israel used JDAMs and Small Diameter Bombs in its recent attack on Gaza.It's unlikely, however, that the resolution will pass the 51-member committee, which includes a number of pro-Israel legislators on both sides of the political aisle.On Monday, a report from unnamed sources revealed the U.S. approved a week before the conflict broke out a $735 million weapons deal that included the precision-guided missiles.Omar, the first Muslim woman elected to Congress and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, blasted the deal with Israel, who is a top recipient of U.S. military aid.'It would be appalling for the Biden administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians,' the Minnesota representative in a statement.'If this goes through this will be seen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at brokering a ceasefire,' she continued.A report revealed the deal was approved a week before the conflict in the Middle East broke out, but the sale of the weapons produced by Boeing in the U.S. still needs congressional approvalOmar said Washington shouldn't 'stand idly by while crimes against humanity are being committed with our backing.'The arms deal has to make it through congressional review before it is finalized.A group of 28 Democratic lawmakers, led by Jewish Congressman Jon Ossoff of Georgia are calling for a ceasefire to 'prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence'.The conflict so far, which has seen a barge of bombs between the two nations, has killed over 200 people and sparked a humanitarian crisis.After reports emerged of the sale and as the conflict with Israel and Hamas escalated, Biden held a phone call Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.According to a readout of the call, Biden justified Israel's actions as self defense.'The President reiterated his firm support for Israel's right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks. The President welcomed efforts to address intercommunal violence and to bring calm to Jerusalem,' the readout states.'He encouraged Israel to make every effort to ensure the protection of innocent civilians. The two leaders discussed progress in Israel's military operations against Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza. The President expressed his support for a ceasefire and discussed U.S. engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end.'Israel argues it has only sent bombs into Palestinian territories where it feels it has evidence Hamas is operating – including in a media building leveled by an Israeli airstrike.A rocket fired from Gaza which landed on a road near Ad Halom just outside Ashdod on Wednesday. There were no injuries reportedIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gestures as he shows a slideshow during a briefing to ambassadors to Israel at a military base in Tel Aviv on WednesdayRelatives of Palestinian Hassan Salem, who was killed during an israeli raid on west Gaza City, mourn during his funeral on May 19, in Gaza City, GazaEarlier on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he'd seen no evidence Hamas was operating in the Gaza-based building, even though Netanyahu said they showed Biden 'smoking gun' evidence.According to the call, Biden stopped short of calling for an 'immediate' cease-fire.The readout concluded 'the two leaders agreed that they and their teams would remain in close touch.'Biden's statement came the same day Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell mocked efforts to apply equal pressure on Israel and Hamas.'To say that 'both sides' need to de-escalate downplays the responsibility the terrorists have for initiating this conflict in the first place, and suggests Israelis are not entitled to defend themselves against on-going rocket barrages. I completely reject this obscene moral equivalence,' McConnell said.IfNotNow, Center for Constitutional Rights, Friends Committee on National Legislation, Jewish Voice for Peace, Churches for Middle East Peace, and Defense for Children International–Palestine are all backing the progressive lawmakers' attempt to block the bomb sale.",2

We’ve seen it countless times. But the latest stunt was caught on video and it’s absolutely hilarious.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was caught pretending to bike to work.As a leftist progressive transportation secretary, it was apparently important for him to appear to care about eco-friendly transportation, so he thought it would look really good for him to be riding his bike to work. Look at him, saving the environment and stuff. He’s been seen several times biking around the capital and received exactly the progressive liberal fawning that he was seeking by his actions.But a video revealed that Buttigieg and his bike werein two armored SUVs, to a location close to his meeting where his security then unloaded the bike from one of the SUVs.

Oscar-worthy political theater.He was hoping people would only notice the part where he showed up on a bike, and then he could boast about his environmentally conscious commute.But what makes this even more hilarious is that while Buttigieg pretended to bike part of the way to work as some righteous eco-friendly publicity stunt,he was still followed the entire way by the two gas-guzzling armored SUVs.Quite literally, him biking for that little bit of his commute wasn’t any more environmentally conscious than if he and his bike and just ridden the entire way in the armored SUVs.But it was great for optics, and that’s all that really matters to the Biden Administration.And it’s just the kind of duplicitous and disingenuous political theater we’ve come to expect from Biden politicians.",0
314,Biden Is Turning America Into the Land of the Freebie,26.33,19.67,https://spectator.org/biden-free-college-democrats-socialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,spectator,23,"With the media proclaiming President Joe Biden to be the new FDR, it’s important to craft the right governing philosophy for him. The answer is simple. The federal government should make real the most simple liberal — excuse me, progressive! — principle. Everything in life should be free. At least, everythingin life should be free.I had this extraordinary revelation while reading the, the repository of all that is wonderful and decent in the nation’s capital.Poststaffer Jen Balderama penned an articleentitled, “Community college saved me. Biden is right: It should be free.” It was an epiphany! I suddenly understood: If even one person benefits from something, it should be free to all. What could be more obvious? What a wonderful life Americans then would have.Why stop at giving away community college education? Consider the movement to eliminate student debt. The Left already is pushing this hard. It involves the same principle, at least for anyone who borrows to pay for a university degree. How foolish I was to work while in school and accept help from my parents to pay for undergrad and law school. Education was good for me. No doubt adding another lawyer to our terribly underserved society was great for the people! Somy schooling should have been free. Why should I have to pay for something just because I chose to do for my benefit? America — and, heck, everyone else on Earth — benefited. Make college free for all.And as much as we want wherever we want. If I feel called to be a permanent student, Washington should make my dream come true. Moreover, if I want to go to Stanford, Harvard, Yale, or some other pricey place, cost should be no object. Indeed, why should I be denied entry by discriminatory “standards” and “qualifications”? Elite schools are part of the racist, elitist, patriarchal, and whatever other evils that apply to structures designed to hold we the people in bondage. All universities should be public, open to all, and free to everyone. Cambridge, here I come!It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free.There’s also child care. Why should people be expected to be responsible for their own kids? Hillary Clinton was wrong to believe that it “takes a village.” That isn’t nearly enough people! Rather, it requires all the smart thinkers in Washington taking and spending everyone else’s money. Progressives believe that having sex and aborting babies are the most — actually, perhaps the only — essential liberties. Government is entitled to promiscuously and routinely interfere in every other human decision. If the intersection of these two fundamental rights unexpectedly leaves a baby alive, then the essential right to economic redistribution kicks in. And everyone else should pay for everything — starting with child care at birth.It is beyond question that health care should be free. Every last procedure. Being healthy is our rightful state, and getting sick isn’t our fault. Even if someone claims that we contributed to the problem — all the outrageousfat-shamingthat goes on after people have a heart attack, for instance! — it shouldn’t be held against us. Personally, I want it all.If a few extra pounds result, there should be some miracle medical procedure to remove a few of them — why should I be denied the chocolate that is necessary to help me determine the meaning of the universe and engage in other essential acts of personhood? My once-bountiful hair appears to be thinning: surely modern medicine can fix that. And it was nice getting the COVID-19 vaccine for free. Why do I have to pay more for aspirin than for a life-saving shot? It all should be free.Similarly, food should be free. We need it to live. And there should be food equality. It’s no one else’s business what we eat. If I prefer a diet of steak and shrimp, what is the problem? If I want caviar, it should be my right. Why should I be denied my preference? Why should rich people get to eat what they want and not me? That is downright unfair. It also is classist. Racist. Sexist. And probably some other evil “-ist”s as well. In my case, being fat is an essential part of who I am — especially eating cashews, chocolate, potato chips, and ice cream. It isn’t fair to deny me such necessities just because some dead white cisgender male living in what once was an empire that oppressed native peoples and allowed slavery claimed something was unhealthy. Food should be provided to everyone, without judgment and free of charge.So should transportation. How are those of us who aren’t Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos supposed to get around? Cars are expensive. Gasoline is expensive. Parking is expensive. We need to go to work (oppressive!) and school. We even have to drive to go out on dates (essential to humankind!). Buy groceries. Vote (early and often!). And organize unions for protest and the socialist masses to overthrow their oppressors.Moreover, gasoline-powered cars are bad for the environment. So mass transit should be everywhere and free. Electric cars should be free. Even taxis for those of us who don’t want to own cars should be free. Though not Uber and Lyft, tools of exploitation against the laboring masses. It is socially unjust to expect people to pay for something as essential as transportation.Housing should be free, too. No one should be denied the home of their choosing. Today poor people suffer in cities while their oppressors live in splendor in surrounding suburbs. Public housing is a good start but doesn’t go nearly far enough. It still allows enormous housing inequality. Why shouldn’t everyone get to live in a house like that owned by Bill Gates? Government should confiscate the existing housing stock and distribute it on a fairer basis. But much more is required. Government should make companies build houses for free for everyone. Make rich corporations give back to the community! True servants of the people, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who owns three homes, should be shown special consideration for having devoted their lives to taking from the rich for the rest of us. Personally, I believe I deserve at least two homes!Even jobs should be free. That is, government should employ anyone who needs work. Well, a paying position, not actual work, if you get my meaning. Nor is there any reason to let “need” and “qualifications” as defined by dead white cisgender males get in the way. Government should provide employment to everyone — no restrictions. Why should people be constrained by arbitrary limits that prevent the oppressed masses from being all they can be? Have you ever been denied an opportunity that you believed you deserved? It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free.Democrats should listen to progressive activists and institute the socialist ideal. Like to cook? Government restaurants should allow anyone to be a chef. A frustrated architect? Government construction companies should let anyone design and build homes for all. Better yet, produce skyscrapers to showcase the new equal and fair America. Just imagine Stalinist realism with a Bidenesque accent!Did you play doctor when young? No need to waste time in medical school! Government hospitals should hire anyone to fulfill their dreams. We would have true people’s radiologists, neurologists, thoracic surgeons, and more. Why let oppressive training get in the way of ideological commitment? Who doesn’t believe they can teach better than some antediluvian professor with an ancient degree granted by a school founded decades or centuries ago by a bunch of dead white slave-owning cisgender males? Government universities could allow anyone to teach. With appropriate emphasis on true human values. We have a chance to build a real and permanent socialist majority.There’s no limit to this idea. Why let qualifications get in the way of government service? The more decades of undistinguished office-holding, the better! Government institutions should allow anyone to take power and rule over the rest of us — oh, wait, at least that ideal has been fulfilled! All hail President Joe Biden! But this should be just the beginning.Free should become the new principle of government. Paying for everything remains a slight challenge, though. The who is obvious, starting with rich, oppressive, white, cisgender men and even women — there just aren’t enough guys, alas. Also high-income, conservative people of color, who obviously are not authentic and do not deserve to be treated as real people of color. And anyone else departing from progressive orthodoxy. But how to keep them working while seizing everything they earn remains a slight conundrum. Still, surely Joe, with the help of Kamala, Nancy, and Chuck, should be able to work out the details.Just think of the new national rallying cry: America the land of the free, the brave, and the perpetual freebie!The Politics of Plunder: Misgovernment in Washington",0

Absent such a declaration, a denial of such access would be grounds for the removal of any military officer. The same is true for the exercise of other executive privileges and powers,” Mr. Turley said.Similarly, Ilya Shapiro, the publisher of the Cato Institute’s Supreme Court Review, found Ms. Pelosi’s statement to present legal trouble unless she does pursue impeachment, which she has hinted could come next week.“It’s definitely a problem. Until and unless the president is removed, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment, he remains the commander-in-chief. Given Pelosi’s statement, either she’s proceeding with impeachment or she’s setting a dangerous precedent for disrupting the civilian chain of command,” Mr. Shapiro said.Democrats have been pushing for Mr. Trump to be impeached a second time, arguing that he incited his supporters to break into the Capitol in a violent riot that ended with multiple people dead. They argue the president should never be able to serve in office again, and an impeachment would be a path to ensuring that bar is set.If a president is impeached in the House and convicted by the Senate, the upper chamber then holds a second vote to bar the individual from serving in higher office again. It would require 67 senators to accomplish their goal.Ms. Pelosi also said in her letter that she asked Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump, who she said is unstable to continue to serve.She warned if Mr. Pence does not take action, they could move forward in Congress to hold Mr. Trump responsible for the actions of his supporters following a speech he delivered from the White House on Wednesday — just prior to the violence breaking out on Capitol Hill.“If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action,” Ms. Pelosi wrote.Mr. Trump has been telling his voters the 2020 election was stolen due to alleged fraud. Election officials from several swing states have dismissed the claims.Ms. Pelosi’s chamber impeached Mr. Trump over a call with the Ukrainian president in late 2018, and the Senate held a trial early last year. The Republican controlled chamber did not vote to remove him at that time.Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC.Click                            here for reprint permission.Click to Read More and View CommentsClick to Hide",2

Faleti is a candidate for Missouri Secretary of State in the 2020 election.“It is shocking that Jay Ashcroft would make such an abhorrently callous, insensitive and irresponsible statement, suggesting he is willing to risk the lives of parents, children, teachers and school staff so that children can be sent back to school,” Faleti said in an emailed statement.Ashcroft, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch, said, “It’s ridiculous to say that I want people to die.”Asked if he regretted suggesting fathers risk death in order to send their children to in-person classes, Ashcroft rejected the premise of the question.“I didn’t suggest any other father do that,” Ashcroft said. “No I didn’t. I said I would risk that. And I didn’t know a father that wouldn’t. But I didn’t tell anybody else what to do. I just said we need to get schools going.”“I don’t think it’s fair to say that school automatically means death,” he said. “Now you may have to do school differently, and I think you should take precautions.“I want every parent to have the option to send their kid to school if they want,” Ashcroft said. “I’m not telling parents what they have to do with their children. I think they ought to have that option.”The criticism marked the second time in recent weeks that a Republican statewide elected official has had to defend comments on kids returning to school.Gov. Mike Parson drew national attention last month whenhe said kids going back to school would catch the virus, but that they’ll “get over it.”“These kids have got to get back to school,” Parson told a radio interviewer last month. “They’re at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get COVID-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. They’re going to go home, and they’re going to get over it.”Parson later said, in another radio interview, “I didn’t do a good job of explaining the point I was trying to make.”Ashcroft, asked if he could have done a better job making his point in the radio interview, said: “If someone had been asking me questions like you … yes, I probably would’ve explained it in more detail. But I was just saying — I want schools, I want our kids to get educated.”He then said that he could filter everything he says so that political opponents don’t “misconstrue” his statements.But, he said, “I hate that sort of politician that’s always sort of mealy mouthed and doesn’t want to say stuff.”Sign up now to get the most recent coronavirus headlines and other important local and national news sent to your email inbox daily.Jefferson City reporter",2
317,Where the heck is Joe Biden as anti-Semitic attacks engulf America?,22.0,18.33,https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2021/05/where_the_heck_is_joe_biden_as_antisemitic_attacks_engulf_america.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-thinker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-23,americanthinker,25,"Low-grade pogroms against Jews are sweeping the U.S.Hamas thugs are unleashing violent unprovoked violent assaults on Jews innocently going about their business in U.S. cities - inNew York, Los Angeles, Arizona, New Mexico, andFlorida, with leftists saying 'don't blame me.' Some leftists are repeating their old trope that they're merely anti-Zionist, not full-blown Jew-haters no different from the Klan or other low-class dirtbags. For appearances' sake, most are paying some kind of lip service to condemning this apparently organized Hamas thuggery appearing suddenly on our shores, even as they continue to claim with forked tongues that Israel is the problem.Joe Biden, though, is the exception. He hasn't said a damn thing. He still remains AWOL as Jews are hunted down and assaulted inhate crimes, raising questions, at least in my mind, as to whether Hamas has something on him.He's said nothing. His Twitter feed is a wasteland and his White House site is silent. 'Silent Joe' is his way with this one, and it's not a compliment.Biden can reliably be counted upon to condemn other hate crimes and perceived transgressions -- he condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, for one, and of course, calls any incident involving a black suspect and a white cop 'systemic racism,' which makes his silence in the case of this shocking wave of attacks all the more remarkable.It's certainly been noticed in any case.According to Ben Samuels, writing inHa'aretz:The Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Hadassah: The Women's Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote Biden on Friday highlighting a spike in reported violent incidents targeting Jews in the U.S. and abroad, as well as on social media. TheADL said Thursdayit was seeing ""a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate"" after the outbreak of renewedhostilities between Hamas and Israel, ""from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like New York and in small towns, and across every social media platform.""The organizations call onBidento call out antisemitism, telling him to ""harness the authority of the Presidency and the United States Government to speak out loudly and clearly against antisemitism.""According to A.J. Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a ceasefire with Israel after it started its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only in supporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America.Each year,FBI stats showJews are overwhelmingly the victims of more anti-religious “hate crimes” than any ethnoreligious group. And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month.Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he's even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, his silence suggests consent.Biden's silence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations.According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, he shifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he's concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political foot soldiers. That's where the biggest Jew-haters roost.Start with the far-left Squad side of things. Writing in theNew York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe's behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians.The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib’s “passion and concern for so many people.” Presumably, her concern doesn’t include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate.The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haters such as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lip service to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe won't condemn even those.There's more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- there's also the Democratic Party's black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev.

This, despite, or maybe because of, President Trump's heavy inroads on winning over the black vote to Republicans in 2020.

Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues to serve as a shadow president.This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keeping silent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He therefore stays silent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violence spirals across the U.S., expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away.It won't.Image:Gage Skidmore, via Flickr//CC BY-SA 2.0To comment, you can find the MeWe post for this articlehere.Low-grade pogroms against Jews are sweeping the U.S.Hamas thugs are unleashing violent unprovoked violent assaults on Jews innocently going about their business in U.S. cities - inNew York, Los Angeles, Arizona, New Mexico, andFlorida, with leftists saying 'don't blame me.' Some leftists are repeating their old trope that they're merely anti-Zionist, not full-blown Jew-haters no different from the Klan or other low-class dirtbags. For appearances' sake, most are paying some kind of lip service to condemning this apparently organized Hamas thuggery appearing suddenly on our shores, even as they continue to claim with forked tongues that Israel is the problem.Joe Biden, though, is the exception. He hasn't said a damn thing. He still remains AWOL as Jews are hunted down and assaulted inhate crimes, raising questions, at least in my mind, as to whether Hamas has something on him.He's said nothing. His Twitter feed is a wasteland and his White House site is silent. 'Silent Joe' is his way with this one, and it's not a compliment.Biden can reliably be counted upon to condemn other hate crimes and perceived transgressions -- he condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, for one, and of course, calls any incident involving a black suspect and a white cop 'systemic racism,' which makes his silence in the case of this shocking wave of attacks all the more remarkable.It's certainly been noticed in any case.According to Ben Samuels, writing inHa'aretz:The Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Hadassah: The Women's Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote Biden on Friday highlighting a spike in reported violent incidents targeting Jews in the U.S. and abroad, as well as on social media. TheADL said Thursdayit was seeing ""a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate"" after the outbreak of renewedhostilities between Hamas and Israel, ""from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like New York and in small towns, and across every social media platform.""According to A.J. Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a ceasefire with Israel after it started its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only in supporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America.Each year,FBI stats showJews are overwhelmingly the victims of more anti-religious “hate crimes” than any ethnoreligious group. And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month.Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he's even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, his silence suggests consent.Biden's silence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations.According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, he shifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he's concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political foot soldiers. That's where the biggest Jew-haters roost.Start with the far-left Squad side of things. Writing in theNew York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe's behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians.The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib’s “passion and concern for so many people.” Presumably, her concern doesn’t include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate.The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haters such as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lip service to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe won't condemn even those.There's more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- there's also the Democratic Party's black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, two notorious anti-Semites, as if they represent all black voters, and are ineffably tied to the mast of the Democrat party.

Professors Alex Sharland and Teresa Weldy held nooses.Wood, Sharland and Weldy were posted on the business school’s Facebook page shortly after the party, but the pictures havesince been removed.Along with the faculty members, graduate students of the Clinical-Counseling Psychology (CCP) program at USA sent school administration a letter as well.“We believe that the message the University administration is sending to faculty, staff, and students of color is that they would rather protect White tenured faculty than maintain campus safety,” a portion of the letter read.Graduate students of the program want the university to take action by investing in ways to promote diversity and equity, change the University structures that perpetuate inequalities by race and sex and more. The graduate students also want a response to the following statements by April 30:All three faculty members are still on administrative leave as of April 1. In March, Tony Waldrop, announced that an independent investigation into the incident would be conducted by attorney, Suntrease Williams-Maynard.",2
319,Gun Enthusiasts Celebrate Man Who Shot Himself in the Balls as Their King,-22.0,32.0,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3zeew/gun-enthusiasts-celebrate-man-who-shot-himself-in-the-balls-as-their-king,https://adfontesmedia.com/vice-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,vice,21,"Back in May, we wrote about a group of gun enthusiasts wholove taking pictures of loaded weapons pointed at their dicks. On a long enough timeline, one of them was inevitably going to accidentally discharge their weapon, and on Tuesday, that appears to be exactly what happened to one member in the San Diego area.A member of a Facebook group dedicated to taking pictures of loaded weapons pointed at dicks finally shot himself in the balls, according to bloody pictures and video he posted on social media and the Imperial County Sheriff's Office, which confirmed the incident to Motherboard. Rather than step back and start questioning whether the practice is wise, the group made him an administrator and are now celebrating him as their king.On August 11, a member of the group ""Loaded Guns Pointed at [B]enis"" posted a video of himself pointing a loaded 1911 handgun at his junk. There’s a brief pause before the gun discharges.The original video of the man shooting himself in the balls and subsequent thread has been deleted, but members of the group captured the video and aftermath and reuploaded it.“Hey [b]ois, I might have fucked up,” the man who shot himself in the balls wrote above a picture of his naked legs and splattered blood on the carpet of his floor. A towel is stuffed between his legs and a printed out copy of the constitution is crumpled on the edge of the photo.The guy posted through the incident as he bled. “God’s caliber [.45] went through my scrotum, mattress, boxspring, and floor,” he wrote. Originally the man thought he’d just grazed his balls, but a subsequent hospital visit told a different story.In the last public post from the man, he’s in a green hospital gown on a gurney. A pink mask is draped across his face and he’s pointing his finger at his crotch like a gun. “Turns out it wasn’t a graze, that round went right the fuck through me,” he posted. “What I thought were two graze wounds, turned out to be an entrance and exit wound.”The shooter didn’t respond to a request for comment, but an admin for Loaded Guns Pointed at [B]enis said he was doing well. “[He] is 100% okay, actually went to work the next day,” an admin of Loaded Guns Pointed at [B]enis told Motherboard in a Facebook message. “The reason we are calling him king is partially because the poor guy already shot himself, don’t think he needs to be chastised as well… I’m quite sure he’s learned his lesson without the entire world calling him an idiot.”According to his Facebook profile, the man who shot himself lives in the San Diego Area. The San Diego Police Department told Motherboard it had been called to the hospital in the area to follow up on a patient with a self inflicted gunshot wound at 8:30 p.m., August 11. A representative of the police department told Motherboard on the phone that the man was gone by the time officers arrived at the hospital. The shooter posted his picture from the hospital at 8:24 p.m. on August 11.To understand why this idiotic thing happened in the first place, and why there are several groups online dedicated to posting pictures of gun owners pointing a loaded weapon at their dick besides the Facebook group in question, you need to understand the beef raging between online gun people.""Trigger discipline"" is a basic gun safety measure drilled into people when they’re learning about firearms. Basic safety says that you always keep your finger off the trigger until you’re ready to shoot, and that you point it away from yourself and other people unless you mean to shoot them. Shitposters love taking pictures of a loaded gun pointed at their groin, finger hovering just above the trigger, to irritate responsible gun owners.Now, Loaded Guns Pointed at [B]enis has made the shooter an admin, and the group is making memes of him as their king. In one meme, Barack Obama is giving him a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The group changed its cover photo to a screenshot of the shooter pointing his loaded 1911 at his dick.“[We] are sick and tired of being demonized as gun owners, and looped together with the alt-right just for owning guns,” an admin of Loaded Guns Pointed at [B]enis told Motherboard in a Facebook message. “We are sick of republicans (think NRA) telling us what to do with our property, and we are sick of being told that just because we like guns It means we have to be anti woman, pro life and pro trump.”Since the story made its way to Twitter and other gun groups online, many have called the shooter's actions stupid.“I’m honestly surprised it took this long,” an admin of Gun People Who Hate Gun People, a Facebook group for gun enthusiasts to vent about irresponsible gun owners, told Motherboard in a Facebook message. “But of course this is probably one of the dudes crazy enough to actually point a gun at his junk and then actually post a video of him shooting himself. Like most people have the sense of self worth to not share getting so amazingly owned by their own stupidity.”",1

Butcountries,lawmakers, and President Trump say the app – owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance – is not goodFor You. And last Friday, Trump said he wouldban it.Because ofnational security concerns. US officials haveaccusedthe company of sharing users' data to spy on US citizens and potentially eveninfluencethe US election. They're also worried about intellectual property theft, which has already cost the US billions of dollars. One US senator called it a ""Trojan horse."" But TikTok says 'don't worry' – US user data is under ""strict controls"" and only stored in the US. Now, Microsoft is entering the chat.Last week, rumors that Microsoft was looking to buy TikTok's American operations spread faster than you scrolled through its bite-sized videos. After speaking with Trump, Microsoft said the deal with ByteDance was stillon the table, pending a security review. And that it would build on the app's current structure but with enforced ""world-class security, privacy, and digital safety protections.""It's not the first time the US has taken steps to ban a Chinese company over national security concerns (see:Huawei and ZTE). And TikTok's already been banned byUS military branches. But now that an American company's offered to buy it up, some believe the security concerns will be a thing of the past. Others are still worried about the ever-growing power ofBig Tech.A ""new phase"" of COVID-19. Yesterday, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said the US entered a ""new phase"" in the fight against the virus, calling it ""extraordinarily widespread"" across rural and urban areas. She stressed the ongoing importance of social distancing and wearing masks...evenpotentially at home(for people who live with someone who is at risk). It comes as cases in the South and Midwest have skyrocketed in recent weeks. And as California became thefirst stateto report more than 500,000 cases. In all, the US has reported more than 4.6 million infections and over 154,000 deaths.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's. Yesterday, President Trump called for the federal government to seek the death penalty for the Boston Marathon bomber.Reminder: In 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother planted homemade bombs at the finish line, killing three people and injuring hundreds. While his brother died in a shootout with police, Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges and faced execution. Butlast week, a federal appeals court threw out his death sentence. It argued the original jury wasn't fully vetted for potential bias and ordered a new trial to determine whether Tsarnaev should be executed. Now, Trump is saying that ""rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than"" Tsarnaev and is asking the gov to seek it once again.Ellen DeGeneres. Last month, nearly a dozen current and former employees of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" spoke to BuzzFeed News, accusing show execs and HR of racism and intimidation. Allegations included employees being fired for taking medical leave and racist comments toward a Black employee. WarnerMedialaunchedan internal investigation into the show and Ellenapologized, saying she's ""committed to ensuring"" this doesn't happen again. But these aren't the only accusations the show faces.

321,The persuasion problem,-2.67,46.0,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/29/the-persuasion-problem-pandemic-health-officials-try-to-change-minds/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,montanafreepress,15,"It had only one known COVID case until July. But that changed as the nation moved into its third surge of the virus this fall. By mid-December, Hill County had recorded more than 1,500 cases — the vast majority since Oct. 1 — and 33 people there had died.When Larson hears people say pandemic safety rules should end, she talks about how contagious the COVID virus is, how some people experience lasting effects and how hospitals are so full that care for any ailment could face delays.“In public health, we’ve seen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, research showing that this really does save lives,” Larson said. “In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Public health laws typically come long after social norms shift, affirming a widespread acceptance that a change in habits is worth the public good and that it’s time for stragglers to fall in line. But even when decades of evidence show a rule can save lives — such as wearing seat belts or not smoking indoors — the debate continues in some places with the familiar argument that public restraints violate personal freedoms. This fast-moving pandemic, however, doesn’t afford society the luxury of time. State mandates have put local officials in charge of changing behavior while general understanding catches up.Earlier this month, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams stood next to Montana’s governor in Helena and said he hopes people wear masks because it’s the right thing to do — especially as COVID hospitalizations rise.“You don’t want to be the reason that a woman in labor can’t get a hospital bed,” Adams said, adding a vaccine is on the way. “It’s just for a little bit longer.”He spoke days after state lawmakers clashed over masks as a majority of Republican lawmakers arrived for a committee meeting barefaced and at least onetoutedfalse information on the dangers of masks. As of Dec. 15, the Republican majority hadn’t required masks for the upcoming legislative session, set to begin Jan. 4.And now a group opposed to masks from Gallatin and Flathead counties has fileda lawsuitasking a Montana judge to block the state’s pandemic-related safety rules.Public health laws typically spark political battles. Changing people’s habits is hard, saidLindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University in Washington, D.C. Despite the misconception that there was universal buy-in for masks during the 1918 pandemic, Wiley said, some protesters intentionally built rap sheets of arrests for going maskless in the name of liberty.“In public health, we’ve seen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, research showing that this really does save lives. In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”She said health officials realize any health restrictions amid a pandemic require the public’s trust and cooperation for success.“We don’t have enough police to walk around and force everyone to wear a mask,” she said. “And I’m not sure we want them to do it.”Local officials have the best chance to win over that support, Wiley said. And seeing elected leaders such as President Donald Trumprebuffhis own federal health guidelines makes that harder. Meanwhile, public shaming like calling unmasked people selfish or stupid can backfire, Wiley said, because if they were to give in to mask-wearing, they would essentially be accepting those labels.In the history of public health laws, even rules that have had time to build widely accepted evidence weren’t guaranteed support.It’s illegal in Montana to go without a seat belt in a moving car. But, as in13other states, authorities aren’t allowed to pull people over for being unbuckled. Every few years, a Montana lawmaker, backed by a collection of public health and law enforcement organizations, proposes a law to allow seat belt traffic stops, arguing it would save lives. In 2019, that request didn’t even make it out of committee, squelched by the arguments of personal choice and not giving too much power to the government.Main opposition points against public health laws — whether it’s masks, seat belts, motorcycle helmets or smoking — can sound alike.When Missoula County became the first place in Montana to ban indoor smoking in public spaces in 1999, opponents said the change would destroy businesses, be impossible to enforce and violate people’s freedom of choice.“They are the same arguments in a lot of ways,” said Ellen Leahy, director of the Missoula City-County Health Department. “Public health was right at that intersection between what’s good for the whole community and the rights and responsibilities of the individual.”Montana adopted an indoor smoking ban in 2005, but many bars and tavernswere givenuntil 2009 to fall in line. And, in some places, debate andcourt battles continuedfor a decade more on how the ban could be enforced.Amid the COVID pandemic, Missoula County was again ahead of much of the state when it passed its own mask ordinance. The county has two hospitals and a university that swells its population with students and commuters.“If you have to see it to believe it, you’re going to see the impact of a pandemic first in a city, most likely,” Leahy said.Compliance hasn’t been perfect and she said the need for strict enforcement has been limited. As of early December, out of the more than 1,500 complaints the Missoula health department followed up on since July, it sent closure notices to four businesses that flouted the rules.In Hill County, when the health department gets complaints that a business is violating pandemic mandates, two part-time health sanitarians, who perform health inspections of businesses, talk with the owners about why the rules exist and how to live by them. Often it works. Other times the complaints keep coming.County attorney Karen Alley said the local health officials have reached out to her office with complaints of noncompliance on COVID safety measures, but she has not seen enough evidence to bring a civil case against a business. Unlike other health laws, she said, mask rules have no case studies yet to offer a framework for enforcing them through the Montana courts. (A handful of cases against businesses skirting COVID rules were still playing out as of mid-December.)“Somebody has to be the test case, but you never want to be the test case,” said Alley, who is part of a team of three. “It’s a lot of resources, a lot of time.”Larson, with the Hill County Health Department, said her focus is still on winning over the community. And she’s excited about some progress. The town’s annual live Nativity scene, which typically draws crowds with hot cocoa, turned into a drive-by event this year.She doesn’t expect everyone to follow the rules — that’s never the case in public health. But Larson hopes enough people will to slow down the virus. That could be happening. By mid-December, the county’s tally of daily active cases was declining for the first time since its spike began in October.“You just try to figure out the best way for your community and to get their input,” Larson said. “Because we need the community’s help to stop it.”The Montana GOP uninvited a planned convention speaker amid U.S. Senate drama.The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new fire station and additional police officers and firefighters.Health care providers, patient advocates and state lawmakers continue to hammer the administration of Gov. Greg Gianforte for removing more than 120,000 people from state Medicaid programs between April and November of last year, including many residents who say they remain eligible for coverage.Montana Free Press is a public-powered nonprofit newsroom, and it's thanks to readers just like you that we can bring Montanans quality, independent journalism.that can be put toward a free MTFP tote bag or a discount on t-shirts, hats and other MTFP merch.Will you join the 3,900+ donating members who are helping bring quality journalism to more people across our state?",2

I encourage Christians to make this a day of prayer—for peace and calm, and praying for our new leaders, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris,” Graham, who also leads Samaritan’s Purse, said in astatement on Facebook.Graham’s call for calm comes in the wake of theJan. 6 attackon the Capitol building by pro-Trump supporters and others in Washington, D.C., that left five people dead. The protesters sought to prevent the confirmation of Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election by Congress.CitingGraham's previous remarksin support of Trump's argument that the election was stolen, progressive Christian group Faithful America launched apetitionlast Friday, accusing Graham of sedition and calling on directors of Samaritan's Purse and BGEA to fire him.“As long as Samaritan's Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association stand by Franklin Graham, it must be said that these once-vaunted organizations have forgotten their original Christian missions, abandoned the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and are complicit in the spread of dishonest, discredited election conspiracy theories and the deadly, unpatriotic, white-nationalist terrorism at the U.S. Capitol incited by those lies,” said a message, which Faithful America said was sent to board members of the two Christian organizations led by Graham.“Our faith in Jesus Christ demands that we do better than this. Your fellow Christians from across the country call on you to fire Franklin Graham, or to resign from the Board in individual protest.”The petition has garnered more than 20,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning.Faithful America, which was founded in 2004, describes itself as “the largest online community of Christians putting faith into action for social justice.”“Our members are sick of sitting by quietly while Jesus' message of good news is hijacked by the religious right to serve a hateful political agenda. We're organizing the faithful to challenge such extremism and renew the church's prophetic role in building a more free and just society,” the groupexplains on its website.The group is led by Rev. Nathan Empsall, an Episcopal priest and veteran digital organizer, and has organized numerous petitions, including ones against former President Donald Trump, World Vision and Family Research Council.Trump left the White House for the last time Wednesday morning to make way for the Biden administration.“You are amazing people. This is a great, great country.

And what they had to say was downright dark.The McCloskeys, a pair of personal injury lawyers who famously pointed guns at demonstrators in front of their palatial residence this summer, instantly went down as one of the most unusual appearances in the history of presidential conventions. They’re a pair no other president would have invited — but Trump.Mark and Patty McCloskey warned that in an America under a future President Joe Biden, other Americans would likewise be forced to defend themselves from protestors on their own front lawns.“No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America,” said Patty McCloskey.The couple beamed into the convention from their Renaissance palazzo-style mansion in St. Louis, seated on a couch in a room richly-paneled with dark wood, and spoke straight to the camera.They warned other Americans that they, too, may soon have to wave their own weapons at unruly gangs of demonstrators if Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.“What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods across this country,” Patty McCloskey said. “And that’s what we want to speak to you about tonight.”The pair also complained bitterly about getting slapped with criminal charges for felony unlawful use of a deadly weapon over the incident.“Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime,” Mark McCloskey said. “But you know who was? We were.”The couple went on to allege that Democrats want to “abolish the suburbs altogether,” by ending single-family home zoning.“The radicals are not content just marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress,” Mark McCloskey said. “They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden’s party. These are the people who will be in charge of your future, and the future of your children.”",1
325,Donald Trump is still spiraling after that Michelle Obama throat punch,-20.33,29.67,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/throat-punch-donald-trump-is-still-spiraling-after-that-michelle-obama/31695/,https://adfontesmedia.com/palmer-report-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,palmerreport,25,"The first night of the Democratic National Convention was nothing short of inspiring. Some gave typically political speeches, but all had one goal in mind: electing Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States. Not only was the focus on electing Biden but also on the continued destruction being carried out by “president” Donald Trump. Some gave powerful speeches in “no holds barred” fashion, including Governor Andrew Cuomo. He did a fantastic job with New York, and many believe he could do the same across the country, but last night was about Joe Biden.One of the most poignant messages came from Kristin Urquiza, whose father died from listening to “president” Trump’s false messaging about coronavirus. One of her most powerful messages was: “His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.” Urquiza pledged to vote for Joe Biden in her father’s honor. Her father is an unfortunate example of listening to Donald Trump. Democrats are working hard to reach those who fail to see the perils of listening to Trump, and we can only hope that their urgent calls shook some people awake.Bernie Sanders was extremely clear that he expects his followers to vote for Joe Biden. He pointed out that he and Biden do not agree on everything but that Joe is making moves in the right direction, and four more years of Trump will ensure that none of the progressive policies make it past their own thoughts. The speech of the evening, however, goes to Michelle Obama.Michelle was so convincing, so real, and at times, very emotional. She laid out from first-hand experience how challenging the job of president is and how the person in that office must rise to the occasion. One of the most compelling things Obama said was: “being president doesn’t change who you are; it reveals who you are,” and that is certainly true when it comes to Donald Trump, a self-centered narcissist who does nothing unless it benefits him. He refuses to listen to science, preferring to listen to “my pillow man” and some doctor who has absolutely no experience in epidemiology and who believes we should all go out and infect each other to defeat the virus.As expected, Trump had to come back at Michelle Obama, and just like his plagiarizing wife, he had to use Michelle’s words, claiming that she was “in over her head.” No, that is you, Trump, and it is glaringly obvious. The worst thing about Trump’s inability to do the job he stole is his refusal to listen to those more knowledgeable to find a solution. He would rather kill us all with his stupidity. Face it, Trump: Just like Barack, Michelle showed you up, not that it is really that difficult to do. Anyone who believes his own hype more than the evidence pointing him in the face is headed for a downfall, and we cannot wait for Trump’s to come.",1

However, it’s only been in the last year or three  that his enormous influence has begun to be recognized.As we wrote last year, for example, “But now, after 28 years suddenly more perceptive observers are beginning to grasp that Justice Thomas has moved the High Court in his direction even as he has created a stable of young conservatives who are found everywhere in the pro-life Trump Administration and in the federal courts.”Here’s another, quite current example of Thomas’ extraordinary insight and foresight.There’s ensued tremendous controversy stemming from Planned Parenthood of Greater New York’s decision  to remove the name of Margaret Sanger, PPFA’s “iconic” founder, from its Manhattan health clinic because of her ‘harmful connections to the eugenics movement. Reluctantly,  at least some observers are recalling  Justice Thomas’ prescient comments in Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky.In that 2019 decision, the Supreme Court voted to uphold one part of a 2016 Indiana abortion law while laying over for another day the second part—the portion of the law that prohibited “abortions done solely for reasons of race, sex or disability—in other words, for eugenic reasons,” as William McGurn reminded us in a piece that ran yesterday in the Wall Street Journal.Justice Thomas took the occasion to write 7,000-word history of how “From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics.”His reward for being waaay ahead of the curve?MercatorNet aptly observedMost journalists ignored it or ridiculed it.Mark Joseph Stern at Slate said that Thomas had attacked women who have abortions as “callous and monstrous child-killers” – a slander which Stern made up out of thin air.Charles P. Pierce, at Esquire, wrote that Thomas had gone “bananas.” Garrett Eps, in The Atlantic, said that Thomas was part of “the far-right wing of African American conservatism.”Adam Liptak, at the New York Times, barely mentioned it.The full decision in Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky [Thomas’s concurrence begins on page 13] can be readhere.What follows are just a few highlights from his 20 page concurrence.*”This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes. These arguments about the eugenic potential for birth control apply with even greater force to abortion, which can be used to target specific children with unwanted characteristics. Even after World War II, future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates endorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of controlling the population and improving its quality. As explained below, a growing body of evidence suggests that eugenic goals are already being realized through abortion.”*“Eight decades after Sanger’s ‘Negro Project,’ abortion in the United States is also marked by a considerable racial disparity. The reported nationwide abortion ratio—the number of abortions per 1,000 live births—among black women is nearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women. And there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive—and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in the same area. Whatever the reasons for these disparities, they suggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of ‘family planning,’ black people do indeed ‘tak[e] the brunt of the ‘planning.’”*[This is crucial] “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the twentieth-century eugenics movement. In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination. … Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is dutybound to address its scope. In that regard, it is easy to understand why the District Court and the Seventh Circuit looked to Casey [the 1992 Supreme Court decision] to resolve a question it did not address. Where else could they turn? The Constitution itself is silent on abortion.“Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.”Life is full of ironies.Planned Parenthood of Greater New York could not possibly dislike anything more than the prospect of frankly acknowledging the truth of what McGurn wrote on Monday: “Planned Parenthood disavows her ‘racist legacy’ but continues carrying it out.”",0
327,Immigrants Detained by ICE Say They Were Thrown in Solitary for Requesting Covid-19 Tests,-11.33,46.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/ice-detention-center-covid-19-outbreak,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2020-12-02,inthesetimes,25,"Long-time U.S. resident Shemoi Edwards looks on after release from immigration jail. Edwards, like many others, was locked in solitary confinement because of Covid-19.Photo by Cydni ElledgeThe InterceptInside his cell at the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Ala., Karim Golding began feeling sick one day in June2020. He had a fever, a pounding headache, cold sweats, an​“onion burning sensation” behind his eyes and he was sleeping for days on end. When he finally felt well enough to emerge,​“the entire unit” was sick, Golding recalls.​“Everybody have some symptom or the other.”Three months earlier, asreportedin April,Golding, who has asthma, was a lead organizer of a protest inside the jail, pushing for stronger precautions to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Now, as Golding looked around, he realized their worst fears had come true.Etowah contracts with the federal government to hold people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To prevent becoming a Covid-19hotspot, Etowah claims (in court documents) it follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including quarantining new arrivals, implementing social distancing measures and providing cleaning supplies. But Golding and more than a dozen other people detained by ICE say the measures taken were more than just inadequate — they led to a massive Covid-19outbreak.Seven of them say people were given a single disposable mask to last for three weeks. One shares a photo of what he says were the only​“cleaning supplies” he received — a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and combo shampoo/​body wash — which came inside a gift bag emblazoned with the words​“Merry Christmas” from the Salvation Army.Immigrants detained inside Etowah also say many new arrivals were housed in quarantine for only five days or eight days — rather than the recommended two weeks — potentially allowing the virus to spread inside the jail. According to a partial Etowah roster obtained byandIn These Times, ICE transferred at least24people into the facility in June. By the second half of July, the agency reported that21people — nearly a quarter of those housed in Etowah’s ICE unit — were sick.When Golding finally emerged from his cell, the organizer part of his brain clicked back on.​“I’m looking at people that’s literally looking pale in the face,” he says.​“And medical is doing nothing for them.” So, Golding told everyone in the unit to request a test for Covid-19.“So you have Africans, you have Jamaicans, you have El Salvadorans — you have different groups,” Golding explains.​“What I did was say,​‘Hey, listen, you talk to your peoples, you tell them this.’ ”Many people were apprehensive about asking for a test, as guards had already placed the few who were presumed positive into solitary confinement, a fate considered by the United Nations to be torture. In solitary, detainees say they were locked in cells without air conditioning for around23hours a day. The average high temperature in July in Gadsden is91degrees.Nevertheless, by July4, everyone in the unit — more than80people — had put in requests for a Covid-19test, according to interviews with Golding and another immigrant detained by ICE, as well as the affidavits of nine detainees included in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus Golding filed on his own behalf in the Northern District of Alabama in September.Two days later, according to those11, Etowah County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Mike O’Bryant called a lockdown of the unit. O’Bryant then read the names of the10most vocal detainees calling for mass testing, including Golding. These10, O’Bryant said, were going to solitary. At the time of their transfer, none had tested positive for Covid-19. All11sources say they felt this was punishment and retaliation for requesting the coronavirus tests.“I noticed that all of us who were randomly picked were the ones who were vocal, outspoken and shown desire to be tested,” Stanley Walden wrote in an affidavit dated August7.“He handpicked cells and made an example, in front of everyone, that he really meant to throw anyone who get tested into a dungeon,” Sebastian Abalo Cunna wrote in an affidavit dated July28.​“It feels like punishment for standing up for our right to health and safety.”After locking down the unit, O’Bryant and other staff members went from cell to cell asking whether anyone still wanted a Covid-19test, according to Golding and the affidavits of nine others. Most declined and signed waivers saying as much.In a recorded conversation involving two Etowah employees obtained byandIn These Times, one employee described the events of July6as an attempt to​“bully” people into not getting tested. Afterward, both employees said in the recording, immigrants inside Etowah appeared too scared to seek even basic medical care.Four of those who went to solitary say they were unable to communicate with family for days. Some of their concerned family members called the facility. The relatives of one detainee say jail staff assured them that their family member was fine. At the time, he was in solitary confinement having developed symptoms of Covid-19. Golding’s mother says she was told there was no evidence of the virus at the facility, even as Covid-19at Etowah was listed on the ICE website. According to the family members interviewed for this story, neither ICE nor Etowah ever reached out to tell them their loved ones were sick.The Etowah County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to detailed questions fromandIn These Timesabout the jail’s Covid-19precautions, the detainees’ allegations of retaliation and whether detainees had authorized the release of their medical information to family members.“The health, safety, and welfare of those in our care remain a top priority and concern for the agency,” a spokesperson for ICE wrote in an emailed statement.​“Since the outbreak of Covid-19, ICE has taken extensive steps to safeguard all detainees, staff and contractors, including: reducing the number of detainees in custody by placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs, suspending social visitation, incorporating social distancing practices with staggered meals and recreation times, and through the use of cohorting and medical isolation.”ICE’s own guidance on how its detention centers shouldrespond to the Covid-19pandemicsays​“facilities must ensure that medical isolation is operationally distinct from administrative or disciplinary segregation, or any punitive form of housing.” And yet a previous investigation byfound that a number of ICE detention centers have failed to adhere to this requirement. According to immigrants detained at Etowah, solitaryconfinementwas used not only as leverage to discourage requests for testing, but to isolate people with Covid-19.andIn These Timesspoke with five men who tested positive for Covid-19while detained at Etowah. Each says he spent weeks in solitary.Shemoi Edwards developed Covid-19symptoms just days before Golding. At first, Edwards hoped to quietly sweat out whatever illness he had picked up, but he soon hobbled over to an officer and said he felt like he’d been hit by a truck. With a history of bronchitis and a recent diagnosis of sickle-cell trait, Edwards was too scared to ride out the illness on his own. Not long afterward, Edwards says, he was transferred to solitary.The men universally describe conditions in the solitary confinement unit as squalid. In their affidavits, many expressed distress that they no longer had access to mental health professionals, the law library, sunlight or fresh air.​“Civil detention have turned into torture,” Falaye Kourouma wrote.Bakhodir Madjitov, who was deported in September, wrote that there were cockroaches and flies in the unit. Golding wrote that he was fed uncooked frozen food and didn’t have access to drinking water because the sink in his cell didn’t flow properly.“No one wants to be treated how I am currently being treated,” Dawa Sherpa wrote in his affidavit.​“I fear that I may die here at Etowah County Detention Center.”One man says he spent21days in isolation. Another counted35days, a third54. Edwards says he was put in isolation June29and released July28—29days. Golding says he was in solitary confinement from July6to August28—53days.“We was getting the same treatment as [when] you get in trouble,” Edwards says.​“Even though it’s probably a different word — it’s​‘isolation’ — it’s still a form of punishment that they’re putting us in.”Edwards received the results from his coronavirus test July8, after he had been in solitary for more than a week; he was infected. One day later, Golding received the same bad news.In isolation, the men say, their phone access was limited. They could make calls only during a brief daily free period (no more than75minutes), which occurred on an irregular schedule. Sometimes, they say, it popped up in the middle of the night.Before he got sick, Edwards would speak with his mother and brother — Nickoy Edwards, a police officer in Flint, Mich. — a few times each week. Nickoy, after not hearing from his brother the first week of July, decided to call Etowah. After finally getting someone to talk to him, Nickoy says,​“that person answered and told me that they looked in the computer and they told me,​‘Shemoi is OK. He’s on the floor. And nothing is wrong with him.’”Nickoy believed the facility — at first. Then, weeks later, his brother finally called, telling Nickoy he was in solitary confinement and had the coronavirus.Nickoy called Etowah again.​“And they told me the same thing:​‘He’s OK.’“I felt like they weren’t telling the truth,” Nickoy says.​“I was a little upset, you know, and concerned because, you know, I want him to be OK.”Their mother, Tyson Mills, also began to worry. When she was finally able to get through to Etowah, Mills explained who she was and asked about her son.​“Ma’am, he’s OK,” Mills says she was told.​“He’s alright. Nothing to worry about.” She says it was suggested her son didn’t have enough money on his commissary account to call.​“It wasn’t nice,” Mills says.​“I was like breaking down in tears.”Golding’s mother, Mervine Duhaney-Metzgar, says she called Etowah six times after not hearing from her son. At first, her calls were transferred around.​“And it happened that I called again, and they told me that everything is OK, and there’s no evidence of any illness being there. And I know that wasn’t true,” she says.​“It was very disturbing as a mother.”Nicholas Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, is not surprised by the lack of communication experienced by the families of these detained men.​“ICE is essentially kind of a closed book to us,” Phillips says.​“Etowah adds another level of complexity to it because Etowah is a county jail. And so it’s not really run by ICE. It’s run by the Etowah County sheriff’s department.”According to a2015agreement, Etowah is responsible for medical care inside the facility. But ICE’s36-page guidance on how detention facilities should handle the pandemic does not mention how (or whether) facilities should notify family members of immigrants who get sick.Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney at the Adelante Alabama Worker Center, has represented immigrants seeking release from Etowah because of medical conditions that put them at risk during the pandemic.​“Because the jail is a healthcare provider, HIPAA applies to them,” Vosburgh says of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.​“They have to respect patient privacy, which means not disclosing someone’s medical information without their consent.”“When I need to get someone’s medical records from Etowah, I need their signed consent and then [the jail] can share it with me. And I think it would work similarly for a family member,” Vosburgh says.​“I don’t think there’s anything in HIPAA that would require or allow people to lie or provide false information about someone’s health. That’s different than not disclosing, right? If there’s something they can’t disclose, they just have to say,​‘I can’t disclose.’ ”​“Even if someone is being imprisoned, they have the right to proper health, to proper medical attention,” Golding’s mother, Duhaney-Metzgar, says. Even before Golding got sick, she had put in a complaint to the office of her congressperson, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), asking for an investigation into how her son had been treated in ICE custody and requesting that he be transferred to a facility closer to home.“My office has repeatedly reached out to follow up on the case for Mrs. Metzgar’s son Karim, and it has been months since their last reply,” Meeks says of ICE.​“ICE’s response time is simply unacceptable, especially now during a pandemic when it’s a matter of health and safety.”“I am so hurt deep down with what’s going on,” Duhaney-Metzgar says.​“Behind it, I strongly know that it’s an act of racism.”Phillips agrees. “[The Trump] administration, in my view, does not give a shit about detainees, immigration detainees,” he says.​“So how does it fit into the kind of larger discussion about racial justice and Black Lives Matter? I think it’s an integral aspect of that. I mean, immigration detention is, in many ways, simply an extension of the kind of mass incarceration crisis that America has gone through.”The criminal justice system and the immigration system are deeply entangled, with harsh consequences for Black immigrants in particular.One out of every five peoplefacing deportation because of a criminal conviction is Black. As of July2020, about half of the people detained by ICE at Etowah were Black, including Golding, Edwards and many of the other men interviewed for this story. Several are lawful permanent residents, but have lost their green cards and became​“deportable” after criminal convictions.Rather than accept deportation, many immigrants remain at Etowah for years as they fight their cases, often because they have nothing to go back to. Golding and Edwards were both born in Jamaica and came to the United States as children. Edwards, now30, arrived at15on a green card; most of his family now also lives in the United States. Golding, now36, arrived at9to reunite with his mother, who had fled an abusive relationship; he has never since been back to Jamaica.Before being incarcerated by ICE, Golding served a10-year sentence in federal prison. He and his family say they didn’t know there would be immigration consequences for his criminal conviction and that he has served his time.“I just want my son to get to come home,” Golding’s mother says.​“Every one of us has the right to be forgiven.”Edwards was just shy of hitting one month in isolation when his third Covid-19test came back positive. Medical staff at Etowah had informed everyone that they would need two consecutive negative tests to leave solitary and return to the general population — so when a guard later woke Edwards up and told him to pack his things, Edwards was confused.​“I thought I was going back to my original unit,” he says. But a sergeant appeared and told him he was being released.“And I’m like, OK!” Edwards says.​“So I just got to packing, you know, packed all my legal work, and I gave all my commissary away to everybody.”Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, had won a case just two weeks earlier (on July16,2020) on behalf of Jervis Glenroy Jack, a lawful permanent resident. The federal government had sought to deport Jack because of a conviction on unlawful gun possession in New York state. The judge Jack saw in the2ndU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled the state-level gun conviction did not qualify as a deportable offense.Edwards’s case was nearly identical to Jack’s: Edwards, a longtime permanent resident, served two and a half years in prison on a similar conviction in New York. When Edwards was out on parole, immigration authorities took him into custody.Doing his own legal research, Edwards came across the Jack case in2019, then reached out to Phillips, who agreed to represent him. After Phillips won the Jack case, he assumed the reversal would also help Edwards — but no one from ICE contacted Phillips, until moments before Edwards was released.Outside the immigration jail, Edwards asked the ICE officer for his ID and a Greyhound bus ticket.​“I’m basically explaining to him, like, I’m from New York. How are you going to bring me all the way down here and then just tell me that you just gonna release me with no ID, no bus ticket, plane ticket, no nothing to get back to my family?” Edwards says.​“He was saying that because the way I won my case, he’s not entitled to give me anything.”But the ICE officer did give Edwards something — directions to a Greyhound bus station a mile away. After that, Edwards was on his own. It was87degrees as Edwards started his walk down a four-lane highway, schlepping a heavy black garbage bag full of legal paperwork. He had about $100and a dead cellphone on him. He stopped at the first gas station he saw to buy a mask; the one he had at release, he says, was weeks old and filthy.When Edwards finally made it to the bus station, he asked about the next trip to New York. Two days, the person at the counter said. And Flint? A week. His best bet would be to keep walking up to Walmart, where he could buy a phone or a charger.At Walmart, Edwards started making calls: to Phillips, to his brother and to Shut Down Etowah, an organization that helps immigrants after release from ICE custody.​“I basically explained my situation, and they said,​‘We’re gonna have somebody come and pick you up. Just stay at the Walmart.’ ”Shut Down Etowah booked Edwards on a flight to Detroit (out of Birmingham, Ala.) that same evening, and a volunteer accompanied Edwards to the airport. The airport was eerily empty, and Edwards was nervous, he says. He didn’t have any identification and worried he would be sent back to jail.“My main mindset was that I do not want to go through this in a different jail,” Edwards says.​“Even if it’s for two, three hours, or even a day. I do not want to do that.”The representative from Shut Down Etowah did most of the talking, pulling different legal documents out of Edwards’s bag to explain who he was. Somehow, he got on the plane.“I guess the [airport security] guy must have felt sorry for me,” Edwards says.Arriving in Michigan felt surreal to Edwards. Everyone he knew had grown up in the years he’d been away.​“They literally was babies when I left,” Edwards says.Edwards’s mom calls every day to hear his voice, but he hasn’t been able to see her. She lives in Massachusetts; Edwards still hasn’t been able to get a driver’s license.Edwards now works long hours at a factory and has decided to stay in Flint. He’s started working with Shut Down Etowah and speaks with college students and other groups about his experience in immigration detention and the criminal justice system. After almost a decade behind bars, he doesn’t believe anyone should be incarcerated, especially not for immigration violations.“You saying we incarcerate somebody for rehabilitation? I don’t see it. They don’t rehabilitate you. They just put you in there till your time up and be like,​‘Go.’ That’s it,” Edwards says.​“I don’t feel like we have the right to do that.”Edwards, Golding, and the other men interviewed for this story who contracted the virus while at Etowah say they’re experiencing possible long-term symptoms of Covid-19: trouble breathing, exhaustion, gastrointestinal problems, and more. While Edwards is at home with family, Golding remains alone and in custody.​“ICE detention has been far more degrading than any prison confinement I have experienced,” Golding said.​“As far as rights go, you basically have no rights.”The Intercept,which pro­vid­ed fact-check­ing by Meerabelle Jesuthasan.I hope you found this article important.

329,"Everything You Need to Know About 2020 Election Fraud, but the Media Won’t Let You Ask",28.67,16.33,https://stream.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-2020-election-fraud-but-the-media-wont-let-you-ask/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-06,stream,24,"Video footage shows a few poll workers at State Farm Arena in Georgia staying behind after poll watchers and members of the press leave for the night, pulling suitcases of ballots out from under a table and counting them.ByThe EditorsPublished onDecember 6, 2020•We’re told, over and over, from media outlets and social media platforms, that claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election are “baseless” and “unsubstantiated.” Twitter flags every article alleging voter fraud, and even storiesallegations of voter fraud. Hostile news stories may even put “voter fraud” in scare quotes.Despite this relentless media campaign, there are now scads of evidence of fraud. This evidence is far more robust than anything the media used to keep the Russia collusion hoax alive for years. And it’s far more robust than the uncorroborated and contradictory “evidence” the press used to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh’s life. There was never any evidence, for instance, that Kavanaugh had even met Christine Blasey Ford.The most visually sensational evidence of election fraud is the time coded security video footage from the State Farm Arena in Georgia. Democratic counters sent home Republican poll watchers and members of the media, claiming there was going to be a break. But four stayed behind, and later, when no one was watching, they appeared to pull cases of ballots from under a table (which one of them had set up that morning) and started counting thousands of ballots, for hours.We have sworn affidavits from the Republicans that they were told to leave. And on the day in question (election day, November 3rd), the media reported that counting stopped at 10:30 pm.NEW: The election department sent the ballot counters at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta home at 10:30 p.m., Regina Waller, the Fulton County public affairs manager for elections, tells ABC News.https://t.co/HgCtcXEka3— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics)November 4, 2020This is a visual age, and there’s nothing like security video showing what looks like nefarious behavior. But at the moment, we’re still groping for exact details. Some officials aredenyinganything untoward happened (as they would). Perhaps it isn’t what it appears to be. But press “debunkings” of the story, so far, consist of quoting election officials — the very ones accused of incompetence — or claiming the containers holding the extra ballots weren’t “suitcases” but rather … ballot containers. Big deal. The fact that they’re even disputing such a trifle is suspicious.In any case, this is prima facie evidence.Of course, many observersfraud on election night. We all remember when vote counting in several battleground states suddenly paused. The media’s fishy explanations — a plumbing leak, vote counters needing to sleep, etc. — only confirmed the suspicion.But the evidence goes far beyond fishy smells. The best evidence of electoral fraud is mostly in the form of sworn affidavits and testimony from on-the-record eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, along with (often confirming) statistical analyses of events. Statistics can help us tell if some event is far more likely to happen by fraud than by chance, even if it can’t tell us how the fraud happened.Focus on this evidence. If juicy video evidence appears and stands up to scrutiny, fine. But don’t be distracted by eye-catching visuals.And don’t suppose that a lack of video evidence means much if anything. Remember, murders happen every day. We almost never have video of them happening.Finally, be skeptical of everything. If some Democrats committed fraud in the November election, they would be smart enough to anticipate some of this would be detected. Thus, they would be smart enough to seed social media with sensational examples of fraud that they know conservatives would pass around and retweet. And then, when those were debunked, the complicit media would use this to paper over solid, but less catchy evidence.Here’s the reality: the media and social media are suppressing and burying the best evidence. We’ve watched articles and stories get buried by Google in near-real time. Twitter and Facebook have been utterly shameless in censoring and misdirecting users.You can see the result of this social media “curating” by looking for relevant stories on Google, Bing, and Duck Duck Go. For instance, Google “Pennsylvania hearing on voter fraud.” (Google is by far the worst.) You’ll find many, many “stories” describing Trump cancelling his trip to the hearing, and “rambling” when he called in instead. Note how hard it is to find a straightforward news summary of the content of the hearing. It’s almost like Google is trying to keep you from finding such information.Or, try toGooglethe excellent summary of suspicious anomalies published recently in the US edition of the (UK). I’ll even give you the exact title of the piece: “Reasons why the 2020 election is deeply puzzling.” Note how long it takes for Google to provide a direct link the article itself (as opposed to recent pieces that make reference to the original, which Google hasn’t yet buried). If you didn’t have the exact title of the piece, you might as well be searching for a microscopic needle in the mother of all haystacks.Next, try the same search atBing, for a different experience.For a real hoot, search for “the very best evidence of electoral fraud 2020” on several different search engines.Another example: Search for the phrase “widespread election fraud.” The press has filled the infosphere with that word “widespread.” But of course, the best evidence is election fraud is highlyin a handful of cities and counties dominated for decades by Democratic machine politics.One final example (we could do this all day): Search for “Donald Trump, electoral fraud speech, December 2, 2020” on any search engine. Notice the relentless bias.Here’s one version of the video without a biased title (at least until YouTube pulls this version).Now multiply this experience with search engines ten thousand times to get a sense of how social media and media in general have worked to bury evidence of electoral fraud. This is, in effect, an information propaganda campaign by virtually the entire establishment in control of the flow of information.But even without this media censorship, how does the average person discriminate between good and bad information? In the last few weeks, a ton of bogus and misguided claims have flooded the relevant channels. These are sticky and more likely to get shared on Twitter than more solid but less sensational information. And even some sophisticated statistical analysisfalls apart on closer inspection.As a result, it’s hard for most people to find reliable sources, and to separate the wheat from the chaff.So, here’s a representative sample for the honest inquirer, who doesn’t have countless hours to research the subject. (We’ll update this piece periodically, so you might want to bookmark it — especially since it will likely get buried or labeled on social media.)There’s really no substitute for watching the videos of the state hearings themselves (links below), but this requires many hours and the testimony varies on quality. Short of that, at least spend a few hours reading the following articles, including summaries of the hearings. If you do that, you’ll know more about the evidence of fraud than anyone that relies on their Twitter feed or CNN for information.You’ll also know that when media and social media tell you that fraud claims are baseless, they’re either lying or negligently uninformed.Michael Pakaluk, “It’s Not Over,”Edward Feser, “Means, Motives, and Opportunity,”Gil Sanders, “Skeptical of Voter Fraud in 2020?

We’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol kidnap immigrant kids from their parents and hold them hostage in cages. Now we’re seeing federal agents tear gassing and kidnapping peaceful protesters.These agents are nothing more than street thugs with a badge, and once Trump is gone, we’re going to spend years sorting out their criminal trials. Hundreds of federal agents will serve lengthy prison sentences. There will be a national debate over whether the agents who have murdered immigrant kids should get the death penalty. America will end up having its own version of the Nuremberg trials.Now it turns out some of these agents are getting their feelings hurt about being called out for their deranged, psychotic, violent, thuggish, criminal behavior. They’reinsistingthat they’ve merely been following orders. Okay, fine.

332,"Glennon Doyle and Biden Campaign Manager Jen O’Malley Dillon on Politics, Motherhood, and Doing Hard Things",-15.33,30.67,https://www.glamour.com/story/glennon-doyle-and-jen-omalley-dillon-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,glamour,18,"Within an hour of the networks’ at last declaringJoe Bidenthe winner of the 2020 presidential election, his campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon took to Twitter to celebrate. In contrast with what we’ve come to expect from those who serve in the current administration, she wasn’t gloating or triumphalist. She was honest, elated, and grateful. “We can do hard things,” shewrote, “and you just did!”The phrase “We can do hard things” will sound familiar to the 1 million women who have kept the bookon theNew York Timesbest-seller list for the past 39 weeks. Glennon Doyle—the activist and public speaker who made a name for herself on her parenting blog and has since founded Together Rising, a nonprofit that’s raised over $25 million for people in need—wrote it to chronicle her divorce from her husband and her eventual marriage to the soccer star Abby Wambach.Thebookis about those seismic life events, but it’s also about an ethos: The world is rife with heartache and obstacles. There is no hiding from that. We have to do hard things. We can do hard things.This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.No wonder the mantra resonated with O’Malley Dillon—whose college softball coach introduced her to it. She is the first woman to manage a successful Democratic presidential campaign, the first woman to run a campaign that ousted an incumbent president, and of course the first person to spearhead a winning ticket in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic.Her task since she joined the Biden team on March 12, 2020—less than 24 hours after Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for Covid-19, the NBA suspended its season, and the World Health Organization designated the brand-new disease a global pandemic—has been to do the hardest possible things: Win a virtual election. Fight a cascade of misinformation. Keep hundreds of staffers and the candidate himself safe. Do not flinch.After Biden is sworn in, O’Malley Dillon will serve as his deputy chief of staff—her first White House role ever after two decades in presidential politics. But in the meantime, with the tiniest bit of breathing room now that Donald Trump and the GOP have lost almost 60 court cases in their futile, craven efforts to overturn the will of the voters in the 2020 race, O’Malley Dillon made some time to meet Doyle over Zoom and talk about—what else?—the hard things. —Well, it was a team effort, but we’re getting there.Look, I think there’s never an easy path to that, right? I’ve been doing presidential campaigns for the last 20 years. Before I worked for the president-elect and before he was in the race, I ended up going on the campaign trail for Beto O’Rourke. I had a great life! I had a consulting firm, and I loved the work I did. I had three little kids. People thought I was crazy that I was even thinking about taking that job.But I just had this sense—for both my husband and me, because you obviously can’t do any of this shit if you don’t have a partner that believes in it as much as you do and is willing to help. I just felt like, How do you answer to your kids when you look back on your life? How do you go on with your life without doing something to help? So I left all that stability. We moved to Texas. I moved three kids to El Paso, and my husband agreed to do it, and we made our lives work.When it came to Vice President Biden, we had just around that time found out that my dad had cancer. We didn’t know how serious it was. And I asked myself, “Am I even up for this?” This is scary shit, and everything is at stake. In the end, I just really felt called. I had to do something. And I believed in the vice president. It was kind of as simple as that.I think for our generation—the women before us were such trailblazers and were held to such a different standard. But when I was growing up, my dad said that I could be anything, and I really believed him. I didn’t even get what women had done and sacrificed and still didn’t have until I got much older.ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI feel like it’s so important to talk about the fact that I’m a mom. I think a lot of people just feel like that’s still so incongruent with being a professional woman. I had my girls—twin daughters—a week after the election in 2012. When I was deciding to do that campaign, I had women who I admired telling me, “You can’t do it. If you want to be on a campaign, you cannot have a kid.” Or, “If you’re thinking about having a kid, don’t tell anyone.”That was the norm. And now we’re seeing more and more women who are able to have kids in a campaign environment that’s more supportive, so I just feel like talking about it is so important; talking about it is how other people believe it’s possible to do it.You know what? No, I don’t. I am not sitting here telling you I’m an awesome parent right now. It just feels like it is important for me to say to a young woman, “You can figure this out if you want to. You don’t have to want to, but don’t believe you can’t. And also, don’t be afraid to talk about it.”I feel like I’m at my TED Talk here, but that’s the other thing that’s totally a pet peeve for me. When you have a meeting somebody wants to schedule, so many women are like, “Well, I don’t want to tell them I can’t make it because I have a school thing or my kid is sick, because that’s not professional.”Fuck that. Why shouldn’t I say, “Actually, you can’t talk to me from 6:30 until 8:00 unless it’s an emergency, even on a presidential campaign during a pandemic, because that is the only time I have with my kids. And that is more important.” Of course there are going to be times when you make exceptions. But I feel like if we don’t talk about that stuff, it means it’s not okay for that to be the reason. And as a professional woman, that has to be okay.Exactly. Exactly.I mean, the answer is so long and obvious, but also it’s still such a problem that we have to talk about it. First I want to caveat that I’ve been super fortunate. The first time I met with the president-elect, he talked about family coming first. That is the Biden way. As I was trying to navigate this job, I wasn’t sure how long my dad might have to live. We didn’t really know. I had the kids. How could I do this to them again? I had just moved them to Texas. And he allowed me to work through that. He gave me the space to do that, and also was like, “Look, if something happens and your dad gets sick, that will always be okay and family will come first.” That is not how it usually goes. I think it’s important to mention that.ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyBut when it comes to this campaign or campaigns in general or other jobs, I would say a couple of things. First, I think that there is an opportunity with women for working together more effectively. Women are not afraid to share information. We’re communicators—sometimes overcommunicators. You hear the stories, too, about women trying to reinforce another woman’s voice. I still do that.Of course not everyone is perfect here. We’re all human. But I do think seeing other women in roles of leadership, seeing them in partnership, there’s a sense that they’re thinking about the integration of how one role fits with another. There’s a feeling of shared responsibilities.And then the other thing I is, at least how I have experienced it—the shit, the drama, and the turf wars, who gets credit—first off, it’s not important to me, but also it doesn’t get me bothered as much as I think as it might bother others, because I have kids. Every moment that I’m not spending with them, I’m not spending with them. You have to be efficient about how you use your time, because you know what you’re giving up. I think that that really in turn reinforces the efficiency of the entire workplace and helps clarify what’s really important.Well, we could spend a whole lot of time talking about who were the people within the party on the outside of the campaign who were sharing all their thoughts publicly, but that would probably be a different conversation. I will say honestly, it would have been impossible to do it if the vice president didn’t set the tone. He said that we had to make sure people were safe, and we could not deviate from that. And also, he knew he had to be a role model. It wasn’t good enough to just talk about the science. You had to live it, and I think that is the model for his life too.It was hard, though. We had a lot of people who were well-meaning, who were just scared that this was the wrong call: It was going to hurt us; we were never going to be able to build the campaign we needed. But this was not my first rodeo. I’ve spent 20 years on presidential campaigns. So I just was confident that I had the support of the candidate and that this was the right thing to do.ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyNow, even though I thought it was the right thing, I thought there was a political price to be paid. It is possible that that was the case. But it felt to me like, this was authentic to who Joe Biden is. And if we lost that, or we lost sight of him being a good man and a great leader and someone who is resilient and has gone through these hard things, then how could we be true to the campaign? That was grounding as well.But again, it was not easy. I had so many people calling me. My mom was like, “Jen, I saw on CNN that these luminaries in the party are saying you’re doing the wrong thing. Are you going to get fired?” I had to be like, “Stop watching CNN, Mom.”Yeah, exactly. And then her other question is, “What actually do you do?” We’ve been doing that for 20 years.depending on you. Did you have strategies or rituals to deal with the stress of knowing that, or are you just a generally calm person?My whole professional life has been in a stressful environment. So I don’t mind that. And campaigns—it’s like sports, I think. You’re building for the moment, the end game. I have developed an ability to push myself because I know it’s going to be over. I think that’s owed to a few things.One, again, I have my kids to anchor me. They could give a shit about all this. Around the time of the decision around the running mate, we were having a serious meeting. It was Dr. Biden, and it was the vice president. And my daughters came in, and Katie was like, “Oh, hey, Joe Biden, what are you doing?” Like,concern. He was happy to talk to them, but it just kind of puts things in perspective.And the second thing is, you as one person actually can’t take in the totality of what you’re responsible for. I had this amazing team. There were so many other people. Ultimately, it was the president-elect who really carried the burden. But for me, I couldn't focus on the bigness of it. I just had to know that we were headed in the right direction. And I had to ask myself, What did I have in front of me that I had to accomplish? You can’t let yourself get distracted in the abstract.ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI’ve never thought of it quite like that, but it’s passion and belief in values. Those are the things that drive the work. My dad and my mom are teachers, and they taught us that it was important to be part of your community and to find ways to give back—whether it was through a job or just in your own life. I think that’s what I found when I started doing organizing work, which meant figuring out what other people cared about and what mattered to them. It wasn’t just a one-sided thing. That showed me that you couldn’t be successful in politics if you didn’t understand what another person needed, if you didn’t understand what a community needed. And you had to be open to listening.Like Joe Biden says all the time, “Great leadership starts with listening.” It’s challenging for us to do that right now, because of how polarized we are. But politics breaks down to one-on-one conversations and not being afraid to talk. I get that you’re not supposed to talk politics at the holiday dinner. Well, fuck that. It’s because we don’t do that that we are in this situation now.I also think, as in love, compromise is a good thing. The atmosphere in the world now is like, “Oh, if you compromise, you don’t believe in something.” No, it’s: I believe in it so much that I’m going to work to find a path we can both go down together. That feels to me like the heart of relationships and love and success across the board.Yes, exactly. And frankly, that’s what we need. The president-elect was able to connect with people over this sense of unity. In the primary, people would mock him, like, “You think you can work with Republicans?” I’m not saying they’re not a bunch of fuckers. Mitch McConnell is terrible. But this sense that you couldn’tfor that, you couldn’t wish for this bipartisan ideal? He rejected that. From start to finish, he set out with this idea that unity was possible, that together we are stronger, that we, as a country, need healing, and our politics needs that too.Which is not to say it is easy. It is like a relationship. You can’t do politics alone. If the other person is not willing to do the work, then that becomes really hard. But I think, more than not, people want to see impact. They want to see us moving in a path forward. They want to do their work, get paid a fair share, have time for themselves and their family, and see each other as neighbors. And this overhang of this negative, polarized electorate that politics has created is the thing that I think we can break down.ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI played softball in college, yes. Not anywhere near your wife’s level as an athlete. But my sister and her wife are coaches. They’re basketball players, and they’re phenomenal.Everything. I am not here, doing this work, without sports. As a kid, I didn’t feel like I fit with everyone else. I didn’t always feel like I connected. Sports was a place that I felt like I belonged. It was a place where I felt like I could work hard and see improvement, which I think applies so much to campaigns and politics.Sports also taught me about leadership, and when I was a girl and then in college, it helped me find a voice. I was good at softball. I was not great. But being part of it allowed me to see that I had things to contribute. I saw what was required of a leader, and I saw what might be required of me to lead too.That college coach is the person who introduced me to the idea of “We can do hard things.” I didn’t even know you had said it before. I was just starting on the campaign. And people were finding out about it, and my college softball coach reached out. We were chatting and she said that one of the moms of her players was talking about how hard everything was with the pandemic, and she was trying to figure out, like, what’s a simple thing the team can rally around to get through the day and to just hang in together? And my coach said the mom had said, “We can do hard things.”And I was like, “Oh, that’s the exact thing that I’m looking for.” I had just started this job. Everyone was remote. I had 200 people that I was working with who had never even met me. We started these weekly virtual meetings, and in the first one I said, “This is hard, but we can do hard things. We’re going to get through it.” It became the rallying cry we used every week. And it was hard. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.That little saying really helped us get through it, honestly. Because sometimes, like in sports, you don’t have it in yourself, but someone in the group has it, and someone can be there to say, “We’re going to get through it. We’re going to be okay,” and that’s what you need.Right. Exactly. It has to be a we.Exactly.That is amazing.And we’ve already done hard things. That is the other part of it for me. It’s grounded in the fact that we’ve already done hard things. And that is what holds me together.",1
333,What should the media do with President Trump’s false election claims?,-9.0,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-president-trumps-false-election-claims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,poynter,24,"For the past six months, the country has been on edge as we led up to the 2020 election. But even now, as the election is essentially over, the country cannot totally exhale.We have 72 days between now and inauguration day when Joe Biden is expected to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. Buckle up because this ride will be bumpy.There’s no indication that the transition of power will go smoothly over the next two months. President Donald Trump has taken a defiant tone, showing no signs of conceding while ramping up his insistence that the election has been rigged. We expect to see recounts and lawsuits, which are acceptable in our democracy. We also expect to see plenty of baseless rhetoric and unproven conspiracy theories, which are not acceptable.So what role does the media play in how the next two months will go?In her latest piece,Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wroteof Trump: “He was a deeply abnormal president, but we constantly sought to normalize him, treating his deranged tweets like legitimate news and piously forecasting, every time he sounded the least bit calm, that he was becoming ‘presidential.’”She added, “From the beginning, TV news far too often took his public rallies and speeches as live feeds, letting his misinformation pollute the ecosystem.”There is a danger of that happening again. Based on how he has reacted so far, Trump seems likely to continue floating his false theories, putting the media in an uncomfortable position.Up until now, most news outlets have tried to walk a tightrope — reporting on the president’s protestations about the election, while attempting to point out that Trump’s assertions are not rooted in fact or reality.News broadcasters sound something like this: “The president says the election is rigged. There is no proof that is true.” We’ve heard versions of this on all networks for the past three days.But is that enough? Doesn’t there come a point when repeating the president’s unproven claims, even while debunking those claims, does damage? Doesn’t putting Trump’s bogus allegations into the ether chip away at the trust in our elections even though there is no reason to doubt the honesty of our elections?On one hand, Trump is the president. What he says and what he does right now is news, especially if his refusal to participate in a transition of power impacts the nation. On the other hand, just because Trump insists the election is a fraud doesn’t make it so — and it doesn’t make it news. AsThe Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg told Brian Stelter on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,”“The salience of this administration goes down by the day.”But it is not going to disintegrate completely.News outlets have to think long and hard about what truly is news at this point. It looks as if it will be impossible to completely ignore everything the president says about the election. When the media is forced to cover this part of the story, it must keep repeating that his conspiracies are not true. But the media also doesn’t have to cover Trump’s dangerous speech every time he tweets or talks.Trump has made his allegations known. The media has reported on that. For the media to keep reporting on it every single time Trump repeats it is no longer necessary.If something changes — if Trump concedes, or Trump offers something more than just wild, off-the-cuff lies — then report it. Otherwise, ignore it and cover real news. Goodness knows there’s plenty of it with coronavirus, the economy and so much more.Fox News’ Chris Wallace. (Courtesy: Fox News)Fox News’ Chris Wallace had a couple of moments over the weekend that need to be pointed out.First, on Saturday, after Biden was projected the winner of the 2020 election, Wallace commented on Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the election.“I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable,” Wallace said on the air. “It’s one thing to be pursuing legal challenges. It’s another to have this very heightened rhetoric that we know is the way the president does business. I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable because I think you’re going to start to see a lot of the Republican leaders who are realizing their fortunes and their futures are no longer so directly tied to Donald Trump are going to begin to pull back.”Wallace also pointed out how “un-normal” Trump’s refusal to accept Biden’s victory is.Then on his “Fox News Sunday” show, Wallace again brought up the idea that Republicans will have to push back on Trump’s election claims.“It would seem to me that Republicans on Capitol Hill have a role to play in this,” Wallace said. “A very few of them have said, look, you pursue your legal options, but, you know, damn down the rhetoric, like Mitt Romney, like Pat Toomey.”Then he said this whopper:  “There are a lot who are just silent. And then there are some — I mentioned Ted Cruz — you know who are like the Japanese soldiers who come out 30 years after the war — out of the jungle — and say, ‘Is the fight still going on?’”Here’s how NBC News’ Lester Holt closed his “Nightly News” broadcast on Saturday, the day Biden was projected to win the election:“The handwriting has been on the wall for days. Today, it was on the screen in bold letters and a check mark and for the first time it could be said out loud: America has decided to go another way. This kind of passion — the deep disappointment of the president’s supporters, the celebratory dances of Joe Biden voters — should be allowed their moment. As a country the campaign whipped us into a frenzy, too often rooted in fear of the other. Today, we let it out. Both sides deserve a collective primal scream over all we’ve been through.“But tomorrow, just maybe we can leave it on the field, wave away the smoke screens and confront what we know to be real and urgent — a pandemic that is literally killing us and sending too many into financial ruin. If we can reengage unity on anything, let it be in the insistence that our leaders, both incoming and outgoing, put us and our well being first.”In case you missed it, I had a special edition of my Poynter Report newsletter on Saturday, applauding how the media handled Election Day turned Election Week. If you missed it, you cancheck it out here.CNN was the big winner on what turned out to be the final day of the election. From 3 a.m. Saturday morning until 3 a.m. Sunday morning, CNN was the most-watched cable news network. It drew 4.2 million viewers, which was more than MSNBC (3.01 million) and Fox News (1.72 million). Interesting to note that Fox News was the most-watched network of all on Tuesday’s Election Day, but then CNN mostly took over from there.CNN’s Brian Stelter compiled exactly when the networks made the calls on Saturday to project that Joe Biden would be the next president.CNN was the first at 11:24:20 a.m. NBC was next at 11:25:15, followed by CBS at 11:25:45, and The Associated Press and ABC at 11:26. Fox News made its call at 11:40 a.m.Looking for an expert source? Find and connect with academics from top universities on theCoursera | Expert Network, a new, free tool for journalists.

The party was especially strong in rural areas like Oklahoma — success that the socialist movement could actually replicate today.Eugene Debs in 1912. (Library of Congress)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today.Markwayne Mullin is an ultraconservative Republican congressperson from eastern Oklahoma. He hates socialism and isn’t afraid totell you about it.“Socialism is nothing but a disguised free democracy, meaning that they make you think you have a choice, but you really don’t,” he warned his constituents in 2019. The Green New Deal “has nothing to do with eliminating my cows from farting,” he insisted. “It has to do with that farm being deemed a hazard to the public health” so the federal government can claim “eminent domain and take over our farms.” And if the socialists and bureaucrats in New York and Washington, DC can use farting cows as an excuse to take over farms, what’s next?Donald Trump skillfully tapped into fears of “socialism” to run up huge margins in places like Mullin’s congressional district, which went for Trump in 2020 by the largest margin in the state (76 to 22 percent).But this largely rural area wasn’t always a hotbed of reaction. A century ago, socialist firebrands likeKate Richards O’Harefound receptive audiences in eastern Oklahoma, and the state boasted the largest per capita Socialist Party (SP) membership in the country. Five-time Socialist presidential candidateEugene Debsconsidered southwestern farmers “real Socialists . . . ready for action, and if the time comes when men are needed at the front to fight and die for the cause the farmers of Texas and Oklahoma will be found there.”Today, Debs’s words sound like a broadcast from another dimension. While socialists, radicals, and progressives are doing important work across the country, left politics are —at least for now— largely synonymous with the most urban and cosmopolitan precincts in the United States.The New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) claims roughly 10 percent of the organization’s entire membership. The crop of democratic socialists recently elected to Congress hail from places like the Bronx and Queens (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), New York’s northern suburbs (Jamaal Bowman), Detroit (Rashida Tlaib), and St Louis (Cori Bush). Electoral breakthroughs at the state legislative level have come so far only in New York, and all of those legislators represent districts in the Big Apple. Chicago boasts a socialist caucus on its city council, but no other town or city can say the same.This year marks the 120th anniversary of the SP’s founding. And during its heyday, many of the movement’s biggest strongholds were found in the country’s most rural areas. As James Weinstein observes in, until 1918 “the greatest relative voting strength of the movement lay west of the Mississippi River, in the states where mining, lumbering, and tenant farming prevailed.”In addition to Oklahoma, the states with the highest proportions of SP voters were Nevada, Montana, Washington, California, Idaho, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Butte, Montana — which elected a Socialist government led by Mayor Lewis Duncan in 1911 — features one of the last public remnants of the old SP:Socialist Hall. Even in states like New York, the party tended to do just as well in smaller upstate towns like Schenectady, where Socialist mayorGeorge Lunnwas elected to two terms in the 1910s, as it did in New York City.Big-city socialists today still havea lot of work to doin our neighborhoods and workplaces. But if we want to become a truly popular movement, we need to find ways to grow beyond our metropolitan footholds. Revisiting the SP’s record of building power in rural and small-town America — including a frank assessment of its failures and shortcomings — can give us a sense of how that legacy might be rebuilt today.The SP was far from the first organization to make a radical appeal to the nation’s hinterlands. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Knights of Labor, the People’s (Populist) Party, and other organizations rallied workers and farmers against the growing power of bankers, railroad barons, and land speculators.But when the Socialist Party formed in 1901, it wasn’t simply as a reincarnation of Populism. As James Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism: Radical Movements in the Southwest, 1895–1943, while many of the early SP leaders were former Populists, the Socialists’ main areas of support in the region were outside the old Populist strongholds, among the growing ranks of tenant farmers and industrial workers in cotton farming and coal mining areas.In addition to former “Pops,” the movement drew on an experienced cadre of labor organizers like the old Knights of Labor militantMartin Irons, a grizzled Scotsman who had led a massive railroad strike in 1886 against the robber baron Jay Gould.Radicals and Socialists in the region drew much of their support from migrants who had fled their homes in search of land. Instead of a frontier idyll, these migrants found that many of the best lands had been claimed by railroads, speculators, and cattle ranchers, and the cost of setting up an independent farm was often prohibitive. Many nominally independent farmers became deeply dependent on creditors. By the turn of the century, most farmers in the region were tenants and sharecroppers, rather than the self-sufficient homesteaders of their dreams.Some of these tenants were Cherokees, Choctaws, and other indigenous people who had their tribal lands stolen. Some were black migrants looking to get out from under Jim Crow. Most were white. Nearly all were poor, ensnared in exploitative forms of agricultural finance like the crop-lien system. This set of property relations generated bitter class struggles between tenant farmers and their landlords, which allowed the Socialists to exploit fissures in the Democratic Party’s electoral base.In addition to tenant farmers, Socialist organizers were well received among the miners, timber workers, and railroad men of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, and the interior West. They were particularly successful in recruiting militant miners, who built strong United Mine Workers (UMW) and Western Federation of Mineworkers (WFM) locals across the region.The UMW was one of the main sources of black recruitment to southwestern Socialism, as it was one of the only organizations that sought to unite working people across racial lines. Local SP organizations, however, were not always willing to do the same. Many white SP members resisted cooperation with black and indigenous farmers, and segregated party locals could be found in Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere.Still, a number of Socialist leaders fought racism and white supremacy in the movement. The rakish Southern radicalCovington Hallorganized dock workers across the color line in New Orleans and was a leading founder of the interracialBrotherhood of Timber Workers(BTW).Oscar Ameringer, one of the most underappreciated figures in the history of American Socialism, worked to unite the black and white brewery workers of New Orleans while on assignment from the Socialist-led Brewery Workers’ Union. When he moved to the Sooner State in 1907, he quickly began agitating for socialism among tenant farmers in Indian Country. Together with state party secretaryOtto Branstetter, another German social democrat with close ties to the Milwaukee Socialists, he sought to bring together black, white, and indigenous workers in a strong and well-organized SP affiliate.Official party organizations did not spring up overnight. In the first years of the twentieth century, the Southwest was covered by a vast web of journalistic and propaganda activity that drew masses of people into the Socialist movement — in many cases before under-resourced official party organizations could reach them. As Green recounts inGrass-Roots Socialism, radical journalists, intellectuals, and propagandists promoted “an unusual level of self-organization and self-education among the poor working people who joined the movement.”None was more important thanJulius Wayland, whose weekly paper, theAppeal to Reason,was central to Socialist education and organizing in places like Oklahoma and Texas. The paper’s “Appeal Army” of volunteer salespeople would fan out into the country like Methodist circuit riders, hawking subscriptions and pamphlets and seeding party organizations wherever they went. By 1912, Green writes, “over six thousand Appeal volunteers were walking, bicycling, and driving buggies through Oklahoma and Texas spreading the Socialist gospel.”Their efforts won the paper a national circulation of roughly 750,000 — the highest of any weekly publication in the country. TheAppeal, in Green’s words, “was literally the only contact with socialism experienced by many people in the first decade of the century, and it was particularly important in converting younger farmers and workers” who were not veterans of the Knights of Labor or the Populist movement. Other unofficial but Socialist-aligned papers like theNational Rip-Saw(St Louis) and theRebel(Hallettsville, Texas) served a similar role, bringing Socialism to the people in an idiom that blended class struggle with American republicanism and evangelical Christianity.Socialist organizers also made excellent use of mass encampments, a familiar institution associated with both Populism and religious revivals. Socialists organized their first encampment in 1904 in the Grand Saline area of Texas, where a thousand farmers from across the region showed up to listen to speeches and lectures for hours. As one account in the Socialist press described it, “Go into the Grand Saline country and see erstwhile democrats . . . preaching Socialism as earnestly as did the Pentecostals preach the New Gospel and perhaps you will have a clearer conception of what the encampment accomplished.”These encampments brought thousands into the movement because “they drew upon the collective traditions of the frontier and added political significance to common experiences.” Preachers and teachers advanced Socialist ideas in biblical and populist language to justify the struggle against those who would deny workers of hand and brain the full product of their toil.Ameringer described the encampments’ effect in vivid terms:For these people radicalism was not an intellectual plaything. Pressure was upon them. Many of their homesteads were already under mortgage. Some had already been lost by foreclosure. They were looking for delivery from the eastern monster whose lair they saw in Wall Street. They took to socialism like a new religion. And they fought and sacrificed for the spreading of the new faith like the martyrs of other faiths.Attendees were thrilled by the oratory of renowned leaders like Mother Jones, but they also made minor celebrities of forgotten figures likeWalter Thomas Mills. Known as the “little professor,” this diminutive polymath established a “School of Social Economy for Socialists” and wrote a popular textbook calledThe Struggle for Existence, which offered readers an eclectic blend of Christian moralism and scientific socialism. If a good organizer is, in the words ofFred Ross, a “social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire,” the old Socialist movement had them in droves.And nobody in the movement set more people on fire than Eugene Debs, easily the most popular orator at the Southwestern encampments. Debs brought both prophetic and intellectual intensity to his speeches and exuded an unshakeable faith in the ability of the poorest and most despised people to change the world.Reflecting on the success of the encampments, Debs related how farmers and their families would head home “feeling that they had refreshed themselves at a fountain of enthusiasm,” ready and able to deliver “the glad tidings of the coming day” to their friends and neighbors.A lively press and effective organizing tactics like encampments were key to Socialists’ success in rural areas. But the movement would not have found such fertile soil if it did not directly appeal to people’s material interests — even if they diverged from orthodox Marxist prescriptions.The Texas and Oklahoma parties, for example, supported tenant farmers’ essentially Populist demands for private, small-scale ownership of farmland despite the opposition of party members from other sections of the country. Critics argued that small family farms were inefficient and obsolete, and that only demands for land collectivization were consistent with proper socialism.Other Socialists disagreed. In his influential 1902 studyThe American Farmer,Algie Simonsinsisted that not only were small farmers not disappearing, but that the growing power of corporate capital made them a potential audience for Socialists.Simons’s main argument was twofold. First, “the small farm owner is a permanent factor in the agricultural life in America, and that he forms the largest uniform division of the producing class,” and second, “any movement which seeks to work either with or for the producing class, must take cognizance of him.” Industrial workers could not, in his view, transform society without the masses of small farmers standing with them at the ballot box and on the field of class conflict.Simons’s arguments gained additional strength after the party’s disappointing results in the 1908 elections, when it offered no agrarian program beyond a vague call for collective ownership of all land. In 1912, the national party congress adopted an agrarian program that incorporated demands long raised by Simons and the Southwestern Socialists: state-supported cooperatives; public ownership of transportation, storage, and processing facilities; graduated land taxes; and expansion of cheap government-backed leases of land to family farmers.The new program marked an important moment in the movement’s development. As Simonswroteafter the 1912 convention, “Conditions in agriculture, in the party and in the views of the delegates have all changed with the years, and the Socialist party now goes forth with a clear statement of its position in regard to the farmer that should mean a tremendous growth in agricultural localities in the near future.”He was right. In 1912, Debs received a total of eighty thousand votes (about one-tenth of his national total) from Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. At its height in the middle of the decade, the Oklahoma party claimed about ten thousand members, the most members per capita of any state in the country. In 1914 and 1915, the year when the SP had its largest number of state legislators in office, states west of the Mississippi River accounted for nineteen of thirty-three legislators. Oklahoma alone accounted for six, second only to Wisconsin’s nine, and it elected a total of a hundred seventy-five Socialists to local and county offices.The party’s back-and-forth over how best to approach the rural masses resembled debates in other parties of the Second International. In hisreviewof Simons’s book, German theorist Karl Kautsky noted that the agrarian question was “one of the most difficult and disputed” issues in the German Social Democratic Party — pitting Bavarians and other southerners who wanted to appeal to poor and middle peasants against northerners who only wanted to recruit landless agricultural laborers on large estates.This question was also a major dividing line in Russian social democracy, where Lenin’s support for aligning with the Russian peasantry put him at odds with the Mensheviks, who focused primarily on the urban working classes and bourgeois liberals.The erosion of small farmers as a social class means that contemporary socialists don’t confront the same “agrarian question” as our predecessors. But the conundrum of “contradictory class locations” is very much on the agenda, as theoften-heated discourseover the “ PMC (professional managerial class) question” clearly shows. The challenge today is to reconcile two groups who are largely isolated from each other socially and politically: progressive, highly educated wage earners and the masses of lower paid, less-credentialed working people.In hishistory of the SP, Jack Ross observes that “the movement of the Old Southwest never fit neatly into the factional categories of the national party.” The left-wing Texas Socialists, for example, supported the essentially “revisionist” agrarian program. They were sympathetic to theChristian Socialistsand sought to recruit ministers to the movement — positions in keeping with many of the party’s more moderate elements. At the same time, they staunchly opposed the successful campaign to recall “Big Bill” Haywood from the party’s National Executive Committee in 1913 over his support for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and sabotage.Similar dynamics played out on organizational questions and white supremacy. Left-wingers dominated the Oklahoma party’s ranks, but for years its social democratic leaders like Branstetter and Ameringer sought to reproduce the more centralized methods of Victor Berger’s Milwaukee organization. Local radicals denounced this “German form of organization” and sought greater organizational decentralization wherever possible.The degree of commitment to interracial organizing did not tend to break down along neatly defined left-right lines either. In general, the Oklahoma Socialists took a firmer stand against white supremacy than their counterparts in Texas and elsewhere. Even the most radical elements of the movement could be weak on the question of racial equality. WhenRebeleditorTom Hickeyand other left-wing Texas Socialists formed a Land Renters’ Union in 1911 they barred blacks from joining the organization.The union eventually organized black and brown tenants, but into separate locals. As Green notes, many of the poor white tenant farmers of the region “pitted themselves against landlords and businessmen on one hand, and against black sharecroppers and brown migrants on the other.” Otherwise radical leaders like Hickey did not combat this racism. Some of them, likeRebelpublisherE. O. Meitzen, were blatant race-baiters and nativists.To their credit, leaders like Ameringer, Branstetter, andTenant Farmereditor Pat Nagle defended the rights of black and brown people and courted their support. In 1912, they and others successfully campaigned to add an explicitly anti-racist plank to the party’s platform through a membership referendum. Two years earlier, in 1910, Oklahoma party leaders campaigned against the Democrats’ successful referendum to disenfranchise black voters in the state. Some party members voted for it, but Green concludes that a majority of Oklahoma Socialists voted against it.In light of these struggles, Ameringer denounced “the bitter race hatred that has been a nightmare to every clear-seeing Socialist working man in the South.” Many rank-and-file Socialists agreed with him. There were some important examples of interracial organizing in the region, particularly among miners and timber workers oriented toward industrial unionism.The BTW, which organized black and white workers in the piney woods spanning west Louisiana and east Texas, was exemplary in this regard. It proved much harder, however, to convince white tenant farmers to unite with blacks in common organizations instead of fearing them as competitors. The movement as a whole was weaker than it should have been as a result.The SP maintained a fairly steady level of membership and electoral strength in the Southwest and interior West until the United States entered World War I in 1917. But the combination of repression and a severe cotton crisis triggered by the war arrested the movement’s growth and set the stage for its eventual defeat.The organized strength of Socialism stirred the region’s ruling classes to wage a reactionary countermovement. Timber workers, miners, and tenant farmers clashed with bosses and landlords in bitter strikes and confrontations. At the same time, left-wing “Reds” in the Oklahoma party took aim at social democratic “Yellows” like Ameringer and Branstetter, and ousted them from their positions in 1913.These dynamics inverted the story that was playing out elsewhere in the movement at the time. As Green observes, the heightening of Southwestern class conflict around 1913 boosted the fortunes of local left-wingers and direct-actionists at the same time the likes of Haywood were being ousted from national leadership positions.The Oklahoma Socialists made solid gains at the ballot box in 1914, when UMW militant Fred Holt stood as the party’s gubernatorial candidate. With the state’s cotton farming districts racked by drought and a collapse in prices, the party waged a robust campaign against the Democrats and Republicans. Holt won 21 percent of the statewide vote, polling more votes than Debs in his 1912 presidential campaign. His coattails, and those of other effective candidates like Nagle, swept a wave of Socialists into office at the state, county, and local levels throughout Oklahoma.While the party made big gains in Oklahoma and held ground in Texas, it did not fare as well elsewhere. In 1914, lumber barons smashed the BTW in Louisiana, which effectively defeated the Socialist movement in the state. At the same time, Democrat-sponsored suffrage restrictions and election “reforms,” combined with the devastating cotton crisis, pushed increasingly desperate tenant farmers to adopt guerrilla tactics.In 1915, an underground conspiratorial organization called theWorking Class Union(WCU) began dynamiting vats in protest of Oklahoma’s tick eradication law, which fell hardest on poor tenants. (The vats were used to dip cattle in arsenic to kill ticks, but only wealthier farmers and cattlemen could afford to comply with the rule.)These and other militant actions like night-riding were understandable, even predictable, responses to economic hardship and political repression. But as Green notes, the turn to social banditry brought repression “where the party had already suffered serious losses as a result of blacklisting campaigns organized by Democratic businessmen, landlords, and politicians.”To its lasting credit, the SP — unlike many of the other parties of the Second International — took a strong stand against entering World War I. Their reward was ruthless repression. The most damaging anti-Socialist measures came from the postmaster general, who removed party papers from the mail, impacting nearly every Socialist periodical of importance in the country. For the movement in rural areas — which relied heavily on the mail to organize, educate, and agitate — the postal crackdown was especially devastating.Oklahoma was the site of the most militant antiwar activity, including a failed armed uprising in 1917 called theGreen Corn Rebellion. The SP was officially against these tactics, but since many of its members were involved in armed resistance the state’s ruling Democrats attacked the Socialists in a fury of patriotic repression. By 1918, the once-mighty Oklahoma Socialist Party was crushed.The party organization dissolved itself out of fear of further repression, and many of its key leaders and militants fled the state. In 1918 alone, Weinstein notes, “some 1,500 of the more than 5,000 Socialist Party locals were destroyed, mostly in small communities” and disproportionately in areas west of the Mississippi. By the time of the 1918–19 split, which decimated the SP and birthed two fractious Communist parties, the movement in Oklahoma and the trans-Mississippi region in general was already crushed by vicious wartime repression.Rural socialism continued to find expression in theNonpartisan Leaguesand Farmer-Labor movements of the Midwest. But over the subsequent decades socialism became a predominantly urban phenomenon, particularly as the Communists and various Trotskyist groups focused much of their attention on workers in the mass production industries.Communists played an important role in the early years of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, as Robin Kelley documents inHammer and Hoe, and the Communist Party made some limited headway among Midwestern farmers, particularly in the Dakotas amid the farm protests of the 1930s. Socialists led the formation of the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union (STFU), founded in 1934 to unite black and white tenants in the SP’s old Southwestern strongholds.The union recruited tens of thousands of members by the late 1930s, but it ultimately could not survive the combined pressures of New Deal farm relief, violent landowner repression, and the growing mechanization of agriculture, which radically reduced the scope of both agricultural wage-labor and farm tenancy. By the latter decades of the twentieth century, the social layers that formed the base of classical American Socialism were in severe decline.Thousands of family farms were permanently wiped out in the 1980s, bringing rural communities down with them. Deindustrialization and the attack on labor decimated the ranks of the UMW and other unions with a rural presence. The economic base of rural Americashiftedlargely from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to the service sector, particularly healthcare and food services.In this sense at least, urban and rural areas have actually grown more alike — potentially making it easier to craft demands and programs that bridge seemingly insurmountable geographical divides. In any case, the dramatic transformation of the American “heartland” means that the contours of democratic-socialist politics in these regions will look very different today.Many rural areas are in a dire state. As Marc Edelman describes in hissobering surveyof rural America, since the 1980s, “Mutual savings banks and credit unions, cooperatives, mom-and-pop businesses, local industries and newspapers, health and elder care facilities, schools, and libraries have all fallen victim to relentless austerity policies or private-equity raiders.” The disintegration of rural communities opened the door to reactionary demagogues like Donald Trump and Markwayne Mullin, who point the finger at everyone except those who really deserve the blame: the corporate interests who have plundered and abandoned Main Street, USA.The Left has a dual imperative to rebuild its base in small-town America. The severe distress and deprivation that prevails demands relief for its own sake. People are suffering, and the Left should do all it can to relieve that suffering.There’s a more practical reason, too: the United States’ system of political representation is structurally biased against urban and metropolitan areas. Organizations like DSA are growing in membership and building power in the nation’s most urbanized districts, but cities often lack the economic and political capacity to solve their own problems. They’ll need support from the states and the federal government, which likely won’t come if rural and small-town representatives aren’t willing to grant it. Consider, for example, the wave of preemption laws right-wing state governments have passed to stop municipalities from raising wages, implementing antidiscrimination ordinances, reining in police power, or building municipal broadband systems.The old Socialist movement made many of its first rural inroads by deftly using mass media, particularly newspapers. Today’s left should attempt to replicate this by developing media aimed specifically at rural and small-town audiences.The decline of local print media has allowed a vacuum for Fox News and right-wing radio hosts to fill, but the Left can reach people who want an alternative to this steady diet of reactionary demagogy. A wave of public school strikes swept GOP-dominated states likeOklahomain 2018–19, which briefly revived a dormant militant tradition and pointed to a potential political opening among educators and other public service workers.The disintegration of rural communities has had terrible social consequences. At the same time, it gives the Left a chance to create even small circles that give people a social outlet and focal point for community life. As Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism, “in many of the rural sections of the Southwest the party local served as a little Socialist community, a sort of surrogate for the declining ‘country community.’”The old Socialists also capitalized on people’s discontent with established Christian denominations that catered to their exploiters. The “prosperity gospel” that is so popular today demands a new social gospel that resonates where evangelical Christianity is a central aspect of daily life.We should link social and spiritual appeals to a program of material demands, including land reform. As Levi Van Santhas argued, a land reform program that challenges concentrated land ownership and ecologically destructive corporate agriculture could bridge geographical divides and underpin a multiracial, working-class alliance.Rural areas are commonly assumed to be monolithically white, but that perception is far from the reality. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere work onfarmsandmeatpacking plants, and substantial communities of Native Americans, blacks, and Latinos live throughout rural America. A strong, consistent message of racial equality must be an integral part of this agenda — not only to combat the racism and nativism of the Right but to appeal to core components of our potential base.In addition to the land question, a left-wing program would support funding for public schools and libraries, widening Medicare/Medicaid eligibility, mental health and substance abuse services, transportation investments that reduce auto dependence, high-speed broadband, and an expansion of the US Postal Service — including reestablishing postal banking to combat predatory check-cashing services and payday lenders. Marginalized urban communities share many of these same interests, which could make it easier to unite periphery and metropole around a common program than it initially appears.We can’t simply transpose what the Socialists did a hundred twenty years ago to our own time. But there is much to learn from this history, particularly when it comes to building a radical movement in apparently inhospitable territory. The legacy of Ameringer, Hall, and Debs can help us turn some of the most seemingly intractable corners of Republican America a deeper shade of red.Chris Maisano is aJacobincontributing editor and a member of Democratic Socialists of America.This doesn’t appear to be a valid email.Thanks for signing up!→Already on our list?

336,4 key takeaways from Oregon’s election,-1.0,46.33,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/11/4-key-takeaways-from-oregons-election.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,oregonlive,25,"A record2.3 million-plusOregon voters had their say in this fall’s general election, deciding races from local ballot measures and city councils tothe U.S. Senate.Here are some of the takeaways from Oregon voters' decisions.Unlike nationally, few Oregon races are undecided after election night.Oregon’s well-oiled vote-by-mail system delivered decisive results in the vast majority of contests Tuesday night. Oregon’ssix contested seats in Congress, its three races for statewide state office, nearly all legislative races and key money measures: all were decided shortly after the balloting deadline, thanks to swift action by voters and election officials.The few key races still pending -- two key Oregon Senate races that will help decide the balance of power in the Legislature, a tight race for Gresham mayor, a relatively minor ballot measure about Portland Water Bureau billing rights -- are worth watching, but don’t remotely approach the national breath-holding over the presidential race.Oregon Democrats' grip on state office is strong.Oregon has tilted blue for some time. But this year’s election results reinforced the state’s Democratic voters' dominance. The statewide votes for former Vice President Joe Biden to become president and incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley to serve another term were overwhelming, as were the votes to install the three Democratic candidates for statewide office -- incumbents Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Treasurer Tobias Read and newcomer Shemia Fagan as secretary of state.Oregonians want people to be free to use drugs.Two ballot measures, one to one to decriminalize possession of most street drugs and the other toallow supervised use of psilocybin, passed overwhelmingly Tuesday. Both are nationally notable, as they mark the first time any state has permitted the non-prosecuted possession or use of substances.To be fair, backers of the measure to decriminalize drugs, many of whom are former addicts with long records of hard-won sobriety, said they want people caught with small amounts of heroin, meth and other drugs to get assessed and treated to end their addiction, not to keep using. But it would not be a crime for them to do so.Multnomah County voters are soft on taxes for causes including parks, libraries, schoolsA global pandemic that has struck Oregon hard in recent this year and torpedoed the U.S. employment market hasn’t stopped Multnomah County voters from endorsing taxes increases or keeping property taxes at current levels to aid kids, library users, parks-goers and the like.Current results show them saying yes to:A newtax to build and upgrade librariesA new parks operating levyA bignew school construction bondFree preschoolfor all the county’s preschoolers-- Betsy Hammmond; betsyhammond@oregonian.com; @OregonianPol",2
337,Nurses question hospitals’ claims they’re contracting coronavirus in the community instead of at work,-4.33,48.33,https://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/12/nurses-question-hospitals-claims-theyre-contracting-coronavirus-in-the-community-instead-of-at-work.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,cleveland,18,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – Over the past several months, hospitals have repeatedly said contact tracing shows the doctors, nurses and other health care workers who’ve acquired COVID-19 are largely being infected through community spread.Leaders from the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals made those assertions during a Nov. 16 news briefing where they announced that hundreds of health care workers and other hospital employeeswere sidelined due to the virus. The claim has also been repeated by leaders from other Ohio hospitals who’ve appeared at Gov. Mike DeWine’s coronavirus briefings.Yet those assertions have puzzled and disheartened nurses who are at the front lines of the pandemic.They question how hospitals can pinpoint where they acquired a virus that is so widespread, and they contend it’s just as likely they were infected while treating COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, nurses feel that suggesting they’re getting the virus through community spread insinuates they’re being careless once they’re off the clock.“Every time someone from a hospital is talking, they seem to want to throw in that this is all community spread, that health care workers are not getting [COVID-19] in the hospital,” said Brandon Marlow, a labor representative from the Ohio Nurses Association. “It just seems very curious, why it’s a consistent message they feel they need to give.”Marlow said he isn’t sure why hospitals continue to say employees are being infected outside of work. He assumes it could be related to liability reasons, and said several hospitals have made the same assertions in private meetings with the ONA.However, several of Cleveland’s largest health systems said they are offering paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19 without requiring them to use vacation or paid time off.Data on the topic is scarce, although one study published in The Lancet foundfrontline health care workers were at higher riskfor contracting COVID-19 than the general community.Doug Meredith, an ICU nurse at Cleveland Clinic Akron General, said health care workers who are around coronavirus patients every day know the severity of the virus and take precautions to protect themselves outside of work. He said it’s discouraging to hear hospitals suggest employees are getting infected elsewhere.“I think [nurses] do take it personally. They do feel like their professionalism is being questioned, because of what they do outside of work,” he said. “Because I think we all try to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Cleveland said they trust their employees and do not believe they’re being careless in the community. Instead, they feel the high number of employees who’ve contracted the virus is the result of a spike in infections across Ohio.“Our caregivers are highly professional, and contracting COVID-19 outside the hospital is not a reflection of their professionalism, but a reflection of how contagious this virus can be in the community,” a UH spokesman said.How do they know?Hospitals say they’ve been conducting contact tracing when an employee tests positive for COVID-19 to identify the source of infection. Leadership for the Clinic, MetroHealth and UH said during the Nov. 16 news briefing that the rise in infections among employees largely mirrored the spike in coronavirus cases in Northeast Ohio.But the ONA is skeptical the hospitals can truly identify where and when someone was infected, Marlow said. Even though employees are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking other precautions in the hospital, there’s still a risk they’re being exposed.“What [hospitals] would like to say is that because all these measures are in place, there’s no way somebody could be getting it in the hospital,” he said. “And I don’t know if that’s a conclusion a reasonable person could come to.”Marlow said the ONA has repeatedly asked for data that shows employees are being infected in hospitals but has yet to receive any such proof. The Clinic, MetroHealth and UH did not provide any specific contact-tracing data to cleveland.com.UH said roughly 4.5% of its caregivers have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. That compares favorably to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13.4% of U.S. health care workers have tested positive. Less than 1% of the UH cases have been linked to exposure at work, a spokesman said.All three health systems have said they’ve conducted robust contact tracing and have protocols in place to protect employees, such as temperature checks for visitors, mask requirements and social-distancing measures.Meredith has not tested positive for COVID-19, but some of his colleagues have. He said he’s not aware of any contact tracing that took place after those exposures.Nurses are already dealing with skeptics in the community who claim the virus isn’t that serious and the pandemic is overblown. So it’s frustrating to hear hospitals tell nurses that they’re acquiring it outside of a workplace where they’re constantly interacting with COVID-19 patients, Meredith said.“It’s kind of like you’re hearing it from both ends, and you’re stuck in the middle,” he said. “Sometimes you feel like you’re completely on your own.”The liability questionEarlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in Ohio’s House of Representatives sought to address the issue of workplace liability through H.B. 573, which proposed making COVID-19 an occupational disease under the workers’ compensation law. Rep. Lisa Sobecki of Toledo and Rep. Kristin Boggs of Columbus introduced it March 23, the same day Ohio’s stay-at-home order went into effect.Yet the bill never got a hearing after being referred to the House Insurance Committee on May 5. Sobecki said she isn’t sure why it failed to gain any traction, although the state’s Republican lawmakers have consistently pushed back on any legislation surrounding the coronavirus and evensought to strip DeWine’s authorityto issue statewide public health orders.Sobecki said she’s unaware of any outside lobbying to prevent the bill from becoming law. But she said she heard from constituent groups who supported the legislation, and feels it’s important for Ohio to stand behind the essential workers who’ve put themselves in harm’s way throughout the pandemic.“We haven’t seen bills that help everyday Ohioans in the middle of a pandemic,” she said. “It really saddens me.”She plans to reintroduce a new version of HB 573 once the Ohio Legislature begins a new session in 2021.“This is not going to go away. The pandemic doesn’t stop on Dec. 31,” Sobecki said. “This pandemic is going to continue until we can get the vaccine to Ohioans.”Cleveland health systems said they’ve nevertheless taken steps to support employees who contract COVID-19. The Clinic is giving its employees paid time off if they contract COVID-19, regardless of where they’re infected. Those employees are not required to dip into their own PTO, a Clinic spokeswoman said.“There’s a lot of positive things [the Clinic] is doing as well, to try to take care of workers who are off with COVID,” Meredith acknowledged.UH employees who acquire COVID-19 at work qualify for workers’ comp. If they’re infected through community spread, they may use the health system’s leave and short-term disability programs, a UH spokesman said.Marlow said other Ohio hospitals have similar programs in place to help employees. Those efforts are appreciated, but the ONA also wants hospitals to provide robust contact-tracing data and give more weight to the possibility employees are being infected at work.“I think what makes the most amount of sense is to not pretend once you walk into a hospital, it’s a magical place where it’s no longer the community and you can no longer contract the virus,” Marlow said.",2
338,The fall of Afghanistan in 2021 is the result of years of American delusion,-5.67,37.67,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/fall-afghanistan-2021-result-years-american-delusion-n1276883,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,msnbc,25,"On Sunday morning, Taliban fighters captured Afghanistan'sBagram Airfield— the symbol and source of U.S. power projection in the region for 20 years — releasing thousands of prisoners. Within hours, Taliban fighters were trickling into the city center with little resistance. The Taliban had already swept in andcaptured the capital city of Kabul. By nightfall, President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, and the Taliban's reconquest of Afghanistan was complete.The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before.Last Monday in Doha, Qatar — the site of fruitless peace talks with the Taliban across now two administrations — the U.S. envoy to those talks announced his intention to ""press the Taliban"" for an end to their offensive across Afghanistan. It was a naive statement even at the time, and it hasn't improved in the week since.The Taliban had already been pressing at the gates of several provincial Afghan capitals. Having withdrawn troops from the country, the U.S. lacked whatever leverage it once had in negotiations with the insurgent group. But the White House appeared confident. ""Ultimately, our view is that the Afghan security forces have the equipment, numbers and training to fight back that will strengthen their position at the negotiating table,""White House press secretary Jen Psaki insistedTuesday.What negotiating table? The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. By the middle of last week, it was downright fanciful. And in the hours that passed after Psaki made this ponderous pronouncement, the Taliban took one city after another. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. In the process,Taliban fighters took controlofmillions of dollars' worthof vehicles, helicopters, offensive weaponry and advanced military infrastructure.""The Taliban,"" Psakiobserved last week, ""has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community."" This was hardly an errant thought. On Aug. 8, the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital had admonished the Taliban for sacrificing the ""international legitimacy"" they claim to want. ""They should devote their energy to the #PeaceProcess,"" read a statement from the Kabul embassy's Twitter account, ""not a military campaign. #CeasefireNow."" For now, the ""promise of hashtag"" remains unrealized.Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents.The White House's irresolvable confusion notwithstanding, the Taliban had made it perfectly clear what their intentions were.As the insurgency retook Afghan territory, it resumed its abhorrent treatment of women and girls. Taliban members are reported to have targeted women with death foroperating in professionsorwearing clothingthat offends the former leaders of the Islamic emirate. It has begunshuttering girls' schoolswith the intention of keeping them closed for good and relegating their students back to the shadows of Afghan society.And according to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban have been summarily executing Afghan civilianslinked to the government— a development Secretary of State Antony Blinken meekly said was ""troubling."" Already, the Afghans who put their lives on the line to assist the U.S. Army over the last decades arereported to have been beheaded, a grotesque dereliction of our duty to the Afghans who foolishly believed in the U.S.These were the very same people we spent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process, only to abandon the charade and the country with it when it became clear that the Taliban weren't going to let us take the easy way out.As recently as July, President Joe Biden insisted that it was ""not inevitable"" that the Taliban would retake control of the country. ""The likelihood that there's going to be a Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely,""Biden reassured the public. By the middle of last week, intelligence officials who had thought it would take the Taliban a year to complete their reconquest of the country revised their estimates.Kabul would be cut off in the next 30 days, they warned. The city and the U.S.-backed government would fall to the Taliban before the year's end.But even that was deliriously optimistic. Collapse came not in weeks but over the course of a single weekend. Kabul was all but surrounded not in 30 days but in 72 hours after these revised estimates were made public.The U.S., which had hoped to preserve its diplomatic presence in its embassy — it evensent 3,000 troopsto ensure that prospect — summarily abandoned the place and evacuated all but a skeleton crew. There may not have even been enough time to carry out orders to burn sensitivedocuments, agency logos and even U.S. flags— lest the American public have to confront the wages of our defeat on their television screens.The Biden White House's belief in a Taliban that existed only in their own minds was so total that one of the administration's last, desperate gambits was to beg the insurgency for mercy.The New York Timesreported as recently as Thursday that the U.S. envoy in Doha had a new objective: to seek assurances from the Taliban that they would leave America's embassy in peace. The administration was even reported to have dangled ""financial aid and other assistance"" to the ""future Afghan government,"" a euphemism for a Taliban-run enterprise.These were the very same people we spent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process.Given the Taliban's commitment to violence and its refusal to renounce its ties to Islamist terrorist groups, such assurances — even if they were forthcoming — wouldn't be worth a dime. Such a deal would only have legitimized an entity the Biden administration insists is illegitimate by virtue of the tactics it is using to seize power. And in the end, it would only have preserved a diplomatic presence in a capital city operated by a government Washington doesn't recognize. What were they thinking?With the near total collapse of the Afghan armed forces, the Biden administration was left to articulate its last, most demoralizing argument in favor of total withdrawal — we are powerless to alter the course of events and should accept our utter futility.Over the weekend, thepresident released a written statementoutlining the rationale that led to our unilateral declaration of defeat. ""One more year, or five more years, of U.S. military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,"" Biden insisted. The president's dubious exercise in clairvoyance notwithstanding, a review of even the recent past doesn't support this kind of fatalism.The notion that the Afghan conflict looked the same in 2021 as it did in 2016 is downright hallucinatory. The U.S. and NATO formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan at the end of 2014. In the years that followed, the American mission had been limited to support operations for local forces, many of which took place from behind the high walls of U.S.-run facilities. To the extent that America's modest, affordable and low-risk footprint in Afghanistan maintained the peace, it was largely as a deterrent force that dissuaded the Taliban from embarking on the broad offensive now underway.The lastAmerican combat-related deathin Afghanistan occurred on Feb. 8, 2020. Every U.S. soldier's death in service to the country is tragic, and their sacrifices must be honored. But to call that an unacceptable level of risk calls into question U.S. deployments to places like Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain and Kuwait, whereU.S. soldiers also lost their liveslast year.And yet, the happy fallacy Biden may come to regret putting his faith in most is the notion that the U.S. was desperate to dissolve our commitments to the Afghan people and would celebrate that achievement. Where are the sighs of relief from a grateful public? Where are the celebrations? If Brookings Institution scholars Madiha Afzal and Israa Saber are right, the Biden administration has misread the national mood.""The public seems to be partly ambivalent, partly divided on the correct course of action,""they wrote in a careful dissection of recent pollingon the American presence in Afghanistan. ""What's clear is that the common refrain in policy debates that 'Americans want out' is not accurate and should not be presented as the driving force for efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan.""That idea — the notion that the American public longed for this humiliation — may prove to be just another delusion. And a terribly costly one, at that.Noah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary Magazine.",1
339,Portland’s Independent Police Review opens more than 40 investigations into alleged police misconduct at protests,0.33,49.0,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portlands-independent-police-review-opens-more-than-40-investigations-into-alleged-police-misconduct-at-protests.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,oregonlive,25,"Portland’s independent police oversight body is investigating more than 40 complaints related to protest policing since June, according to the director.The Independent Police Review’s quarterly report offers the first look at the swelling number of complaints against Portland police at the nightly protests. The city’s complaint process is the public’s main avenue to hold police accountable for specific actionsThe report, which covers April, May and June, was released at a time when the future of the oversight office is in doubt. A proposal for a new oversight system was unanimously referred to the Nov. 3 ballot by the City Council at the end of July.The vast majority of the Independent Police Review investigations are related to allegations of unnecessary force by police at the protests, director Ross Caldwell said. The office also has some open complaints about the general conduct of officers interacting with Portlanders at protests.Protests against police brutality and systemic racism began in Portland in late May after George Floyd died when a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The protests have routinely drawn hundreds, and sometimes thousands of people.The protests quickly became a flashpoint between police and protesters. Some protesters scrawled graffiti, broke windows and threw things at officerson May 29. The night culminated in forceful dispersals by police after some protesters looted luxury stores and a Target, and lit a fire inside of an office at the downtown Justice Center. The city responded withseveral days of curfewsand much-criticized tactics of hitting Portlanders with batons and deploying tear gas, pepper spray, stun grenades, impact munitions and an ear-splitting warning sound that caught other demonstrators and journalists in the middle.Police havecontinuedto use force since the early days of protest, as have protesters continued to tag buildings with graffiti andthrow various objects at officers, including water bottles, eggs and fireworks.Federal judges havebarred or limited use of many of the tacticsunless police say they believe life or public safety are at risk. Police have more recently used batons and lines of officers to push people back at protests and occasionally,used tear gas and munitions after declaring civil disturbances.Portland’s Citizen Review Committee, an advisory body to Portland police and the Independent Police Review condemned the police tactics in a June statement.“While these demonstrations are first and foremost about the worth of Black lives, the response to them is also illuminating a troubling pattern of police violence against protesters that interferes with public safety and freedom of speech,” the statement said.Sgt. Brent Maxey, an 18-year veteran of Portland police,told KGW in an interview last Thursdaythat people who are not engaging in unlawful conduct have been subjected to force by Portland police at protests.In June alone, the office received 185 such complaints, more than in March, April and May combined. At least 113 of those contacts were “directly related to protest activity,” according to the quarterly report. Some of those complaints were about the same incident, Caldwell said.While the Independent Police Review averaged 6.3 “intake investigations” a day in April and May, that number jumped to 22.5 a day in June, the report says. While intake investigations are preliminary to assess if the group wants to move forward, Caldwell said the 14-day process includes interviewing people who filed complaints, pulling police reports and identifying involved officers.The Independent Police Review investigations represent a fraction of the thousands of complaints filed since the protests began. Many of those complaints were form letters listing demands the Independent Police Review has no power to enact, like abolishing the Portland Police Bureau, Caldwell said.The office also has a narrow definition of what it can investigate. Complaints related to the conduct of officers who work for agencies assisting Portland police are forwarded to the employing agency, although none have an equivalent oversight body. Caldwell said many of the forwarded complaints were aboutfederal officersand theMultnomah County Sheriff’s Office.While Caldwell said people filing complaints have struggled to identify officers or their agencies at times, he said the investigators often pinpoint the information after reviewing reports and protest footage.Caldwell said his office canonly investigate community allegations that Portland police officers have violated bureau directives.The sharp increase in protest-related complaints along with others unrelated to protests, drastically increased the oversight body’s workload, Caldwell said.Floyd’s killing, “combined with the numerous killings of Black people by police that came both before and after, exposed previously unaware community members to the inequities built into the system and galvanized an already passionate, vocal population into taking sustained action,” the report says.The report called for systemic change and increased accountability to strengthen the current system.Independent Police Review, which is housed in the city auditor’s office, lacks direct access to reports from police, further complicating its ability to investigate police actions.While the office has a voting member on the board that recommends disciplinary actions, the chief of police and Mayor Ted Wheeler, who serves as the police commissioner, have the final say. However, the police union can challenge discipline to a state arbitrator, who has the power to overturn it.“Police oversight in Portland needs the support of its leaders, policymakers and the community to better address the barriers to full transparency, independence and authority necessary for any oversight system to flourish,” the report says.State law and the police union agreement limits what information about investigations the Independent Police Review can turn over to the public.“These two constraints mean few cases are ever made public, and when they are it creates the opportunity for an arbitrator to overturn the decision if they conclude the disclosure violated the labor contract,” the report says.-- K.

340,An ex-student of Carol Dweck identified a new mindset for success — Quartz at Work,0.33,50.0,https://qz.com/work/1883138/an-ex-student-of-carol-dweck-identified-a-new-mindset-for-success/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,qz,25,"We all know someone who barrels into tasks without putting much thought into it. Just give them a directive—a household repair job, a homework assignment, a data entry project—and they dive right in.Then there are others who can’t so much as wash the dishes or make a sales call without first devising an optimal plan of attack. They go to work every day not assuming that the accumulation of their labor will one day lead to a promotion. Rather, they’re going to analyze how promotions are awarded, to whom they go and why, and develop a road plan to check off the boxes that should get them that pay raise and prestige faster.The planner types have what the psychologist Patricia Chen, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, and Carol Dweck, thenoted Stanford University psychologistand Chen’s former adviser, have identified as a strategic mindset.“Those with a strategic mindset tend to ask themselves strategy-eliciting questions, such as, What can I do to help myself? How else can I do this? Or, is there a way to do this even better?” Chen tells Quartz. “People who ask these strategic-mindset questions tend to generate and apply more and better strategies that end up making them more effective than others.”In a new paper,published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), lead author Chen and a team of researchers, including Dweck, assert that a strategic mindset “uniquely predicts how much people report actively using strategies and, in turn, how effective they are at pursuing goals across life domains.”Crucially, they note it’s not enough just to have mastered a methodology for conquering a goal, or to know when you should try other means to reach your end. Nor is it enough to simply value the process of thinking about how you think (what psychologists call metacognition).When you have a strategic mindset, you actually use multiple strategies and keep track of what’s working for you, or not, habitually.The paper reported on three studies in the US involving more than 800 adults. First the researchers sent surveys to more than 350 students with queries about how often they step back to assess the ways they study for different classes or whether their study methods give them an advantage. “The higher they scored on a strategic mindset, the more they reported planning, generating strategies, monitoring, and adjusting their techniques during learning, and, in turn, the higher they scored in their GPAs,” says Chen.A second study—one that asked randomly selected people to complete an online questionnaire—showed a correlation between having a strategic mindset and making greater progress toward a life goal, whether at work, school, the gym, or anywhere else.The third study described in the paper is most compelling, if also messy. In a lab test, participants were presented with 30 eggs and asked to separate the whites and yolks in under two minutes. They were told that whoever separated the most eggs and collected the highest volume of egg whites would receive a $100 prize.“Although this task does not seem like the kind of task that most people will encounter in modern life or the modern workplace,” the authors note, “it was carefully designed to meet the following criteria: The task was relatively unfamiliar and challenging for most participants; it could be accomplished with different methods, some of which were more effective than others; and there were clear performance metrics.”To discover whether there might be a causal relationship between a strategic mindset and goal achievement, some participants in the egg-separation study were randomly selected to be primed to think about a strategic mindset by reading and summarizing a Lifehack article about the concept, while the control group read an article about an unrelated topic. The researchers hypothesized that the first group would be more apt to explore several ways to speedily and cleanly remove the golden yolk from its sea of albumen, and to evaluate their methods along the way. And they did.You can probably guess which bunch were the fastest at the job.  What’s more, when participants were given eight extra eggs they could use to practice if they felt like it, those who had strategizing on their mind were more likely to do so.Don’t worry, Chen and her team controlled for any casual bakers in the group. Each person’s experience with egg separating under normal conditions—i.e., as cooks at home—was first measured and taken into account in the study’s scoring rubric. Everyone in the study also watched a demo of a common “but suboptimal” method for separating eggs, the authors write:the back-and-forth sifting techniquerecommended by typical meringue or custard recipes that call for egg separating. The psychologists wanted to see whether people would default to that option and never improve upon it, or look for smarter, quicker methods.In the study appendix, researchers labeled the five dominant more innovative techniques they observed in the lab, like Hand Straining (“letting egg white run through fingers while holding the yolk back”); the Break-and-Grab (“cracking eggs into a bowl and then removing the yolks with hand, tool, or eggshell”); and the Pincer (“partially cracking open the egg, allowing only the egg white to fall out whilst holding the yolk in”).Chen says her future research will investigate why and how some people develop strategic mindsets and others demonstrate less of this trait, instead going through life passively or even blindly, she says. Without a strategic mindset, it may be easier for a person to become frustrated with a task, or to give up entirely—an unfortunate outcome when someone wants to, say, quit smoking for health reasons, or learn to code in order to become more competitive in the job market.There may be a clue in Chen’s own life experience as to how the mindset is inculcated. When she was young, Chen says, her mother would regularly point out people or systems that were working ineffectively. Running errands in Singapore, her mother would say to Chen and her sister, “Look at what that person is doing. Do you think that’s the best way of doing it? Can you think of a better way?” Chen recalls.“She would ask us, ‘What do you think they could do to make this better’ for their customers, or students, or people? And she’d make us think about the answers and brainstorm multiple answers to these questions,” says Chen. In time, running through that process became second nature to her.People who didn’t grow up with that kind of nudging from a parent or teacher probably can still develop the same habits.Dweck’s famous researchabout the growth mindset is proof of this potential. “Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset,” as Dweck once explained in theHarvard Business Review. “They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.”The growth mindset conceit is widely praised—if not always practiced—in the corporate world. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella claims hisembrace of itserved as a foundational principle in rebuilding the company’s culture. Dweck has been name-checked by both former US president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. Her theory has become so popular that Dweck herself hashad to debunk common misconceptionsabout what it isand isn’t.In contrast, the concept of a strategic mindset is still in the early stages of research. Chen says she and Dweck have spent a lot of time discussing how a strategic mindset differs from a growth mindset, and concluded that the two frameworks complement each other. “Both mindsets can be helpful in moments of challenge or difficulty, but in different ways,” says Chen. “The strategic mindset motivates strategy, while the growth mindset promotes effort, investment, and persistence, which may or may not involve initiating different or better strategies.”Combing both ideas ought to be powerful, at least in theory. Imagine someone is pursuing a long-term goal, says Chen. “Even if they believe that their abilities can be developed, people may not necessarily think about how best to develop their abilities and channel their efforts. And we certainly believe that simply exerting yourself can become discouraging if people simply double down on wrong and unproductive strategies.”Enter the strategic mindset, she says, which “can motivate people to search for and try out new strategies, maybe seek out experts, maybe consult with mentors, and so on.”The team is conducting studies with preschool children, college students, students, and other adults to better understand how to cultivate this mindset, she says. One of her earlier papers, published in 2017,has already demonstratedthat a 15-minute intervention that asked students to reflect on how they craft a study plan led to better grades, lifting B+ students into the A range. More data about what else could work is still to come, but Chen suggests that teaching someone else about the strategic mindset, or just talking about it, might help a person internalize the process.What’s most important, she says, is to question your own strategies when you’re faced with a tough challenge or aspiring to make a personal change. “Even if it’s to be a happier person, or be a more optimistic person, or to relax more,” she says, “there is no harm in asking yourself,  ‘How else can I do this?'”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2

Over the last decade or so, a number of studies have shown the planet's oceans to be home to a lot more methane than scientists previously thought.RelatedStudy: Models underestimate amount of carbon absorbed by Earth's oceansArctic Ocean acidification will be worse than scientists thoughtCoral parents pass algae to their offspring to help cope with climate changeInterestingly, studies suggest very little of that methane is making it into the atmosphere.AdvertisementAccording to the latest study, an abundance of methane-hungry microbial communities on the bottom of the ocean are responsible for keeping much of that methane locked up in marine ecosystems.Without these microbes, scientists surmise Earth's atmosphere would host more methane -- making it even warmer than it already is.When scientists surveyed microbe communities surrounding seven geologically distinct seafloor seeps, they found the group colonizing carbonate rocks was responsible for the highest rates of methane consumption ever recorded.""The microbes in these carbonate rocks are acting like a methane bio filter consuming it all before it leaves the ocean,"" senior study author Peter Girguis, professor of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University, said in a press release.Though carbonate rocks are common on the ocean floor, they only sometimes form the kind of porous, chimney-like structures found rising from the seabed at a deep sea site just off the coast of Point Dume, California.That's where scientists found the record-setting microbes.""We measured the rate at which the microbes from the carbonates eat methane compared to microbes in sediment,"" said Girguis. ""We discovered the microbes living in the carbonates consume methane 50 times faster than microbes in the sediment.""Advertisement""We often see that some sediment microbes from methane-rich mud volcanoes, for example, may be five to ten times faster at eating methane, but 50 times faster is a whole new thing. Moreover, these rates are among the highest, if not the highest, we've measured anywhere,"" Girguis said.""These rates of methane oxidation, or consumption, are really extraordinary, and we set out to understand why,"" co-author Jeffrey J. Marlow, former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, also said in the release.By efficiently capturing methane as it seeps out of seafloor vents and converting it into bicarbonate, microbes help construct these unusual carbonate rock chimneys.Scientists suspect the carbonate chimneys they call home -- and their mineral surroundings -- are key to their unprecedented metabolic capabilities. Researchers found some of the microbial communities colonizing carbonate rocks are surrounded by pyrite, which is electrically conductive.Efficient electron exchange, the researchers hypothesized, may explain why these microbes can eat so much methane so quickly.""These very high rates are facilitated by these carbonates which provide a framework for the microbes to grow,"" Girguis said.""The system resembles a marketplace where carbonates allow a bunch of microbes to aggregate in one place and grow and exchange -- in this case, exchange electrons -- which allows for more methane consumption,"" Girguis said.AdvertisementGirguis, Marlow and their research partners recently recreated a diversity of seafloor environs in the lab and are now studying how microbes metabolize methane under varying conditions.Researchers hope their ongoing experiments will reveal how different characteristics of the carbonate environment influence metabolic rates among the methane-eating microbes.""First, we need to understand how these microbes sustain their metabolic rate, whether they're in a chimney or in the sediment. And we need to know this in our changing world in order to build our predictive power,"" Marlow said.""Once we clarify how these many interconnected factors come together to turn methane to rock, we can then ask how we might apply these anaerobic methane-eating microbes to other situations, like landfills with methane leaks,"" he said.",2

And, like so many others, she's also facing eviction at the end of the month should Congress allow afederal eviction moratoriumto expire Dec. 31.One report says anywhere from 30 million to 40 million American renterscould be evictedfrom rental housing by the end of 2020. No state will be untouched, the report warns, and people of color are especially vulnerable.Hodge worries about herself and about her 9-year-old granddaughter, whom she's raising.""I also don't have anywhere to go because places are so high and I don't have much income,"" Garnell told CNN.In Houston, Texas, although 29-year-old mom Kenia Madrigal eventually found a home with the charitable help of others, she stared down real fear earlier this year as she tucked her four children in for the evening in a small SUV that had become the family's home.For a time, her mind had swirled with questions: How could she possibly keep her kids safe from the coronavirus, which hurtled them into crisis when she lost first her job and then the mobile home she had been renting for two years? How could she keep them safe from unseen dangers the nighttime brings? How could she shield them from the emotional wounds homelessness inflicts?""You have to go day by day,"" Madrigal said. ""You never know what the next night will bring, or the next day.""A day after the nation recorded yet another record number of COVID-19 deaths, a second coronavirus vaccine received emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The decision paves the way for the vaccine to help fight a pandemic that's now killed nearly 314,000 Americans.The emergency authorization of Moderna's vaccine comes just a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to a similar vaccine by drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Prior to the FDA's decision, Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees Operation Warp Speed and the federal effort to distribute vaccines, said the government was preparing to ship almost 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to 3,285 locations in the week following approval.To show trust in the vaccine's safety, Vice President Mike Pence on Friday received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on live television. In doing so, Pence became the highest-ranking U.S. official to receive the vaccine.During the broadcast, Pence celebrated the milestone as ""a medical miracle"" that could eventually contain the raging pandemic.Second lady Karen Pence and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received shots during the White House event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Later in the day, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also received the first doses.Meanwhile, Congress on Friday pushed off a decision on a new coronavirus relief package by passing a two-day stop-gap funding bill, averting a government shutdown and buying itself two more days to negotiate final terms of the $900 billion aid package.Since the measure is looped into a $1.4 trillion government spending bill, Congress originally had until midnight Friday to approve the bill and avoid a government shutdown.If approved, the proposed aid could deliver additional ""paycheck protection"" subsidies to businesses, an additional $300 per week to the unemployed, and stimulus payments to most Americans, likely in the amount of $600.As the federal government continues negotiations, California has turned into the newepicenter of the crisis in the United States.The state reported more than 50,000 new cases on two separate days this week, a surge that's already overwhelming hospitals — statewide, California reported3 percent availability of ICU bedson Thursday.""I've seen more deaths in the last nine months in my ICU than I have in my entire 20-year career,"" Amy Arlund, a nurse at Kaiser Permanente Fresno Medical Center, told the AP.In many California counties, intensive care unit capacity is at less than 1 percent, and morgue space is also running out.New York, the original epicenter of the virus, broke its own record Thursday for most positive tests reported on a single day, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday.The number, 12,697, exceeded the previous high of 11,571 on April 14, when about one-ninth as many tests were being conducted.The total number of coronavirus cases in the United States topped 17 million on Thursday, just five days after the country surpassed 16 million. India is the only country that has more than half the number of cases reported in the U.S.At least 2,878 new coronavirus deaths and 242,838 new daily cases were reported in the United States on Friday, according to aWashington Post database. Over the past seven days, the United States has averaged more than 219,300 cases each day.As of Saturday, 48 states and Puerto Rico remained above the positive testing rate recommended by theWorld Health Organizationto safely reopen. To safely reopen, the WHO recommends states remain at 5 percent or lower for at least 14 days. Currently, only Hawaii, Vermont and Washington, D.C. are under that threshold.More than 17.47 million people in the United States had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Saturday morning, and more than 313,700 have died, according to atally by Johns Hopkins University.Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.",2

344,Explainer: Title IX change for transgender students after Bostock,-7.0,46.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/the-19th-explains-what-did-title-ix-changes-just-do-for-trans-students/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,19thnews,25,"Last week, the Department of Educationissueda new interpretation of Title IX, extending protections to transgender students and rejecting the direction that had been taken by the Trump administration.“The Department makes clear that all students — including LGBTQ+ students — deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive in schools that are free from discrimination,” U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.The federal-level interpretation comes as statehouses have passed legislation discriminatory and sometimes harmful toward transgender youths, but its effects might not be immediately noticeable.The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.Here’s what the new guidance means for transgender students and school administrators.Title IX of the Education Amendments, enacted in 1972 and signed into law by former President Richard Nixon, prohibits discrimination on the “basis of sex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance.”Erin Buzuvis, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of law at Western New England University, said that Title IX is a statute, enforced by regulations. And then one level below that, there are interpretations.You have been subscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]to subscribe.This email address might not be capable of receiving emails (according toBouncer). You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected].“In terms of interpreting Title IX, that is the purview of the administration in power,” Buzuvis said. “It’s a matter of saying, ‘This is how we’re exercising the statute.’”The Education Department’s recent interpretation stems from Bostock v. Clayton County, a case the U.S. Supreme Court decided last year. The ruling upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and protected employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.“The Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion and discrimination — and our LGBTQ+ students have the same rights and deserve the same protections,” Cardona said.But interpretations can be reversed from one administration to the next, leaving protections shaky. A change to a statute’s regulations, Buzuvis said, would have a more lasting effect — but also take a longer period of time to establish. The Trump administration’s regulations related to sexual assault, passed in 2018 and enacted in 2020, were the first Title IX guidance to go through a formal notice-and-comment process since 1997.Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that it was already illegal to discriminate against transgender people, but that the particulars of who was protected under Title IX were heavily contested.“This announcement now means that transgender youth know definitively that it is illegal for schools to discriminate against them,” Heng-Lehtinen said. “It is a very big deal and puts a harder point on it. It means that they know the federal government has their backs.”LGBTQ+ students often face disproportionate bullying, harassment and victimization — which has been exacerbated during COVID-19. While learning remotely, students haven’t had access to school-based mental health services and other supports. Over the past year,42 percentof LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide and 94 percent said politics has also impacted their mental well-being, according to  the Trevor Project, an organization dedicated to suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth.“If you’re a transgender student in school right now and a teacher is harassing you because you’re trans or the school is shutting you out of certain programs, now you’ll be able to file a complaint against that and be in a much stronger position to win against the school,” Heng-Lehtinen said.With the protections no longer ambiguous, Heng-Lehtinen said, schools that do not reinforce protections for transgender students face a greater chance of losing federal funding. Heng-Lehtinen said he anticipates many schools will update their policies in response to the new interpretation.“There’s still a lot more to do to make sure schools are really safe,” Heng-Lehtinen said, “but this is a big step forward.”Under the Trump administration, the Education Departmenthad issued guidancesaying that the Supreme Court ruling did not offer protections to transgender students. Title IX, the administration argued, did not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.In fact, the Trump administration threatened last year to withold federal aid from schools that allowed transgender athletes to participate in sports. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in April, and under Biden, the Department of Justicerevoked supportfor a lawsuit challenging the rights of two Black trans track runners in Connecticut to compete.David Hinojosa, director of the educational opportunities project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that protections for transgender students had been in limbo for the past four years and that the new guidance would instruct school districts on what to do.“Having worked for school districts, albeit briefly, I know that school districts pay attention to guidance from the Education Department,” Hinojosa said. “It could have far-reaching implications as school districts revisit, revise policies or face potential complaints.”About a dozen states this year introduced bills that wouldlimit trans health care for kids, and at least 19 states are also considering bills that wouldlimit trans youth participation in sports.The clarification doesn’t have an immediate legal impact on undoing any of those state laws. What it does, though, is signal to the states that there will be consequences if they try to test the protections of Title IX, Buzuvis said.Most school districts and colleges and universities receive some kind of federal money. The new clarification puts many of them at risk of having to decide whether to receive federal funding or break state law.The Education Department “has never revoked funding under Title IX,” Buzuvis said. “Infractions are usually one-on-one with institutions, not entire states. And institutions typically adjust their policies moving forward to avoid that kind of sanction.”If the federal government does revoke funding to an entire state, that would be unprecedented, she said.“Honestly, what’s going to rock my world is when an actual enforcement matter comes up,” she said.It appears so. The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was introduced in majority-Republican statehouses, including in Montana, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Meanwhile, mostly Democratic lawmakers in more than 10 states have filed at least 20 bills that would add protections for LGBTQ+ people.Politics, more than legal implications, appears to be driving these bills, Hinojosa said.“These legislators don’t care,” Hinojosa said. “They just want to rally their political bases. They’re not writing the checks that have to defend against the civil rights violations. The taxpayers do.”Transgender rights, specifically those relating to transgender girls’ participation in school sports, havelargely become a litmus testfor Republicans running for office. Many conservatives have voiced concerns that trans women will have an unfair advantage against cisgender women.Idaho was the first state to pass legislation barring transgender women from joining women’s sports teams (though its enforcement was halted by a federal judge). Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee followed suit.And according to arecent pollconducted by Politico and Morning Consult, about 74 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats support this type of ban.Some states receive a significant amount of federal funding, up to hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases, Hinojosa said. Even the loss of that funding might not be enough to incentivize a change in state laws.“I don’t know how much these states are willing to dig their heels in,” Hinojosa said. “They seem to have a no-holds-barred approach to these issues, so there’s no real way of telling.”From the Collection",2

But a new project from Getty Images and GLAAD aims to improve the situation.Getty -- which provides images to media companies, advertising agencies, and publications, including-- and the LGBTQ+ media organization today launched the LGBTQ+ Guidebook for Inclusive Visual Storytelling, which gives brands and businesses practical recommendations for confidently making more inclusive visual choices when depicting the broader LGBTQ+ community. Created as part of an ongoing collaboration between Getty and GLAAD, the guidebook is a direct response to Getty research that found overall LGBTQ+ visual representation remains low and is often stereotypical. It follows last December's release of theGetty Images and GLAAD Transgender Guidelines,designed to support Getty Images and iStock photographers and videographers in their efforts to better represent the diversity of the transgender community, addressing terminology, cliches to avoid, and how to create a safe and welcoming set.""While we know that increased representation positively impacts increased acceptance, our research has also shown that LGBTQ+ individuals remain grossly underrepresented in media,"" Tristen Norman, head of creative insights for the Americas at Getty Images and iStock, said in a press release. ""And even when this community is represented, businesses and media rely too heavily upon stereotypical, inauthentic imagery.""Furthermore, our research suggests that LGBTQ+ people in countries with less LGBTQ+ representation in the visuals that surround them, including media and advertising, actually report experiencing more anti-LGBTQ discrimination and bias -- for example, in Germany, where representation is lower, discrimination is higher, as opposed to in the U.S. Which is to say that authentic imagery which accurately and positively captures the nuances of this diverse community is not only needed, but can have a positive impact globally.""Getty's 2021Visual GPSsurvey found that only 21 percent of global respondents said they saw LGBTQ+ people represented regularly or frequently in visuals (the number for the U.S. was somewhat higher, about one-fourth). The global respondents said 30 percent of such visuals depict gay men as ""feminine""; 29 percent show LGBTQ+ people carrying the rainbow flag; 29 percent portray lesbians as ""masculine""; and 28 percent such visuals depict gay men as ""flamboyant.""Some advertisers are reluctant to depict LGBTQ+ people because of fears that the depictions may be less than authentic and therefore alienate the intended audience. Asurvey of advertising and marketing executives,conducted in February for GLAAD and Procter & Gamble as part of GLAAD and P&G'sVisibility Project,found that nearly 81 percent of advertisers agreed that inauthentic representation of LGBTQ+ people would create a greater backlash than not including them at all, and nearly 80 percent agreed that it is ""difficult to adequately represent the LGBTQ community because the community is complicated and has many nuances.""""The guidance we've created with Getty Images seeks to give brands and businesses of all sizes the confidence they need to depict the LGBTQ+ community in inclusive, authentic and thoughtful ways, without fear of backlash or fear of 'getting it wrong,'"" Nick Adams, director of transgender representation at GLAAD, said in the release. ""Instead of shying away from depictions or relying on stereotypes, we've created guidance on how to authentically represent the LGBTQ+ community in ways that will create lasting connections. Increasing representation of LGBTQ+ people in your communications demonstrates your intentional emphasis around diversity and makes a public commitment of your support for this community.""Norman added,""To create real change for LGBTQ+ representation, we need the advertising and media industry to act. Creatives and marketing professionals have the opportunity to not just encourage the creation of this kind of imagery, but also to choose to use it.""The accompanying images are drawn from Getty's collection of more than 435 million assets, including photos, videos, and music, available throughwww.gettyimages.comandwww.istock.com.They show a diversity of LGBTQ+ representation and experiences.

That Meghan is a Black, biracial woman exercising command of her story, opposing the account tabloids have sold about her, threatens the mirage of the monarchy as a secure institution, and the media outlets that feed into the machine they benefit from.When Meghan and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, stepped down from their duties as senior members of the British royal family in early 2020, those unfamiliar with the nation’s press apparatus could be forgiven for thinking the initial brouhaha would eventually die down. Alas, more than a year later, even after the couple left the United Kingdom for North America with their infant son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, the British media’s penchant for adversely dissecting every detail of Harry and Meghan’s life has not eased.Following the Sussexes’announcementin mid-February that they are expecting a second child, anotherwaveof weary, if foreseeable, anti-Meghan punditry has come to the fore. The intensity of this wave has now been heightened by reports on Tuesday fromthat Meghan faced bullying complaints from some of her aides in 2018. Meghan hasdeniedthis through her lawyers, who referred to it as a “calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation,” in a statement to the British paper. Her lawyers also added that these accusations are “being used by Buckingham Palace to peddle a wholly false narrative,” which comes ahead of Meghan and Harry’s CBS Primetime Special with Oprah Winfrey, airing this Sunday. In a highly unusual move, Buckingham Palace released astatementWednesday saying that it will investigate the claims.Notwithstanding the bullying allegations against Meghan, much of the pseudo analysis the British tabloids advance is not really about Meghan and Harry’s perceived faux pas, or a sincere contemplation of the intentions and impact of their public acts. Indeed, it is less about Harry than it is about Meghan. Never mind that Harry will never be king. Never mind, too, that Harry’s contempt for the press is practicallylegendaryand predates Meghan—a fact seemingly lost on commentators who haveblamed her forthe couple’s mistrust of the press and their departure from the United Kingdom. But these demonstrable truths are less significant than what Meghan symbolizes.As Meghan’s detractors see it, that a biracial, Black American celebrity divorcée who had the nerve to enter, and then worse, exit, the royal family (in spectacular fashion) is unacceptable. That she appears to have done so while maintaining her self-respect and individuality insults the sensibilities of a press who both indulged in and resented her presence, often for cheap, ridiculous, and vicious fodder: Thethat referred to “how Meghan’s favorite avocado snack … is fueling human rights abuses” comes to mind.What is so seemingly offensive to the British press and at least some of the British public is Meghan’s independence and desire to control her destiny in the public eye—a common objective for celebrities. It is why her exit was always likely to the discerning mind. But it’s also why she remains a persona non grata to those accustomed to covering culture, celebrities, and/or entertainment with little to no apparent ethical responsibility, or who disregard the duty of care they have to the people they write aboutthe public that reads it. This fact is especially pertinent in light of the recentNew York Times-produced documentary,Framing Britney Spears. While chronicling the pop star’s rise, fall, reemergence, and conservatorship restrictions, the film has also prompted a conversation on how the media covers public figures and, in particular, women.Any direct comparison between Meghan and Spears is, of course, incongruent. From the impact of race to their family backgrounds to their claims to fame: Spears is a pop star; Meghan went from being an actor to marrying into the most famous royal family in the world. Meghan is also autonomous in a way that Spears is seemingly not. A more accuratecomparisonmight be made and has been made between Meghan and Princess Diana, whom the press was also unkind to; some still consider the media at least partiallyresponsiblefor the latter’s death. But what unites the stories of all these women—and many more—is an exhibited pleasure with which the media took, and in Meghan’s case,in harping on any perceived slight or any deviation from norms or protocols, or in foiling their attempts to exercise authority over their lives and public images.What the press owes its subjects remains a tricky conversation, especially in entertainment or culture journalism that sometimes occupies a contradictory space in the media and the public. The subjects and people reported on and commented about are sometimes treated as frivolous, yet they reflect what and who a society deems desirable, relatable, worthy of worship—and paradoxically—who it feels entitled to in terms of surveillance and unfettered condemnation. What is clear in how the press covers women as public figures, regardless of their domains or class of celebrity, is that the media system replicates the same hyper scrutiny and projects the same limited space ofas society offers ordinary women in general.Though Meghan’s move to the United States may allow for a certain physical protection from the tentacles of at least the British media, there remains a danger in how her representation has been distorted by bad-faith press actors, notably in Britain. And what does it say about British media culture, British culture—British racism and sexism—that even the most multi-privileged Black/biracial women are at the receiving end of such ire? (And what does it say for those who share the same identity sans privilege?) The answer is obvious and ugly: Britain, which often imagines itself as occupying a “less racist” predisposition as its European and North American counterparts, remains a societyembeddedin racist, sexist, chauvinistic pathologies. Ignorant to its reality, Britain has hugeswaths of its populationthat are unwilling to address these matters in terms of structure—including the media—and interpersonally.The less spoken part of this entire affair is that there are credible reasons to critique Meghan (and Harry). With this new bullying allegation, however suspicious the timing, it is also not impossible to imagine harmful behavior from people with power; but in this case, it must be considered in a racialized context, whereBlack womenare often on the receiving end of bullying accusations. These criticisms can exist alongside critiques of a British press that continue to be repugnant—and within a larger context of how the media reproduces biased and bigoted representations of women and people of color. Yes, including those who are privileged by skin shade, class, and/or celebrity.It’s inevitable that in the interview with Winfrey on Sunday, Meghan and Harry will address their treatment by the British media. Previews have already revealed as much, including one teaser in which Meghan implicates the palace in “perpetuating falsehoods” about the couple. How the British, American, and global public will respond is worth watching for. It may, and perhaps should, include thoughtful criticism of where and how Meghan (or Harry) may have faltered—she is still a flawed public figure and human being after all. But even if one withholds compassion for the rich and privileged in this instance, perhaps there can still be room for reflection and discernment on her damaging portrayal, given what we know about the press’s legacy on covering women in culture. It’ll certainly be more than what the British press is likely to afford her, if the past is any guide. And truthfully, it’s not a tough bar to clear.Kovie Biakolo is writer, editor, and multiculturalism scholar specializing in culture and identity.",1

She hasn’t paid rent in five months. She can’t. Before the pandemic, she worked at a food kiosk at Brooklyn College selling coffee and sandwiches. But then the campus shut down, throwing her out of work. She had to borrow money just to afford food. She didn’t start receiving unemployment benefits until June, and even then the money had to go to paying back what she had borrowed to travel to her home country of Jamaica when her sister recently died. Rent had to wait.Up until June 20, she was protected from eviction by astatewide prohibitionon all evictions issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo. But once that blanket protection expired, Cuomonarrowedwho was protected to those who were unable to pay rent because they suffered direct financial hardship due to the pandemic. That means landlords can still take their tenants to court and the burden falls to renters to prove to a judge that they qualify. The city’s courts have alsopausedeviction proceedings through at least August 5, but without an extension, thousands of renters like Miller may be caught up in the gears of the system when it reactivates.There were also protections that the federal government put in place. When Congress passed the CARES Act, it included a moratorium on evictions in any federally subsidized housing. Any landlord with a federally subsidized loan through, say, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or who accepts Section 8 rent vouchers, couldn’t legally evict tenants. But those expired on July 27 as Congress failed to pass an extension.“I’m not certain what’s going to happen,” Miller said. Even if her college campus reopens, she’s not sure they’ll want to have people buying food from kiosks. “I don’t know if I’m going to have a job in the future,” she said.She’s certain her landlord will try to evict her as soon as he can, so she’s been trying desperately to enroll in the state’s rent relief program, which was launched in mid-July. But the online system kept shutting down before she could complete her application.Miller lives with her youngest daughter and two grandchildren, and she’s the sole provider; her daughter is in nursing school full-time. “I’m worried about becoming homeless with my family,” she said. “Trust me, I am truly stressed.”Miller is one of millions across the country facing that stress. When the pandemic first hit and officials ordered businesses to shut down, many alsoinstituted protectionsto ensure that people weren’t thrown out of their homes just when they were being told to stay inside them to stem the spread of the disease. Many were temporary measures under the assumption that by now the virus would be under control, and yet US case counts keep going up. Even after some states have allowed businesses to reopen, unemployment is horrifyingly high:More than 30 million peopleare either receiving unemployment benefits or have applied for them.One in five renterswas behind on rent at the beginning of July, whileabout a thirdof American households missed their housing payment that month.Popular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyPopular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyCurrent IssueView our current issueThe disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country hasn’t seen in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at17 million, while another predicts thatbetween 19 million and 23 millionpeople could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as28 million peoplecould face eviction or foreclosure.No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed2.35 millionevictions. “The courts can’t handle it, the states can’t catch the people who go through the system and end up unhoused,” said Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It’s a really catastrophic situation.”The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The United States has never seen this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially in such a truncated amount of time,” Benfer said. During that downturn,nearly 10 million peoplelost their homes to foreclosure in the span of eight years. It seems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by40–45 percentthis year. “We’ll see increases in homelessness the likes of which we haven’t seen in our country since the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.“This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer.The eviction moratoriums cities and states put in place at the start of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barred sheriffs from carrying them out, which could still leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfer said.Still, overall, Benfer said, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings arestill low. “There is no doubt that the federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we can say with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped.New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s in store for other places as protections expire. The state’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city were still protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew were supported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.”Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evictmore than 230city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they’re fieldingtriplethe number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide. They’ve sent hundreds of letters to local and state judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activistsblocked accessto the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases.More From Bryce CovertLina Khan’s Anti-Monopoly PowerDecember 9, 2023As Costs and Demand Skyrocket, Abortion Funds Struggle to Keep UpDecember 7, 2023You Deserve a 4-Day WorkweekNovember 24, 2023The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that many say has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That’s really been the only break wall stemming the tide here,” Benfer said. Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantriesdoubledin March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority on staying housed,” Benfer said. “Which makes sense. The primary response to Covid-19 is to shelter in place, so housing is literally preventative health care.”As the pandemic rages, with casesincreasing in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to any semblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congress still doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at the same level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative$10 billiona week.The current outbreak has many governorsreimposing lockdownson different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords have still been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”Up until June 20, she was protected from eviction by astatewide prohibitionon all evictions issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo. But once that blanket protection expired, Cuomonarrowedwho was protected to those who were unable to pay rent because they suffered direct financial hardship due to the pandemic.

Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”There were also protections that the federal government put in place. When Congress passed the CARES Act, it included a moratorium on evictions in any federally subsidized housing. Any landlord with a federally subsidized loan through, say, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or who accepts Section 8 rent vouchers, couldn’t legally evict tenants. But those expired on July 27 as Congress failed to pass an extension.“I’m not certain what’s going to happen,” Miller said. Even if her college campus reopens, she’s not sure they’ll want to have people buying food from kiosks. “I don’t know if I’m going to have a job in the future,” she said.She’s certain her landlord will try to evict her as soon as he can, so she’s been trying desperately to enroll in the state’s rent relief program, which was launched in mid-July. But the online system kept shutting down before she could complete her application.Miller lives with her youngest daughter and two grandchildren, and she’s the sole provider; her daughter is in nursing school full-time. “I’m worried about becoming homeless with my family,” she said. “Trust me, I am truly stressed.”Miller is one of millions across the country facing that stress. When the pandemic first hit and officials ordered businesses to shut down, many alsoinstituted protectionsto ensure that people weren’t thrown out of their homes just when they were being told to stay inside them to stem the spread of the disease. Many were temporary measures under the assumption that by now the virus would be under control, and yet US case counts keep going up. Even after some states have allowed businesses to reopen, unemployment is horrifyingly high:More than 30 million peopleare either receiving unemployment benefits or have applied for them.One in five renterswas behind on rent at the beginning of July, whileabout a thirdof American households missed their housing payment that month.Popular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyPopular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyCurrent IssueView our current issueThe disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country hasn’t seen in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at17 million, while another predicts thatbetween 19 million and 23 millionpeople could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as28 million peoplecould face eviction or foreclosure.No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed2.35 millionevictions. “The courts can’t handle it, the states can’t catch the people who go through the system and end up unhoused,” said Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It’s a really catastrophic situation.”The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The United States has never seen this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially in such a truncated amount of time,” Benfer said. During that downturn,nearly 10 million peoplelost their homes to foreclosure in the span of eight years. It seems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by40–45 percentthis year. “We’ll see increases in homelessness the likes of which we haven’t seen in our country since the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.“This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer.The eviction moratoriums cities and states put in place at the start of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barred sheriffs from carrying them out, which could still leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfer said.Still, overall, Benfer said, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings arestill low. “There is no doubt that the federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we can say with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped.New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s in store for other places as protections expire. The state’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city were still protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew were supported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.”Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evictmore than 230city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they’re fieldingtriplethe number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide. They’ve sent hundreds of letters to local and state judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activistsblocked accessto the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases.More From Bryce CovertLina Khan’s Anti-Monopoly PowerDecember 9, 2023As Costs and Demand Skyrocket, Abortion Funds Struggle to Keep UpDecember 7, 2023You Deserve a 4-Day WorkweekNovember 24, 2023The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that many say has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That’s really been the only break wall stemming the tide here,” Benfer said. Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantriesdoubledin March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority on staying housed,” Benfer said. “Which makes sense. The primary response to Covid-19 is to shelter in place, so housing is literally preventative health care.”As the pandemic rages, with casesincreasing in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to any semblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congress still doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at the same level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative$10 billiona week.The current outbreak has many governorsreimposing lockdownson different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords have still been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said.

Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”She’s certain her landlord will try to evict her as soon as he can, so she’s been trying desperately to enroll in the state’s rent relief program, which was launched in mid-July. But the online system kept shutting down before she could complete her application.Miller lives with her youngest daughter and two grandchildren, and she’s the sole provider; her daughter is in nursing school full-time. “I’m worried about becoming homeless with my family,” she said. “Trust me, I am truly stressed.”Miller is one of millions across the country facing that stress. When the pandemic first hit and officials ordered businesses to shut down, many alsoinstituted protectionsto ensure that people weren’t thrown out of their homes just when they were being told to stay inside them to stem the spread of the disease. Many were temporary measures under the assumption that by now the virus would be under control, and yet US case counts keep going up. Even after some states have allowed businesses to reopen, unemployment is horrifyingly high:More than 30 million peopleare either receiving unemployment benefits or have applied for them.One in five renterswas behind on rent at the beginning of July, whileabout a thirdof American households missed their housing payment that month.Popular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyPopular""swipe left below to view more authors""Swipe →Calling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticCalling for Respect, Freedom, and Security for All Is Not AntisemiticMarshall GanzWhat Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?What Does It Mean to Be Palestinian Now?Feature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianThe Right to Speak for OurselvesThe Right to Speak for OurselvesFeature/Mohammed El-KurdIsrael Is Losing This WarIsrael Is Losing This WarComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyCurrent IssueView our current issueThe disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country hasn’t seen in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at17 million, while another predicts thatbetween 19 million and 23 millionpeople could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as28 million peoplecould face eviction or foreclosure.No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed2.35 millionevictions. “The courts can’t handle it, the states can’t catch the people who go through the system and end up unhoused,” said Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It’s a really catastrophic situation.”The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The United States has never seen this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially in such a truncated amount of time,” Benfer said. During that downturn,nearly 10 million peoplelost their homes to foreclosure in the span of eight years. It seems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by40–45 percentthis year. “We’ll see increases in homelessness the likes of which we haven’t seen in our country since the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.“This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer.The eviction moratoriums cities and states put in place at the start of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barred sheriffs from carrying them out, which could still leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfer said.Still, overall, Benfer said, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings arestill low. “There is no doubt that the federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we can say with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped.New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s in store for other places as protections expire. The state’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city were still protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew were supported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.”Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evictmore than 230city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they’re fieldingtriplethe number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide. They’ve sent hundreds of letters to local and state judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activistsblocked accessto the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases.More From Bryce CovertLina Khan’s Anti-Monopoly PowerDecember 9, 2023As Costs and Demand Skyrocket, Abortion Funds Struggle to Keep UpDecember 7, 2023You Deserve a 4-Day WorkweekNovember 24, 2023The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that many say has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That’s really been the only break wall stemming the tide here,” Benfer said. Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantriesdoubledin March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority on staying housed,” Benfer said. “Which makes sense. The primary response to Covid-19 is to shelter in place, so housing is literally preventative health care.”As the pandemic rages, with casesincreasing in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to any semblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congress still doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at the same level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative$10 billiona week.The current outbreak has many governorsreimposing lockdownson different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords have still been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses.

Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantriesdoubledin March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority on staying housed,” Benfer said. “Which makes sense. The primary response to Covid-19 is to shelter in place, so housing is literally preventative health care.”As the pandemic rages, with casesincreasing in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to any semblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congress still doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at the same level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative$10 billiona week.The current outbreak has many governorsreimposing lockdownson different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords have still been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”Marshall GanzFeature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianFeature/Mohammed El-KurdComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyMarshall GanzFeature/Noura Erakat,Ahmed Moor,Noor Hindi,Mohammed El-Kurd,andLaila Al-ArianFeature/Mohammed El-KurdComment/Tony KaronandDaniel LevyThe disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country hasn’t seen in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at17 million, while another predicts thatbetween 19 million and 23 millionpeople could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as28 million peoplecould face eviction or foreclosure.No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed2.35 millionevictions. “The courts can’t handle it, the states can’t catch the people who go through the system and end up unhoused,” said Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It’s a really catastrophic situation.”The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The United States has never seen this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially in such a truncated amount of time,” Benfer said. During that downturn,nearly 10 million peoplelost their homes to foreclosure in the span of eight years. It seems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by40–45 percentthis year. “We’ll see increases in homelessness the likes of which we haven’t seen in our country since the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.“This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer.The eviction moratoriums cities and states put in place at the start of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barred sheriffs from carrying them out, which could still leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfer said.Still, overall, Benfer said, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings arestill low. “There is no doubt that the federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we can say with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped.New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s in store for other places as protections expire. The state’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city were still protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew were supported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.”Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evictmore than 230city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they’re fieldingtriplethe number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide.

But landlords don’t want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.”Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evictmore than 230city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they’re fieldingtriplethe number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide. They’ve sent hundreds of letters to local and state judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium.

Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantriesdoubledin March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority on staying housed,” Benfer said. “Which makes sense. The primary response to Covid-19 is to shelter in place, so housing is literally preventative health care.”As the pandemic rages, with casesincreasing in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to any semblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congress still doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at the same level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative$10 billiona week.The current outbreak has many governorsreimposing lockdownson different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords have still been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”“This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer.The eviction moratoriums cities and states put in place at the start of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barred sheriffs from carrying them out, which could still leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfer said.Still, overall, Benfer said, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings arestill low. “There is no doubt that the federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we can say with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped.New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s in store for other places as protections expire.

Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s in store for other places as protections expire. The state’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city were still protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew were supported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.”Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evictmore than 230city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they’re fieldingtriplethe number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide. They’ve sent hundreds of letters to local and state judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activistsblocked accessto the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases.More From Bryce CovertLina Khan’s Anti-Monopoly PowerDecember 9, 2023As Costs and Demand Skyrocket, Abortion Funds Struggle to Keep UpDecember 7, 2023You Deserve a 4-Day WorkweekNovember 24, 2023The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that many say has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That’s really been the only break wall stemming the tide here,” Benfer said. Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantriesdoubledin March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent.

Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire.

Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running.“There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.”Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’t see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’” she said. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to work something out.”The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated.Halfof Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s the same case nationwide:30 percentof Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites.Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governorkeeps extendingit month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended itfour hoursbefore it would have elapsed.“It’s becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”The current outbreak has many governorsreimposing lockdownson different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job.In New York,279,400low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire.

That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a billintroducedby Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a larger systemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.”But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they’ll struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublicafoundlandlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states.“The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They’re scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.”In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomoannouncedthe creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only coversa small portionof the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’t seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s been so little coming from him.”“We’re still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.”Many other states and cities have alsocreatedrent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana’s programran outin three days. Houston’s program wasdepletedin 90 minutes“Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfallsdue to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance.Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democratsincluded$100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alonebillstoextenda moratorium andoffersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package thatdoesn’t includean eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters.Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance.

349,Trump Organization indictments for Allen Weisselberg a small but important step,-15.33,31.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-organization-indictments-allen-weisselberg-small-important-step-n1272896,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,msnbc,25,"One need only recallAl Capone’s tax fraud convictionto recognize that many tax cheats historically flout other laws, too.As of Wednesday, we've added another character to the books with news that the Manhattan district attorney officially filed criminal tax charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer,Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg plans toplead not guiltyto the charges, his attorney said.)A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political.It is no surprise that the corporate defendant in the New York criminal case is owned by former President Donald Trump. This is the same Trump whorepeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt”and verbally abused special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions.This is the same Trump who showed contempt for elections in November 2020 when he asked the Georgia secretary of state to “find 11,780 votes,” and when that didn’t work met with top advisers toconsider declaring martial lawto redo the election — and finallyincited an insurrectionat the Capitol on Jan. 6.Trump’s four-year presidency can be summed up in the words of the New York State Bar Association statement condemning his 2020 pardon of convicted felonRoger Stone, a key witness in the Mueller investigation: “This is a perversion of justice, plain and simple.”The former president may soon fade from the political scene as his legal troubles worsen. But even without Trump, we must confront the perversion of justice that typifies the modus operandi of so many others like him in business, the entertainment industry and politics. Bernie Madoff, Harvey Weinstein and countless others in positions of power and prestige showed contempt for the law. They pervert justice because they think the law is an obstacle to be overcome.First, the powerful claim they are immune from the law. Often, they prove this to be true. Some likeBill Cosbyclaim immunity from prosecution because their lawyers negotiated a strategically advantageous deal with prosecutors. Others claim immunity from prosecution because they are U.S. presidents.They hide behind a constitutionally dubious presidential immunity theory blessed by the Department of Justice in three separate memoranda written during the presidencies of Nixon, Clinton and Trump. Donald Trump’s own lawyers, appearing before the 2nd Circuit in their effort to prevent the Manhattan DA from subpoenaing Trump Organization tax records, claimed the president was immune from subpoena and evencould shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and still be immune from prosecution.Trump’s defenders would have us believe that it’s the law, not his actions, that are wrong.Others in positions of power — many child molesters, for example — claim immunity because they avoided getting caught until after the statute of limitations expired. Still others think their immunity stems from their social class. As New York real estate mogulLeona Helmsleyfamously told her maid, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Unfortunately for Helmsley, she was not immune from prosecution and was carted off to prison.A second approach is to attack those who enforce the law, whether it be Mueller and his band of “angry Democrats,” the four agency inspectors generalfired by Trumpin the middle of investigations, the United States attorney in Manhattan also fired by Trump in 2020, or now the verbal assaults launched at the Manhattan DA from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s strategy appears to be: When caught violating the law, deflect one’s own narcissism onto law enforcement and hope that sticks in the court of public opinion.A third related strategy is to denigrate the rule of law itself. Claim that the law is perverse, either because the law is just political or because the law is irrational in making some things illegal and others not. A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political.In the far-right media, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden did it, it’s per se criminal. If Trump did it, it’s perfectly legal and any prosecutor, inspector general or member of Congress who suggests to the contrary is just on awitch hunt. Many on the left have a similar narcissistic attitude, even if not the media platform to express it, often insisting that law is defined by politics and has no moral integrity on its own.The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either.For over a century, nihilistic legal commentators have re-enforced this view. The German theologian andlegal philosopher Carl Schmittin the 1920s published “The Concept of the Political,” in which he argued that law is not based on neutral principles but is simply a byproduct of politics.Academic commentators on the far right and far left today quote Schmitt, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933, frequently for the same proposition: Law is all about politics. There is no objective truth, no just concept of right and wrong underlying the law. This nihilism, like bad wine, is poured into the fancy bottles of academic theory, but it is peddled to a far larger audience under the more plebeian labels of right-wing radio, TV and internet.Finally, there are the many clever ways to get around the law. In the 1970s, before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan reduced taxes on the rich, some academic economists sympathized with those who did not want to pay whatever taxes the legislature deemed to be their fair share. Arthur Seldon of the London School of Economics and a group of co-authorscoined the term “avoision”to describe manipulative tax strategies that combined ethically problematic but legal tax avoidance (for example, moving from one jurisdiction to another to pay lower tax) with illegal tax evasion (for example, pretending to have moved from one jurisdiction to another in order to pay lower tax).Another common avoision strategy is paying an employee’s rent, private school tuition or other benefits rather than paying reportable income. This, of course, is what the Manhattan DA now alleges the Trump Organization and its CFO did to avoid paying taxes.By the 1990s Seldon’s phrase “avoision” was so widely used that it appeared on “The Simpsons” as Bart Simpson explained why Krusty the Clown was in prison for tax fraud: “I don’t say 'evasion.' I say 'avoision.'”According to a 2019 New York Times article, several generations of the Trump family have been doing just that to “avoid” taxes since the 1970s. And on Wednesday, the Manhattan DA, after a lengthy fight just to get the Trump Organization's financial records, and a 2020 victory in the Supreme Court, finally had enough evidence to hand down an indictment.Trump is the epitome of the avoision man. And the law may be catching up with him.But we cannot just focus on Trump without looking at the underlying problem ­— the narcissistic view of the law that gave rise to Trump and caused so many to celebrate him first as a real estate tycoon, then as a media star and finally as a president.The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either; it is grounded in a collective sense of right and wrong. One of the law’s imperfections is that those who flout the law, who think they are too powerful ever to get caught or prosecuted for violating it, are far too often right.That’s about to change with the small but important step taken by the Manhattan DA on Wednesday. Respect for the law, and enforcement of the law, are crucial to maintaining the rule of law. And that goes for everyone — even a business empire run by a man who once was president of the United States.Richard W. Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W. Bush. He is the S.

Here in March, an EMT worker cleans a gurney after transporting a suspected COVID-19 patient.A New York City pilot program that dispatches mental health specialists and paramedics instead of police for certain nonviolent emergency calls has resulted in more people accepting assistance and fewer people sent to the hospital,early data shows.It's one ofa number of programs underway around the countrytrying to address police violence and systemic racismfollowing George Floyd's murderby providing alternatives to sending law enforcement to respond to emergency calls involving issues such as mental health or drug and alcohol crises.In June, New York City started its Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division, or B-HEARD, to provide more targeted care for those struggling with mental health issues and emergencies such as suicide attempts, substance misuse and serious mental illness.During the first month of the pilot program, B-HEARD teams — consisting of fire department paramedics and social workers — responded to calls in northern Manhattan, which includes parts of Harlem and receives the city's highest number of mental health emergency calls.From June 6 to July 7, B-HEARD received roughly 16 mental health calls each day in this zone.In 95% of cases, people accepted care from the B-HEARD team, data from the city shows. That's compared with 82% for traditional 911 response teams, which include police.Additionally, 50% of people treated by B-HEARD were transported to the hospital for more care, a far lower number than the 82% who are transported to the hospital with traditional 911 response.The city said that 911 operators routed 138 mental health emergency calls — 25% of the number of calls during the pilot period — to B-HEARD and expect that number to grow to 50% in the coming months.""This is great news. A smarter approach to public health and public safety. A smarter use of resources. And the evidence — from Denver to New York — shows that responding with care works,"" U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.,tweeted.New York's program is modeled after a successful, decades-old program in Eugene, Ore., known as Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets, orCAHOOTS. Other similar programs have launched in California, Colorado, Georgia and Montana.In Minneapolis, where police killed Floyd last summer, the city will start sending outcivil crisis response teamsinstead of police to certain mental health calls next month.Mental health-related calls accounted for22% of casesin which on-duty police used lethal force and killed someone, according to data from 2009 to 2012 from 17 states where data was available.",2
351,Lollapalunacy? Experts split on whether jammed music fest is ‘bad idea’ or ‘basically OK’ as COVID-19 cases quadruple,0.0,44.33,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2021/7/23/22590809/lollapalooza-coronavirus-chicago-illinois-case-spike-covid-19-july-23,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,chicago.suntimes,25,"COVID-19 cases have almost quadrupled across Illinois over the past month, nearly a quarter of counties have hit a coronavirus warning level, and more patients are filling hospital wards.Troubling figures released Friday by the Illinois Department of Public Health suggest the state’s latest coronavirus surge is showing no signs of letting up days before daily crowds of 100,000 and up descend on Grant Park for Lollapalooza.City officials have insisted the massive festival will be safe — and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has saidhe’ll be there himself— but University of Chicago epidemiologist Dr. Emily Landon called it “a bad idea” to move forward with the jam-packed event, especially with the more infectious Delta variant looming.“Lolla is too crowded. That’s the bottom line,” she said, acknowledging odds are slim Mayor Lori Lightfoot would pull the plug on the lucrative attraction.“It’s about harm reduction. You have to make the decision for yourself. These cases that happen because of Lolla aren’t likely to be a huge drag on the health care system. But will we see a bump? Yes, and Delta will probably make it higher,” Landon said.“A bunch of people are going to get COVID at Lolla, but a lot of people are getting it from other places now, too.”Fans attend Day 2 of Lollapalooza in Grant Park in 2019.They’re getting it across the state, especially in downstate counties with lower vaccination rates. Cases started rising a few weeks after the state fully reopened June 11.Nearly 8,000 Illinoisans tested positive over the past week alone, an average of 1,140 new cases every day. The state was logging just 294 cases per day at the start of the month, and 238 per day in mid-June.Since then, the average statewide case positivity rate has increased fivefold, from a pandemic low of 0.6% up to 3.3% — the highest it’s been since the first week of May. Hospitals were treating 670 coronavirus patients Thursday night, the most they’ve seen since early June.Graphic by Jesse Howe and Caroline Hurley | Sun-TimesSource: Illinois Department of Public HealthGraph not displaying properly? Click here.State public health officials on Friday singled out 25 of the state’s 102 counties for being at a coronavirus warning level. DuPage is the first Chicago-area county to land on that list in several months, due to an increase in hospital visits for COVID-like symptoms.Most of the other warning-level counties are in central and southern Illinois, where vaccination rates are sometimes less than half the statewide rate. About 72% of all Illinoisans have gotten a shot, with about 56% fully vaccinated.Counties marked orange are considered at a COVID-19 warning level.Even though Lollapalooza takes place in the heart of Chicago, it could have a devastating impact on far-flung areas, said Landon, who urged attendees to “assume you’ve been exposed” and get tested afterward.“It can amplify the spread in areas with low vaccination rates. The people who go home to some south suburbs, to central Illinois, to Missouri — they’re going to set off little wildfires,” she said.But as far as personal risk, Lollapalooza “can be done safely,” according to Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society’s COVID-19 Task Force.“Outdoors is the safest place you can do it,” Chundi said. “If you’re vaccinated, you’re safe. If you’re vaccinated and masked, you’re really safe. If you’re not vaccinated and not masked, you’re not safe.”Attendees at the four-day music festival, which opens Thursday, have to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within three days of entrance, according to Lollapalooza.Anyone who is unvaccinated will be required to wear a mask while attending the event. And even those who got the shot are urged to consider masking up.Chundi said the check-in process could actually result in more transmission than other parts of the fest.“The bathrooms themselves are porta-potties, the vendors, they’re open-air — that all is basically OK. It’s getting huge crowds of people in and then getting them out of these choke points that causes concern,” he said.Thousands of music fans arrive in Grant Park for the first day of Lollapalooza in 2019.Still, Chundi said the likelihood of Lollapalooza turning into a super-spreader event “is very low.” He expects cases to keep rising in the short term no matter what.“You’ve got 30,000 people going to Sox games, Cubs games and soon Bears games. In the U.S., we’ve decided the decision about getting vaccinated is your personal responsibility and your right. That’s getting us into some trouble,” Chundi said.“If we could get everyone to just mandate vaccination, we could get out of this whole mess. But that needs to happen at a national level. … It’s not rocket science. Everyone knows how this works by now.”",2
352,Senate GOP report finds Biden administration spending $2B to suspend border wall construction,13.33,35.33,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-gop-report-biden-administration-2b-suspend-wall-construction,https://adfontesmedia.com/fox-news-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,foxnews,25,"Dek: Fox News’ Mark Eiglarsh discusses the legal fallout from Texas' plans on ‘Your World’A new report by Republicans on a Senate subcommittee has concluded that the Biden administration is spending a minimum of approximately $2 billion to suspend construction of thewall at the southern border,even amid a continuing migrant crisis.The reportby the minority staff of the Government Operations and Border Management Subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee found that efforts to suspend or terminate wall construction projects at the Defense Department have cost between $1.8 billion to $2 billion and the administration is spending $3 million every day.""These interim findings show that the Biden administration’s efforts to stop border wall construction constitute significant waste of taxpayer resources,""the reportsays. ""As of the drafting of this report the Biden administration has paid border wall contractors at least $2 billion and counting to not build the border wall.""""This $2 billion comes directly from DOD’s budget, and the Biden administration’s continued waste of these funds poses risks to national security and border security,"" it says.Biden ended the Trump-era wall project, which saw 450 miles built during the Trump administration, on his first day in office with hundreds of miles still funded and contracts already underway. Biden ordered a review of the federal government’s obligations.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has since announced a plan on what to do with money assigned to the wall, while the administration redirected transferred funds from Pentagon accounts to the original projects for which they had been appropriated. The Defense Department (DOD) had $10 billion transferred from border wall construction and related projects.After the order to suspend construction, the committee found that the Defense Department was initially occurring $6 million a day in ""suspension costs,"" but that was reduced to $3 million after layoffs. The money is being spent on ""make safe and site security"" projects.""This means that the federal government is paying contractors on these seven projects $3 million per day to drive out to project sites and guard the unused pallets of steel and other construction materials,"" the report said.To get to the $2 billion figure, the report uses DOD’s estimates laid out in court documents. Those estimates include ""suspension costs"" for the project, which the subcommittee staff says either ""significantly undercounted"" the daily accrual of $3 million a day or was not fully included.""If the daily accrual of $3 million represents a separate cost not accounted in the broader DOD estimate of termination costs, then the total suspension costs will still be significantly higher than the estimate DOD provided to the Biden administration and to the courts,"" it says.According to the report, the total amount spent could be higher than $2 billion due to uncertainties about plans for contracts acquired by DHS, questions about the Pentagon’s estimation of suspension costs, and the 12- to 18-month timeline it will take to exit the contracts.Pentagon spokesman Chris Mitchell told Fox News that the Defense Department ""will not comment publicly on matters that are in active litigation or settlement discussions.""Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., the lead Republican on the subcommittee, slammed the Biden administration over the findings.""It is absolutely absurd that Americans are paying contractors to guard metal gates that President Biden refuses to install because he wants to ‘study’ the wall,"" he said in a statement. ""Stubbornly refusing to spend money approved for the wall is not ‘executing’ the law. It’s ignoring the law and ignoring the very real national security concerns posed by illegal entry across our very open southern border. For years I have called out federal waste, but the Biden Administration is literally ‘going for broke’ with this nonsense.""The report says that the estimation on exactly how much is being wasted could be higher, as it does not factor in Department of Homeland Security accounts, as well as other costs related to some of the DOD projects.""These estimates do not include an analysis of DHS accounts and therefore do not represent the full extent of waste by the Biden administration, nor do they include the ongoing daily costs related to DOD’s suspension of projects funded by its 284 accounts,"" the report says. ""Given these caveats, President Biden is likely wasting significantly more taxpayer resources than estimated in this report on his efforts to stop building the border wall.""The Republican report also cast its findings in light of the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which has seen more than a million migrant encounters in Fiscal Year 2021 andmore than 188,000 in June alone.""Our border patrol agents are doing their best to secure our border, but they need additional barriers, roads, and technology to help keep us safe,"" Lankford said. ""Instead, President Biden is paying professional construction contractors to babysit metal to the tune of $2 billion and counting, while at the same time we’ve seen a 20-year high number of migrants crossing our open border.""The report comes just as the Department of Homeland Securityannounced that it has canceledcontracts for more than 30 miles of border wall construction in the Laredo Sector in Texas.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!",1

Those limits were loosened over time but will be reinstituted starting Saturday unless lower capacities are required by local regulations.“We know from months of metering data in our stores that the vast majority of the time our stores didn’t reach our self-imposed 20% metering capacity,” a Walmart spokesman told CNBC. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have resumed counting the number of people entering and leaving our stores.”Once a store reaches capacity, shoppers will be admitted on a one in, one out basis.Walmart announced earlier it would be closed on Thanksgiving day, a reversal from previous practices.

354,“Complete incompetence:” Biden team slams Trump’s COVID work,-8.33,44.67,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/nothing-for-us-to-rework-biden-team-starts-from-scratch-on-covid/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,arstechnica,19,"Just a day into office, President Joe Biden and his administration have unveiled a comprehensive,200-page strategic planand over a dozen executive orders and actions to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic currently rampaging across the country.With the running start, the administration hopes to finally get control over the virus, which has already taken the lives of more than 408,000 Americans. The number of deaths is expected to top 500,000 next month, Biden saidin an appearance Thursdayto unveil his strategic plan.""Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better,"" he said, calling his approach to the pandemic a ""full-scale wartime effort.""The lag between people becoming infected, developing COVID-19, and succumbing to the disease will keep the numbers grim for weeks to come, regardless of new efforts put in place today. But the administration says it's also facing challenges from inheriting the work from the previous administration.In remarks Thursday, Biden criticized the federal response so far: ""For the past year, we couldn't rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and coordination that we needed, and we have seen the tragic cost of that failure.""Upon taking office,sources in the administrationtold CNN that they were shocked by the state of the federal work on the pandemic—or the lack thereof. ""There is nothing for us to rework,"" one source told the outlet. ""We are going to have to build everything from scratch.""Another source echoed that the Trump administration had no plan and that Biden's administration would have to start from ""square one."" Upon realizing the situation, the administration member reportedly responded: ""Wow, just further affirmation of complete incompetence.""To get control of the pandemic, Biden moved ahead with a series of actions, signing executive orders Wednesday requiringmasking and physical distancing on federal propertiesandorganizing a White House COVID-19 response team. Thursday, he revealed 10 additional executive orders, which aim to: boost manufacturing for vaccine supplies and equipment; reimburse states for emergency supplies and National Guard deployments; increase testing capacity; support the development of new therapies; boost health data collection; guide schools on how to safely reopen; guide businesses on how to keep employees safe; require masking on transit and negative tests from international travelers; ensure and equitable pandemic response; and restore America's leadership in public health on the global stage.The 200-page strategic plan, titled ""National Strategy for the Covid-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness,"" fleshes out all the steps Biden has planned to tackle the pandemic. Chief among the priorities is to speed up vaccination, which has been plagued by disorganization since rollout began in December. So far, the federal government has distributed nearly 38 million doses, but only17.5 million doses have gone into people's armsand only about 2.4 million people have received their second dose. Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days in office.To reach that goal, Biden aims to speed vaccine development, make the vaccine available to more people, increase the number of places people can get vaccinated, and expand the medical workforce that can administer vaccines. He has already authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to begin setting up the first of many federal vaccination sites.One of the biggest vaccination hurdles so far appears to have been coordination between states and the federal government. In his final days at the helm, former Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, laid the blame solely on states for the bungled rollouts. States, meanwhile, pointed fingers at the federal response.To address the problem, Biden noted in his remarks Thursday that he has directed FEMA to assign a ""COVID response liaison"" for each state, so that every state will have its own federal point person to coordinate federal and state efforts to distribute vaccine and get shots into people's arms.Meanwhile, Biden also took steps to rejoin the World Health Organization, retracting withdrawal notification sent by the Trump administration. In an address Thursday, top infectious disease expertAnthony Fauci told the WHO board: ""The United States stands ready to work in partnership and solidarity to support the international COVID-19 response, mitigate its impact on the world, strengthen our institutions, advance epidemic preparedness for the future, and improve the health and wellbeing of all people throughout the world.""",2
355,"To Build Stronger Families, Reframe the Fight Over Mayor Pete's Parental Leave",5.33,29.33,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stacey-lennox/2021/10/16/to-build-stronger-families-reframe-the-fight-over-mayor-petes-parental-leave-n1524408,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-16,pjmedia,25,"Recently, the media disclosed that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took two months of parental leave following the adoption of twins. This news led to arguments online about whether he should have done so during a global supply chain crisis, whether men should take parental leave, and why the privileged class gets so much time. That misses the more significant opportunity. To defend his absence, the left and Democrats had to loudly declare the importance of parents spending time with their children. They had to advocate for families spending time together and note the importance of parent-child bonds.Agree with them wholeheartedly on these points. Then challenge them on the very policies they have pushed for years that discourage family formation by extending adolescence, making housing more expensive, and deemphasizing the role of fathers. It is time for conservatives to change the strategy of screaming “Stop” while standing athwart history and say, “No, we’re not doing that. We are doing something completely different.”Young adults in this country are marrying less and having fewer children. This trend is a feature of a society in decline. Strong families are the building block of a free and prosperous society. You only need to look at the history of any authoritarian regime to know the family is one of the first things they destroy. Mao’s cultural revolution may be the most horrific example when the culture war destroyed the Eastern tradition of honoring your elders. Young revolutionaries reported on, beat, and even murdered older relatives.Our tax and social policies enforce the politically correct view that all family configurations are equally desirable. One could even argue that many of them discourage traditional marriage by imposing monetary penalties when fathers remain in the home. This view ignores decades of research that confirms that children in intact heterosexual marriages are more successful as a population. It is no surprise that the decline in traditional marriage and childbearing accelerated with the passage of legislation purported to wage war on poverty under President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.It’s no shock that one of the architects of those programs wasMichael Harrington,founder of the Democratic Socialists and a committed Trotskyist. Trotsky envisioned perpetual revolution on a global scale, which cannot occur when solid families and a prosperous middle class with economic mobility exists. Harrington’s view on the disenfranchised in America and how the state should care for them was notably paternalistic. The government as daddy was the goal.In his book, he asserted that millions of Americans lived in a “culture of poverty.” Harrington argued that this culture rendered the poor incapable of improving their situation. He believed a capitalist society could not provide the poor with opportunities for a more dignified life, and they must be cared for by the state. To put it in a nutshell, Harrington described a system that could only create a permanent underclass. The best expression of Harrington’s worldview is “The Life of Julia,” an Obama campaign video scrubbed from the internet because most Americans, even in 2012, found it horrifying.Now, the “Build Back Better” plan includes a raft of policies to discourage strong families. It encourages putting children in government-funded care shortly after a paid parental leave ends, which is supposed to excite you. It increases the marriage penalty for the Earned Income Tax Credit. It also extends adolescence by paying for 13th and 14th grades. The government-run education of children for 18 years in a pre-K-12 system produces horrible results, so let’s do two more. Even the PRO Act seeks to reduce the freelance and contract opportunities that allow parents to work from home and spend less on childcare and more time with their children.In 2013, the left-leaning Brookings Institute notedthe decline of the traditional family is a class issue:A report from the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia summed up the data well: “Marriage is an emerging dividing line between America’s moderately educated middle and those with college degrees.” The group for whom marriage has largely disappeared now includes not just unskilled blacks but unskilled whites as well. Indeed, for younger women without a college degree, unwed childbearing is the new normal.An additional trend now is having fewer children, period. The birth rate hit anew record low for the sixth consecutive yearin 2021. It remains below replacement rates. Problems include financial barriers to successful family formation created by prolonged adolescence, dependence on two incomes, the cost of childcare, and skyrocketing housing costs.Rather than increasing the salaries of childcare providers and expanding childcare subsidies in the “Build Back Better” boondoggle, conservatives should advocate providing tax credits. These credits need to be a substantial percentage of the last year’s W-2 earnings for one parent to stay home and care for their child until they are six. And substantial means 50%. A structure like this is better for families, including the childcare workers who may want to have children of their own.Think about it. Couples could structure their monthly expenses to live within the means of a more substantial portion of the working parent’s salary. Based on average wages on Indeed, a welder and medical office secretary in Pennsylvania could count on an additional tax credit of $13,936 on top of the standard deduction. They would have no childcare expenses and none of the fuel, food, and other costs associated with commuting to work. The average American couple could save and spend in line with the goal of starting a family.Employers would benefit from the planning by having months to recruit, train, promote or transition another employee into the vacant position left by the parent staying home. It would also make returning to the workforce for a stay-at-home parent a common occurrence instead of having an employment gap that can be difficult to overcome. Women arenot returning to the workforceas often post-pandemic. The media assumes they can’t. Perhaps they prefer to stay home with their children.The most important beneficiaries of policies that encourage family formation are the children. Brookings also noted:These differences in family formation are a problem not only for those concerned with “family values” per se, but also for those concerned with upward mobility in a society that values equal opportunity for its children. Because the breakdown of the traditional family is overwhelmingly occurring among working-class Americans of all races, these trends threaten to make the U.S. a much more class-based society over time. The well-educated and upper-middle-class parents who are still forming two-parent families are able to invest time and resources in their children—time and resources that lower- and working-class single mothers, however impressive their efforts to be both good parents and good breadwinners, simply do not have.If we lose economic mobility for the next generation, we lose the American Dream. That’s not a bargain most Americans are willing to make. So let’s make more families at every income level.WATCH “The Life of Julia” that some resourceful user put back on the internet. This is where the “Build Back Better” agenda leads:",1

And it's just trifling and unnecessary to put them at risk because you can't be bothered to wear a mask.""The members of theWhite House residence staffare largely Black and Latino. Many are elderly, putting them at greater risk for severe Covid-19 infections.Critics on social media condemned the president for treating the building staff ""recklessly"" and endangering them ""for his own vanity.""""No one should have to work in this building,"" tweeted author and historian James Gleick on Tuesday, responding to a video of a White House staffer in a hazmat suit sanitizing the press room. ""Not reporters, not housekeepers, not cleaners and cooks.""Other congressional staffers and essential workers have also likely been exposed due to the Barrett event, said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.Outside the White House, restaurant workers in Minneapolis have been forced to quarantine for two weeks after catering a fundraiserTrump attended last Wednesday, a day before he revealed his positive Covid-19 test. Despite his exposure to adviser Hope Hicks, whose diagnosis was revealed Wednesday, the president forged ahead with his campaign schedule, hosting a rally in Duluth and meeting with 40 contributors at a private home. Thirteen catering staffers at Murray's Steakhouse are now in isolation and are being tested for Covid-19.At least two Secret Service members were in close contact with Trump on Sunday evening as they escorted him in a vehicle to greet his supporters outside Walter Reed Medical Center while he had an active coronavirus infection. All three occupants of the vehicle were masked, but some Secret Service members uncharacteristically spoke out about the incident.""He's not even pretending to care now,"" one agent said during Trump's appearance, according to theFormer First Lady Michelle Obama expressed concern for White House residence staffers and all the workers and families whose lives have and will be touched by the outbreak.""My heart goes out to everyone touched by this virus, from those at the White House, especially the Secret Service and residence staff whose service ought never be taken for granted, to all those names and stories most of us will unfortunately never know,"" Obamatweeted.",1
359,Whitmer: Indoor and outdoor sports allowed; Michigan gyms can reopen,0.0,49.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/09/03/whitmer-indoor-outdoor-sports-allowed-while-michigan-gyms-can-reopen/5686314002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,detroitnews,25,"— Gyms can reopen at limited capacity and organized sports can resume in Michigan under new executive orders that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer released Thursday, but one directive clashed with a recommendation by the state Department of Health and Human Services.The long-awaited orders, Nos. 175 and 176, allow for organized sports with limitations on mask use and crowd size, despite guidance from Whitmer's health department recommending against contact sports, including football, soccer and wrestling.They came on the same daythe governor extended through Oct. 1 the state of emergency, which is what gives her the ability to make unilateral actions to combat the virus, such as closing businesses or penalizing those who don't wear masks.The order allowing for contact sports in spite of the health department's recommendation concerned at least one epidemiologist, who opined it would almost surely lead to further virus spread.The orders would allow Michigan gyms and pools to reopen at 25% capacity starting Wednesday with strict protocols in place, including mask use at all times and distancing of 6 feet between workout stations and individuals participating in classes.Gym patrons must provide their name and phone number, or they will be denied entry. Saunas and hot tubs must remain closed.Indoor pools will be capped at 25% capacity, while outdoor pools remain capped at 50%.“I urge everyone who plans to hit the gym after these orders go into effect to take these precautions seriously and do everything in their power to protect themselves and their families,"" Whitmer said in a Thursday statement. ""Be smart, and stay safe.”Indoor organized sports also can resume, but guests will be limited to two per athlete. Outdoor organized sports would be limited to up to 100 guests.Athletes will be required to wear masks, except when swimming, and should maintain 6 feet of distance when ""compatible,"" according to Whitmer's order.Bowling and ice rinks may only open for organized sports, according to the order.The executive orders were followed closely by anannouncement from the Michigan High School Athletic Associationthat reinstated the fall football season after it had been postponed to the spring. Games can begin Sept. 18, the league said.The association also noted competitions could start immediately for boys soccer and on Wednesday for girls swimming, diving and volleyball.There is no mention in the orders of the reopening of movie theaters or banquet facilities in lower Michigan, where they have been shuttered since March.The state Department of Health and Human Services rules that were issued in tandem with the orders recommend against contact sports such as football, wrestling or soccer at schools and universities. But the department said the guidance could be adjusted with updated epidemiological data.The health department's guidance recommends frequent hand-washing, proper disinfecting of facilities or shared equipment, avoidance of shared items such as towels or water bottles, avoidance of post-game high fives or handshakes, and limitations on carpools.There have been at least 30 outbreak investigations in recent weeks linked to sports teams, clubs and gyms, according to the state health department. The outbreaks can easily spread beyond the team and to the community.“Individuals can now choose whether or not to play organized sports, and if they do choose to play, this order requires strict safety measures to reduce risk,” Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said Thursday. ""Based on current data, contact sports create a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and MDHHS strongly recommends against participating in them at this time.""The orders do not detail exceptions for ancillary activities such as marching band or cheerleading, but noted the ""elevated risk"" that accompanies “shouting, singing or breathing forcefully.”So long as gyms adhere to the restrictions in Whitmer's order, the activity should be ""part of the universe"" of openings that can occur with controlled risk, said Nigel Paneth, a professor at Michigan State University's Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Pediatrics and Human Development.But Paneth was less confident about the order allowing organized sports, calling it a ""mistake"" that has been proven to lead to virus transmission among athletes in contact sports.""I'm with the health department,"" said Paneth, referring to the department's recommendation against high school sports. ""These kind of group activities just are not working.""Even mask use is no guarantee that the virus wouldn't spread among athletes, he said.""Helmets fall off. Shoulder pads fall off. You think a mask is going to stay on?” Paneth said. ""I think it’s a step too far because it really is going to almost surely promote the spread of infections.""Whitmer's administration has been hinting at the reopening of gyms and other shuttered businesses for about three weeks as calls to reopen the facilities have mounted.Most businesses in Michigan closed abruptly March 23 when Whitmer issued her Stay Home, Stay Safe order in an attempt to control the spread of the virus.She gradually loosened the restrictions, allowing 17 northern Michigan counties and the Upper Peninsula to reopen restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters in May. She re-tightened bar restrictions there in July.Lower Michigan restaurants reopened in June.Last month, Whitmer allowed Detroit's three casinos to reopen at 15% capacity.The Michigan Fitness Club Association said Thursday it appreciated the reopening and committed to the ""health and safety"" of members and the public.""We are well-prepared to ensure a safe, clean environment and we are excited to offer Michiganders the opportunity to resume their exercise routines,"" the group said. ""We look forward to working with Gov. Whitmer and her administration to help build a healthy Michigan.”For others, the executive orders were lacking key permissions that struggling, still-closed businesses sought.The ongoing closure of banquet halls will decimate facilities across the state, said Alex Lozovoj, general manager of the Italian American Cultural Society in Clinton Township. Lozovoj has canceled weddings and events, run through a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan and is about to start construction on a 3,000-square-foot outdoor platform to hold events.""We have no end in sight on this,"" Lozovoj said. ""We’re crying, we’re begging the government to open us back up because we’ve already lost all our peak time.""If this doesn’t end soon, I can’t imagine any of the banquet halls in the state being able to survive.”For Mike Lucente, owner of Harbor Lanes Bowling Center in St. Clair Shores, the news that he can reopen is well-timed.“This is our normal start-up time either before or after Labor Day,” he said. “I just had a league meeting (Wednesday) night. … They are ready to go. They want to bowl.”Lucente said that league play makes up 75% of his business. He missed the summer league, which would have run for about 14 weeks.Lucente has had concerns about losing business due to the closure.“I might lose these people forever,” he said. “Once they find other things to do, you can’t get them back.”Ken Welch, owner of Pointe Fitness and Training Center in Harper Woods, said Thursday he’s relieved he will be able to reopen his gym. The decision is long overdue, he said.“If you design it in a more structured way to limit the crowd, we could have been doing this,” Welch said.The fitness center owner now needs to decide which approaches he’ll take to limit capacity, which could include an appointment-based system, shortened hours and limited session times.“We have a conscientiousness membership that’s very aware of all of these things,” Welch said. “It’s not going to be a hard sell.”Although Pointe Fitness and Training Center has lost clients, Welch said he has retained a core group of members he expects to return.“Financially, I think we’re going to be OK,” Welch said. “We did get a little bit of government money. I’m not going to go into detail, but that’s helped us out to kind of weather this. All small gyms have that kind of thing. If you’re not working another job or didn’t get your loans from the government, you’re hurting.”Kathy Chester, owner of Disrupt Fitness Gym in Berkley, said she’s excited to work out with her clients.“Our kids, our clients need to be physically moving for their mental well-being and everything,” she said. “I think it’s so important.”Chester said she has concerns about the use of masks indoors. She’s been doing cardio workouts outside in the park. Some participants have worn masks, some haven’t.“That’s incredibly difficult to be working out in masks,” she said. “And so I want them to be able to do that in a place where they can get enough airflow and not get so overwhelmed. I can’t imagine running on a treadmill.”She recommends clients purchase high-quality athletic masks.There likely will be more of a focus on personal training instead of fitness classes, Chester said.“I don’t think clients are going to be able to go into a class…,” she said. “I think that will nerve them up.”",2
360,‘What in the hell are we doing?’: Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton clash over coronavirus spending — foreshadowing a bitter battle in post-Trump GOP,-16.33,30.67,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/what-in-the-hell-are-we-doing-ted-cruz-and-tom-cotton-clash-over-coronavirus-spending-foreshadowing-a-bitter-battle-in-post-trump-gop/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,alternet,25,"The United States’ federal deficit was already huge before the coronavirus pandemic, but the pandemic has caused it to increase even more — and at a private lunch on Tuesday, July 21, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas clashed with a fellow Republican, Sen.  Tom Cotton of Arkansas, during a discussion of coronavirus spending and the federal deficit.According to the Washington Post’sJames Hohmann, Cotton “suggested” that  “Republicans should be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.” But Cruz vehemently disagreed, declaring “What in the hell are we doing?”Cotton, Hohmann notes, “argued that the full conference needs to focus on protecting their most vulnerable members. Cotton postulated that Democrats would spend more money if they win the Senate majority in November — and therefore, it is cheaper in the long run to allow the size of the spending package to grow with more goodies to benefit incumbents who are up for reelection.”It remains to be seen whether or not President Donald Trump will win a second term in November. Many recent polls have shown Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — in some of them, by double digits. But whether Trump leaves the White House in January 2021 or January 2025, Republicans will eventually have to debate what a post-Trump GOP will look like — and as Hohmann sees it, the clash between Cruz and Cotton could foreshadow a clash between the Republican senators in 2024.“Cruz and Cotton are among the small clique of ambitious Republican senators in their forties who have been laying the groundwork to run for president in 2024, along with Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.),” Hohmann explains. “The dueling stances Cruz and Cotton staked out behind closed doors offer an early taste of the ideological battles we can expect as Republicans increasingly vie to take the torch from President Trump. These fights will flare up faster and hotter if the president loses in November. Others outside the Senate, such as Vice President (Mike) Pence and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, are also expected to compete for the nod.”",1
361,The Polls Showed Democrats Poised to Reclaim the Senate. Then Came Election Day.,-9.25,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05112020/senate-republicans-majority-over-democrats-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,insideclimatenews,21,"The dreams of climate-concerned Americans who had hoped voters would hand Democrats control of the Senate—along with the power to act on a climate agenda—were all but dashed in the election, despite bitterly fought campaigns from Maine to Arizona.Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up three seats.Former astronautMark Kellyin Arizona and former Colorado Gov.John Hickenlooperin Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like that script might play out. But then key Republican incumbents held off their Democratic challengers—Sens.Joni Ernstin Iowa,Lindsey Grahamin South Carolina,Susan Collinsin Maine, and most likelyThom Tillisin North Carolina andDan Sullivanin Alaska.We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.While there were still technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple of seats, they appeared late Wednesday to be long shots at best, leaving some climate activists distraught.“I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,” said Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There is so much work to do.”There was a lot at stake for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfire seasons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires this summer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy.Democrats will still control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change.Expertshave saidthat in a Republican-controlled Senate, there still could be some less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have not so far put forward any comprehensive climate plans.“None of the Republican programs we have seen would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given the science around climate change,” said David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University.Scientistshave saidthat to keep global temperatures from rising beyond acceptable limits, there’s a global need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Perhaps the most telling upset that never happened was in Kentucky, where Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellkept his job, despite a fossil fuels agenda, his defense of Trump’s anti-science and deregulatory policies and no plan for climate change. McConnell, 78, was rewarded with a seventh term by soundly defeating Democrat Amy McGrath, despite her $80 million warchest.“I am glad they decided our arguments were better than hers,” he said Wednesday.Anticipating the Senate race outcomes would go Republicans’ way, he said, “If my math is correct, I will still be the offensive coordinator.”The current Republican majority is 53. For Democrats to secure a 51-vote majority, they would have needed a net gain of three Republican seats plus a tie-breaking vote by a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, assuming a win by former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. If President Trump wins, the Democrats would need to net four seats previously held by Republicans.But, by Wednesday evening, Democrats watched nearly all their hopes slip away. Sen. David Perdue’s continued to comfortably lead DemocraticchallengerJon Ossoff with 50.3 percent of the vote as the final ballots were being counted in Georgia, thus potentially avoiding a Jan. 5 runoff election. In the race for Georgia’s other Senate seat, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock led a crowded field in a special election and will face incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a Jan. 5 runoff, since neither collected more than 50 percent of the vote. Loeffler was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to fill the seat vacated late last year by Johnny Isakson.Warnock, a vocal environmental and climate justice advocate, received considerably fewer votes than Loeffler and her main challenger, Republican Rep. Doug Collins, illustrating the challenge Warnock will face in January.The widely respected Cook Political Report said Democrats’ “razor-thin hopes” of regaining control of the Senate would hinge on Georgia runoffs in January if the Perdue-Ossoff race also requires a runoff—and then Democrats would have to defeat both GOP incumbents, Perdue and Loeffler.Going into Tuesday’s election, climate voters revelled in the likelihood that a national climate policy might finally be on the near horizon as pollsters projected that Democrats had a good chance of winning the Senate majority and positioning Congress to reduce carbon emissions and advance clean energy.Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website had given Democrats a 78 percent chance of flipping the Senate. And the Cook Report had concluded that Democrats were the clear favorites to take back the Senate with just days to go until Election Day.But on Wednesday, the Cook report had a new analysis.It called the outlook for Warnock “ominous” in the runoff, while noting the Democrats’ failures in “multiple avenues of flipping the Senate” and that, “in all likelihood,” Republicans would hold on. “In races that Democrats were bullish on and even Republicans sounded very wary about holding in the final days, everything came up red.”Republicans went on a roll.In Iowa, Ernst, who hashada significant relationship with Big Oil, survived an embarrassing moment during a debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, where Ernst failed to know the break-even price of soybeans.In Maine, Collins, who has the strongest voting record on climate among Senate Republicans, won a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon in what the Portland Press Heralddescribedas “an intensely negative contest.”Big environmental groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters that hadabandonedCollins for Gideon now find themselves in the position of having to rebuild their bridges with her.Republicans also took back the Senate seat in Alabama held by Doug Jones, with a victory by a former football coach, Tommy Tuberville, whoarguedthat only God can control the climate.And one of most closely watched and expensive Senate races was inSouth Carolina, where Graham, a self-styled climate champion with little to show for his rhetoric, defeated a well-funded Jaime Harrison, a Democrat who had set fundraising records.“To those who have been following this race, I hope you got the message,” Graham said during his victory speech. “If you don’t get this message, it’s hopeless. The message I got: people like what I am doing and I am going to keep doing it. I am going back to the Senate with a purpose.”Part of that purpose, he said, was to “do everything I can to stop the radical agenda coming from Nancy Pelosi’s House.”Coming into the race, most scenarios for Democrats taking back the Senate started with Hickenlooper beating Sen. Cory Gardner and Kelly, a retired astronaut married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, defeating Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona.They were able to do that.During his campaign this year, Hickenlooper—who some progressives had dubbed “Frackenlooper”—managed to transform his reputation as a fossil fuel-industry supporter into a candidate pledging to fight climate change.  Gardner had sought to dodge the anti-climate label applied to the GOP.“From start to finish, the race for the Senate in Colorado has been about public lands and addressing climate change,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the national environment-focused political action committee, the League of Conservation Voters.Hickenlooper was also endorsed by the Protect Our Winters Action Fund, a climate action group led by outdoor athletes, which noted that “Colorado’s winter sports tourism economy is in harm’s way due to climate change.” The fund also backed Kelly, noting that he “has spoken favorably of a carbon tax.”In Arizona, Kelly told voters during the campaign how his views on climate and the environment were shaped by his experiences in space. He pledged to use science and data as tools to help tackle climate change and facilitate Arizona’s transition to renewable energy.In Montana, a tight race went to incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, who fought off a challenge by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock in an intense battle that left many Montanans eager for the campaign season to end.In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said national political pundits and pollsters that had forecast a good night for Democrats got it wrong once again in the race between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a charismatic Black candidate and former Agriculture Secretary.“We are going to elect someone who is going back to Washington and still be in the majority,” Reeves said at a victory celebration for Hyde-Smith, who easily defeated Espy by 13 percentage points.“It was the Second Amendment that was on the ballot tonight,” said Hyde-Smith, who had tied her fortunes to Trump’s agenda and supported production of Mississippi’s and the nation’s energy resources, including biofuels. “It was socialism that was on the ballot.”James Bruggers covers the U.S. Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

364,Lawsuit Challenges Admissions Changes Meant to Boost Diversity at Acclaimed High School,0.33,46.67,https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/lawsuit-challenges-admissions-changes-meant-to-boost-diversity-at-acclaimed-high-school/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,edweek,25,"A group representing Asian-American parents on Wednesday sued a Virginia school district over a new admissions plan designed to boost racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a highly selective magnet program that is considered one of the top academic high schools in the nation.The group, called the Coalition for TJ, contends that a new “holistic review” admissions program will significantly reduce the proportion of Asian-American students at the high school in Alexandria, Va.“Plaintiff’s data analysts project that Asian-American student enrollment at TJ will drop from 73 percent under the merit-based race-blind admissions system to 31 percent under the new racial-balancing admissions system for the Class of 2025,”says the lawsuitfiled in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. “No other racial group is projected to lose seats. The greatest beneficiary of the new admissions system in terms of increased population will be white students.”The Fairfax County school district did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.According to the 187,000-student district, in suburban Washington, D.C., Thomas Jefferson had a 2019-20 student enrollment that was 71.5 percent Asian, 19.48 percent non-Hispanic White, 2.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, 1.72 percent Black, and 4.70 percent other.The school system, whose overall student enrollment is 38 percent White, 27 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, and 10 percent Black, has made efforts to boost diversity at Thomas Jefferson in recent years, to little avail. The 2020 racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd in police custody and related events prompted renewed efforts to increase diversity at the selective school, which was founded in 1985.“Over the past 10 years, the [Thomas Jefferson] admissions process has undergone a series of changes that were intended to impact issues of diversity and inclusion,” the school systemsaid in a white paper last year. “Nonetheless, … these changes have not made a significant impact on the diversity of the applicants or admitted students.”Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand last year proposed eliminating Thomas Jefferson’s admissions test in favor of five “regional pathways” based on middle schools, with each being allocated a set number of seats in the incoming first-year class to be determined by lottery. Under that plan, Black student enrollment would have increased to 7 percent, while Asian student enrollment would drop to 54 percent, and White student enrollment would increase to 25 percent.The Fairfax County School Board voted to eliminate the entrance exam in October. In December, the board adopted an alternative new plan. Under that plan, the top 1.5 percent of each of the district’s middle schools who meet certain minimum academic standards will be eligible for admission to Thomas Jefferson. The district will then conduct a holistic review that examines factors including each student’s grade-point average, a problem-solving essay, and “experience factors” that include whether they are economically disadvantaged, English-language learners, or from underrepresented middle schools.“Experience factors will allow consideration of contexts that require a student to demonstrate grit and persevere through challenges to meet the [Thomas Jefferson] applicant requirements,” the school system’s white paper said.The district did not offer specific projections for changes in racial and ethnic balance under the holistic review plan. The new system is taking effect this spring for the class of 2025 that enters the high school this fall.The lawsuit by Coalition for TJ argues that the new admissions system violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause because “although facially race-neutral, it was enacted with discriminatory intent.”The lawsuit cites a 2020 email from Thomas Jefferson Principal Ann Bonitatibus to the school community saying that the racial composition of the high school does not reflect that of the school system overall.“If our demographics actually represented [Fairfax County Public Schools], we would enroll 180 Black and 460 Hispanic students, filling nearly 22 classrooms,” the principal’s email said.“This email put the focus squarely on race and the racial balance at TJ, foreshadowing changes to come,” says the suit, which cites other comments by officials in the district about the need to make Thomas Jefferson more representative.“Defendants have been forthright that the changes to the TJ admissions policy are intended to reduce the proportion of Asian-American students enrolled at TJ because they are ‘overrepresented’ compared to the rest of [Fairfax County Public Schools],” the suit says.“They want to match the racial makeup of the county as a whole,” Glenn E. Roper, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Coalition for TJ, said in an interview. “That was the motivating purpose. School districts can change an admissions program, but they can’t do it with a racially discriminatory purpose.”The lawsuit comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the holistic consideration of race in college admissions but has achallenge to Harvard’s race-conscious admissions programawaiting a decision from the justices on whether they will review that case.In 2007, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down two school districts’ voluntary race-conscious plans for assigning students to schools, inParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a concurrence that suggested there were permissible ways for districts to boost racial diversity through race-conscious means.One of those was “drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods,” Kennedy wrote in his concurrence, which some legal experts consider the controlling opinion inParents Involvedbecause much of the main opinion in that case was a mere plurality.The Fairfax County plan for Thomas Jefferson High aims to be a race-neutral plan for increasing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, the very kind of plan that many advocates have urged schools and colleges to adopt instead of race-conscious policies.It will be up to a federal district court, for starters, to decide whether the plan was adopted with the impermissible racial motivation alleged in the lawsuit.",2
365,China hits back at allegations from U.S. of lack of transparency about coronavirus,0.0,46.33,https://globalnews.ca/news/7640261/china-us-coronavirus-transparency/,https://adfontesmedia.com/global-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-14,globalnews.ca,19,"Chinafired back at the U.S. on Sunday over allegations from the White House thatBeijingwithheld some information about thecoronavirusoutbreak fromWorld Health Organization (WHO)investigators.In a statement on Saturday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington had “deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of theCOVID-19investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,” he said, referring to the WHO mission investigating the origins of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late in 2019.“To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak.” Sullivan’s statement said.China responded Sunday with a statement from its Washington Embassy that said the U.S. had already “gravely damaged international co-operation on COVID-19” and was now “pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfully supporting the WHO and at the WHO itself.”While it welcomed PresidentJoe Biden‘s decision to reverse the Trump administration’s move to leave the WHO, China hopes the U.S. will “hold itself to the highest standards, take a serious, earnest, transparent and responsible attitude, shoulder its rightful responsibility, support the WHO’s work with real actions and make due contribution to the international co-operation on COVID-19,” the statement said.Following allegations of Chinese withholding of data in The New York Times and other media outlets, investigation team member Peter Daszak tweeted, “This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission.”This was NOT my experience on@WHOmission. As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways.https://t.co/gwGnm9pnGj— Peter Daszak (@PeterDaszak)February 13, 2021“As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways,” Daszak tweeted.Another team member, Thea Koelsen Fischer of Denmark, also said that had not been her experience and implied some comments had been misrepresented in the media.“We DID build up a good relationship in the Chinese/Int Epi-team! Allowing for heated arguments reflects a deep level of engagement in the room. Our quotes are intendedly twisted casting shadows over important scientific work,” Fischer tweeted.While in Wuhan, Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries.The British-born Daszak, a zoologist who now works in New York, affirmed Fischer’s remarks, tweeting: “It’s disappointing to spend time w/ journalists explaining key findings of our exhausting month-long work in China, to see our colleagues selectively misquoted to fit a narrative that was prescribed before the work began. Shame on you ?nytimes.”Daszak had previously worked with the deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, to track down the origins of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak of the disease. He earlier told The Associated Press that the WHO team enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested.The 10-nation WHO team last week departed Wuhan after nearly a month. It visited markets, hospitals and research centres, including the highly secure Wuhan Institute of Virology that has been the subject of speculation because of its large collection of bat virus specimens.In their comments while in China, team members said they had some new insights into the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people, but that major questions are still unanswered.The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. They said transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, but an alternate theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab was unlikely.The WHO team’s visit was politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters.",2

Vanessa Guillen, a Fort Hood soldier who prosecutors say was murdered in an armory on post by a fellow 3rd Cavalry Regiment trooper.Guillen’s family said she had been sexually harassed by a fellow soldier prior to her death, but she didn’t report the incident for fear of retribution. Following those allegations, Army Forces Command sent a small team in June to specifically look at theSHARP program on Fort Hood.FORSCOM’s review found that the post’s SHARP program overall meets Army standards. But the team also found that 18 out of the 52 women surveyed on post, about one-third, reported being sexually harassed. That number concerned lawmakers and prompted questions about whether the standards of success for SHARP programs need to be changed.TheGovernment Accountability Officeannounced in late August that it would review the Army’s SHARP program, as well, following complaints from members of Congress who sought more answers.Natalie Khawam, an attorney representing the Guillen family, said McCarthy’s comments “corroborated what I have been emphasizing.”Khawam drafted a piece of legislation called the Vanessa Guillen Act, which would create an independent system to investigate both sexual harassment and sexual assault incidents. It would also provide independent charging decisions for courts-martial.“Victims like Vanessa Guillen, who suffered from sexual harassment and assault while serving our country, were failed by the system,” Khawam told Army Times. “In September Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi has promised to schedule our bill for a vote. We have patiently been waiting for her to tell us the date.”In his comments on video Wednesday, McCarthy said that it is “abundantly clear” that Army leaders must do more with regards to sexual harassment and assault investigations.“I am deeply saddened and concerned by the recent news reports of how sexual assault and sexual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to our soldiers,” McCarthy said in the video statement Wednesday. “Leaders, regardless of rank, are accountable for what happens in their units and must have the courage to speak up and intervene when they recognize actions that bring harm to our soldiers and to the integrity of our institution.”McCarthy did not elaborate on which media reports he was referring to specifically, but Guillen’s case has sparked hundreds of survivors to come forward to sharestories of sexual traumain the military.Some of those stories were chronicled this week by CBS Evening News, which interviewed nearly two dozen victims and several whistle-blowers who worked for the SHARP programs as part of a series aired Tuesday.The problems at Fort Hood, however, go beyond issues related to sexual assault and harassment. The post has been plagued this year with a number of violent deaths that set it apart from other installations.Severalof thedeaths that involve foul playinvolveviolence against soldiersstationed there by civilians in the local community.“The numbers are high here,” McCarthy said during a visit to Fort Hood in early August. “They are the highest, in most cases, for sexual assault and harassment and murders for our entire formation — the U.S. Army.”Kyle Rempfer was an editor and reporter who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents.

369,Here’s What Researchers Have Discovered So Far About COVID Vaccines And Donated Breast Milk,0.0,45.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolefallert/covid-vaccine-breast-milk,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,buzzfeednews,25,"Organizations that provide donated breast milk to parents say fielding questions about how the vaccines figure into the transfer of antibodies has led to a “second layer of chaos” from the pandemic.BuzzFeed News ReporterDanielle Byrdsong loaded bags of breast milk into her car, preparing to make her first donation since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in April.“To be honest, I was a little concerned,” she said.Byrdsong, a 36-year-old mother of two living in the Washington, DC, area, told BuzzFeed News that at the time, she didn’t know if getting the COVID vaccine would affect her ability to donate her breast milk — an information gap that is increasingly becoming a factor for milk banks as more of the US population is vaccinated. A key question from donors and recipients is whether protection againstthe coronavirustravels through a vaccinated person’s breast milk to an infant. While long-term studies at a larger scale are needed, early research suggests that the answer is yes.“We don’t have that proof,” said Kim Updegrove, the executive director at Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin. “We are assuming that it's protective. We are assuming that it's coming through with the milk and that it's a really good thing. All of that leads to a very interesting question coming from people who sit on both sides of the vaccine fence.”Fielding uncertainty about the vaccine has become the pandemic’s “second layer of chaos” for milk banks, Updegrove said. Fifteen months after the banks initially addressed panic over the effect COVID-19 might have on lactating or pregnant people, there is a growing need for information regarding whether infants are protected against the virus via the milk of vaccinated people.Donations are typically collected by nonprofit organizations that test the milk, mix multiple donors’ milk into single batches, and distribute the nutrient-rich pooled product to medical providers for people likeParisHenderson, a 33-year-old mother whose son was born prematurely in May. The hospital offered her donor milk when her own milk didn’t come in after the early delivery; her body was behind schedule and unprepared to produce milk. Henderson hasn’t received a COVID-19 vaccine but tested positive for antibodies after she overcame the virus.“I didn’t care if the person was vaccinated or not,” Henderson said about the people who donated the milk her son received. It mattered more to her that her baby received the nutrients in the milk, she added.A main reason for confusion is a lack of robust clinical study about the effect of the COVID-19 vaccines on pregnant or lactating people. As is standard for most clinical trials, pregnant people were left out of the COVID-19 vaccine trials. To include them would have meant that researchers needed to collect data on both parents and babies, potentially prolonging the clinical trial process and raising complicated ethical questions. According to theCDC, there’s little to no information available about the safety and effects of the vaccines on breast milk as of now, but specific clinical trials are underway or planned.“It just feels like another [instance] in which women are just sort of forgotten,” said Erin Burgin, a 35-year-old mother of two from the Washington, DC, area.After becoming pregnant in 2020 and delivering a few months ago, Burgin said the lack of information on the safety of breastfeeding when vaccinated was “extremely unsettling.”But that’s starting to change.Arecent joint studyfrom Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital concluded that vaccinated parents do in fact pass their antibodies to infants via their breast milk. The study took place from December 2020 to February 2021 and evaluated 131 women who were either of reproductive age, lactating, or pregnant and about to receive either the Pfizer or Moderna shots. The researchers had two goals in mind: track if their vaccines worked against COVID-19 and, if so, whether the shot also provided protection to infants.Donor breast milk at the Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin is pasteurized and pooled into a single product.“We found that, reassuringly, pregnant and lactating women made similar amounts of antibodies in response to the vaccination, so vaccination was effective,” Dr. Kathryn Gray, lead author of the study, told BuzzFeed News. “For all the lactating individuals in our study, we found that the maternal antibodies also crossed into the breast milk. That suggests that there may be some benefit and protection conferred to infants from pregnant individuals and lactating individuals who are vaccinated.”But the immunity benefits for the baby don’t last long after weaning, Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News. The antibodies coat the baby’s mouth, throat, and digestive tract, keeping the virus from infecting the baby’s cells, but researchers don’t know for how long.Gawled a small studythat determined both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines do not cross into breast milk. The study analyzed the breast milk of seven individuals at various time points after they received either mRNA vaccine. Researchers said the results bolstered recommendations that lactating people who get the vaccine shouldn’t stop breastfeeding. Gaw added that she saw no harm in mixing pre- and post-vaccine milk.While the new findings are reassuring, the results shouldn’t change how milk banks pool their donations, both Gaw and Gray said. Gray emphasized that prior to the pandemic, adults who produce breast milk are typically exposed to myriad infections and receive vaccines frequently.And as the population becomes more immune to COVID-19, these antibodies will just become another layer of protection breast milk provides babies that formula doesn’t. But consistency is important, a report inNaturefound, because babies process antibodies within a matter of hours or days. As a result, any layer of protection that breast milk provides lasts only as long as babies are breastfed.“We have always asked about vaccinations during our screening process, so this is just a new set of information for us to collect,” said Rebecca Heinrich, director of Mothers’ Milk Bank. “We do not yet know what sort of antibody ‘load’ is transferred, or what sort of immune system boost it might provide, but of course our hope is that antibodies in donor milk help protect the infant from all sorts of pathogens, including COVID-19.”Byrdsong, the mother of two living in DC, said that for people like her, the first step should be clearing up confusion over whether antibodies or the vaccine itself is transferred via breast milk.“I think that most mothers who have concerns about the vaccine ... their discomfort with it has to do with the vaccine itself being given directly to a child versus antibodies,” Byrdsong said. “Personally, I don't know any mother who is against their child receiving antibodies, so I don't know if that's something that they understand, that there's a difference between the two.”Burgin, who received the Moderna vaccine this spring, said she is currently breastfeeding her 6-month-old baby and gives her 3-year-old child a glass of breast milk each week as an immunity boost. Gaw said it’s not yet clear how much milk an older child would need to achieve immunity or how long that immunity would take.“I talked to other moms who said that they've continued their breastfeeding journey longer because they had the vaccine and they want to help some of their older kids in their house,” Burgin said. “It's a huge discussion … and breast milk is an easy way to give [protection] to your kid who can't get the vaccine yet.”Milk banks typically ask donors if they’ve received other major vaccines, such as against the measles, but they don’t yet have a standardized method to prove that they’ve gotten the COVID-19 vaccine or if they have responded positively and developed antibodies, Updegrove said. However, on average, more than 50% of donors in most states have self-reported in their profile that they received one of the FDA-approved vaccines, she added.The Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin estimates it will process about 900,000 ounces of donor breast milk in 2021, about 100,000 more ounces than last year.But that won’t change the way donated milk is pasteurized, said Lindsay Groff, executive director for Human Milk Banking Association of North America. She added that so far, there’s no information about the vaccine's effect on breast milk that would make any changes to the donation process necessary.Experts are also reminding parents that since milk from banks is pooled from multiple people, it’s not possible to request milk from unvaccinated donors unless the recipient seeks it directly from an individual.“The reason why multi-donors are recommended in one pool of milk is that the women who are lactating and expressing their milk are not the same,” Updegrove said. “They're eating different diets, they're taking different vitamins. There's a value in mixing multiple different donors.”When asked about the typical profile of breast milk donors, Grey said she hopes to diversify the research on the vaccine’s effect on people who are lactating, since her study consisted primarily of white, non-Latino women.Henderson said important information about the health and immunity benefits of breast milk has been lacking among Black parents, and in her case, where she lives in Vienna, Virginia, determined her ability to receive a donation.“I think more women in my community in particular would breastfeed if they knew that they were providing their child with a sense of protection,” Henderson said. “I don't think that the information is there. Lactation consultations and breastfeeding centers, they're not available to all. We were fortunate to have our hospital in a wealthier area. That's why we got the donor milk … and they said, ‘This is not something that’s offered everywhere.’ We may not have been fortunate enough to have it.”Now that her milk supply has come in, Henderson said she would “absolutely” donate her milk.“You could be saving somebody's life or preventing a baby from getting sick,” she said. “They're so susceptible to everything anyways, just that one little layer of protection. You don’t really know, but I feel like it gives a parent peace of mind. A sense of comfort. And that's what I go back to. I don't know that I'm doing everything, but I know that at least I'm trying.”",2

It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death,"" he said. ""We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus.""Since the global health agency's pandemic declaration, nearly one in 10 of the state's residents has been infected, with thousands hospitalized by the effects of the virus, straining medical resources and hospital personnel.""This has been a long 12 months for everyone,"" Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Thursday at the opening of a COVID-19 vaccination center in Grundy County. ""The pandemic hasn't ended, but things are truly looking up.""In less than three months since the federal government began shipping vaccines to the states, Illinois has administered 3,680,703 doses as of Thursday, IDPH officials announced. Of those inoculated by Illinois vaccine providers, 1.3 million have been fully vaccinated, more than 10% of the state's population.State health officials Thursday reported COVID-19 vaccine providers throughout Illinois had administered 112,776 doses Wednesday - the fourth-highest single-day total - and the state is averaging 98,166 inoculations a day over the past week.According to IDPH figures, Illinois vaccine providers have used 75.1% of the state's allotted doses so far. And in the past three days, the state has received 635,180 new doses of the vaccine. That does not include thousands of doses being administered each day at a mass vaccination site at the United Center that uses federal resources, or several mobile vaccine clinics run by the federal government.On the anniversary of the global pandemic declaration, IDPH officials reported Thursday that 55 more Illinois residents have died from the virus and another 1,700 new cases were diagnosed.Hospitals statewide are treating 1,118 COVID-19 patients. Of those hospitalized, 231 are in intensive care, according to IDPH figures.The state's seven-day average case positivity rate is now at 2.2%. Case positivity shows the level of infection within a certain population. A seven-day average is used to smooth out any anomalies in the daily reporting of new cases and test results.Pritzker urged residents to remain vigilant about mitigating the spread of the virus by continuing to wear masks, maintaining social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.""We still have a long way to go,"" he said. ""Patience is the watchword for everyone.""",2

Braindead brain surgeon Ben Carson and the clown from the MyPillow commercials were teaming up to hawk a laughably phony coronavirus miracle cure, and they’d gotten Donald Trump on board with it.But sure enough, the whole thing was very much a real story. Ben Carson has a documented history of lending his name to useless supplements disguised as phony miracle cures, including hawking tree bark as a supposed cancer cure, so it wasn’t surprising to see him involved in this latest scheme. But the MyPillow guy was somewhat of a surprise. After all, he’s always come off as a mere informercial doofus who likes Donald Trump way too much.But when MyPillow guy Mike Lindell appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper today, it immediately became clear that Lindell was someone different than the happy and goofy guy he portrays in his TV ads. When Cooper explained that there were no clinical trials for Lindell’s supposed coronavirus drug, Lindell turned angry and aggressive, as if the mask had finally been pulled back.By the time Anderson Cooper pointed out that there was no real difference between Mike Lindell and a “snake oil salesmen,” Lindell just about lost it. We should have known that there was something more sinister to the MyPillow guy than just being a goofy pitchman who was naive enough to fall for Donald Trump’s lies. Lindell exposed himself today in an ugly way. We’ll see if he now pulls back on this coronavirus scam, before it snowballs and destroys his pillow business as well.Bill Palmer is the publisher of the political news outlet Palmer Report",0
375,"If Mumia Abu-Jamal’s Case Is a ‘Non-Issue,’ Why Have Media Gone to Such Lengths to Silence Him?",-18.33,33.67,https://fair.org/home/if-mumia-abu-jamals-case-is-a-non-issue-why-have-media-gone-to-such-lengths-to-silence-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-01,fair,25,"Philadelphia public broadcasterWHYY(4/24/21) was one of the few outlets to report on an April 24 rally seeking the release from prison ofMumia Abu-Jamal. The story included important information on Abu-Jamal, who is serving a life sentence for the 1981 killing of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.It noted that the case has “drawn scrutiny” over claims of police, prosecutorial and judicial bias and misconduct. It cited new evidence released as part of the appeal process, including a note from a key prosecution witness asking the prosecuting attorney for money—the sort of evidence that Johanna Fernandez, a history professor and part of Abu-Jamal’s legal team, notes has in other instances led to a defendant either being set free or getting an immediate new trial.Along with Fernandez, the piece includes the voices of Abu-Jamal’s brother Keith Cook, and MOVE member Pam Africa, as well as people who traveled from around the country to call attention to Abu-Jamal’s case, his current state of health—he has a number of debilitating conditions, and has just had heart surgery—and to put his story in a context of political prisoners here and around the world.I confess I was still irked byWHYYusing its lead paragraph to frame the story like this:The case has pitted Abu-Jamal’s supporters, including a long list of national and international celebrities who say he was framed, against police and their supporters, who resent the attention given to a man convicted of murdering a fellow officer.It bugs me, because those were the themes decades ago when Abu-Jamal was first convicted and sentenced to death (Voices With Vision,4/27/21). That he was a “cause celebre”—and therefore, wink wink, something something about liberal Hollywood, no need to pay attention—and that the upset of anyone concerned about his deeply flawed trial or his inappropriate sentencing was merely theatrical, because, after all, he was “convicted,” wasn’t he?Elite media at the time were open to straight-up lies: A 1995Washington Poststory (5/18/95) led with a macabre account from Faulkner’s widow, Maureen Faulkner, about how when her husband’s bloody shirt was held up in court, Abu-Jamal turned around and smiled at her. Except attorney Leonard Weinglass and the court record show that Abu-Jamal wasn’t in court when the shirt was displayed (Extra! Update,8/95).ABC‘s investigative news show20/20(12/9/98) employed a number of techniques for their big 1998 piece—stating prosecution claims as fact, even when they were disputed by some of the prosecution’s own witnesses or the forensic record; stressing how a defense witness admitted being intoxicated, while omitting that prosecution witnesses said the same (Extra! Update,2/99).At one point, actor and activist Ed Asner is quoted saying, “No ballistic tests were done, which is pretty stupid”—but then host Sam Donaldson’s voiceover cuts him off: “But ballistics testdone,” he says, referring to tests that suggested that the bullet that killed Faulkner might have been the same caliber as Abu-Jamal’s gun. But he didn’t note that tests hadnotbeen done to determine whether that gun had fired the bullet, or whether it had been fired at all, or if there were gunpowder residues on Abu-Jamal’s hands.Producers fromPeople’s Video Networktold FAIR at the time (Extra! Update,2/99) thatABCnot only used clips they’d recorded from Abu-Jamal without permission, but they added layers of echo, making him sound, they said, “like a cave-dwelling animal.”No one was too surprised when it was revealed that in a letter asking permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to interview Abu-Jamal (a request that was denied),20/20pointed out that “we are currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police” (Extra! Update,2/99).After that, the main story has been non-coverage.For instance, in 2006, when Abu-Jamal won the right to appeal on three grounds—including a jury purged of Black people, the prosecutor lowering jurors’ sense of responsibility by saying their decision “would not be final,” and the fact that judge Albert Sabo was all kinds of biased—thePhiladelphia Daily Newstold reporter Dave Lindorff that it was a “non-issue” (Extra!,3–4/06)—although when a judge overturned the death sentence in 2001, the paper (12/19/01) found time to editorialize: “Let Mumia Rot in Darkness.”The late great media critic Ed Herman (Extra!,9–10/00) reported how thePhiladelphia Inquirerwouldn’t cover rallies and tribunals in support of Abu-Jamal, calling them “stunts,” but when the Fraternal Order of Police bought a full-page ad in theNew York Times, that merited a story.In 2000, when Amnesty International declared that the original trial was “deeply flawed,” theInky(2/18/00) made it the fifth “news brief” on page 2B.But if Mumia Abu Jamal’s case is a non-issue that only celebrities care about, why the active silencing?In 1994,NPRcancelled plans for a series of commentaries from Abu-Jamal—who is, after all, a journalist, a former head of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists—after Senator Bob Dole threatened their funding. They said it was because it was a “highly polarized and political controversy”—which they proceeded to say nothing about for the following year (Extra!,11–12/95).WhenDemocracy Now!prepared to air commentaries, stationKRTI, out of Philadelphia’s Temple University, cancelled the show and all ofPacificanews (Extra! Update,4/97), with a station VP explaining: “What’s good enough forNPRis good enough for me.”And when a Vermont college aired a taped commencement address from Abu-Jamal, it led Philadelphia lawmakers to throw together something called the Revictimization Relief Act, allowing crime victims  or prosecutors to sue inmates whose behavior behind bars “creates mental anguish” for the victims. Clearly unconstitutional, violating both free speech and due process rights, it was dubbed the Silencing Act by many, who noted that it didn’t just curtail prisoners’ right to speak, but journalists’ and all of our rights to hear them (FAIR.org,10/22/14).Media’s response was a shrug: TheNew York Timesran anAPpiece (10/21/14) with the headline “Pennsylvania: Gov Signs Law to Help Protect Crime Victims.”Elite media would have us believe they are engaged in a serious reckoning with the racism of the US criminal justice system, that they care about over-incarceration and prison conditions. And keeping people behind bars just because powerful people want them there, and not due to the merits of their case? Well, that’s what Other Countries do.If only there were a case, 40 years’ worth of case, that would allow them to explore those ideals—if not to do justice by Mumia Abu-Jamal (they can’t return what’s been taken from him), then to do some semblance of justice by their own claims of concern.",1

On the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the city of New Orleans was struck by this storm and left broken yet again.Sixteen years ago, I was starting my senior year of high school () and witnessed the destruction of New Orleans in statewide media, the national coverage, and from the accounts of those who evacuated to my high school. We had a handful of new classmates that year who came to us from the Catholic schools of New Orleans, and they had stories to tell.But we all watched as New Orleans became what felt like a developing world country. The streets were flooded for what seemed like forever. The government proved ineffective to help them. There were people stranded on rooftops for days. The Superdome became a long-term shelter for those displaced.Governor Kathleen Blanco blamed the federal government. The Bush administration blamed Blanco. The city of New Orleans blamed everyone else. It was a catastrophic failure at practically every level, and no one really seemed to get that there were lessons to be learned.Katrina would ultimately prove to be Blanco’s downfall. Bobby Jindal came in and, to his credit, it appears he did fight to get the levee systems of New Orleans in working order, and some improvements were made. But the city itself had made very few changes to allow for the residents to be ready to move in the event of another disaster. Even after sixteen years, it appears the only thing that changed was the levee systems. Everything else failed again.But the biggest failure of all seems to be a lack of an evacuation plan. New Orleans is confusing as hell to navigate into and through on the best of days.Twenty years ago, there was a solution to this, and it was implemented by Jeb Bush.Contraflow = both sides of major highways in same direction, for storm evacuationsLouisiana 2021:didn't implement contraflow before Hurricane Ida, many people are stuck in traffic jams trying to evacuate RN20 years ago in Florida:@JebBushpioneered a contraflow system— Gabe Hoffman (@GabeHoff)August 28, 2021June 2000:""Long evacuation travel times raised questions as to the need and feasibility of reverse laning limited access facilities to reduce these times.To address these issues, Governor Jeb Bush appointed a Governor's Hurricane Evacuation Task Forcehttps://t.co/Dkfof0Ofas— Gabe Hoffman (@GabeHoff)August 28, 2021There are numerous ways to enter and exit New Orleans, but given the geography of the state, evacuating the city is a hassle during a crisis. By having something like the contraflow system in place, the state would make it significantly easier to get people out in times of major weather events like Hurricane Ida.Right now, the city is completely without power. Cell service is sporadic at best in and around New Orleans. Transmission towers fell into the Mississippi River. Many people are stuck where they are with no power and no phones. They are completely in the dark, and it’s not because they chose to stay. For the vast majority, many simply couldn’t leave.What’s worse is that the city will be relying on not just the state but the federal government for assistance to get through. But three hours to its west is Lake Charles, which still has gotten none of the federal assistance it was promised by the government after Hurricane Laura. It, too, remains in tatters and struggling to recover a year later.The federal government is being run by the Biden administration, who over the last two weeks has proven it is incapable of even formulating a plan, much less following through on it. Everything about the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a disaster and the leaks from the intelligence and military communities heavily imply every issue has been self-inflicted rather than as a result of the Taliban’s sudden rise to power.I have no doubt that New Orleans will recover. It took some time after Katrina, but this time the levees appear to have held up and there is no major flooding in the city. That is an improvement, but the inability of the government at any level — local, state, or federal — to have done anything to mitigate the damage or to speed up the recovery is still proof that we have a long way to go in protecting our citizens from these threats in the future.",1

A month later, Smartmatic USA, a rival election-technology company,suedthe two lawyers for $2.7bn.Meanwhile, Lin Wood was facing his own legal headaches in Georgia, where he ischallenginga state bar request that he take a confidential mental competency exam after it conducted an extensive review of his alleged legal misconduct over election challenges.In July, a US appeals courtsuspendedGiuliani from practicing law in Washington DC, a month after he was suspended from practicing law in New York after a court ruled that he made “demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public in trying to overturn the election results”.One of the sanctioned lawyers from the Michigan lawsuit, Scott Hagerstrom, responded to Wednesday’s ruling,saying: “This is all political. This is all about sticking it to Donald Trump and the Republicans.”The other eight lawyers involved have yet to comment on the ruling.",1

Doug Joneswas already facing an uphill climb. In order to have a chance at reelection, Alabama’s Democratic incumbent didn’t just need to win in the state’s most populous counties. He needed to run up the score.Instead, GOP challenger Tommy Tuberville did well in the cities and suburbs, winning eight of the 10 largest counties in the state on hisway to a 20 point win. He flipped four of those large counties back to GOP.Jones won six of the 10 largest counties in 2017, including two of the top three. In 2017, Jones carried Madison County, home of Huntsville in north Alabama, and Mobile County on the coast. In that special election, Jones won around 57 percent of the vote in each of those counties.On Tuesday he lost both.Out of the 10 largest counties in Alabama, only Jefferson and Montgomery stuck with Jones.[Can’t see the map?Click here.]And while Jones did win in Jefferson County - the most populous in the state and and his home county - he significantly underperformed there compared to 2017. This year he edged Tuberville in Jefferson with 54 percent of the vote. In 2017, Jones earned a whopping 68 percent of the vote in Jefferson, in a year where turnout was very low.Jones also won Montgomery on Tuesday, part of the traditionally Democratic Black Belt and the fourth largest county in Alabama. He performed well throughout the Black Belt, which other than Montgomery is sparsely populated. Jones pulled 67 percent of the vote in Montgomery, but that was still a smaller victory than he earned in 2017, when he won Montgomery with 72 percent.Tuberville also flipped Lee County, home to Auburn, and Tuscaloosa County, both of which Jones carried in 2017.In fact, Tuesday’s result shows just how much of an anomaly the 2017 special election was. Even if Jones had replicated his percentages in the state’s largest counties, Tuberville still would have won handily.Do you have an idea for a data story about Alabama?

Congress will certify Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election. There were some 140 Republican House members who said they would object. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-RX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) lead a dozen or so Senate Republicans who would do the same. There would be an objection to the allocation of a specific state’s electoral votes, both chambers would break off to hold separate sessions with up to two hours of debate, and a final vote would be held on the matter. This was expected to happen at least three times. It was going to be an hours-long affair. Not the case. Both sessions had to recess because Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Building yesterday. They quickly overwhelmed the Capitol Police. They vandalized the offices. They duked it out with police in the rotunda; tear gas was deployed. They entered the Senate chamber. They tried to bust onto the House floor, but police barricaded the door with guns drawn.It led to a nonstop media meltdown. All the narratives were hurled against the wall about how these protesters were domestic terrorists, traitors, insurrectionists, and how this is what happens when a president peddled conspiracy theories and not fact. Oh yeah, you bet they tried to blame Trump for this event. And what happens later, the media, who had just slammed the peddling of conspiracy theories, serve up a whopper about the Capitol Police. You see,these protesters storm the Capitol Building. There is no evidence to back this up. This is the crackpipe nonsense from liberal media outlets and their allies.MSNBC's Ari Melber floats the possibility that U.S. Capitol Police purposefully allowed the violence to take place in that they assisted the mob in storming the property and causing such death and destruction.pic.twitter.com/u9PE2O9ghqAbsolutely unhinged Michael Beschloss furthers the conspiracy theory that Capitol Police purposefully allowed the violence to take place at the U.S. Capitol, adding that he's going to be too scared to go to sleep at night for the next two weeks.pic.twitter.com/kYIpIIcFApMichael Beschloss goes onto predict that Trump could try enact martial law, ""start unnecessary wars,"" and possibly use nuclear weapons all within the next two weeks before leaving office.NBC News presidential historian, step right up for your tin-foil hat.pic.twitter.com/yqurB0SQIsThis looks more like a giant, belligerent mob overwhelming Capitol Police than the Capitol Police suspiciously ""letting"" the mob storm the buildinghttps://t.co/NJySzfTSCwCurtis Houck of Newsbusters caught this piping hot load of garbage and tweeted about it. Oh, better yet, Michael Beschloss, a supposed presidential historian, decided to calm things today by saying Trump could try to enact martial law, launch nukes, and start insane wars before he leaves office. Uh, dude, if Trump wanted to stay in power, he would have done so eons ago, not two weeks before he leaves office. He didn’t do that because that’s never going to happen. Second, the police really were in cahoots with the so-called domestic terrorists in this event. I mean, I knew sniffing glue was bad, but golly.",0

Brianna Keilar just tore him apart after nearly every sentence he spoke, because each needed to be corrected and fact-checked in real time so that his advice didn't actually kill CNN viewers.Come to think of it, maybe as a Trump campaign lackey, that was a goal of Murtaugh's, but Keilar did her level best to take him down, executing her role as truth-teller journalist in stellar fashion. Here she is smashing his assertion that the only reason the media didn't advocate hydroxychloroquine was that Trump ""expressed optimism"" about it.MURTAUGH: Yes, and everybody embraced a study that it was a failure, and then that study had to be withdrawn. And now there is another study that shows that it can actually cut deaths by as much as 50%.KEILAR: Are you talking about the study that also using -- the study that also includes corticosteroids which are helpful in coronavirus? It is not hydroxychloroquine that helps patients. I'm not a doctor, clearly,MURTAUGH: So, now you're, again you're cherry picking.KEILAR: I'm not cherry picking. Tim, I talk to scientists and doctors. Clearly you don't.Here is Keilar tearing him down for swearing up and down that Dr. Fauci himself would prescribe hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. He tries to claim that because it's been used for 65 years, it's safe. She tries to explain how it's safeHe pretends not to get it because he is a cynical *sshole.MURTAUGH: It is been used for 65 years. How dangerous could it possibly be? It is a known -- it is a known --KEILAR: It is an anti-malarial drug.MURTAUGH: It's been used for six-and-a-half decades, so how dangerous could it be? You just said it is a dangerous drug but yet you admit it was used for 65 years.KEILAR: To prevent malaria, not for people who are potentially dying.MURTAUGH: Well, is it dangerous or not? Will it kill you or not? You just said it was dangerous yet you admit that people take it for malaria.KEILAR: I don't think people on their deathbed are given an anti-malarial medication to prevent them getting malaria. You know what, Tim? No, we're done with this part.MURTAUGH: So it's only used by people on their deathbed. Is that what you're saying?Then she just cuts him off and ends the conversation, like a mother telling her pre-teen child that their arguments aren't going anywhere, and they are still punished. Cementing her spot at the top of the journalistic class, she asks Murtaugh to wait as she brings in an actual doctor to comment.MURTAUGH: There is a lot to be said for this interview, you're right.KEILAR: Actually stand by. I want to bring in Dr. James Phillips standing by and maybe he could shed a little light when it comes to hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Phillips, you're the expert. I feel like I'm talking about this until I'm blue in my face and I've spoken to a lot of doctors like you about this, and you just react when it comes to hydroxychloroquine and I want to be so clear to the people who are watching this, because this is a health issue.DR. PHILLIPS: Thanks for having me on, Brianna. I prepared to talk about recent studies and some other things but this most recent interview is absolutely just unbelievable. So, we've got to get all of the politics and the craziness out of there. Hydroxychloroquine has not been proven safe or efficacious in the treatment of this disease to any degree that doctors should be prescribing this to any patients outside of a clinical trial. The clinical trials that have been performed so far for the most part do not show any efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. In addition it can cause serious illness. It can cause heart problems, it can cause dysrythmias. So to say it's not dangerous is not necessarily true. It has been studied in the setting of patients with malaria. Those are patients with a particular type of symptoms and and a very particular type of disease. Different drugs respond and they work in different ways depending on the situation of the patient. And the studies that have been done in patients with COVID-19 are certainly not conclusive enough to be able to say this is totally safe. Studies have shown that patients probably have died because of the dysrhythmias that occur. So I agree what was just recently said was irresponsible and being said for political reasons and I completely disagree with it.WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS WHETHER OR NOT TIM MURTAUGH HUNG AROUND TO COMMENT AFTER THAT?Yeah, he did not. But trust that Dr. Phillips went on to express disbelief, and explain why just because the FDA has ruled one drug safe for a certain use, that doesn't mean it is safe for other uses. You wouldn't give a hemophiliac a blood thinner, right? Murtaugh's asinine and childish arguments were just ripped apart by Dr. Phillips, and no one should be surprised that he didn't hang around to hear it happen.",1
382,Several tied to Haiti assassination plot were previously US law enforcement informants,0.0,45.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/americas/haiti-assassination-plot-us-law-informants/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-12,cnn,24,"Several of the men involved in the assassination ofHaiti’s Presidentpreviously worked as US law enforcement informants, according to people briefed on the matter, as US investigators grapple with an increasing number of Florida links to the alleged hit squad.Haitian President Jovenel Moise waskilled last Wednesday in an operationthat Haitian authorities say involved at least 28 people, many of them Colombian mercenaries hired through a Florida-based security company.At least one of the men arrested in connection to the assassination by Haitian authorities previously worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA said in a statement in response to CNN.“At times, one of the suspects in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise was a confidential source to the DEA,” the DEA said in a statement.Haitian police arrest suspect accused of orchestrating President's assassination“Following the assassination of President Moise, the suspect reached out to his contacts at the DEA. A DEA official assigned to Haiti urged the suspect to surrender to local authorities and, along with a US State Department official, provided information to the Haitian government that assisted in the surrender and arrest of the suspect and one other individual,” the DEA said.The DEA said it is aware of reports that some assassins yelled “DEA” at the time of their attack. The DEA said in its statement that none of the attackers were operating on behalf of the agency.Other suspects also hadUS ties, including working as informants for the FBI, the people briefed on the matter said. The FBI said in response to CNN’s reporting that it doesn’t comment on informants, except to say that it uses “lawful sources to collect intelligence” as part of its investigations.Authorities on Monday announced thearrest of a suspectwho they say orchestrated the assassination. Haitian-bornChristian Emmanuel Sanon, 63, entered the country on a private jet in June, Police Chief Leon Charles said at a news conference.Haitian authorities say that Sanon hired the Florida-based company CTU Security, which they alleged recruited men initially to provide security for Sanon, though their mission appears to have changed thereafter.“He came to Haiti accompanied by a few people in the beginning of June, these people were supposed to ensure his security and his business,” said Charles at the news conference. “He came with the intention to take over as President of the Republic.”Two Colombian suspects who were killed in Haiti by police also had links to CTU Security, which is owned by a Venezuelan national, said Colombian police on Monday. They have requested assistance from the US Interpol office to investigate the company’s data.It’s not clear that the men who worked as US law enforcement informants wittingly participated in the assassination plot or were aware of the mission, the people briefed on the matter said.Haitians hope 'the truth will come out' as foreign investigators probe assassination of their PresidentCNN has not been able to reach Sanon or his representatives for comment since his arrest.A delegation from the US, including representatives from the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, returned from Port-au-Prince on Monday and briefed President Joe Biden,according to the White House.Biden said later on Monday that he was “closely following the events in Haiti,” and that the US was “ready to continue to provide assistance.”Haitian authorities have provided limited details on the investigation, but the growing number of Florida connections to the plot appears to portray an operation at least partly hatched in the United States. Three American citizens have now been arrested in Haiti for their alleged involvement, according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price.That may increase the likelihood that the US Justice Department could bring charges against any US participants in the plot.On Monday, the Justice Department said it would “investigate whether there were any violations of US criminal law” in connection with the assassination.Senior officials have conducted an initial assessment, and the department would continue assisting Haitian authorities to investigate “the facts and circumstances surrounding this heinous attack,” said a spokesperson in a statement.CNN’s Caitlin Hu, Mitchell McCluskey and Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.",2
383,Black People Are 3 Times More Likely to Experience Pulse Oximeter Errors,-4.0,46.67,https://heavy.com/news/black-people-pulse-oximeter-errors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,heavy,21,"GettyA pulse oximeter measures a person’s blood oxygen saturation level and heart rate.During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have purchased small devices calledpulse oximetersfor use in their home – based on well-intentioned recommendations from health care providers and the media. Pulse oximeters are devices, usually placed on a person’s finger, used to noninvasively measure oxygen levels in the blood. Clinics and hospitals, for example, use them regularly to screen newborns for heart defects after birth.Yet pulse oximeter measurements are imperfect, particularly for Black patients. Our recent paper demonstrated that Black patients werethree times more likelythan white patients to have low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximeters. That could translate into as many as 1 in 10 inaccurate readings among Blacks.We areICUphysiciansandinternistswith expertise in health care research and policy. Our findings were guided by our personal experiences engaging with communities of color during the pandemic and seeing firsthand how easy it is for racial bias to affect health care.Low blood oxygen levels are harmful to patients and can indicate that they are seriously ill. Clinicians frequently use pulse oximetry measurements to decide whether a patient should receive oxygen therapy and how much oxygen a patient should receive. Health care workers may also use this information when deciding what type of care a patient needs, such as admission to a hospital, transfer to an intensive care unit or need for a ventilator.Pulse oximeters came on the market in the late 1970s and seemed to meet the need for an accurate measure of oxygen levels.Pulse oximetersuse light that passes through the skin to measure oxygen levels. Blood with higher oxygen levels absorbs light differently than blood with lower oxygen levels. However, anything that slows the passage of this light, like nail polish or skin tone, can cause inaccuracies. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic we started to recognize that these measurements seemed to be inaccurate for Black patients. Our study confirmed those suspicions, for example finding that sometimes when a pulse oximeter read 94%, the actual blood level of oxygen was much lower.A normal oxygen saturation is above 92%. Oxygen therapy is typically started when oxygen levels are consistently below 89%. In our study, we identified patients who had normal oxygen levels by pulse oximetry (between 92% and 96%) but low oxygen levels by blood oxygen testing (less than 89%).If low oxygen levels in Black patients are missed because of inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, Black patients may be less likely to receive appropriate oxygen therapy or other medical care when they need it. Some people with COVID-19 infection were encouraged to purchase pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels at home as a tool to decide whether hospitalization was needed. These inexpensive home pulse oximetersmay be even less accuratethan the hospital pulse oximeters used in our study.The extent to which biased pulse oximetersmay have delayed appropriate treatmentfor Black patients is unknown. It is also unclear just how these inaccuracies might affect other medical conditions whereracial disparities in medical carehave been previously identified.Thefirst pulse oximeterwas developed in 1974. However, because early designers did not use a diverse group of test subjects, sources of error, like skin tone, were underrecognized. Today’s pulse oximeters might be better than the ones from the 1970s – the FDA requires all medical technology to be tested on a diverse population of patients, based on age, gender and skin tone. However, the agency defines skin tone diversity by havingat least two “darkly pigmented” individualsin the entire testing sample. Our study shows today’s pulse oximeters are still not good enough and that the agency’s guidelines for diverse testing remain insufficient.A study fromthe late 1980sbegan to show that pulse oximeters might be inaccurate based on skin tone, and aseriesofpublicationsin the 1990s seemed to confirm these findings. Yet 40 years later, these findings have not been widely publicized, were not thoroughly investigated with additional clinical studies and are not routinely a part of medical school curricula at this time.Pulse oximetry will remain an important tool for clinicians, and our findings highlight the need to consider pulse oximetry data in the context of other information related to the patient.However, there are no other straightforward and noninvasive ways to estimate oxygen levels. Feeling short of breathpoorly correlateswith oxygen levels; skin findings, such ascyanosis, may be more difficult to identify in individuals with darker skin tones; and using other locations of the body to measure oxygen levels noninvasively (like the ear) may not produce more accurate results than the finger.An alternative strategy might be to perform more invasive measurements of oxygen level, such as sampling arterial blood. However, arterial blood draws are painful andcan lead to complications. They are also inconvenient and require specialized training. Requiring arterial blood for accurate measurements in Black patients but not white patients simply propagates a different form of racial bias.Medical technology developers should increase the number and diversity of test subjects, with device performance compared across groups to ensure the equity of their accuracy. In addition, prior testing was conducted only among healthy subjects, and our study suggests inaccuracies may be more prominent as oxygen levels decrease. Diversity, in this case, should include a range of patients, based on age, gender, skin tone, and disability.Our recent conversations with device manufacturers suggest that engineering solutions may already be available. However, once new technologies are available, replacing legacy pulse oximeters with more accurate devices will be difficult, given the ubiquity of existing pulse oximeters and the expense associated with purchasing new devices. Health care providers and patient advocacy groups will need to demand updated technology when it becomes available. Recognizing this now may lead to improvements in medical technology, better medical care for Black patients, and greater recognition ofstructural racism within medicine.[Subscribe to The Conversation’s new science newsletter.]By Thomas Valley, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,;Michael Sjoding, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan Medical School, andSusan Dorr Goold, Professor of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy,University of Michigan Medical SchoolThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

384,Mississippi Explicitly Asks the Supreme Court to Overturn Roe v. Wade,-9.67,45.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/mississippi-15-week-abortion-ban-viability-supreme-court-roe-v-wade.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,slate,25,"The state of Mississippi made explicit Thursday its attempt to have the Supreme Court overturn,filing a briefthat calls on the court to uphold the state’s current abortion restrictions en route to upending the nearly 50-year-old law that ensures access to abortion procedures in the U.S. Mississippi’s Republican attorney general, Lynn Fitch, filed the brief that seeks to persuade the court to dust off the settled law and break with precedent to allow the state’s prohibition on abortion services after 15 weeks of a pregnancy to stand. The legal standard established underRoesays states must allow access for abortions performed up until fetal viability around 24 weeks.Mississippi passed the restrictiveabortion lawin 2018, along with a slew of anti-abortion provisions that have been blocked by the courts, including a law restricting abortions after six weeks. The Supreme Court announced in May that it would hear thecase, setting off alarm among abortion rights activists. The suit filed by the Jackson, Mississippi organization, the only abortion services provider in the state, contesting the 15-week law was successful in the lower courts, which cited precedent preventing states from restricting abortion access during the pre-viability stage. The Supreme Court, however, after months of hemming and hawing, announced that it would hear the state’s appeal of the case, raising the possibility it could choose to upend abortion pre-viability abortion restrictions that have been ruled unconstitutional as placing an undue burden on women seeking an abortion. In announcing its decision, the court stated explicitly it was out to reassess “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”The announcement signaled a tectonic shift in U.S. abortion law could be coming now that the court is lopsided with conservative justices. The Mississippi brief attempts to chip away at the viability standard, claiming advances in science and technology justify the state intervening earlier and earlier in a pregnancy. Even if the Supreme Court does not explicitly reverse, there are other ways it could defang the law. “As an alternative, Mississippi said the court could reduce the heightened scrutiny that abortion laws must meet and find that Mississippi’s law meets legitimate objectives such as protecting the unborn, women’s health or the medical profession,” the Washington Postnotes. “It could find that not all pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional, the state said, or that the 15-week restriction does not place an undue burden on a substantial number of women.”What is clear is that the stakes are high and, as the Post notes, Thursday’s “brief emphasizes the potential presented in the case,, the most direct challenge to abortion rights at the Supreme Court in decades.” The Supreme Court is likely to hear the case later this year, in November or December, and a decision would be handed down by June of nextyear.",2

386,The number of migrants arriving at the border was the largest in years.,-1.33,46.0,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/us-mexico-border-record.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,nytimes,25,"AdvertisementThe number of migrant children and teenagers arriving at the border increased slightly from May, but the influx has slowed since early spring, when a steep surge created President Biden’s first immigration crisis as president.ByEileen SullivanUnited States officials said Friday that the number of migrants arriving at the southwestern border last month was the largest in years, a sign that the surge this year may extend into the hotter summer months when numbers typically start dropping.According to new data released byCustoms and Border Protection, June also brought more migrant families to the border than any other month since President Biden took office. In all, border officials encountered migrants there 188,829 times, the largest number in a single month in recent history.The number of migrant children and teenagers arriving at the border increased slightly from May, but the influx has slowed since early spring, when a steep surge created Mr. Biden’s first immigration crisis as president. On average, about 500 migrant children and teenagers arrived alone at the border in June, compared with about 600 a day in March.The uptick in family arrivals in June still falls well short of the record set in May 2019, when 84,000 families came. But the growing overall numbers, andMr. Biden’s rejectionof President Donald J. Trump’s hard-line tactics toward undocumented immigrants, will soon force the administration to grapple with vexing policy and political questions that the public health rule, known as Title 42, has largely allowed it to avoid.As of Friday, nearly 15,000 children were in government shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to internal data obtained by The New York Times.The number of times that single adults tried to enter the country last month was down slightly; they were turned away under the public health rule 82 percent of the time.According to Customs and Border Protection, 34 percent of all the migrants encountered in June had tried at least one more time to enter the country in the past 12 months. The number of new migrants to arrive at the southern border since October is just slightly lower than the last surge in 2019 during the Trump administration, the agency said.Republicans have seized on the surge in migration to the southern border — driven in part by violence and poverty in Central America, as it has been for years — and have turned it into a political attack on Mr. Biden. The party is hoping the issue will galvanize voters in midterm elections next year, when it will have a chance to recapture control of the Senate and the House.Eileen Sullivanis a Washington correspondent covering the Department of Homeland Security.

387,223 People Have Died With COVID-19 After Getting Fully Vaccinated: CDC,9.67,35.67,https://www.theepochtimes.com/223-people-have-died-with-covid-19-after-getting-fully-vaccinated-cdc_3818232.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/epoch-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-17,theepochtimes,25,"Over 1,100 people in the United States have been hospitalized with COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated against the virus that causes it, and more than 220 have died, according to new figures from a top U.S. health agency.The number of hospitalizations among the fully vaccinated is up to 1,136, and the number of deaths among the same population is 223 as of May 10, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The numbers could also be undercounted because “national surveillance relies on passive and voluntary reporting, and data might not be complete or representative,” according to the CDC.Breakthrough metrics refer to cases, hospitalizations, or deaths among people who have seen two or more weeks elapse since receiving the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine—the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the second shot of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.Of the people who died after being fully vaccinated, 42 were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19, according to the CDC. Additionally, 342 of the hospitalizations were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.“Many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in, so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID. They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on May 16.Under the usual counting program, people who haven’t been vaccinated but who die of heart attacks or other causes while testing positive for the CCP virus are typically listed as a COVID-19 death.The death rate among the fully vaccinated is “extraordinarily low” when taking into consideration the death rate of COVID-19 itself, Walensky said.Some 115 million people had been fully vaccinated as of May 10.Clinical trials showed the Pfizer vaccine to have a 95 percent efficacy rate in preventing infection by the virus; the Moderna shot to have 94 percent; and the Johnson & Johnson shot to have 66.9 percent.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was studied later than the others.No other shots are currently authorized for use in the United States.The CDC last week dramatically altered previous masking guidance, saying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in many indoor settings.“We now have science that has really just evolved even in the last two weeks that demonstrates that these vaccines are safe, they are effective, they are working in the population, just as they did in the clinical trials, that they are working against our variants that we have here circulating in the United States, and that, if you were to develop an infection even if you got vaccinated, you can’t transmit that infection to other people,” Walensky said on ABC’s “This Week.”If people are vaccinated, “they’re safe,” she said.She also said health officials are trying to figure out how a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among the New York Yankees, who were mostly vaccinated.“I would consider that, when you look at the details that I’m aware of, seven of those eight were completely asymptomatic. The eighth was a mild case. They were detected on routine testing that generally doesn’t happen in many other populations. This is the vaccine working,” she said. “This means that you didn’t get infected—or you didn’t get a severe infection. You didn’t require hospitalization. You didn’t require death [sic], and most likely those people were not transmitting to other people.”“We’re just doing the best we can with it,” manager Aaron Boone said. “Fortunately, he’s another one that feels good. So we’ll just continue to try and be vigilant and handle it as best we can.”",1
388,Biden's capital gains tax plan would push US rate to one of highest in developed world,6.33,41.33,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bidens-capital-gains-tax-plan-highest-among-developed-countries,https://adfontesmedia.com/fox-business-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-26,foxbusiness,25,"Former acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney on what to expect from Biden’s proposed $6 trillion budget that Democrats claim will ‘reshape America.’Wealthy Americans could pay one of the highest taxes on capital gains and dividends in the world ifPresident Biden's sweeping tax and spending plan becomes law.Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate to 39.6% from 20% for millionaires; coupled with an existing Medicare surcharge, federal tax rates for the wealthy could climb as high as 43.4% – pushing the levy on returns to one of the highest in the developed world, according to a new analysis published by theTax Foundation.Ireland – with a 51% tax on dividends – would be the only developed nation to impose a higher tax on investment income. On average, nations in the 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development levy a marginal tax rate of 24.4% on dividend income.Unlike the U.S., many OECD nations differentiate how they tax dividends and capital gains.As far as capital gains tax rates, the U.S. would have the highest capital gains tax rate among OECD nations under Biden's proposal. Currently, Denmark has the highest rate of 42%, followed by Chile at 40% and Finland and France each at 34%.Roughly one-fourth of all OECD countries do not impose a capital gains tax on the sale of long-held shares, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey.The average capital gains tax rate among OECD members is about 19.1%, according to Tax Foundation data.Taxes on long-term capital gains – generally classified as an asset that's held for more than one year – currently range from 0% to 20% in the U.S., depending on a person's income. Wealthier investors are also subject to an additional 3.8% tax on long- and short-term capital gains that's used to fund ObamaCare. Short-term capital gains on assets sold within a year are typically taxed as ordinary income.The top long-term capital-gains tax rate is currently paid by single taxpayers earning more than $445,850 this year (and $501,600 for married couples filing a joint tax return).Capital gains are taxed favorably when compared to wage and salary income; under existing law, the richest Americans pay a top tax rate of 37% on ordinary income, while the top tax rate on capital gains is 23.8%.Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for rich Americans.But a recent analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, suggests that rich Americans would employ techniques to avoid the rate increase. Tax avoidance, most of it legal, would cut about $900 billion of the estimated $1 trillion that a capital gains tax increase could generate for the federal government over the next decade, the researchers said.""Even with stepped-up basis eliminated, several avenues for tax avoidance remain,"" the researchers wrote.For instance, they said, taxpayers would likely realize more gains in years when taxable incomes fall below the threshold. They also suggested that an increased share of business incomes would be organized via pass-through interests instead of C-corporations in order to avoid the second layer of shareholder tax.""A large body of empirical research shows that when taxes on capital gains increase, realizations of capital gains fall,"" the researchers wrote. ""Compared with other forms of income taxed under the individual income tax, capital gains are relatively responsive, or elastic, with respect to tax rates.""Get a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.We've added you to our mailing list.By clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox NewsPrivacy PolicyandTerms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

390,"Women Were the Primary Targets of Nearly 3,800 Reported Anti-Asian Hate Crimes in the Last Year",-4.67,45.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/aapi-anti-asian-hate-crime-report-statistics-48222291,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,popsugar,25,"On Tuesday, March 16 — just hours before the fatalAtlanta spa shootings that killed eight people in Georgia— the Stop AAPI Hate coalition releaseda report disclosing the statistics behind anti-Asian hate crimesin the United States since March 2020. According to the report, there have been nearly 3,800 documented cases of anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide over the last year, and a majority of the victims were women. This is only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur annually, with cases of xenophobia and bigotry mounting since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the numbers remain a formidable reflection of recent hate crimes.All but one of the eight victims of Tuesday's massage-parlor shootings were women, and six were Asian, which is a chilling statistic that has only served to ""exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" according toStop AAPI Hate. ""The reported shootings of multiple Asian American women today in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the Asian American community, which has been reeling from high levels of racist attacks over the course of the past year,"" the group said in a statement on March 17. ""Not enough has been done to protect Asian Americans from heightened levels of hate, discrimination and violence. Concrete action must be taken now. Anything else is unacceptable.""A closer look at the report reveals that verbal harassment and shunning make up the two largest portions of total incidents reported, collectively totaling at just over 80 percent. Physical assault comprises 11.1 percent of reported incidents, while civil-rights violations — including workplace discrimination, refusal of service, and so on — make up 8.5 percent, and online harassment follows closely behind at 6.8 percent. More than one-third (35.4 percent) of these instances of discrimination and harassment happen while a member of the Asian community is at a business, such as a store, salon, or workplace, while one-quarter of incidents take place in public streets or on the sidewalk.Across all 50 states, women are 2.3 times more likely than men to report these crimes. Chinese individuals are the largest ethnic group affected, constituting more than 42 percent of reported incidents. Together, people of Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipino descent make up an additional 31 percent of reported experiences of hate. Just days before the March 16 attacks, Georgia state SenatorMichelle Au gave a chilling accountdetailing the reality of hateful encounters APIA individuals have faced on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Georgia should not consider itself immune from this epidemic,"" Dr. Au said. ""And to be clear, the epidemic I'm referring to is not COVID-19, but racism towards Asian Americans. . . . The thing is, racism against AAPI Americans is not new. Otherization or exoticization of AAPI Americans is not new. Violence against AAPI Americans is not new.""While speaking with Stop AAPI Hate for the purposes of the statistical report, a student from College Park, MD, said, ""One of my professors was talking about the public health response to COVID-19 and explicitly called it the 'China Virus' and that 'we've gotta be very careful about that country and what they'd do to us.'"" Another added, ""Two white, middle-aged men, who have been my neighbors for over fifteen years, approached me threateningly on the street, pulled down the corners of their eyes and said, 'Go back to Wuhan, b*tch and take the virus with you!' When I called them vile, they then called me a 'Thai wh*re' and threatened to beat up my husband.""Six days after taking office,President Joe Biden released a memorandumaimed at combatting racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US. The memo reads: ""The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.

391,"What Is Felony Murder, And How Much Did The Capitol Rioter MAGA Assholes Commit It?",-20.33,34.83,https://www.wonkette.com/felony-murder,https://adfontesmedia.com/wonkette-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,wonkette,25,"Amidst all of the chaos, outrage, andexcellent memesin the wake of the MAGA riot, it can be easy to gloss over the gravity of what happened last week.Violent insurrectionists tried to stage a coup and five people died at the United States Capitol.More than 50people have been charged with crimes for their roles in last Wednesday's events — but, so far, no one has been charged in connection with any of the deaths.Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of injuries from ""physically engaging with protesters,"" according to the DC Metro Police Department. Both the MPD and FBI areinvestigatinghis death as a murder. Depending on what comes out in the investigation, one or more people could be charged with murder, manslaughter, or aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter. Four Trump supporters also died, including one who was shot by Capitol Police.Because of these deaths, there has been a lot of talk about the doctrine of felony murder, which allows prosecutors to charge people with murder even when they didn't actually play a part in anyone's death.Does the felony murder rule apply here? Let's take a look.I get it and I agree: There needs to be serious consequences for what that happened last week.But the thing is, felony murder is bullshit. It makes murderers out of people who are not actually killers.Felony murderlets prosecutors charge people with murder if someone dies, even by accident, if they were committing a dangerous felony at the time of the death. The underlying felony has to be dangerous enough that someone dying, even by accident, was foreseeable.A common application of felony murder is when a group of people plan a robbery and someone dies. Even if the death is accidental — or one of the perpetrators is killed by a cop. It doesn't matter what role you played in the underlying felony, or even if anyone was armed.Felony murder came from 12th century English common law and was eventually codified here in state and federal statutes. Twenty-seven states evenexecutepeople who found guilty of felony murder — andat least11 people have been executed for felony murder since 1985.It's notout of the realm of possibility that someone could be charged with felony murder for some of the deaths at the Capitol. But it won't be an easy case to make.Because the crimes were committed in DC, federal law applies. The federal felony murder rule, found at18 U.S. Code § 1111, says people can be charged with murder if they:committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated as part of a pattern or practice of assault or torture against a child or children; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree.Armed insurrection, riots, and terrorism are, for whatever reason, not on the list.That doesn't mean it would be impossible for anyone to be charged with felony murder, though.According toformer federal prosecutor Tim Heaphy,""You could look at the storming of the doors of the Capitol by that riotous mob as burglary. If they went in with the intent to steal, disrupt proceedings, to commit other offenses, they committed burglary. And, therefore, a murder that occurred during the course of a burglary could be potentially charged as felony murder.""And it appears the DOJ and DC US Attorney have not ruled out felony murder charges, with senior prosecutor Ken Kohlsaying,""Felony murder is always in play in something like this. Until we get all the facts and conduct the investigation, talk to witnesses, review any videos, we're not in a position to comment.""So it looks like we'll just have to wait and see to find out.It's easy to get outraged about what happened and understandable that so many people are demanding serious consequences. I'm pretty fucking pissed off, myself, that most of the charges so far have been for misdemeanors like unlawful entry to the Capitol. But, at the same time, we need to remember that changing the law to make it easier to charge people with felony murder would be a terrible thing — and very rarely used against people like the white, middle class MAGA assholes who stormed the Capitol.As long as Black kids are still being charged with felony murder for their friends gettingkilled by cops, I'm fine with also using it against racist terrorists. The law is on the books and actively being used, so sure, charge the motherfuckers. Whatever.But also, let's just get rid of felony murder entirely. We're not in medieval England anymore.[ACLU/DPIC/Reuters/USA Today/WTOP]Do your Amazon shopping through this link, because reasons.Want to just donate once?",1
392,Off-Duty Pilot Said to Save 737 on Its Next-to-Last Flight,0.0,50.35,http://time.com/5554684/boeing-737-lion-air-pilot-saved-flight/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,time,25,"As the Lion Air crew fought to control their diving Boeing Co. 737 Max 8, they got help from an unexpected source: an off-duty pilot who happened to be riding in the cockpit.That extra pilot, who was seated in the cockpit jumpseat, correctly diagnosed the problem and told the crew how to disable a malfunctioning flight-control system and save the plane, according to two people familiar with Indonesia’s investigation.The next day, under command of a different crew facing what investigators said was an identical malfunction, the jetliner crashed into the Java Sea killing all 189 aboard.The previously undisclosed detail on the earlier Lion Air flight represents a new clue in the mystery of how some 737 Max pilots faced with the malfunction have been able to avert disaster while the others lost control of their planes and crashed. The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn’t contained in Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s Nov. 28 report on the crash and hasn’t previously been reported.The so-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize.“All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have been submitted to the Indonesian NTSC. We can’t provide additional comment at this stage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,” Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro said by phone.The Indonesia safety committee report said the plane had had multiple failures on previous flights and hadn’t been properly repaired.Representatives for Boeing and the Indonesian safety committee declined to comment on the earlier flight.The safety system, designed to keep planes from climbing too steeply and stalling, has come under scrutiny by investigators of the crash as well as a subsequent one less than five months later in Ethiopia. A malfunctioning sensor is believed to have tricked the Lion Air plane’s computers into thinking it needed to automatically bring the nose down to avoid a stall.Boeing’s 737 Max was grounded March 13 by U.S. regulators after similarities to the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash emerged in the investigation of the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In the wake of the two accidents, questions have emerged about how Boeing’s design of the new 737 model were approved. The Transportation Department’s inspector general is conducting a review of how the plane was certified to fly and a grand jury under the U.S. Justice Department is also seeking records in a possible criminal probe of the plane’s certification.The FAA last week said it planned to mandate changes in the system to make it less likely to activate when there is no emergency. The agency and Boeing said they are also going to require additional training and references to it in flight manuals.“We will fully cooperate in the review in the Department of Transportation’s audit,” Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers said in an email. The company has declined to comment on the criminal probe.After the Lion Air crash, two U.S. pilots’ unions said the potential risks of the system, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, hadn’t been sufficiently spelled out in their manuals or training. None of the documentation for the Max aircraft included an explanation, the union leaders said.“We don’t like that we weren’t notified,’’ Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in November. “It makes us question, ‘Is that everything, guys?’ I would hope there are no more surprises out there.’’The Allied Pilots Association union at American Airlines Group Inc. also said details about the system weren’t included in the documentation about the plane.Following the Lion Air crash, the FAA required Boeing to notify airlines about the system and Boeing sent a bulletin to all customers flying the Max reminding them how to disable it in an emergency.Authorities have released few details about Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 other than it flew a “very similar” track as the Lion Air planes and then dove sharply into the ground. There have been no reports of maintenance issues with the Ethiopian Airlines plane before its crash.If the same issue is also found to have helped bring down Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, one of the most vexing questions crash investigators and aviation safety consultants are asking is why the pilots on that flight didn’t perform the checklist that disables the system.“After this horrific Lion Air accident, you’d think that everyone flying this airplane would know that’s how you turn this off,” said Steve Wallace, the former director of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s accident investigation branch.The combination of factors required to bring down a plane in these circumstances suggests other issues may also have occurred in the Ethiopia crash, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, who also directed accident investigations at FAA and is now a consultant.“It’s simply implausible that this MCAS deficiency by itself can down a modern jetliner with a trained crew,” Guzzetti said.MCAS is driven by a single sensor near the nose that measures the so-called angle of attack, or whether air is flowing parallel to the length of the fuselage or at an angle. On the Lion Air flights, the angle-of-attack sensor had failed and was sending erroneous readings indicating the plane’s nose was pointed dangerously upward.Contact us atletters@time.com",2
393,"The Morning Briefing: Change All the Names, Nuke All the Statues—Grievance Wusses Will Still Be Whining",26.03,20.42,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stephen-kruiser/2020/07/14/the-morning-briefing-change-all-the-names-nuke-all-the-statues-grievance-wusses-will-still-be-whining-n637246,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-14,pjmedia,25,"No doubt I will catch some grief for this one but that is kind of my role around here, is it not?The grievance mob is picking up steam, using the Year of the Riot to claim more cultural victims. We’ll get into the philosophical discussion about all of this in a moment but, on a personal note, I find it rather exhausting just attempting to keep up with whom or whatever they are mad at during any given moment. At this point, I’m not even certain there are any statues left in America.What we’ve witnessed in recent weeks is truly a descent into madness. Criminals are taking over cities with the backing of the elected officials who run those cities. Those same officials are proudly abandoning their police forces to score points with a bunch of Marxists, then predictably seeing violent crime skyrocket overnight. We are supposed to believe that this is all being done in the name of delivering some long-overdue justice.It’s all bunk.The always-eloquent Thomas Sowell put it very well ina recent conversation with Mark Levin:Right off the bat, Levin asked Sowell about theriotingthat has gone on nightly in America since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “I’m regarded as pessimistic,” Sowell said, “but I was never pessimistic enough to believe that things would degenerate to the point where they are now, where adult human beings are talking about getting rid of the police … what is frightening is how many people in responsible positions are caving in to every demand that is made, repeating any kind of nonsense that you’re supposed to repeat. I do believe that we may well reach a point of no return. I hope, of course, that will never happen.”Count me among the pessimists.We’re not focusing on riots today but this is all tied together.It’s only Tuesday and the grievance-mongers have been busy. They pulled off the seemingly impossible,making Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder back downafter years of saying that he wouldn’t change the team’s name. Barely pausing to take a breath, the grievance mob thendecided to go after the Texas Rangers.That’s a rather ambitious Monday.But wait, there’s more!ran a post yesterday titled “Don’t Stop at Statues. Demand a Reconsideration of Place Names Too.”This grievance slope isn’t just slippery, they’ve now got a free army of people to keep covering it with Vaseline. We’ll be sliding down it forever at this rate.I don’t care if people have hurt feelings. Everybody has hurt feelings at one time or another. The thing is, the lunatics that are becoming a bigger blight on America every day always have hurt feelings. They wake up aggrieved, and the day just becomes one long list of grievances that is updated hourly. Though it may seem impossible, there is an inexhaustible supply of grievances to keep them raging.Back in the Occupy days, I kept saying and writing that the rage was the endgame for them. It’s basically the same now. They keep saying they want change, and I don’t doubt that they would like to affect some political change here and there, but that won’t make them any less angry. There is nothing that will make them less angry simply because angry is what they want to be.The grievance freaks will always find another grievance. They’re addicted to it. What’s disturbing about the last couple of months is the pace at which they’re finding new ones. As we have seen with the destruction of the statues, they are alsonot very discriminateabout focusing their wrath.It’s very aggravating that there are so many Republicans in Washington who don’t understand this. We’re fighting for the soul of America and we’ve got Republicans in Congress going on about statues as if they’re trying to get dates with antifa. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Mitt Romney at the next statue-toppling. He and his ilk are forever convinced that, if they just give the grievance crowd one more concession, everything will be roses and puppies.There is no telling how long we’re going to be subjected to this nonsense that’s largely being fueled by woke white people at theandNew York Times, but it will no doubt be a while. We may truly have reached a point of no return.

394,Supply chain issues: What are they and how will shortages impact the holiday shopping season?,-1.33,47.0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/10/15/supply-chain-shortages-issues-impact-holiday-shopping/8450237002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-15,usatoday,22,"Food prices are going up,gas prices are climbing, andfinding that great giftfor the holidays might get tougher.The reason? Struggles linked to our global supply chain.Last week, President Joe Biden revealedplans to help tackle bottlenecks within our supply chain, including plans to turn ports into 24/7 operations. Meanwhile, shipping companies FedEx and UPS as well as retailing giant Walmart will expand their efforts to ease the strains on the supply chain.“This is the first key step for moving on entire freight transportation and logistical supply chain nationwide to a 24/7 system,” said Biden.So, what is the supply chain, and why should you care about these issues? Let's explain:The supply chain is how we get nearly all of the stuff in our lives that we want and need. It's a system that helps makeand deliver our favorite products. It involves the manufacturersof these products, the companies that supply materials to create them, the cargo ships, trains and trucks that deliver them, and the stores selling them.“You can think of this as a pipe that connects supply and demand,"" said Tinglong Dai, a professor of operations management and business analytics at Johns Hopkins University.It's also complicated. Take the iPhone, for example. To build one, Apple has supply chains with companies providing materials for its smartphonesuch as Corning, which makes precision glass for use on the iPhone. Then you have the supply chains Apple uses to distribute iPhones to you.""It’s a complex network of various different entities that are working together in order to enable us as consumers to receive our products in the time that we expect,"" said  Marko Bastl, the director of the Center for Supply Chain Management at Marquette University.These products may be hard to find due to supply chain issuesWhy are they higher?3 tips to save on your groceriesThe issues affecting supply chains are linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bastl said the pandemic is unique because it has impacted both supply and demand.Some manufacturers still aren't operating at the levels they reached before the pandemic.The pandemic also affected companies focused on logistics, such as warehousing to store items that travel overseas and transportation like trucks and trains to deliver them across the country, said Bastl.At the same time, due to millions of us staying at home to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, we ordered a lot of stuff, from personal computers to sports equipment.""It’s almost like a perfect storm of loss of manufacturing capacity as well as loss of logistics capacity, married then with the increase in demand,"" said Bastl.One of the enduring images of this crisis has been several container ships sitting idle at ports waiting to unload their goods.Biden has struck a deal with the Port of Los Angeles to turn it into a 24/7 operation to move ships through more quickly.Dai said the process of unloading these ships requires a lot of work and people, including warehouse workers and drivers to ultimately deliver these products to retailers.“We have increased the number of goods coming here to the U.S., but we do not have more truck drivers, we do not have more warehouse space,"" said Dai. ""So then that’s where those cargo ships are stuck.""Bastl said it depends on the industry because of the different supply chains they use, but he notes consumer electronics, such as personal computers and video game consoles, as well as toys, have been affected most by supply chain issues.Dai said ""low-end inexpensive products"" across industries will be impacted as well, forcing us to buy a more expensive item to compensate.All of these issues have a direct impact on what we can buy – on what's available to buy. That's the reason consumers have beenadvised to start their holiday shopping early. Dai projects we'll see higher prices and fewer available products. And we may see more empty shelves at stores due to shortages and delays, Bastl said.""The longer that these delays will last, the more likely it is companies involved in production, distribution and movement of our products will not be able or willing to absorb this cost, and they’ll start pushing them on to consumers,"" Bastl said.",2
395,Bill to Subsidize Sustainable Agriculture Is a “Prime Contender” for Reconciliation Package,-3.33,42.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/21/agriculture-carbon-credit-markets-reconciliation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,theintercept,25,"A bipartisan measureto boost carbon credit markets is a “prime contender” to be in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., told The Intercept. But its inclusion in the simple-majority process would put Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other critics in the awkward position of supporting a bill they already voted against.The Growing Climate Solutions Act, or S. 1251, aims to help farmers and foresters more easily participate in carbon credit markets. It would establish a program at the Department of Agriculture to certify technical experts who can assist landowners implementing carbon capture, emission-reduction measures, and other sustainability methods by planting fast-growing crops such as hemp. Championed by Whitehouse and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., the Growing Climate Solutions Act has received the endorsement of the American Farm Bureau Federation and Environmental Defense Fund and passed the Senate in a 92-8 vote just last month.Sanders, along with Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., voted against the bill. Broadly speaking, opponents argued that the measure was at best a distraction from the necessary work of reducing emissions and at worst could prolong the strength of the fossil fuel industry. “I don’t believe that an offset system that subsidizes corporations’ continued pollution in front-line communities is the best strategy,” Merkley said at the time of the vote. “Let’s set incentives that reduce pollution in both agriculture and front-line neighborhoods.”Advocates of the bill argue that time has run out, and Democrats can’t afford to leave any tool that could reduce carbon concentration on the sidelines. Carbon concentration has reached 418 parts per million, well over the 350 ppm that scientists say is a threshold the planet needs to remain under.Whether portions of S. 1251 and other climate crisis bills are eligible to pass with just 51 votes, including the vice president, is ultimately up to the Senate, but both parties have outsourced their responsibility over the years to a parliamentarian, who is hired to give advisory opinions on whether legislation complies with the rules of reconciliation. Those opinions, however, have been taken by Senate Democrats as final rulings, empowering Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to have control over what makes it into the party’s bill. The reconciliation process’s restrictions, coupled with the pressure of maintaining every Democrat’s support, may leave Sanders and other S. 1251 critics no choice but to end up supporting the measure when they vote in the $3.5 trillion package’s favor.Meanwhile, the Growing Climate Solutions Act is not the only proposal to tackle the climate crisis that lawmakers seek to pass in the reconciliation bill. With trillions at their disposal, Democrats may not be in an either-or situation. “I’m hoping that reconciliation produces much stronger climate measures,” Whitehouse said, without providing specifics. S. 1251 “would be a part of it.”Anthony Pahnke, vice president of Family Farm Defenders, said there are other agriculture bills lawmakers have introduced that could be more effective to defend the environment. His organization was one of more than 200 farming, environmental, and animal rights groups that signed a letter to Congress in October urging members to oppose the Growing Climate Solutions Act, arguing that carbon markets fail to reduce emissions overall and worsen conditions in low-income communities located near industrial polluters.Pahnke pointed to bills like Booker’s Farm System Reform Act, which would crack down on concentrated animal feeding operations, or New York Democrat Sen.

Are you a nanny with experience as a camp counselor willing to oversee scavenger hunts and an obstacle course for a family’s private summer camp? Then thisBeverly Hills positionis perfect for you.The rich have always sought to create private worlds of their own, cordoned off from the rest of the country and insulated from the violence their resource hoarding inflicts on others. What the coronavirus has provided is a common denominator, a single ongoing event that has exacerbated every existing form of inequality and inspired among the elites a certain kind of brashness about getting what they believe is theirs to take: jumping to the front of the line to get tested, hiringconcierge doctors, and organizing private drive-through testing sites. And now, a life uninterrupted by a pandemic while others struggle to secure the basics for themselves and their families.Across the country, public school systems are trying to develop best practices for another semester of remote learning that will service thetens of millionsof parents and kids who depend on these institutions beyond their educational services. This summer, teachers at public andprivate schoolsalike have organized against their administrations to ensure their school systems are doing everything possible to protect their students, their communities, and them. And they’ve done this while grappling with the fact thatanother remote semesterwill only further set back the students already disproportionately underserved by the education system; in New York City, arecent reviewby the city’s Independent Budget Office found that the Grab & Go program designed to help feed children at risk of going hungry only distributed a quarter of the meals it usually provided children during in-person schooling.As many schools have opted to pursue remote learning to start the fall, parents with the means to do so have begunshelling outfor private “pod” teachers. A “microschool community” in San Francisco is footing the bill for registered nurses to conduct weekly Covid-19 tests for their hired teachers. Another group, also in the Bay Area, is looking for a Spanish-fluent teacher to keep up with their kindergartners’ language immersion program. In New York City, two parents are looking for a live-in “teacher nanny” to work 40 to 45 hours a week at their house in the suburbs. “You don’t go home until Covid is better contained,” the job listing reads. “You have separate living quarters and you can leave the property whenever you like but on foot.” The pay for this year-round service starts at $70,000 but no worries: “You are welcome to give up your apartment and stay with them for the year and save money.”These are jobs in a country where millions of people need them—the arrangements might even be an improvement for some teachers—but the dynamic is still a broken one. As of June, the unemployment rate in 20 states wasabove ten percentwhile the virus continues to hospitalize and killa rising numberof people in this country. Meanwhile, the main debate being had on Capitol Hill this summer concerned whether the government was distributing too much money to working and middle-class people suddenly out of a job—all while Congress breezily passeda $740 billion defense billand left for a nice paid summer break.With the Paycheck Protection Program funds for small businesses from the spring beginning to dry up and the$600 unemployment stimulusexpired, thousands of locally owned restaurants now have tochoose betweenclosing up shop temporarily or going out of business—and putting their employees out of work—for good. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, a chief executive officer is offering a job for a personal chef at “one of his personal homes.” Bonus points if the candidate has “the ability and desire to organize, clean, and manage the dwelling.” Other, more health-conscious rich families have made compromises—like having their personal chefs cook inthe pool house.These jobs servicing the elite are not random; they are the product of a system that has clearly been designed for one group and not the other. Doing its part to add to the misery, the best–or rather, most telling–plan the White House has been able to foist came in the form of the Ivanka Trump-led “Find Something New” campaignthat debuted last month—a public initiative that tried to rebrand the widespread joblessness crisis as an opportunity to switch career paths. I am set to be an ecologist; others, likemy editor, are destined to be interplanetary doctors (presumably for a wealthy family of four living in the Mars version of the Hamptons.)In this void created by federal inaction, the wealthy have chosen to help themselves. The demand for private jets was so high in April that operators wererunning out of planes. (It helped that Congress carved outmultiple tax breaksfor private jet companies, dropping both the federal excise tax and fuel tax.) For families looking to stay closer to home, many hauled their nannies to their summer homes, threateningto fire themif the at-risk workers refused to incubate themselves. Martha Stewart now lives full-time with her gardener, driver, and housekeeper—her “three detainees,” she called them—at her Westchester home. When some families went to hire replacement workers, they added stipulations includingCovid-19 antibodies.The sprawling systemic effects of this clear split in financial ability is not lost on everyone. Speaking withThe Colorado Sunabout the innately exclusive pod approach to education, Melissa Rich, a parent considering putting her child in one of these private settings for the school year, acknowledged, “This idea can replicate the white flight that we saw in the 1950s.” Katie Farnan, a Boulder parent committed to her childrens’ public school, laid out the ramifications more clearly: “I want my kid to come back to a school that has the funding needed for the community it serves,” she said. “And there’s a good chunk of community that will have never left that school but will come back to a school that may have fewer resources because families have divested.”As my colleague Jo Livingstonewroteon the phenomenon of microschools, “The problem is everywhere, not just in one Bay Area backyard.” The question now is “What do we do with all this information?” We knew well before the pandemic how imbalanced and cruel America was for most workersbecausethe wealthywanted it that way. The calls for the private chef, the microschool teacher, and the contracted nurse are not individual affairs. They are another attempt to permanently distance the select few from the rest of society while they continue tosiphon the nation’s wealth. You have to blow up the model this inevitably calcifies into. There will be no shortage of crises in our future—another pandemic or a climate emergency—and these private, parallel economies will only grow.Without the redistributive policies necessary to prevent it,our future will look more and more like the nation under pandemic: A society with an ocean-sized gulf between us and them, with one side slowly drowning and the other remarking that the water feels just fine.",1

Yes. But what else do you expect from the woman who has made herself apopular fixtureon cable news with herwillingness to jettison professional ethics and declare the president mentally unstable?Former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is in the hospital. He threatened to harm himself this weekend at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,according to law enforcement officials.“Brad Parscale is a member of our family, and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.Self-harm is serious. Suicide is serious.Someone should tell that to Lee.“Here is another side effect of continuing with a mentally impaired leader,”the Yale University psychiatry professor said in reaction to the Parscale news. “It will attract mental impairment, augment mental illness (in both supporters and opponents), and cause disorder to reverberate through society.”Later, after social media users alerted Lee to the obscenity of her attack, she added, “The messages I receive from Trump supporters give a good measure. They went from normal: ‘How could you do this to our president?’ To more disturbed: ‘Dems are diabolical demons, and wretched, vile, inhumane Communists like you made a deal with the Devil’ (my last message).”Ah, yes. So, those angry at her manipulative use of Parscale’s reported breakdown are the real issue.Lee’s behavior should not shock you. She proved long ago that she is unethical and callous when it comes to her area of expertise.Democrats summoned Lee to Capitol Hill in 2018 when they needed a medical professional to condemn Trump’s mental health. “[Trump’s] going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs,”she told lawmakers at the time. Lee also signed a statement in 2018 urging members of Congress to “take urgent steps to restrain [Trump’s] behavior and head off the potential nuclear catastrophe” with North Korea. She continues to host events where she and her friends use their medical credentials to declare the president a loony tune.“The president’s condition has been visibly deteriorating to the point where there’s a lot of talk right now about his mental state beyond mental health professionals,”she said in 2019. “It no longer takes a mental health professional to recognize the seriousness of the current presidency.”Lee has never once conducted an in-person evaluation of Trump. The long-standing, prudentGoldwater rule means nothing to her. But what else do you expect from the media’s favorite “resistance” mental health professional? Lee is popular on the cable news circuit precisely because she is happy to violate professional ethics in service of “resistance.”Thatshe has a book to sellon the matter should not go unnoticed either.",1

The correct figure, as disclosed by Lockheed in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 120 jets.WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin delivered 120 F-35s to the U.S. military and international customers in 2020,missing its initial 141-aircraft goalfor the year, the company announced.The COVID-19 pandemic proved itself to be a formidable challenge to Lockheed’s main F-35 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as its network of suppliers across the globe. As early as April, Lockheed executives sounded the alarm about potential supply chain disruptions that threatened to slow down F-35 production.In May, the company announced it would be18 to 24 jets shortof the 141 F-35s scheduled for delivery in 2020. By fall, officials stated they expected Lockheed to deliver a total of 121 aircraft.“The F-35 joint enterprise team rapidly responded to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to deliver the unmatched combat capability the F-35 brings to the warfighter,” said Bill Brotherton, the company’s acting vice president for the F-35 program. “Achieving this milestone amid a global pandemic is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team and their commitment to our customers’ missions.”The 120th aircraft — an F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant — was built at the final assembly and checkout facility inCameri, Italyand delivered to the Italian air force last week.Over the past year, Lockheed delivered 74 F-35s to the U.S. military, 31 jets to international partner nations that helped pay into the program’s development costs, and 18 aircraft to foreign military sales customers.However, the company needed to take steps to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its production lines and suppliers, such as accelerating payments to small businesses that build components for the aircraft and grappling with COVID-19 breakouts that have sometimes led to the quarantine of a portion of its supply chain.In May, the F-35 production line in Fort Worth moved to a three-month adjusted work schedule, slowing the pace of production because its suppliers weren’t getting components to the line on time. During that stretch, production decreased to about eight to 10 jets per month, Darren Sekiguchi, Lockheed’s vice president of F-35 production, said inan October interview.Instead of surging to meet the 141-jet target — which would have increased production costs and created the risk of future delivery delays — Sekiguchi said that Lockheed would more incrementally ramp production back up to 14 jets per month. It will take until 2023 for the company to catch up to its original production schedule.Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

399,Serbia’s Protests Aren’t the Beginning of a Balkan Spring,4.25,35.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/serbias-protests-arent-the-beginning-of-a-balkan-spring-vucic-stefanovic-protests-belgrade/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,foreignpolicy,25,"BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic.BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic.The protests, which started on Dec. 8 last year, have spread to several dozen cities across Serbia and have even inspired similar protests in Albania and Montenegro, where activists have risen up against their own crooked political classes.Last Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgrade stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police.That same night in Albania, protesters lobbed stones and clashed with police in front of the parliament building in Tirana. This blossoming of dissent has led some to wonder if this might be the beginning of a “Balkan Spring.”In Serbia, the protests were triggered by the beating of Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician and leader of the Serbian Left party, in the southern city of Krusevac on November 23, 2018, where he was left bloodied and hospitalized after being assaulted by a group of assailants wielding blunt objects. The following day, one of Stefanovic’s allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was “the main culprit” behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of “Stop the Bloody Shirts” and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left and spans the entire breadth of the country’s political spectrum.The inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group ofstudentsfrom the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been the spark that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, “even if there were 5 million people in the streets.” This was quickly adopted as their slogan: “One in 5 Million”.Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011.Vucic has, lest we forget, seen out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to the street on an almost daily basis to protest “against the dictatorship,” as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largelyfizzledout.The protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes thana spoof candidatewho promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked a serious strategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out of steam.Today’s protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors by setting out several concrete demands: They’ve called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children’s health at risk), as well astwo senior figuresat Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in the side of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it’s still unclear how they plan to extract these concessions.The protesters’ main problem is that they’re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic’s stranglehold on national politics.Although the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations aren’t formally affiliated with any single opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideological spectrum is represented—from student Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives—sometimes causing scuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else.The anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homophobe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote—four times less than the spoof candidate, Ljubisa “Beli” Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli).Dveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade’s former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic’s breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. He served as chief negotiator in the 2008 sale of state petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia’s Gazprom Neft.The deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a final sale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS’s market value at the time. Many see it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations that followed Yugoslavia’s disintegration—and Vucic’s government launched an investigation into the sale in 2014. It’s deeply ironic and profoundly cynical that someone involved in the hawking of state assets now leads a party that bills itself as “Left.” Borko Stefanovic and his sometime Democratic Party colleagues need to shoulder some of the blame for the country’s current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic’s party.This considered, it should come as little surprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with a shrug: “Who else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.”This cuts to the heart of Serbia’s political malaise:It’s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace.In contrast to their opponents, they still have political capital to spend. Until this changes, protesters will struggle to rally the sort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000.At the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a “30-point”political program, but two-thirds of these points are just single-line slogans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country’s politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to the status quo. Their main selling point is that they’re not Vucic.No candidate can realistically offer substantially better living standards because Serbia’s problems—an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, a stagnant and left-behind economy that’s ill-equipped for the 21st century—predate the current government. Serbia’s neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all face similar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition’s draw.The president’s domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country’s political system. Serbian politicians frequently switch parties. There have been more than500 defectionssince the 2016 local elections, and some 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic’s Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as kingmakers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity.Ivica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist party since the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname “Little Sloba.” Before taking up his current position, he served as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures with similar resumes. This creates a malign sort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it, such that nothing ever seems to change.Even if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint.This is why any talk of a Balkan Spring should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is no panacea that will end the country’s malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia’s institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the first step toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protesters should bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia’s long post-Yugoslav freeze.AleksEroris a journalist and political consultant from Belgrade.

He also announced support for a cease-fire and an effort to restart long-stalled peace talks.“This war has to end,” Biden said. “And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.”The move signaled a dramatic shift in U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, a move that has long been urged by progressive activists. Under President Donald Trump, Congresspassedresolutions blocking certain arms sales and directing the U.S. to end its role in the hostilities, but Trumpvetoedthem.One of the primary backers of the vetoed resolutions, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told The Intercept by phone that Biden’s announcement was a victory. “This is now a decisive step and really what the war powers resolution was calling for, so I’m very pleased,” Khanna said.Asked if Congress’s job was done, Khanna said he thought the legislature still had a role to play in supporting diplomatic efforts and reversing last-minutepolicy changesby the Trump administration.The Biden administration had previously placed a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as saying that it would review the transfer of advanced military hardware, including air-ground munitions, that the Trump administration sought to advance over the objections of Congress.Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their intervention in Yemen in March 2015, after an Iranian-backed rebel group known as the Houthis took over the capital and forced out Yemen’s internationally backed president. The U.S. has supported the intervention, first under President Barack Obama and then under Trump, with weapons sales, intelligence, and logistical support, even after Saudi airstrikes increasingly targeted civilian sites like hospitals and schools.The Biden administration has not yet announced operational details of the move or clarified what they meant by “offensive operations.” In his address, Biden said that the U.S. would continue to help defend Saudi Arabia from drone and missile attacks, some of which have come from Yemen and have led the Saudis to claim that they are pursuing the war in self-defense.An administration official declined to share operational details of what the cutoff meant but pointed to the fact that the Biden administration had previously announced they were “reviewing several arms sales to ensure they are in line with our strategic goals, including ending the war.”Briefing reporters on Thursday morning, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the prohibition would extend “to the types of offensive operations that have perpetuated a civil war in Yemen that has led to a humanitarian crisis,” but would not result in the U.S. halting its own operations against Al Qaeda in the country.Kate Kizer — policy director with the progressive group Win Without War, which has lobbied to end U.S. support for the intervention — told The Intercept by phone that understanding the details of the distinction are important because the Saudis have frequently claimed that they were acting defensively.“The coalition has tried repeatedly in the past to say that airstrikes in residential areas in Yemen have been ‘defensive’ operations because they were responding to a ballistic missile strike,” Kizer said. “So it’s really important to define what that means.”Biden’s call is a hard won-victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, much of which had urged Obama and Trump to end U.S. support for the war. Khanna, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had repeatedly introduced various measures to stop U.S. support for the war, all of which initially failed in Congress.Khanna told The Intercept that a turning point on Capitol Hill was the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Saudi dissident who was brutally killed by Saudi agents, likelyon the ordersof Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — who is also a key architect behind the Yemen war.“When we started, there was such a strong U.S. relationship with the Saudis that it was very hard to break through,” Khanna said. “And it took a lot of work in the House; we were taking on our own leadership in the beginning. But then after Khashoggi’s murder,things changed.”Kizer told The Intercept that building support for ending the war has been a long process among progressive activists, and that it was important to move the discussion beyond a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “I think what really has been the gamechanger over the years is building a public education campaign that really changed the terms of the debate about what’s happening in Yemen,” Kizer said. “When we started in 2015, it was totally framed through the lens of Iran, and the détente with Saudi Arabia and the Iran nuclear deal. Very little was said about Yemen.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe U.S. risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, experts say.Schuyler MitchellProposed laws to curtail the use of PVC plastics have failed amid heavy lobbying.Prem ThakkerA new report shows Norfolk Southern spent $2.3 million to lobby the government in 2023.",2
402,"TikTok banned: 6 ways the app is countering US scrutiny, Trump's ban threat",-5.0,43.67,https://fortune.com/2020/07/22/tiktok-us-ban-counter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,fortune,25,"The Trump administration is considering banning TikTok, the wildly popular short video platform, over national security concerns and TikTok’s alleged vulnerability to Chinese government censorship and data sharing.TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech firm ByteDance Ltd. and has 30 million monthly active users in the U.S., has denied U.S. claims about its susceptibility to Chinese government influence. But President Donald Trump’s targeting of the app has only increased since he mentioned a potential ban earlier this month; new Trump campaignads on Facebookthis week claimed, “TikTok is spying on you.”TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.Growing political scrutiny of TikTok in 2019 had already prompted the app to increase transparency, distance itself from ByteDance, and deny claims that it shares user data with Beijing or complies with its censorship requests. Scrutiny of the app has only accelerated in recent weeks with India’s TikTok ban in late June and the U.S.’s subsequent threat of a ban.TikTok no doubt has become aflashpointfor the West’s disputes with China. In response, the app has taken six actions that seem aimed at underscoring its commitment to the U.S. and proving its operational independence from its Chinese parent—and from China’s government:At the start of 2020, TikTok had 500 full-time staff in the U.S.; that number has since increased to 1,400. On Tuesday, TikToksaidit plans to hire 10,000 employees for “good-paying jobs” in the U.S. over the next three years, a long-term commitment to the market that could foster good will in Washington. TikTok hasofficesin New York City, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles.A sharp increase in staff isn’t the only way TikTok is expanding its U.S. presence. The company has hired more than35 lobbyiststo advocate on its behalf in Washington to persuade lawmakers that it’s committed to U.S. regulations and not beholden to the Chinese government. TikTok had no lobbying presence in Washington a year ago,accordingto theTikTok has made other signals of commitment to the U.S. market. In March, the companysaidit was setting up a “transparency center” in its Los Angeles office to “provide outside experts an opportunity to directly view how our teams at TikTok go about the day-to-day challenging, but critically important, work of moderating content on the platform.”Even before the threat of a U.S. ban, the company came under fire for allegedly censoring content deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese government, a charge TikTok denies.TikTok blockedand then unblockedone U.S. user who posted a video criticizing China’s government for its treatment of Uighur ethnic minority people. The company said a “human moderation error” caused the removal of the video.TikTok has made moves to localize its U.S. business and show the international market that it’s separate from its China-based parent company.In May it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who is American, to run TikTok. (Mayer holds dual roles as TikTok’s CEO and ByteDance’s chief operating officer.) TikTok has pointed to Mayer’s U.S. roots when asked about the Chinese government data-sharing allegations.“TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy in the U.S.,” a company spokespersontoldCNBC in July.TikTok also taken cues from U.S.-based Internet giants in responding to political issues related to Beijing. After the Chinese government enacted a controversial national security law in Hong Kong,Google,Facebook,Twitter, andothers announced they were halting some operations in the regionwhile they reviewed the law, which grants Hong Kong authorities far-reaching power over Internet data.TikTok went further,announcingon July 6 that “in light of recent events,” it was withdrawing from Hong Kong entirely. The company didn’t directly name the national security law, butanalysts saythe decision to pull out of Hong Kong was a direct response to the law and an effort by TikTok to illustrate its distance from Beijing and willingness to take issue with Chinese government data controls.Some U.S.-based ByteDance investors are in talks with ByteDance management to buy a majority stake in TikTok, The Informationreportedon Tuesday.Such a sale would make TikTok majority-owned by U.S. shareholders rather than by Beijing-based ByteDance, and potentially could convince U.S. lawmakers that a ban of TikTok isn’t necessary.Larry Kudlow, a White House economic adviser,said last weekthat a TikTok spinoff from ByteDance would be better than a ban on the popular app.“I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company, which is China-run, and operate as an independent American company,” Kudlowsaid,declining to comment on whether U.S. companies could acquire TikTok.Even before the Trump administration publicly leveled the threat of the TikTok ban, the app was looking beyond the U.S. market and its tens of millions of American users.In November, when U.S. lawmakers escalated their scrutiny of TikTok, ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yimingsaidin an internal staff note that the company needed to “diversify TikTok’s growth,” “increase investment in weaker markets,” and improve its skill in “handling global public affairs,” without specifically mentioning U.S. pressure.The number of countries where TikTok is facing pressure has grown this year. Outside of the U.S., TikTok was banned in India last month, and some politicians have called for bans in Australia and the U.K.TikTok has been mulling a global HQoutside of Chinasince late last year to distance itself from its Chinese owner, and it’s reportedly stillconsideringLondon—its existing hub in Europe—as a base. The ongoing U.K.-China feud, which saw the U.K. recently ban Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G rollout, had cast doubt on whether TikTok would continue its U.K. expansion plans.“It’s very clear that ByteDance [is] trying to do as much as [it] can to make TikTok a separate company that operates globally, thinks globally, and does not think and act like a Chinese company,” Dev Lewis, a fellow at Hong Kong–based research think tank Digital Asia Hub, toldearlier this month. Whether its efforts succeed remains to be seen since, as Lewis said, “TikTok will always be caught in the middle” of China’s geopolitical disputes.",1

404,Democrats are furious Trump’s DOJ got lawmakers’ data from Apple,-7.67,40.0,https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/11/22530070/trump-doj-apple-data-schiff,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,vox,25,"Democratic lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the Trump administration’s Department of Justice (DOJ) and its use of subpoenas to obtain device metadata belonging to at least two members of Congress. They say it’s a disturbing attack on the separation of powers, the principle of keeping the operations of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches generally separate from one another.The calls for oversight follow aNew York Times reportrevealing that the DOJ made Apple turn over records from several people associated with the House Intelligence Committee — including Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Eric Swalwell, their staff and family, one of whom was a minor — in the midst of an investigation into people leaking classified information. While the seizure of this data happened back in 2017 and 2018, a DOJ gag order kept Apple from informing the representatives until just last month when they received an email notification from the company. Now, members arereportedly racingto gather more details from Apple about the scope of the DOJ subpoena, and the DOJ’s top national security official, a Trump appointee, has resigned.At the same time, the DOJ’s pursuit of phone data went beyond those lawmakers. In February 2018, the department also sought communications data about an Apple account belonging to former White House counsel Don McGahn, according toa New York Times reportpublished on Sunday. It’s not yet clear why the DOJ sought that data, and Apple only notified McGahn about the subpoena last month.That the Department of Justice sought the private phone data of US lawmakers without their knowledge is remarkable and disturbing. While details are still emerging, the exchange sets a concerning precedent about the ability of the executive branch to obtain the digital records of lawmakers as well as tech companies’ roles in complying with such orders. Attention has now turned to both Apple and the DOJ, and it has raised concerns over how each approaches controversial government demands for sensitive data.It’s unclear what data Apple actually handed over. Apple did not respond to Recode’s request for comment. Recent reporting indicates that the information shared with the DOJ about members of Congress and staff were provided through the company’s standard procedure of obliging government requests for data, and thatApple wasn’t awareit was handing over data belonging to members of Congress.Still, Democrats are outraged, calling the seizure of this data “an assault” on the separation of powers. They say the subpoenas constituted dangerously broad government surveillance deployed in service of the political interests of then-President Donald Trump.“President Trump repeatedly and flagrantly demanded that the Department of Justice carry out his political will and tried to use the Department as a cudgel against his political opponents and members of the media,” Rep. Schiff told Recode in a statement. “It is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears.”RelatedThe DOJ’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz,announcedon Friday that he will start a review of the agency’s actions under the Trump administration and will look at “whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.” Sen. Ron Wydenhas also promisedto introduce legislation aimed at “reform[ing] the abuse of gag orders” and increasing transparency into government surveillance. On Monday, the New York Timesreportedthat John Demers, head of the DOJ’s national security division and one of the the last remaining Trump appointees at the department, would resign following the outcry. While Demers did not become the DOJ’s top national security official until after the subpoenas for Democrats’ records were sent, some want to know what Demers knew about the ongoing investigations.Companies like Apple frequently hand over user data when government agencies demand it. Here’s how Recode’s Sara Morrison explained itlast year.Depending on what law enforcement is looking for, it may not need physical possession of your device at all. A lot of information on your phone is also stored elsewhere. For example, if you back up your iPhone to Apple’s iCloud, the government can get it from Apple. If it needs to see whose DMs you slid into, law enforcement can contact Twitter. As long as they go through the proper and established legal channels to get it, police can get their hands on pretty much anything you’ve stored outside of your device.You do have some rights here. The Fourth Amendment protects you from illegal search and seizure, and aprovisionof theElectronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986(ECPA) dictates what law enforcement must obtain in order to get the information. It might be a subpoena, court order, or warrant, depending on what it’s looking for. (WhatsApp actually does a good job of explaining thisin its FAQ.) A section of the ECPA, known as the Stored Communications Act, says that service providers must have those orders before they can give the requested information to law enforcement.But, assuming the government has the right paperwork, your information is very obtainable.On Apple’s US-focusedtransparency website, the company says it can receive government requests related to a person’s device identifier, financial identifiers, customer data related to account information, and customer data requested in the midst of an emergency. In the case of the DOJ’s investigation into leaks, Appleturned over metadata and account information, according to the Times.“In this case, the subpoena, which was issued by a federal grand jury and included a nondisclosure order signed by a federal magistrate judge, provided no information on the nature of the investigation, and it would have been virtually impossible for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users’ accounts,” a company spokesperson, Fred Sainz, toldthe New York Times. “Consistent with the request, Apple limited the information it provided to account subscriber information and did not provide any content such as emails or pictures.”“These demands for lawmakers’ private data are especially disturbing because they threaten the separation of powers. But the problem is far bigger,” ACLU senior attorney Patrick Toomey told Recode in an email. “The government seizes the sensitive information of vast numbers of people each year, often without any notice to the people affected.”Tech companies do have some power when they receive these kinds of requests. They can try to reject a government request as being invalid, though they often don’t. Challenging such a request can also be hard to do if a company has limited information on what the request is actually for. Apple says that between January and June 2020, the company provided data 82 percent of the time when a government agency requested identifying information about a particular device. Tech companies can also try tofight a gag order. In this case, a gag order seemed to remain in place.This is concerning. At the same time, the seizure of this kind of data is a dark reminder that companies like Apple continue to hold onto vast amounts of user data and that they can be legally obligated to hand it over to the government without a user ever knowing.This story includes new information reported about Apple and about the resignation of a DOJ official.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

Gretchen Whitmer should not have opened vaccinations up to people ages 65 and older beginning Monday - which lengthened the queue by about 702,000 people - while the state was vaccinating the initial group of 800,000 front-line workers. But Michigan Department of Health and Human Services officials say the priority is getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.Large-scale vaccination centers, which have been swiftly set up across the state, have the capacity to inoculate tens of thousands of people per day. But appointments have been dramatically limited because Michigan doesn't have enough vaccine.Appointments to be vaccinated at health departments and hospitals are filling up as soon as they become available, providers said. Michigan anticipates receiving 62,400 doses the week of Jan. 18, MDHHS spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin, and health providers said that will lead to additional shortages of vaccine beginning next week.Michigan Medicine received 20,000 fewer doses of vaccine than planned this week, and has placed a temporary hold on scheduling first-dose vaccine appointments because it only has enough to fulfill appointments already scheduled, spokeswoman Mary Masson said.“Please be patient, we do not have enough vaccines and it takes time to administer, but we are building quickly and it looks like we’re going to be coming into more vaccines soon,” Whitmer said Wednesday. “This is the greatest tool we have to end this pandemic.”Here's what you need to know:The vaccine will be rolled out in phases, based on availability. The state began vaccinating front-line health care workers in December and on Monday, the state extended eligibility to additional health care workers, those in long-term care facilities, residents 65 and older, and childcare, corrections and K-12 school staff.An estimated 2,576,000 Michigan residents are considered eligible for the vaccine, but the state had just 831,150 doses as of Wednesday, Sutfin said in an email to The News.Sutfin said Michigan expects to receive an allotment of 60,450 doses of Pfizer's vaccine this week.The state is also accelerating distribution with the Michigan National Guard, Sutfin said.""We recognize that there is not enough vaccine for every currently eligible individual with the limited supplies we have,"" Sutfin said. ""There will be some places that run out of vaccine and do not have enough appointments available. This is why we have asked the federal government to give the State of Michigan more vaccines.""Vaccination will take place in different phases that occur simultaneously, the state health department said.Michigan has more than 5,000 facilities participating in the federal program to vaccinate staff and residents in long-term care facilities, which is being administered by CVS and Walgreens pharmacies. Michigan's allotment of Moderna vaccine doses through the end of January are being shipped directly to the companies, which coordinate distribution, vaccination and federal and state reporting. The companies are not accepting appointments at their stores.Meijer's120 pharmacies throughout Michigan are partnering to distribute the vaccine through atext-based registration process through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program.Meijer will administer the first doses at a limited number of stores in Wayne County to patients 65 and older beginning the week of Jan. 18. Specific store locations have not yet been determined.

The city has converted the TCF Center parking garage into a drive-through vaccine center, by appointment only.Mayor Mike Duggan said Detroit is hoping to provide 20,000 coronavirus vaccinations by early February if the state is able to maintain an adequate supply. If additional doses come through, they hope to increase the number of vaccinations to 30,000, the mayortold reporters Tuesday.Detroit is currently offering vaccinations to residents over age 75 and any ""good neighbor"" driver, 65 or older, who accompanies them to the TCF Center, as well as essential workers including K-12 teachers and childcare workers. All participants must make an appointment in advance. The city also ramped up vaccinations of critical workers including police officers and bus drivers.The city has booked its first 2,000 appointments, already set up through the first part of next week. Detroiters eligible should call (313) 230-0505 to arrange appointments.health department has exhausted its supply of vaccine and is unable to make new appointments before its next shipment of vaccines, officials posted to the county'swebsite.About 300,000 Macomb residents qualify for the vaccine, but the county's allocation for this week was 3,800 doses, County Executive Mark Hackel said Tuesday.""We need to make sure we have the supply before start continuing to open the demand,"" Hackel said. ""If we're going to try to figure out how do we get to the masses, it can't just be with health departments throughout the state.""Health Division asked residents to remain patient Wednesday as the department is seeing an overwhelming demand for the vaccine. The department has received 7,800 doses, administered about 5,600, and scheduled an estimated 17,000-plus first- and second-dose appointments through the end of February, officials said.There are more than 217,000 residents age 65 and older eligible to receive the vaccine in Oakland County. Officials are directing seniors to hospital systems to check for availability. The department's phone lines have received more than 20,000 calls each day and officials say the minimal supply limits their ability to schedule further appointments.To join the waiting list, use the county's Save Your Spot link on its website,oaklandcountyvaccine.com. Residents can also text OAKGOV COVID to 468311 for updates. For anyone unable to complete the form, call the health hotline at 800-848-5533.“We are asking the community to help us plan for administering future doses of vaccine we receive by completing this new form,” County Executive David Coulter said in a press release. “This will help us reach residents and workers who are eligible for vaccination when more doses become available.  As we receive more vaccine, we will continue to administer them quickly and efficiently until everyone has the opportunity to receive the vaccine.”Health Department repurposed Eastern Michigan University's Convocation Center as a vaccination center, said Susan Ringler Cerniglia, the department's spokeswoman. The center has eight to 14 vaccination stations operating at a time and can inoculate up to a thousand people a day.""We’re working toward as soon as we have sufficient vaccine to do 5,000 a week,"" she said. As of Wednesday, the Washtenaw County Health Department had administered 2,088 initial doses, and 70 second doses, of the two-dose vaccine.Dr. Mouhanad Hammami,health strategist, said demand for the vaccine is outpacing the state's ability to supply it to regional health departments. The county has an estimated 500,000 people eligible for the vaccine but only received 2,900 doses this week, which will be exhausted by next week, he told county commissionersTuesday.Hospitals and health systems currently have the most reliable supply of vaccines for seniors, Hammami said.""I want to emphasize that anyone 65 and older because this is the contradiction that the state has said, 'Call your health department,' which will do them no good if they call us. In fact, it will put a lot of burden on us because we are going to repeat the same message: You need to go to your health system,"" Hammami told The Detroit News Monday.Residents are encouraged to check their health provider's online medical chart or portal as all local health systems are going to start making appointments for their patients once they vaccinate their medical personnel.Oakland County officials are directing 1B groups to Beaumont Health, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland, Ascension Providence and McLaren Oakland.has tripled its server capacity after its website crashed Friday due to heavy demand for vaccines.The health system will continue working on the system and plans to expand capacity even more, said Hans Keil, Beaumont’s chief information officer.A limited number of appointments became available Monday to patients by a randomized computer lottery.Senior patients receive an email inviting them to schedule their vaccination through their myBeaumontChart account. When Beaumont receives confirmation about how many doses will arrive next week, the health system will send additional email invitations to eligible patients to schedule appointments.""We are in regular communication with state and local officials and talking with them about increasing our allocations of the vaccine because we have the capacity to do so much more,"" Beaumont Health CEO John Fox said in a press release. ""Next week, we hope to launch two additional clinics and should have the capacity to do more than 50,000 vaccinations a week. Again, this all depends upon how much vaccine we receive.""Beaumont is also preparing to launch a call center to assist with answering questions and scheduling appointments. However, right now, the only way to schedule an appointment is online through myBeaumontChart.is prioritizing existing patients who are 65 and older, patients who have certain high-risk conditions or meet the broader eligibility requirements announced last week.Once adequate vaccine supply becomes available, Henry Ford will open as many as eight appointment-only vaccination sites throughout southeast Michigan with the combined capacity to vaccinate between 4,000 and 5,000 people per day, officials announced Wednesday.Nearly 32,000 patients, or 94%, of those who responded to a Henry Ford survey, said they wanted to receive the vaccine. The hospital system is contacting patients who meet eligibility requirements through MyChart, text messaging and phone calls.The hospital has more than 800 appointments scheduled this week for the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, officials said Wednesday.About 70% of Henry Ford's staff of more than 33,000 team members have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. Approximately 22% of employees declined vaccination, but are eligible to change their mind and sign up to be vaccinated. The health system anticipates all team members who want to be vaccinated will receive the first dose by the first week of February.was prepared to complete its Phase 1A and roll out to Phase 1B on Monday, but only has enough to complete first-dose appointments already scheduled as well as administer second doses, Masson said Wednesday.""We ordered 24,000 doses for this week. We received about 4,000 doses, which will be used for second doses scheduled for this week,"" she said in an email to The News.Michigan Medicine is administering more than 90% of its vaccine supply each week.""Michigan Medicine is ready and staffed to perform as many as 12,000 vaccinations per week, with rapid expansion capability to 24,000 vaccinations per week and additional locations prepared to open when vaccine supply is available,"" Masson said.

407,Conservatives Keep Missing Opportunities to Really Engage With Blacks,7.67,42.0,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/01/15/conservatives-keep-missing-opportunities-for-real-engagement-with-blacks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,dailysignal,25,"Since the Nov. 3 election, I have received many calls and emails from influential Republicans and prominent conservatives. Despite losing the White House, they were high-fiving about President Donald Trump’s going from 8% of the black vote in 2016 to 12% in 2020.What a sad state of affairs when a 12% market share is reason to celebrate.  In most industries, this would be viewed as unacceptable and embarrassing.Herein lies the problem with the conservative movement: Our expectations are so low when it comes to the black community that even miniscule progress is celebrated jubilantly.The reason expectations are so low is because deep down inside, conservatives–for purposes of this column, I’m using the words Republicans and conservatives interchangeably–know that they have not really made a serious effort to cultivate relations with the black community.They do, in their minds, just enough not to be called racist.According to this perverse logic, if they have one black on staff, they can’t be racist; or if they grew up with a black nanny, they can’t be racist. I am not kidding; I have had many conservations with conservatives along this line.Those who have followedmy writingover the years know that I have been critical of the lack of “substantive” engagement with the black community from conservatives.Most of the blacks invited by conservatives to speak at their events have little to no connection to the black community and, quite often, their speeches are off-putting to the black community.If your goal is to be entertained or to throw red meat to the white base of the party, then they may be appropriate speakers. But if your goal is to build relations with the black community, they are counterproductive.I challenge conservatives to specify the number of blacks they have in decision-making positions within their organizations. How many blacks do they have around them that tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear?How many five- and six-figure black consultants do they have on retainer?  How many black vendors do they contract with during the course of a year?When I say decision-making positions, I mean someone who can hire or fire; has budgetary authority to  spend money; or can get meetings set up with key executives.This is the 21st century, and many conservative organizations have little to no reflection of the diversity that our country presents.  How is this possible?These organizations hire their friends, they give consultant contracts to their friends, they contribute to their friends’ campaigns. They do the same things they accuse radical liberals of doing. They are in a bubble, an echo chamber filled with people who only think and look like them.Are they racist? Absolutely not. People tend to gravitate toward the things they are familiar with; it’s a logical and natural thing to do.No, I am not talking about imitating the Democrats. No bean counting. They, as usual, go overboard with their push for diversity, to the point that it is discriminatory.But, if you are a conservative and don’t notice that every time you’re in a meeting or conference that not one black person can be found there, that is a problem.Democrats are obsessed with diversity and Republicans are oblivious to diversity.Both are equally wrong and detrimental to our American values.But true leaders understand this dilemma and make a conscious decision to inject diversity into their organizations so they can remain relevant.  There is no evidence that conservatives have learned this lesson.I have done PR and crises communications for some of the biggest names in politics, business, sports, and entertainment from all over the world.  I refer to myself as a “straticist,” not a strategist.Most people in my profession understand PR or strategic communications, but few understand the merging of both when confronting an issue; thus, the word “straticist.”The Republican Party and the conservative movement have a brand problem. We have allowed radical liberals to brand us as racist.  A lie that is repeated enough becomes the truth.Conservatives are under the misguided notion that blacks need to be sold or persuaded on conservatism.  Blacks are more conservative than most whites; survey after survey has shown that blacks are the most churchgoing people in the country.Blacks don’t need to be lectured about family values and entrepreneurship.  We had the most intact, stable families from the 1900s to the 1950s, and the highest marriage rates. Then Democrats in the 1960s injected our community with welfare and all these radical liberal “social” programs.We always have been business-minded, even before slavery; until, that is, Democrats cut off our access to opportunities and capital.Conservatism is in our DNA.The sooner conservatives grasp this, the sooner we can begin to make significant progress with the black community. The sooner conservatives stop promoting black minstrel shows dressed up like outreach, the sooner more blacks will publicly join our cause. To cite two examples: The “commentary” of a certain upwardly mobile young lady and a certain comedic duo, each with their own podcasts, play into the worst stereotypes of blacks ever perpetrated.We, as black conservatives, are not here to be used to throw out inflammatory rhetoric against the black community or to entertain a room full of white conservatives with feeble attempts at humor.  We want to be a full partner in spreading a positive, conservative message throughout the black community.In the immortal words of my grandmother: “Boy, your actions speak so loud, I can’t hear a damn thing you are saying!”How appropriate for conservatives.Conservatives must first and foremost engage with black entrepreneurs. They are the leaders of the black community, not the preacher-politicians.When all is said and done, so far there has been more said than done.",1
408,Did you hear U.S. plans to require vaccine passports? Not true,-3.17,46.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/did-you-hear-us-plans-to-require-vaccine-passports-not-true.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-10,oregonlive,25,"The Associated Press checks out some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. This one is bogus, even though it was shared widely on social media. Here are the facts:CLAIM:The federal government wants to require Americans to present a health passport or vaccine certificate “on demand,” including for domestic travel.THE FACTS:The U.S. government has no plans to require so-called vaccine passports to travel domestically, or for any other purpose.While private businesses are considering vaccine passports for certain activities, Biden administration officials have said the federal government will not mandate vaccine passports.A vaccine passport is documentation that shows a person has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or recently tested negative. The information will be in the form of a scannable code that can be stored on a smartphone or printed out.During a press conference on Tuesday, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration is “not now nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.”But posts circulating on social media are falsely implying that vaccine passports will be mandatory in the U.S., including for domestic travel. “President Biden and the Democrats want to force Americans to present a ‘vaccine passport’ upon demand, yet they oppose presenting an ID to cast a vote,” reads a tweet by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.A Facebook post claims: “So, now, I will need a Health Passport to travel IN America, but Illegals don’t need any kind of Passport to enter INTO America!”Such claims are “patently false,” according to Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor, and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.“There are no plans in the US to introduce a vaccine passport for domestic travel,” Gostin said to the AP in an email. “Neither the government nor the US airline industry have announced any plans for requiring proof of vaccination as a condition of interstate travel.”Gostin explained that foreign carriers were discussing a voluntary COVID vaccine passport system, but it did not include U.S. carriers yet. In the U.S., only one state has rolled out a vaccine passport. New York introduced an app through a limited government partnership with a private company. People can show proof of vaccination or a negative test with an app to enter places like entertainment venues.Lawmakers in ahandful of states, including Pennsylvania, are trying to ban vaccine passports. Last week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also issued an executive order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof they got the shot. The Facebook post’s claim that people without legal status in the U.S. are allowed to enter without documentation is also misleading. Those trying to enter the U.S. must show proof they are an American citizen or documents showing they have permission to enter the country, otherwise they are placed in expedited removal proceedings and face deportation. The law does allow those without documents who have a credible fear of returning to their home country to enter and apply for asylum.",2
409,"In Italy, I’ve Rediscovered the Power of Three Types of Praye...",-1.0,35.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/march-web-only/italy-covid-19-prayer-coronavirus-psalms-lament-intercessio.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-26,christianitytoday,25,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how Italian Christians pray and live their faith, amid a nation reeling from more than 10,000 deaths—the highest tally in the world—among 92,400confirmedcases, second only to the United States [as of March 28].During lockdown, we can no longer gather on Sundays or in home groups. Social gatherings, travel, and weddings are suspended, as are most businesses. If someone is caught outside their home without a valid reason, there can be a heavy fine.But this season of exile has helped us discover three facets of prayer we often neglect in times of abundance.Psalms of lament often felt hyperbolic a month ago. For example, Asaph’s complaint that God has made his people “drink tears by the bowlful” could seem overdramatic; David’s cry to God of “How long will you hide your face from me?” was a distant feeling.But as humanity struggles to contain a fear- and anxiety-provoking pandemic, lament feels newly relevant to all of us. In March 2020, Psalm 44 sounds pitch perfect:Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep?Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.Why do you hide your faceand forget our misery and oppression?We are brought down to the dust;our bodies cling to the ground.Rise up and help us;rescue us because of your unfailing love.Few Western Christians have experienced poverty, injustice, or persecution. Consequently, our worship usually reflects the moods of resourceful individuals in times of prosperity and peace: composed and mainstream. We do suffer individually; however, seldom is our corporate worship fueled by protest and mourning before God.Lament is suffering turned into prayer. It’s the worship of people who feel out of balance and out of place. Historically, it has been the prayer of minorities, the poor, and the persecuted—of Chinese pastors in prison cells and of black slaves singing of justice and Christ’s coming.If lament felt foreign to most Italians a month ago, pastors have found eerie echoes of biblical stories in what is currently taking place in the country. “To see wives who can’t perform rites or bid farewell to their dying husbands reminds me of how Jesus was hastily buried and women returned to the tomb to anoint his body,” Gaetano di Francia, director of the Union of Christian Biblical Churches in Italy, told me. “Their lack of closure will produce a deeper grief.”The language of lament may prove to be one of the bittersweet lessons Christians learn from this crisis. It can help believers unlearn a spirituality of the center and learn a spirituality of the margins (as pastor Abraham Choremindsus).Never have I spent so much of my time in prayer interceding for others. I’m ashamed to confess that, in the past, I’ve often told people, “I’ll pray for you,” but then forgot to do it.But now that the virus ravages Italy, I have been moved by images of overworked doctors and people lying in makeshift hospitals. A member of our church fell gravely sick, but the emergency room turned him away because it is fielding so many cases of the new coronavirus.I can’t meet or lay hands on him due to the current national lockdown, but I have been praying for his recovery. As a church, we have prayed for doctors, created a common fund to help those in economic need, and fasted for our country.The coronavirus crisis has united Italian evangelicals, who observed a National Day of Prayer this past Sunday [March 22]. “Pentecostals, Reformed, Wesleyans, Baptists, Congregationalists, and others met at the feet of the Lord, united by the Holy Spirit,” Giacomo Ciccone, president of the Italian Evangelical Alliance, told me.“It is as if God prepared leaders and denominations around the country to come together in prayer for the nation and for the church,” Leonardo de Chirico, the alliance’s vice president, told me. “It was the easiest event to organize. Nobody needed convincing; all were already on fire for it.”Mila Palozzi, a pastor at my congregation, Hopera Church in Rome, agrees that evangelicals desire to come together.“In the Promised Land, Israel understood itself as a collection of tribes but in exile as one nation,” she told me. “So does Italy: this crisis is bringing churches and tribes together to pray as one body for our country.”It’s a foretaste of the spirit of unity and intercession spreading around the world. For example, this coming Sunday [March 29] the World Evangelical Alliance will convene a Global Day of Fasting and Prayer.However, the news is so bleak and the suffering so global these days that we can feel overwhelmed in prayer. How can my prayers possibly meet this moment? Our honest response may be, “Lord, I’m dumbfounded. I don’t know what to say.”When I watched army trucks driving corpses to be cremated because there is no longer space in cemeteries in parts of Italy, I was speechless.But to wait upon the Lord is valid. To put our wordless trust in him is a legitimate prayer. When Paul writes about our present weakness and suffering, he adds:“We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.” (Rom. 8:26-27, NIV)When words fail us, we can be still and know that God is God.“As a family, we have chosen to fill our silences full of doubts with the secure promises of God,” Stefano Picciani, a preacher at Stadera Church in Milan, told me. “Asaph’s statement of trust in Psalm 73—‘Yet I am always with you’—provides words for our prayers.”We rightly long to return to normalcy and corporate worship. Imagine the victory parties, and the joining of hands!When this pandemic will be defeated, many will resonance with the sense of relief of Psalm 126 (“Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.”) and the joy of Psalm 150 (“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.”).But alongside celebrations, we will be wise to remember the prayers we uttered in this time of sickness. May this pandemic humble our hearts and teach us the prayers of the weak, the concerned, and the speechless.René Breuel is founding pastor of Hopera, a church in Rome, Italy, and author of.[ This article is also available inespañol,Português,العربية,Italiano, , 	]",1
410,"Americans Are Worried About Crime, But That Doesn’t Mean They’re Blaming Democrats",-6.67,41.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,fivethirtyeight,25,"Welcome toPollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.Rising murder, aggravated assault and auto theft rateshave increased concern about crime among the American public. According to polling fromYouGov/The Economist, the share of Americans who say crime is the most important issue facing America has increased since President Biden took office — to a greater degree than any issue except national security. Relatedly, a May 22-25Fox News pollfound that 73 percent of registered voters thought there was more crime nationwide than there was a year earlier. Only 17 percent thought there was less crime, and 7 percent thought the level of crime had stayed about the same.Fewer, but still a majority, believed crime was up in their local area, too: 54 percent, compared with 28 percent who thought there was less crime in their area and 15 percent who thought it was about the same. (It’s worth noting, though, that Americans perpetually believe that crime is on the rise,even when it is not.)AGallup pollearlier this year also found that only 27 percent of Americans were satisfied with the nation’s policies to reduce or control crime, and that 65 percent were dissatisfied. That’s a big change from 2020, when 47 percent were satisfied and 49 percent were dissatisfied.Altogether, this hassparked a narrativethat the rise in violent crime poses a political problem for Democrats, who are the ruling party and also traditionally perceived assofter on crime. But at this point, it’s not really clear that the crime issue will hurt Democrats and anti-police progressives politically. For starters, Americans are actually pretty divided on what the best solution to stopping crime is. In aYouGov/Yahoo News pollfrom May 24-26, 32 percent of adults said that law enforcement is not tough enough on most offenders — but about the same amount, 27 percent, said law enforcement istough on most offenders. (Eighteen percent thought law enforcement’s level of toughness was about right, while 22 percent weren’t sure.)The public is also pretty sharply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans are better on the issue of crime. When asked whether Biden or former President Donald Trump has done a better job handling crime, 34 percent of respondents to the YouGov/Yahoo poll said Trump, while 32 percent said Biden. (Fifteen percent thought the two were about equally good on crime.) Of course, this just mirrors people’s existing partisan preferences — a majority of Republicans preferred Trump’s handling, while a majority of Democrats preferred Biden’s — but that just bolsters the theory that crime isn’t an issue that’s changing anybody’s mind.Similarly, in elections so far in 2021, it also doesn’t look like crime is driving voters toward more conservative candidates. True, this week’s Democratic primary for mayor of New York Cityfocused heavily on crime, and thewinner was most likelyBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, arguably the race’s most pro-police candidate. But there are plenty of counterexamples: In the Democratic primary for Philadelphia district attorney, incumbent Larry Krasner — theGeorge Washington of the progressive criminal-justice movement— handily defeated a moderate who attempted totie Krasner’s policies to Philadelphia’s rising crime rate. And in this month’s special election forNew Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, the Republican candidate ran what was virtually a single-issue campaign on crime and policing issues; Democrat Melanie Stansbury ended up winning by 25 percentage points, exceeding the district’s D+18partisan lean.1It’s possible crime emerges as a wedge issue in the 2022 midterms. But so far, there’s little evidence that it is helping one party over the other.According to FiveThirtyEight’spresidential approval tracker,252.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 42.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +10.5 points). At this timelast week, 51.9 percent approved and 42.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +9.9 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 54.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 40.3 percent, for a net approval rating of +14.0 points.",1

At 6 p.m., the AP called Michigan for Biden.But the Trump campaign said earlier Wednesday it would ask for a recount in Wisconsin, where Biden was up by a little more than 20,000 votes early in the afternoon. In Wisconsin, candidates can request a recount if the margin is less than 1%. Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016.“Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be. There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. “The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so.”The Trump campaign said it would file suit in Michigan to halt ballot counting until “meaningful access” is granted to “numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process.”His campaign also said it is “moving to intervene” in an existing case before the U.S. Supreme Court over Pennsylvania’s extended deadline that allows mail-in ballots to be accepted through Friday as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 3. And the president’s re-election campaign is suing to temporarily stop the vote count in Pennsylvania over claims of “transparency” issues.Stepien said in an afternoon press call that the campaign had “a high degree of confidence” that Trump would prevail in Pennsylvania.“In fact, we are declaring a victory in Pennsylvania,” Stepien said, even though the AP and major news networks have not called yet called the race.Earlier in the day, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon projected confidence about Biden’s chances in most of the remaining swing states after the former vice president flipped Arizona and one of Nebraska’s congressional districts from Trump, according to the AP.“Joe Biden is on track to win this election and he will be the next president of the United States,” O’Malley Dillon said in a briefing with reporters late Wednesday morning. “We believe we are on a clear path to victory. By this afternoon, we expect the vice president will have leads in states that put him over 270 electoral votes.”A handful of battlegrounds remained in play as ballot counting wore on Wednesday. Even as the AP called Wisconsin for Biden, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia remained up for grabs, and the Trump campaign pushed back on Arizona being called for the Democrat.The Biden campaign said it expects to “win” Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while O’Malley Dillon listed Georgia as a “toss-up” and said North Carolina was currently leaning toward Trump.Stepien, the Trump campaign manager, offered a different view of the map during a press call Wednesday morning as officials said they are “confident” in the president’s paths to re-election.Stepien said Trump is “in a very good position” — showing restraint just hours after the president addressed supporters and the nation from the White House in the wee hours Wednesday and said, “Frankly, we did win this election.”“If we count the legal ballots, the president wins,” Stepien said.But O’Malley Dillon countered, “If Donald Trump got his wish and we stopped counting ballots right now, Joe Biden would be the next president of the United States.”After losing several swing states the campaign had made plays for, including Florida, Texas and Ohio, O’Malley Dillon said, “We did not believe the race was in that wide margin we were seeing in the national polling numbers.”She said the campaign “definitely saw a number of states become more in play than we had even anticipated. Obviously some of those went to Trump. But those are swing states, so we’re not surprised.”O’Malley Dillon said the former vice president would likely address the nation sometime later Wednesday.Millions of ballots remained outstanding in Pennsylvania late Wednesday morning, where Gov. Tom Wolf said, “We may not know the results even today, but the most important thing is that we have accurate results, again, even if that takes a little longer than we’re used to.”Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a press conference “we hope” the first unofficial tabulation “will come sometime within the next 24 hours” as ballots remain outstanding in major population centers.Massachusetts GOP Gov. Charlie Baker, who “blanked” his presidential ballot, released a statement with Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito Wednesday morning needling the president as they called for “every vote to be counted.”“Every American, regardless of political affiliation, especially the President and every candidate on the ballot, should be united in supporting this process,” the Republican leaders wrote, adding, “When the results are finally determined, we are hopeful that all candidates, especially the two running for the most powerful office in the world, set aside partisanship to improve the lives of all Americans.”",2

It will likely approach the coast of Belize on Wednesday night and early Thursday, according to the NHC’s public advisory.Nana is expected to make landfall over Belize as a Category 1 hurricane, and wind shear is expected to limit its intensity, according to a forecast discussion.Nana, the season’s 14th tropical storm, formed Tuesday about 120 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica.As of 8 a.m., Nana was about 150 miles northeast of Limon, Honduras, moving west at 18 mph with top winds of 60. A Category 1 hurricane forms when sustained winds are in the range of 74 to 95 mph.Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from Nana’s center, the hurricane center said.Northern Honduras and coastal Guatemala are under a tropical storm watch, the southern Yucatan Peninsula is under a tropical storm warning, and the entire coast of Belize is under a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch.There have been four hurricanes so far in this busy Atlantic season: Hanna, Isais, Laura and Marco.Laura was the season’s first major hurricane, making landfall in Cameron, La., as a Category 4 on Aug. 27. Hanna, Isias and Marco were Category 1 hurricanes that made landfall in Padre Island, Texas; Ocean Isle Beach, N.C.; and at the mouth of the Mississippi River, respectively.Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Omar is weakening over the open Atlantic.Omar, the season’s 15th tropical storm, formed about 225 miles east of Cape Hatteras, N.C., on Tuesday, about five hours after Nana, according to the NHC.Tropical Storm Omar was about 350 miles northwest of Bermuda, the NHC said Wednesday in its 5 a.m. advisory. It was moving east-northeast at 14 mph, with 40 mph winds and higher gusts. It is not expected to strengthen much and it is likely to significantly weaken throughout the day on Thursday, becoming a remnant low by Thursday night, the NHC said in its outlook.The system is expected to continue its curve away from land, moving in a northeast to eastward motion off the U.S. East Coast.An area of the Atlantic midway between the Windward Islands and the west coast of Africa is bustling with activity from two tropical waves. One is an area of low pressure with showers and thunderstorms that is slowly becoming better organized, the hurricane center said.The other is expected to move off the coast of Africa on Wednesday and merge with a disturbance a couple hundred miles southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands, the hurricane center said. If and when the disturbances merge, the system will develop and could become a tropical depression by the weekend as it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean.This is the time of year when storms tend to form in the open Atlantic, particularly near the Cabo Verde Islands. Those storms, which grow in size and intensity as they make the long trek westward across the Atlantic Ocean, are historically the most powerful and destructive hurricanes.The remaining monikers for named storms this season in the Atlantic are: Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred.In August, the federal government issued an updated forecast for the season,predicting as many as 25 storms, which is more than the agency has ever forecast. The tropical weather experts at Colorado State University predicted that 2020 could possibly be thesecond-busiest season on record, behind only 2005, the year that produced Katrina and Wilma.",2

We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility,” he said.“Together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.

416,We Must Change How Our Criminal Justice System Treats People with Mental Illness,-7.67,42.0,https://time.com/5876045/we-must-change-how-our-criminal-justice-system-treats-people-with-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,time,25,"In this moment ofrethinking law enforcement, we must examine how both our policing and our correctional system exacerbate the crisis of mental health in America.As an inpatient psychiatrist, I treat patients who are psychotic, plagued by voices or visions or paranoid delusions. Or they are in the throes of mania. Or they are actively trying to harm themselves or others. Their lives are replete with hardship. Many of my patients are homeless. Some are drug-addicted. Nearly all have been victims of significant trauma. They have few safe havens, and the illnesses that besiege their minds wage a relentless war on their stability, their happiness, their safety. Many of them also serve or have served time in jail and prison. Environments that exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and routinely make mentally ill people worse and in which they face a disproportionate risk of being victimized by both officers and other inmates.In addition to my work at the hospital, I also perform forensic evaluations for the courts, and once I began working in prisons I found a system that runs counter to every principle of human flourishing that I know. Mentally ill Americans suffer from diseases of the mind, but when they come in contact with police, they also suffer from our law enforcement policies.At the 2016 annual meeting of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, former Portland, Oregon police commander Sara Westbrook illustrated this truth to a roomful of doctors. She recounted a call her department had recently received about a mentally ill man at the city’s downtown Waterfront Park. The man was large and muscular and had a gallon jug filled with fluid attached to a long chain. He was grunting loudly, swinging the chain in a large circle above his head, and charging at people.The police arrived, and the man began charging at the officers. Over the course of the next two and a half or three hours, the police officers worked diligently to get the man into custody with what Commander Westbrook described as “very little force.” When they succeeded, they took him to the hospital for psychiatric care. But due to a chronic shortage of psychiatric hospital beds, he was discharged from the ER before the police paperwork had even been finished. Police would soon be called again, and this time they would take the man to jail.Encounters with police require obedience, and people with manic or psychotic symptoms—who are in the grip of delusions, or who are distracted by visions or voices, for example—are not always able to comply. The misalignment between the expectation that people follow commands and their medical inability to do so has the potential for disaster. Of the roughly 1,000 fatal shootings by police in 2018,approximately 25% of the victims were mentally ill. People with mental illness aresixteen times more likelyto be killed in a police encounter than people who are psychiatrically well. This statistic is even more sobering given that it is often desperate friends or family members seeking help for their mentally ill loved one who have called police in the first place.Even when, as in this case, police are able to safely de-escalate a psychiatric emergency, their presence at the front lines of mental health crises means that they—not clinicians—decide whether a person should be taken to jail or to the hospital. In the moment of the police encounter, law enforcement becomes the arbiter of psychiatric care. Once police are involved, even if they attempt to opt for treatment over punishment, a therapeutic and just outcome is by no means guaranteed. If psychiatric units are full, police are often forced to turn to jails to house the acutely mentally ill—facilities that have what a prison psychologist once described to me as “an iron-clad, no-refusal, admission policy.”When mentally ill people in crisis are not admitted to hospitals, Westbrook said, she and her officers view taking them to jail as a last resort act of compassion. Given the lack of community services available for the mentally ill, she said, jail is at least “three hots and a cot, and I know somebody will check to make sure they’re still breathing.”Across the country, jail is now seen as a treatment option—and sometimes the lone treatment option—for disadvantaged citizens with mental illness. There is even a term for this response: compassionate arrest. We use “compassionate arrests” only for people who suffer from lack of access to care for their psychiatric illnesses. We would never incarcerate people in order to obtain treatment for their cancer, or their asthma, or their diabetes. But we have come to treat psychiatric crises as legal problems rather than the health care emergencies that they are. The consequences of such an approach are stark, and have resulted in the fact that todayour country’s largest mental health institution, holding more than 2,000 mentally ill people, is Chicago’s Cook County Jail.We have ended up as a society like this because of a very specific series of choices by the government over the last 50 years. The closing of state psychiatric hospitals in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s led directly to the influx of mentally ill people into correctional facilities. The prospect of liberating tens of thousands of people from long-term psychiatric institutions was initially thrilling, especially given the egregious treatment and even abuse that many of the facilities’ residents had endured in the name of psychiatric “care.” In 1963 the Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed with the intention of shifting care for the mentally ill out of the asylums and into the communities. State mental hospitals across the country were defunded and closed, but the accompanying promises of community resources—from psychiatric treatment to vocational training to social supports—never materialized.Without funds, without treatment, and suddenly also without housing, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens fell out of health care and into the realm of the legal system. The criminalization of mental illness had begun.Since that time, the field of psychiatry has seen more than fifty years of institutional reform alongside tremendous advances in neuroscience and pharmacology. The care that hospitals like mine are now able to provide is both humane and therapeutic. However, the woefully insufficient funding of mental healthcare in America has only worsened, and therefore such care is not widely accessible.Following the 2008 recession, five billion dollars were cut from state mental health services and 4,500 psychiatric hospital beds were eliminated across the country. The lack of resources for psychiatric care in our communities means that people who suffer from severe mental illness all too often receive inadequate treatment, if they receive treatment at all. With a chronic lack of availability of both inpatient and outpatient mental health services, our mentally ill citizens are relegated to emergency rooms, to homeless shelters, and to correctional facilities.As a result, our system continues to indiscriminately shift large numbers of people who belong in therapeutic environments into punitive ones. Today, ten times more people with serious mental illness are in our nation’s correctional facilities than in our state psychiatric hospitals.Once in jail—no matter the rationale behind the incarceration, no matter the state of their minds—all people behind bars are subjected to the same strict rules and harsh punishments. When we underfund psychiatric care in our country and then ask police to serve on the front lines of mental health emergencies, everyone loses. People who belong on treatment wards end up on cellblocks, and the results can be catastrophic.If my patients become assaultive in the hospital, their symptoms are more aggressively targeted with medications and therapy. We aim to quickly and safely reduce their delusions or ease their hallucinations. In correctional facilities the responses to the same actions are drastically different, as was true for a man I evaluated who, in the grip of paranoia, punched a correctional officer. He incurred a felony assault charge that comes with a possible penalty of 15 years in prison. In just this way, when we punish people for the symptoms of their illnesses, our overcrowded correctional facilities become inundated with the psychiatrically ill. The practice strains our prison system and drains money from state coffers. It is also unjust and cruel.Widespread demands for change offer us an opportunity. Calls to shift money from policing to mental health can move people who suffer from mental illness from beneath the auspices of police and corrections and back into healthcare where they belong.But if we continue to use police as the frontline workers for mental healthcare, we perpetuate the criminalization of mental illness that began sixty years ago at great cost to the legal system, to the mentally ill, and to us all.Contact us atletters@time.com",1

The allegations included an instance when she said Cuomo suggested they “play strip poker,” and that had once allegedly kissed her on the lips without her consent.Cuomo has denied those allegations.Charlotte Bennett, another former aide, detailed a series of uncomfortable encounters with her former boss to The New York Times, including alleged overtures for a sexual relationship while alone in his state Capitol office last June.A third woman, who does not share work history with Cuomo, alleged unsolicited touching at a wedding in 2019.Cuomo, for his part, has spent much of the week trying to distance his actions from some of the more egregious types of behavior that have cast a shadow in the wake of the MeToo movement. Cuomo maintained during his first public briefing since the two additional women came forward that he had never “touched anyone inappropriately.”“The governor’s press conference was full of falsehoods and inaccurate information, and New Yorkers deserve better,” Bennett’s harassment lawyer, Debra Katz, told the Times.In aCBS News interview Thursday evening, Bennett said that she perceived the governor’s alleged sexual overtures as indication that he saw himself as “untouchable.”Cuomo’s dominant presence in New York politics, and the accusations of a third-term governor wielding power for self-interested ends and being beyond the grasp of accountability comes as the New York legislature moved to strip Cuomo of the emergency pandemic powers this week.State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) last month said it was time to restore “checks and balances” for the governor, who had enjoyed additional emergency powers to drive a quick pandemic response since last spring. The move gets ahead of the expiration of the powers set for April 30.Stewart-Cousins had also separately weighed in on New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations, saying during a CNN interview this week: “If the investigation shows that something inappropriate did happen, I think he would have to resign.”She elaborated on those comments in a Thursday interview with local networkSpectrum Newswhen asked at what point the governor would lose her support: “Any further people coming forward, I would think it would be time for him to resign.”Cuomo on Wednesday expressed contrition, saying he was both “embarrassed” and had “learned an important lesson.”“I do not believe that I have ever done anything in my public career that I am ashamed of,” he said, adding that he felt “badly” his words had caused discomfort.But even after Cuomo rebuffed calls for his resignation, he was further battered by anotherreportthat landed late Thursday.The Times revealed an effort by some of the governor’s senior aides to rewrite a report on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, likely as part of a broader effort to preserve the image of the long-serving governor, whose missteps amid the pandemic have increasingly come under scrutiny.A final version of the report concealed a staggering number of nursing home deaths occurring until June, as the Cuomo administration publicly cited a figure that was roughly 50 percent lower than the one identified by state health department officials.While Cuomo has previously attributed efforts to withhold true accounting of the total death toll of nursing home residents to concerns that the Trump administration would launch a politically-motivated inquiry, the Times’ report shows evidence of the masking effort far before the arrival of federal requests for the data.Cuomo will face a separate investigation overseen by the state attorney general regarding nursing home deaths.",1
418,Meet the Smith College employee whistleblower exposing anti-white racism,14.0,36.0,https://www.thecollegefix.com/meet-the-smith-college-employee-whistleblower-exposing-anti-white-racism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,thecollegefix,23,"An employee at Smith College in Massachusetts has been making videos detailing the creation of a “hostile work environment” for her as a white person.“I am very, very concerned about this issue, not just for the Smith community, but for communities at other colleges and workplaces too,” Jodi Shaw toldin an email.Shaw, an alumnus of the school, currently works as an administrative assistant in the Department of Student Affairs at the elite women’s college.“I’m white, which really shouldn’t be relevant, but my employer has made it clear that, not only is it relevant, but it’s possibly one of most important or if not the most important feature of me as a human,” Shaw said in a video posted to herYouTube channel. As of now, Shaw has made a total of four videos detailing her experience at work.The first is titled: “Dear Smith College: I Have a Few Requests.”“I ask that Smith College stop reducing my personhood to a racial category,” she says. Shaw also claims that “a lot” of other staff members feel the same way. Those staffers have not come forward.Shaw goes on to offer a blistering indictment of critical race theory, attacking the idea that white people have built an unconquerable system of racism against which people of color are powerless.“I believe my value lies in the quality of my work, the goodness of my deeds, the essence of my character, and the fullness of my heart, not my skin color,” she says.According to Shaw, there is an “ever-present terror” at Smith “that any unverified student allegation of racism, or any other ‘-ism,’ has the power to crush our reputations, ruin our livelihood, and even endanger the physical safety of ourselves or our family members.”Shaw later went on thepodcastto describe what she was referencing.On July 31, 2018, a staffer saw student Oumou Kanoute lounging in a dining hall. Believing she was out of place, the staffer called unarmed campus police to investigate. When the officer arrived on the site, he recognized Kanoute, saw nothing was wrong, and left.Given a platform by the ACLU, Kanoute wouldclaimthat she was “racially profiled,”creating a firestormon campus.An independent investigation, however,foundthat the employee who called the policedid not violateany campus policies.After Shaw posted the first video to her channel, an HR representative came to a meeting with her supervisor, she told“We know about your video,” she told Shaw. Shaw was then assigned a “campus safety partner” — which is another name for a campus police officer — to whom she could turn if she felt “unsafe.”“It felt strange and I do not know if Smith is actually concerned about me or just concerned about fulfilling obligations necessary to maintain their liability policy,” Shaw said, though she also said she assumes it is the latter.Publicly, the college threw Shaw under the bus.“This past week, an employee of the college posted a personal video to express their concerns about the college’s programming to promote racial justice,” wrote Smith College President Kathleen McCartney in astatement.“This employee does not speak for the college or any part of the college. Further, we believe the video mischaracterizes the college’s important, ongoing efforts to build a more equitable and inclusive living, learning and working environment,” she wrote.“The National Labor Relations Act protects employees who engage in concerted activities, including speech, with respect to workplace conditions,” McCartney writes.Shaw is particularly skeptical of this sentence.“I feel like this paragraph is code for: ‘We would fire her, but we can’t, because there’s this law that says we can’t…otherwise she would totally be fired,’” Shaw said in a second video deconstructing the statement.One reason for her disbelief is the existence of a college policy protecting the “free exchange of ideas,” as Shaw calls it. According to Shaw, it is suspicious that McCartney cites the National Labor Relations Act rather than any freedom-of-expression policies at Smith.In a third video, Shaw describes an experience she had while organizing a library orientation for students. As a candidate for a full-time library position, she was told to “do something crazy.” She decided to perform a rap to get students acquainted with the library system.While she was preparing for the orientation, the incident with Kanoute occurred. According to Shaw, the campus “went into overdrive” and created a very “racially tense environment.”A supervisor wrote in an email to Shaw, “The use of rap as a medium by a white staff member and student could easily be perceived as insensitive or cultural appropriation by incoming Smith students and could create a perception with students that the library is not racially sensitive.”In an in-person conversation with the supervisor, Shaw asked if she would be able to do the rap if she were a person of color. Without hesitation, the supervisor replied, “Yes.”“I honestly believed that, if I filed a complaint…nobody would ever hire me at Smith College or anywhere,” Shaw said.Because of that event, as well as suspicion that the department would not want to hire a white person, she withdrew her application for the position and took on her current role.After Shaw posted this video,, Smith’s student newspaper, wrote a November 2storyon Shaw. While Shaw agreed to an interview withThe Sophian, she is only directly quoted once.Shaw toldthat, while she did not read the story, colleagues told her that “it did not do a fair job of portraying the issues which is unfortunate as it denies members of the Smith College community access to information in an objective, fair manner.”The fourth and most recent video as of November 11 describes Shaw’s experience at a faculty retreat, the first day of which would see her and her colleagues discuss their “identities.”Shaw was told to sit in a group and talk about her race “in the context of your childhood, your adolescence, and your college years.”Uncomfortable talking about such subjects in a work environment, Shaw abstained from the discussion.Hours later, a facilitator told the group, “Any white person who expresses discomfort about or distress or any kind of resistance toward talking about their race when asked to is not actually experiencing discomfort, so don’t feel like you should comfort them because it’s not discomfort. It’s called ‘white fragility,’ and it’s a power play.”Shaw saw this as “a public humiliation.”“This was framed as a manipulative maneuver on my part,” said Shaw. “It was an act of aggression, me saying I’m uncomfortable.”Shaw toldthat more videos are forthcoming.They will feature her take on “specific incidents that took place on Smith College campus between [the Kanoute incident] to the present that I believe are all a product of and a contributor to the hostile environment at Smith and excellent examples of the ideological stranglehold Smith seeks to maintain over its community.”contacted the Smith College public relations department, but it did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Shaw’s videos have garnered national attention from TV hosts such asTucker Carlson, who had Shaw on as a guest.“I consider myself a liberal,” Shaw told, “and while I wish more liberals would speak out against this, I recognize it is an issue that concerns all of us and is an area that both conservatives and liberals can (and should) join forces on. This is not the time for division.”“I continue to work in a hostile work environment that feels more hostile since releasing the video.”IMAGE: Jodi Shaw Smith College Big Dig/YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1

""And for most people who get this Delta variant, it's going to be the most serious virus that they get in their lifetime in terms of the risk of putting them in the hospital.""The Delta variant has fueled a rise incoronaviruscases, the number of new infections rising in all 50 states. Hospitalizations have also increased 36%, and deaths are up 26%. On Friday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said ""this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" as nearly all people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have not been inoculated.Even as the number of coronavirus cases spikes, Gottlieb said the U.S. is likely undercounting infections, as Americans who are younger and healthier, or those who are asymptomatic or have mild cases, may not get tested for COVID-19.""We're not doing a lot of routine screening right now,"" he said. ""Unless you work for the New York Yankees, you're not getting tested on a regular basis. So I think that this Delta wave could be far more advanced than what we're detecting right now in our ascertainment.""Gottlieb estimated the U.S. is picking up roughly 1-in-10 or 1-in-20 infections, and those who get tested for COVID-19 are either sicker or have ""telltale"" symptoms of the coronavirus, such as loss of taste or smell.To mitigate the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, some areas of the country havereimposed mask mandatesfor both unvaccinated and vaccinated people indoors. But Gottlieb said to protect against the variant, it's important for people to invest in high-quality face coverings, such as N95 masks.""Quality of mask is going to make a difference with a variant that spreads more aggressively like Delta does, where people are more contagious and exude more virus,"" he said ""Trying to get N95 masks into the hands of vulnerable individuals in places where this is really epidemic I think is going to be important, even in cases where they're vaccinated, if they want to add another layer of protection.""As the number of new coronavirus cases grows and vaccination rates flatten, the Biden administration has issued warnings about misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines that has proliferated on social media, which Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called a ""serious threat to public health.""Gottlieb said the most ""pervasive"" piece of misinformation related to the vaccine is that it will impact fertility, which he said is discouraging many young women from getting their shots.But Gottlieb it's not the vaccines, but contracting COVID-19 during pregnancy that can be dangerous.""I think every woman who's an expectant mom or a prospective mom should be talking to their doctor about getting vaccinated,"" he said.",2
421,"House Appropriations ‘Minibus’ Stuffed With Bad Policies, Overspending",16.67,29.67,https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/07/21/house-appropriations-minibus-bill-stuffed-with-problematic-policies-overspending/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-21,dailysignal,25,"The House is expected to vote later this week on H.R. 7608, a “minibus” bill that covers fiscal year 2021 spending for the departments of Agriculture, Interior, State, Veterans Affairs, and more. That covers four of the 12 spending bills that fund the federal government.Thebill’s text—produced on July 16—is a staggering 689 pages long, meaning that no representative’s office has had the time to properly vet it before the vote.The practice of voting on huge spending packages, common in both chambers for years, sacrifices transparency and accountability for the sake of political convenience.While any such legislative package is bound to contain flaws, this one is brimming with mistakes and ideological overreach on issues such as abortion, foreign policy, and welfare, and adds to our already skyrocketing national debt.Experts from The Heritage Foundation have highlighted a number of policy concerns that the House should address.The “minibus” package contains more than $37.5 billion in “emergency”-designated spending. Much of this spending is unjustified.Rather, it continues the use of the emergency spending designation toavertBudget Control Act spending caps for fiscal 2021.The Department of State/foreign operations bill provides $10 billion in emergency funds which,accordingto the House Appropriations Committee, would be used for global coronavirus preparedness, response, and relief.However, the bill designates only $2.5 billion of the funds directly to health programs. The bulk of the spending would go toward diplomatic programs, operating expenses, development programs, international disaster assistance, economic support, migration and refugee assistance, and the United Nations.The State Department should be working toward ensuring the health and safety of Americans abroad as the world continues to seek treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus.However, even of the $2.5 billion designated for global health programs, $800 million is being diverted to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, not the coronavirus. Much of the other funding is simply being used to expand the base operations budgets of various State Department programs.The Interior and Environment bill adds$15 billionin emergency funding for infrastructure projects for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Indian Health Service. Of that, $13 billion would go directly to the EPA for infrastructure grants.As with the State Department emergency funding, this money is not intended to fight the coronavirus or any other true emergency. It would be used to expand functions of the EPA that should be done within the existing agency budget, if at all. Much of the money would be spent in the form of grants to states for drinking water infrastructure, which should be addressed at the local, rather than federal, level.Finally, the bill provides $12.5 billion in emergency appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover rising health care costs.Providing quality health care (whether public or private) to our nation’s veterans is of the utmost importance. However, doing so by ignoring budget caps and fiscal responsibility sets a dangerous precedent.Congress must prioritize spending on a case-by-case basis to keep programs under control. Offsets, whether they come from within VA programs or other federal programs, should be the bareminimum requirementfor new spending initiatives.In2019, a total of $25.4 billion in emergency appropriations were enacted. This “minibus” alone would represent a 48% increase above that number.If all of the money was for fighting the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps it would be justified, but that’s not the case. Most of it is simply being used to expand existing government programs without retaining any sense of fiscal responsibility.The House is headed down a dangerous path and should reexamine the emergency provisions of this bill.The House Appropriations agriculture subcommittee has jurisdiction over funding one of the largestsafety netprograms; namely, food stamps.The goal of this program is to help millions of low-income Americans buy food. The committee used the appropriations bill to undermine commonsense reforms advanced by the Trump administration to safeguard the program.Section 733 of the appropriations bill seeks to permanently prohibit implementation of the administration’sAble-Bodied Adults Without Dependentsrule. This rule strengthened food stamp work requirements that only apply to work-capable individuals ages 18 to 49 who do not have children or other dependents in the home.During a recession, this work requirement rule will understandably not be implemented for this work-capable population. It’s only applicable when the state unemployment rate is below a 6% average for the most recent 24-month period. Inasmuch as the June unemployment rate was11.1%,no state will meet the unemployment threshold soon.Moreover, even if there hadn’t been a COVID-19 economic downturn, the number of work-capable individuals without dependents is a small fraction of the overall food stamp pool—about688,000among nearly 40 million food stamp beneficiaries.The bill would also permanently ban the Department of Agriculture’sStandard Utility Allowancerule in Section 734. That rule eliminates a loophole known as “Heat and Eat.”The way the loophole works is a bit convoluted. The amount of food stamps a household receives is based on its “countable” income (income minus certain deductions). State governments can game the system by sending households a tiny amount of money through a low-income energy assistance program, which makes the household eligible for more food stamps.The administration’s reform to stop this abuse was commonsense, and should remain in place.Finally, the House committee’s report language makes a “strong” recommendation against the administration’s proposed rule calledBroad-Based Categorical Eligibility. The rule would close a loophole that allows individuals to bypass food stamp eligibility rules. Current rules still allow millionaires to get food stamps.When Congress does pass a bicameral appropriations package, it should ensure that these provisions are not included. Instead, Congress should codify the president’s reforms and go beyond them to pursue statutorily fixing these serious issues that threaten the long-term integrity of the food stamp program.The House spending bill would exempt wine grapes, hops, pulse crops, and almonds from the Obama administration’s Food and Drug Administrationproduce safety rule. The rule wasdeeply flawedand ignored the plain language of the Food Safety Modernization Act that it was implementing.The law directs the FDA to regulate fruits and vegetables based on risk, but the FDA instead developed a rule that ignored the risk-based requirements of the law. Rather than directing the FDA to fix this flawed rule,Section 746of the House spending bill would create special carve-outs for certain commodities.That ignores the problems with the rule as it affects other commodities, and it creates a situation where organizations representing specific commodities have to lobby Congress for exemptions from coverage under a rule that they shouldn’t be subject to in the first place.Federal bloat: The House bill in general rejects measures to reduce the size and scope of government.For example, the House proposal consistently maintains or increases spending on EPA programs where the president’s budget largely reflected measures proposed to reduce or eliminate programs in the EPA that are better left to states, communities, and private individuals.The bill would also block healthy government reform by prohibiting any funds from being used to relocate, close, or consolidate any EPA office, laboratory, or facility.It also includes measures that would increase costs for American taxpayers on infrastructure projects, such as therequirementin Section 421 that all of the iron and steel work in projects using Safe Water Drinking Act grants be produced in the U.S.Cognitive dissonance on federal lands: The bill makes refreshing efforts to fund maintenance on federal lands and national parks. The National Park Service alone holds a backlog of $11.9 billion indeferred maintenance, and Congress historically has neglected prioritizing those projects.However, the bill neglects to address one of the troublesome roots feeding the systemic maintenance issue; namely, the federal government’s preference for buying new acreage, rather than stewarding what it already has.The primary tool for federal land purchases is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The bill presumes Congress will pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which, among other things, reprograms the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatory spending program of $900 million annually. Doing so delegates away Congress’ power of the purse to bureaucrats at the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service.Importantly, it appears that Congress has little ability to limit how much of the annual $900 million a presidential administrationcan spend. At least under the current structure as an appropriated program, Congress must debate which projects to support and how much to appropriate, and retains the option to later rescind certain funds.Nevertheless, the appropriations bill lays the groundwork for implementation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatory spending program and reinforces the preference to purchase an ever-growing list of lands rather than to save.For example, Section 425 states: “The Federal land acquisition project lists required by each Agency … shall total for each agency no less than 150 percent of the amount enacted for that agency for the previous fiscal year.”While the House’s attention to maintenance needs on federal lands is encouraging, one must wonder whether this newfound fervor will outlast the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a new permanent and mandatory spending program operating largely beyond the hands of Congress.Instead, Congress should be going in the opposite direction and reducing federal land ownership.The House spending bill also includes policy riders that would block EPA efforts to respect both the rule of law and principles of federalism, protect the environment, ensure the use of sound science, and increase transparency in government.Some of those riders would:. One of the mostegregiousabuses in the Obama administration’s EPA was promulgating its “mercury” rule without the agency being able tojustifythe purpose of the rule (i.e., reducing mercury and other hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants). The costs were as much as 2,400 times greater than the direct benefits.Instead, the agency justified the rule based onquestionableancillary (secondary)benefitsfrom reducing particulate matter, even though particulate matter had nothing to do with the purpose of the rule.To its credit, the Trump administration acted andfinalized a rulethat wouldn’t allow this type of regulatory abuse. Buried within the massive House spending bill is language that would undo this new rule and require the EPA to bless the Obama administration’s games with its mercury rule. (Seepage 94).. Under the Clean Water Act, states can use the Section 401certification processto ensure that state water quality will not be harmed by federally permitted activities.But what happens when statesabusethis process to address issues that have nothing to do with water quality? What happens when issues not related to water quality delay critical projects?  That has become a major problem.Last month, the EPAreleasedafinal rulethat would help to better clarify the Section 401 process andeliminatesome of those abuses.UnderSection 440of the House spending bill, the EPA would be prohibited from using funds to finalize, implement, or enforce what was the Section 401 proposed rule. Congress would allow states to continue blocking projects under the Clean Water Act even if the reasons have nothing to do with water quality.. It’s quite disturbing how some on the left want to ensure that the public doesn’t have proper information to evaluate the science used by the EPA.The Trump administration has proposeda rulethat wouldimprove transparency.Section 447of the spending bill would block funding for those efforts that wouldpromoteopen government and sound science.. Should the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers be able to regulate almost any water they want, including even regulating what most people would consider to be dry land?That’s what the Obama “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS)rulewould have done.The Trump administration gotrid ofthat rule andfinalized a rulethat did somethingdifferentwhen it comes to defining “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. It tried to follow the law.The Housereport(page 99) accompanying the spending bill includes language requiring the EPA to develop reports answering leading questions, with the apparent assumption the answers would make the Obama rule look better.It would do this by conveniently ignoring the rule of law, property rights, the state role in water protection under the Clean Water Act, and the vagueness problems that have undermined the Clean Water Act.. Another provision in the bill would prevent the EPA from finalizing the Trump administration’s right-sizing of the Obama-era standards that regulate oil and gas methane emissions.The U.S. has become the world’s leading oil and natural gas producer, providing affordable, reliable power to families and businesses. Resource extraction has created jobs across the country, and cheap natural gas is a critical reason why many energy-intensive manufacturers have chosen the U.S. as home.The Obama administration’s methane regulations were a costly solution in search of a problem. Producers have an incentive to capture and sell methane, the main component in natural gas, because it has economic value, yielding low-cost energy for consumers and reducing the U.S. allies’ dependence on Russian gas.Even the Obama administration’s EPA reported that methane emissions from the industry decreased despite the fact that energy production has skyrocketed.The State Department, foreign operations, and related programs appropriations bill passed by the House Appropriations Committee have several provisions that conservatives should be concerned about.Overall, the level of appropriations is $8.5 billion higher than for fiscal 2020, an increase of nearly 15%. In addition, the bill continues funding normal activities through Overseas Contingency Operations, rather than through the normal funding accounts—a mechanism originally set up to avoid spending constraints.With federal government spending at record, unsustainable levels, such an increase cannot be justified. Instead, appropriators should be seeking to better allocate existing resources.In addition, there are numerous parts of the bill that would change policy to the detriment of U.S. interests, including:Current law enacted in 1994 under then-President Bill Clinton restricts U.S. payments for U.N. peacekeeping to 25 percent of the total budget. The U.N., however, charges the U.S. nearly 28% of the peacekeeping budget.By permitting payment of “United States assessed contributions up to the amount specified in the Annex accompanying United Nations General Assembly document A/73/350/Add.1,” the House bill would override current law.That wouldremove pressureon the U.N. to reduce U.S. peacekeeping assessment to 25%.Currently, the U.S. withholds funding to the U.N. organizations for a number of reasons, including withholding 15% of funding if the secretary of state reports that the organization is not meeting legislatively specified transparency and accountability standards.The House bill would override those provisions and mandate full payment of U.S. assessments to U.N. organizations.Indeed, in the case of U.N. transparency and accountability, it would maintain the reporting requirement but eliminate the withholding. Withholding is a keypoint of leverageto press for reforms or, if necessary, to ensure that U.S. taxpayer funds do not support activities counter to the national interest. It must remain an option.Unless the secretary of state reports to Congress that funding does not support the national interest, funding will be renewed.The flaws of theHuman Rights Counciland theU.N. Relief and Works Agencyare well-established. Congress should put the onus on the organizations to reform and earn U.S. funding.The bill would prohibit funding for the International Criminal Courtinvestigation of Americansand allies, but allows “for technical assistance, training, assistance for victims, protection of witnesses, and law enforcement support related to international investigations, apprehensions, prosecutions, and adjudications of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.”That loophole sends at best mixed signals to an organization that is bent on investigating Americans even though the U.S. has never joined the court, nor acknowledged any jurisdiction over Americans.Regardless of what Congress thinks of the president’s decisions regarding the World Health Organization, it’s clear that the organization badly mishandled the COVID-19 response, particularly its willingness to unquestioningly echo statements and assertions from Beijing.The U.S. needs towork withother member states to try to reform the WHO or, if that proves unachievable, to forge an alternative mechanism to detect and respond to international pandemics.Providing funding in this way risks sending the message that the U.S. is not determined to reform this flawed institution.The bill sets an arbitrary staffing levelfar higherthan the average of the past two decades and bars the secretary of state from acting to “downsize, downgrade, consolidate, close, move, or relocate the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.”Both unreasonably limit the secretary of state’s ability to adjust the department to meet current needs and priorities.The U.S. decided to withdraw from the World Tourism Organization in 1995 after conducting a “comprehensive interagency assessment of U.S. membership in all of the international organizations to which it makes assessed contributions” and concluding that U.S. membership in it was among three organizations in which U.S. membership was least defensible.American taxpayersdeserve betterthan to have their money squandered again on this unnecessary organization.Unsurprisingly, House Democrats have moved to undo significant Trump administration pro-life policy achievements.Specifically, the committee-reported bill contains a one-two punch gutting “the Mexico City Policy,” which ensures that American taxpayers do not fund international organizations that perform and promote abortion overseas.The Mexico City Policy was first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Since then, the policy has been enforced by every Republican president and suspended by every Democratic president shortly after inauguration.Several months after reinstating the policy after taking office, President Donald Trumpexpandedthe policy—now known as “the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy”—to apply to even more funding streams than the original policy.Not only does the House bill contain language specifying that none of the funds appropriated under the bill can be used to enact the policy, it also inserts language from the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (Global HER) Act, which contains language that would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy.Additionally, the bill increases funding to the United Nations Population Fund and makes an underhanded attempt to weaken the administration’s ability to ensure that U.S. dollars do not support coercive family-planning practices abroad.In 2017, the Trump administration used its authority under the Kemp-Kasten Amendment towithholdfunding for the United Nations Population Fund due to the organization’s complicity in violating the rights of Chinese women and men by aiding the Chinese government’s draconian coercive population-control policies.First enacted in 1985 and included in every foreign appropriations bill since, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment authorizes the president to withhold federal funding from any organization that “supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.”Like the Mexico City Policy, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment has been invoked—or not—along administration party lines. In addition to funding the U.N. Population Fund despite the Trump administration’s determination to the contrary, the bill contains language that would weaken the administration’s ability to invoke Kemp-Kasten in the first place.: On spending, regulations, foreign policy, and the national safety net, the House “minibus” package requires extensive fixes. If the House passes the bill as is, the Senate should steadfastly oppose the myriad divisive policy riders that it contains.",1

That is because so many investors still have lots of cash to put to work, the head of the world’s largest asset managertold CNBCin a Tuesday interview.“Despite where the markets are in equities, we have not seen money being put to work,” Fink said. “We have record amounts of money in cash.”A meltup is often defined as a sharp and unexpected rise in the price of an asset class, driven largely by a stampede of investors who are more concerned about missing out on a big up move than by improving market fundamentals. Melt-ups are often followed by sharp market setbacks.After a steep fourth-quarter selloff that pushed the S&P 500SPX,+1.07%and the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA,+0.35%into corrections but stopped just short of a bear market — defined as a 20% drop from a recent peak — stocks have roared back. For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 15.9% and stands less than 1% below its all-time closing high of 2,930.75 set Sept. 20.Data from Lipper last week showed that U.S. equity funds saw $4.3 billion in inflows through the week ended April 10, but that followed a $19.7 billion outflow from the end of last year through April 3.Individual investors finally turn bullish, as stock market nears all-time highsThe stock-market rally so far this year has been partly attributed to a dovish shift by the Federal Reserve, which abruptly paused its policy tightening effort in January to adopt a wait-and-see approach after delivering four rate increases in 2018. Fed policy makers have signaled they expect no rate rises this year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank, which ended its bond-buying program at the end of last year, introduced a new round of bank stimulus in March in the face of renewed economic sluggishness.Fink said the dovishness of central bankers creates a shortage of “good assets,” which could serve as a trigger for a global melt-up in equity prices.BlackRock on Tuesday reporteda fall in first-quarter profitdue to a price-war that continues to ripple across the asset-management industry. Total assets under management rebounded to more than $6 trillion after slipping at the end of 2018.",1

424,The economic threats that could derail the Democrats' election dreams,7.67,37.0,https://theweek.com/articles/981286/economic-threats-that-could-derail-democrats-election-dreams,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,theweek,24,"Can Joe Biden ""reimagine and rebuild"" the American economy in just 550 days? Because that's how long it is until the 2022 midterm elections. And history suggests a good chance Democrats will lose their narrow control of Congress, most likely by losing the House. Then gridlock resumes. It's doubtful that Republicans will have much interest in helping Biden further become a ""transformational president"" by passing more wish-list items from the progressive agenda.Democrats surely understand the clock is ticking. But they also have to be hoping that the extraordinary power of the emerging economic boom might make the 2022 midterms an exception to the political pattern. Moody's Analytics, for example, recently revised its 2021 real GDP growth outlook to nearly 7 percent and to over 5 percent next year. ""If we are right,"" chief economist Mark Zandi told clients in a report, ""and there's good reason to believe we will be, this will be the strongest two years of growth since 1950-1951 at the height of the post-World War II economic boom."" And Moody's is hardly alone in predicting warp-speed GDP and job growth this year and next.So we're really off the map here. Who knows, not only might the Biden Boom keep the House and Senate in Democratic hands, it might also make a second Biden term (or a first Harris term, perhaps) a pretty good bet. And when you think about it, two presidential terms might be what Democrats need to pass key legislation and then make sure those programs survive during an era of extreme partisanship. Democrats are already trying to undo the Trump presidency wherever possible, such as attempting to partially reverse the Trump tax cuts, restore environmental rules, and rebuild America's trade relationship with Europe.Escape your echo chamber.

Putting aside the possibility of a dangerous new COVID-19 variant, perhaps the greatest risk to the recovery — and thus the Biden legacy — is how Washington is helping generate that recovery. The stimulus continues to flow even as consumers boost spending and businesses fully reopen. And some Democrats still don't think there's enough federal dough being spent, such as those who wantrecurringstimulus checks to be sent out and the $2.3 trillion Biden infrastructure plan to be a$10 trillion plan. As is, the tsunami of spending might yet boost inflation, resulting in surprise action from the Federal Reserve and an unexpected slowdown. Imagining pre-election recessions during the first terms of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama creates a pretty interesting game of ""what if"" alternate history with Presidents Mondale, Kerry, and Romney.An inflation surprise is hardly the only risk. While the recovery is currently generating gobs of jobs, the expansion will eventually slow. And it might slow faster than necessary thanks to generous jobless benefits that could potentially discourage work and create shortages. The $1.9 trillion COVID relief package last Marchextendedsupplemental benefits of $300 a month through early September. It’s an argument sure to gain momentum after Friday's wildly disappointing April jobs report that showed 266,000 net new jobs were created last month vs. a Wall Street forecast of a million or so. Now fat unemployment checks might not be the main reason for that undershoot. Home schooling, a lack of child care, virus fears, and data issues all might have played a role. But the report does suggest why some economists are worried about the labor-supply impact of impact of jobless benefits as the economy continues to gain strength in the coming months. A worker shortage would also add to the inflation threat. Again, many Democrats don't seem at all worried, at least so far. Late last month, nearly 40 Democrats on Capitol Hill sent the Biden White House a letter proposing ""more generous and long-lasting jobless benefits on a permanent basis,""accordingto the.Then there's the proposed tax increases, more than $3 trillion worth — including a record increase in capital gains tax rates. A nation's tax burden matters. How an economy is taxed matters. What is taxed matters. Tax rates matter. And although the economy didn't soar after the Trump tax cuts, the impact of the business tax cuts might have been offset by the Trump trade war.It is generally accepted, however, that tax rates affect how much and where a company invests. More investment makes workers more productive and will, over time, boost their wages. There's an economic risk that these proposed Biden tax increases will hurt investment. While many Wall Street banks have some pretty rosy economics forecasts, they are generally not incorporating any downside impact of the tax hikes. Those same firms are also, for the most part, assuming the economy returns to its modest pre-pandemic pace in 2023. So there could be less room for economic policy mistakes than it seems right now.And Democrats — pushing for more, more, more — should be worried a transformational presidency might just end up transitioning back to a Republican one.",1

While she left the soap in 2014, Smith returned briefly in 2016 for Whitney Dean and Lee Carter's wedding, before officially rejoining the soap in January 2018.Smith has also branched out as a musician, releasing her first album – Where My Heart Is – in 2017.Samba (8 + 8 + 8) = 24Tango (8 + 9 + 8) = 25American Smooth (8+7+9) =24Cha Cha (7+8+9) = 24Salsa (9+9+9) = 27Quickstep (9 + 10 + 10) = 29Jive (9 + 10 + 9) = 28Couple's Choice (10 + 10 + 10) + Viennese Waltz (9 + 10 + 10) = 59Maisie hit the ballroom floor running, managing to secure a second place spot on the leaderboard in her first week on the dance floor. She followed it up with the top spot on the leaderboard in Week Two and third place in Week Three.After surprisingly finding herself in the dance off in Week Four, Maisie bounced back in style the following weekend, with her memorable Salsa seeing her score 27 points – putting her in second place behind only Jamie and his partner Karen.The routine, danced to Better When I’m Dancing by Meghan Trainor, had all three judges unanimous in their praise. However, it wasn't enough to save Maisie from her second dance-off.The actress managed to beat Caroline Quentin and Johannes Radebe to keep her spot in the competition, but had to pull out all the stops in Week Six to make it through to the next live show.Did she and Gorka bring their A-game or what as they performed a Quickstep and bagged a near perfect score of 29 points!Smith has said for some time now that she really wanted to make it to Musicals Week, as she hoped to put on an epic performance inspired by an iconic stage show.Fortunately, she did indeed make it through after delivering a sensational routine based on Little Shop of Horrors, which earned her a very strong 28 points – including a perfect 10 from Shirley Ballas, who complimented her footwork.In the semi-final, Maisie smashed it with a street dance to Will Smith's Getting' Jiggy Wit It and earned straight 10s from the judges for a perfect 30.Despite receiving consistently high scores from the judges, she hasn't received the same acknowledgement from viewers at home when it comes to theStrictly vote.However,Maisie Smith’s rocky Strictly journey isn’t unprecedented, and although some viewers appear to have found it difficult to warm to contestants like Maisie – who have had some dance experience – she's very much needed on the series for it to work.Strictly 2020 isn't the first time Smith has taken to the ballroom – she competed in a Children in Need Strictly special last year and won with her professional partner Kevin Clifton.Speaking about joining the line-up for this year's competition, she said: “Get me in those sequins, I can’t wait to dive into the Strictly fancy dress box this winter! This is a dream come true.”",1

Witnesses described seeing Taliban fighters once detained at Herat’s prison freely moving on the streets.Meanwhile, a Twitter account attributed to Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadireported that Kandahar’s prisonhad been “completely conquered” after “a long siege and violent attacks.”“The personnel surrendered and all the prisoners were released,” the message added, giving no indication of what happened to the prison staff.Witnesses told the AP that the governor of Kandahar province and other officials fled the onslaught, catching a flight to Kabul.In all, the Taliban have captured 12 of the country’s 34 provincial capitals since beginning their latest offensive in May. One of those captured cities, Ghazni, sits on a major highway linking Kabul and Kandahar. Its fall effectively cuts off Ghani’s government from the southern provinces of Afghanistan.Ghazni provincial council member Amanullah Kamrani alleged that the provincial governor and police chief made a deal with the Taliban to flee after surrendering. Taliban video and photos purported to show the governor’s convoy freely passing by insurgents as part of the deal.The swiftness of the Taliban’s advance has led US officials to warn that the fall of Kabul could come within 30 to 90 days,according to the Washington Post. Thirty days from Thursday is the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America, as well as the initial date Bidengave for ending America’s combat missionin Afghanistan.Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon announced that 3,000 US troops would reinforce the more than 600 forces already working at or near the embassy, with press secretary John Kirby saying US officials didn’t want to “wait until it’s too late” to secure the safety of diplomatic personnel.Separately, the United Kingdom said 600 of its troops would be deployed on a short-term basis to support British nationals leaving the country. Late Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Canadian special forces would be sent to Kabul to help with the evacuation of embassy staff.CTV News reportedthat “sensitive documents” were being destroyed at the Canadian embassy in anticipation of an evacuation.The White House has insisted that Afghan security forces have all the manpower, equipment and training they need to stem the Taliban tide. But video clips of militants riding on American-made Humvees and pickup trucks with M-16s slung across their shoulders has led to recriminations in Washington.“Afghanistan is careening toward a massive, predictable, and preventable disaster,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement Thursday. “And the Administration’s surreal efforts to defend President Biden’s reckless policy are frankly humiliating.”“President Biden’s decisions have us hurtling toward an even worse sequel to the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975,” added McConnell, who urged Biden to commit more support to the Kabul government’s forces. “Without it, al Qaeda and the Taliban may celebrate the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by burning down our Embassy in Kabul.”At the United Nations, Reuters reported Thursday that a statement was being drafted by diplomats from Estonia and Norway that would condemn the Taliban attacks, threaten sanctions, and affirm the non-recognition of an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.In Qatar, where peace talks are ongoing, international envoys who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognize any government in Afghanistan “imposed through the use of military force.”",2

The Bethesda man had been found guilty in the fiery 2017 tunnel death of Silver Spring resident Askia Khafra. Beckwitt was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter, which the appeals court did not overturn. He will now face a new sentencing, and the ruling means that he could end up doing less time (he is currently serving a nine-year sentence).The bizarre case was chronicled in anin-depth 2019 Washingtonian story. Khafra died in a fire that broke out in a series of tunnels leading to a bunker underneath Beckwitt’s home. A budding entrepreneur, Khafra was working for Beckwitt at the time, digging tunnels with a pickax and shovel. He would eat, sleep, and use the restroom in the shaft as he clocked long hours.Unlike a straightforward homicide charge, a “depraved heart” murder describes a death that occurs due to an extreme disregard for human life. When the house caught fire, Khafra escaped the burrow network but never emerged from the basement’s rubble.

431,New unemployment officials reveal plans to get jobless in Nevada help,0.0,49.0,https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/new-unemployment-officials-reveal-plans-to-get-jobless-in-nevada-help-2097904/?itm_source=parsely-api,https://adfontesmedia.com/las-vegas-review-journal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,reviewjournal,24,"The new leaders tasked with managing the state’s unemployment crisis say they don’t know the extent of the claims backlog.But they’re 10 days in and working to find out — and tell everybody else, too.“We just really want to get a good sense of those and then be open and transparent and put it on the website. And every week we would update it,” said Barbara Buckley, head of the state’s new rapid-response effort aimed at working through the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation’s worst problems.Buckley and Elisa Cafferata, the new acting director of DETR, have their work cut out for them.Cafferata is the department’s third director since March, when Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered a statewide shutdown to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The previous two resigned. Cafferata’s immediate predecessor, Heather Korbulic, resigned June 19 out of fear for her safety.The department has been flooded with applications from Nevadans desperate for financial relief as the state’s jobless rate, just 3.6 percent in February, shot up to a staggering 30.1 percent in April before it tumbled the past few months, state and federal data shows.DETR reported that it had received nearly 621,000 new unemployment claims since the week ending March 14, when Sisolak ordered sweeping business closures to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The department reported roughly 398,000 additional claims for the benefits program for self-employed workers and independent contractors, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.“There are two systems with two sets of rules and a group of people eligible in one, a group of people eligible for another, and a third group of people eligible for both,” Cafferata said.She and Buckley represent the new leadership in the ongoing unemployment crisis. Their first priorities are to implement quick system fixes, bolster staffing and beat back fraud.System glitchesThey identified technical tweaks and a larger staff as immediate solutions to speed up claims processing.Buckley and Cafferata said they are looking for common denominators in claims that have been automatically flagged to find a way to move them along in bulk.“Let’s say, for example, we need a tax return filed for PUA, (and you can) say, ‘Just look, is it there? OK, boom. I’m going to do, what, a thousand in two days and get those moving,’ ” Buckley said.Technical fixes could allow for mass adjudication and faster approvals, she said.Other issues or categories could include early filers, people eligible for both PUA and traditional benefits and claims needing additional identity verification, Buckley said.Additionally, the state is identifying ways to increase staff through hiring or borrowing from state agencies. It has already identified 300 potential workers in the Department of Health and Human Services’ division of welfare and supportive services who are willing to work overtime for DETR.“We’re pushing on every lever we possibly can to help bring staffing resources in,” Cafferata said.She and Buckley said they are also hearing from retired employees with DETR’s employment security division who are interested in helping and wouldn’t require training.Buckley said she has recruited volunteers for the task force she is heading, including Anthony Pearl, general counsel for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas; Steve Fisher, administrator for the state’s welfare division; Vanessa Alpers, a longtime state employee; and Michael Schmidt, senior intelligence manager at Siemens.‘Fraud is not an excuse’DETR and state officials have pointed to rampant fraud as a significant roadblock to paying out claims. Many states are dealing with the same issues.Fraud is as big a problem as it’s made out to be, Buckley said, “conservatively” estimating 200,000 fraudulent benefits applications in Nevada. In court documents produced last month, DETR estimated that between 133,748 and 185,484 possibly fraudulent jobless claims have been filed.“Fraud is not an excuse to not pay eligible folks, but they clog up the pipeline,” Buckley said. “And they cause staff to spend time they shouldn’t be spending on claims when you have an eligible, deserving Nevadan waiting.”The state brought aboard Bill Strong, the former chief fraud investigator in the state’s welfare agency, to help “build out” DETR’s fraud unit, Cafferata said. That will take some time to do, but in the meantime, the department is working with the offices of the U.S. attorney and the state attorney general to combat and prosecute bogus claims.Additionally, the state recently approved language for an automated response that will go out to those who report fraud.The response details next steps for possible fraud victims and assures them that their report has been received, Buckley said. Buckley said the state is compiling fraud data and will release that to the public.DETR will work to be responsive to the public in its work, but Cafferata said she knows that the strongest way to regain the trust of a frustrated public is to pay claims.“Our goal is to pay everybody who is legally eligible and then do a better job of communicating with folks if they don’t meet (those) requirements,” she said.Contact Mike Shoro atmshoro @reviewjournal.comor 702-387-5290.

But many are concerned that might be the next step.Pavelski said, “It could affect the church. If it gets to the point where you are saying that when you talk about Christian viewpoints and it is considered to be too offensive. That could be the case.”There would be a big reason the big tech firms out there would censor Christianity in America.“These Twitter accounts, Facebook, whatever the social media is not owned by Christians,” Pavelski said. “It’s not a Christian company. So, you cannot expect them to act in any kind of a Christian manner. That, that’s just the way it is.”There is also another reason the church is on the lookout for possible big tech censorship.“Maybe people who would say that that some of the things that the Christians talk about would be inappropriate,” said Pavelski. “It would be what some would consider hate speech.”As of now, Pavelski said the attack on Christianity has not grown too out of control in America.“I haven’t seen anything compared to any kind of attack on Christians like it has been in the first century, where Christians are fed to the lions. There aren’t any Christians being fed to lions in the United States that I know of.”Pavelski also notes that Christians are persecuted in other parts of the world, including those with a one-party system.",1

It's the most sweeping vaccine mandate the federal government has yet announced.""Have at it,"" the president retorted during a school visit Friday morning when a reporter asked if the new requirements constitute overreach and could be confronted with legal challenges.Mr. Biden also criticized some GOP governors' resistance to vaccine mandates and mask requirements —""this isn't a game,"" he said.Republicans who have threatened to sue include Governors Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Brian Kemp of Georgia.""South Dakota will stand up to defend freedom. @JoeBiden see you in court,"" Noem tweeted.""I will pursue every legal option available to the state of Georgia to stop this blatantly unlawful overreach by the Biden administration,"" Kemp tweeted.The Republican National Committee has also pledged to sue, although it said in a statement it won't take legal action until Mr. Biden's new executive orders go into effect.""Joe Biden told Americans when he was elected that he would not impose vaccine mandates,"" RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""He lied. Now small businesses, workers, and families across the country will pay the price. Like many Americans, I am pro-vaccine and anti-mandate. Many small businesses and workers do not have the money or legal resources to fight Biden's unconstitutional actions and authoritarian decrees, but when his decree goes into effect, the RNC will sue the administration to protect Americans and their liberties.""The rule affecting private companies will be developed by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which regulates the safety of workplace environments.

The speech is expected to take place in Milwaukee, although details are not confirmed.A keynote address is scheduled for Aug. 18, the same night of the presidential roll call, which will be conducted virtually.The convention will open Aug. 17, with committee reports on credentials, rules and the platform, and select speakers.Convention planners also confirmed that former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will participate, although where they'll be speaking from has not been announced.There will also be a tribute to the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis. That spot is being produced by Dawn Porter, who was the producer-director of ""John Lewis: Good Trouble.""Delegates have been asked not to attend the event in person because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. They are casting ballots remotely, beginning next week.Members of Congress have also been told not to travel to Milwaukee.Democrats are calling this a ""Convention Across America,"" featuring speeches and events from other sites, with Milwaukee anchoring the proceedings.This convention is anything but typical. Normally at a party gathering, meetings are well-attended during the day with the delegates gathering for several hours nightly to listen to speeches.The 1872 Democratic Convention in Baltimore is reputedly the shortest on record,clocking in at six hours over two days.This year's event is in essence an abbreviated event at an unprecedented time.Top Democrats were named to the convention leadership, led by honorary chairs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi was named permanent convention chair.U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, who helped bring the event to the city, will be the sergeant-of-arms.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the permanent co-chairs of the convention, with Gov.

Gavin Newsom — ahead of Caitlyn Jenner — in a recall election this September.Elder leads at 16% in a newEmerson College/Nexstar Media poll.Elder, a 69-year-old Republican, is followed by businessman John Cox, at 6%, and former San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer, at 6%. California State Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, and Jenner are at 4% each, according to the poll.The poll found that 48 percent of voters still want Newsom to remain in office but the number of people who want him out is increasing. Forty-three percent of people polled now say they will vote to recall Newsom — up from 38 percent in March. A majority of voters say they don’t know yet who they’d want if Newsom is booted from office.Elder has a nationally syndicated talk show and is a frequent guest on Fox News. He calls himself the “Sage of South Central”on his website, a reference to where he grew up in LA.Former Fox News anchor and now podcaster Megyn Kelly is a fan, frequently tweeting out “LARRY!” on her feed.Elder said Newsom’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic is why he decided to run.“The arrogance of Gavin Newsom was crystalized by the way he handled this pandemic,” Elder told theSacramento ObserverFriday.“This man has presided over the most severe coronavirus lockdown in all 50 states. People lost their jobs, people lost their livelihoods, meanwhile his own private business kept open and his own kids remained in in-person private schools,” he said.Elder says he’s not focusing on other candidates.“The target is Newsom,” he said. “If he isn’t recalled, it doesn’t matter. I intend to be the person that you write down or you check off for who you want as a replacement when you recall this guy. He’s going.”Elder said he’s not normally in favor of recalls or impeachments.“But when someone has become so outrageous, sometimes something has to be done,” he said.The recall effort against Newsom, launched in January 2020, gained strength due to the governor’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the closure of schools and businesses even as Newsom himself was photographedviolating state restrictionson indoor gatherings.",1

Buttigieg has recently returned to making TV appearances as the country deals with a growingsupply chain crisisand as a pair of infrastructure bills backed by the White House are jeopardized bytwo Democratic senators demanding less spendingon domestic programs.ConservativesquestionedButtigieg’s absence and, after Politico’s report on Thursday, mocked his decision to take leave to spend time with his newborn babies. Carlson, for his part, just resorted to straight-up homophobia.“Paternity leave, they call it,” Carlson said during his Thursday night broadcast. “Trying to figure out how to breastfeed, no word on how that went.”This is not the first instance of Carlson being homophobic. Last year, a tweet went viral showing Carlson’s entry in his college yearbook joking that he was a member of the “Dan White Society,” a reference to the San Francisco city supervisor whoassassinated pioneering gay politician Harvey Milkin 1978.As critics pointed out, Fox News offers parental leave to its employees as well. Todd Piro, a co-host of early morning show,wrote an op-ed earlier this yeartalking about his experience on leave after becoming a father, and praising the network for offering six weeks of parental leave.“I cannot thank Fox enough for providing all fathers who work here with such a generous paternity leave. This experience has changed me in a profound way and in ways I won’t fully comprehend until my daughter is older,” he wrote. “But for now—that smile coming from the crib each morning, immediately followed by morning snuggles—is what I will cherish the most. There is nothing better.”Carlson wasn’t the only prominent right-winger to criticize Buttigieg’s parental leave. Sen.

While the complex is connected, it is not the area where the breach actually occurred.https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1357047129911492619?s=20AOChas claimed that the eventthat she experienced was a “near-death” experience. In her recount of the events, she said she felt she was mere moments away from dying. She shared she had security concerns while she was in a room with other members of Congress.Except none of that appears to be true. She appears to have been in her office, away from the events entirely.AOC was quick to respond to the new reports. She made statements about the reports on Twitter.People were trying to rush and infiltrate our office buildings – that’s why we had to get evacuated in the first place.The attempts of attackers & publicly available communications show how they tried to gain access and share location info on finding members for physical harm.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)February 3, 2021She states that the reports are examples of the manipulative right and that no one understands the layout of the Capitol complex.

Rioters never breached the Cannon building.She also claims that Trump supporters planted bombs around her offices. While those bombs were relocated outside the RNC and DNC offices, neither of those are located in the Cannon building.

What a joke,” Morgan tweeted. “Just admit you did badly, made mistakes, and will strive to do better next time. Kids need strong role models not this nonsense.”Biles, 24,saidTuesday she wasn’t in the right frame of mind entering the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and found herself “fighting all of those demons” once the action got underway. She removed herself from Tuesdays events and watched as her teammates won the silver medal in the team competition. Biles could return for the gymnastics all-around competition Thursday.Tennis starNaomi Osaka, a medal favorite who wasdefeatedTuesday, cited the preservation of her own mental health for withdrawing from the French Open in April and skipping Wimbledon in June. While both Biles and Osaka have been widely praised for speaking out about the importance of mental well-being, one Twitter user suggested comments like Morgan’s are what lead people with problems to remain silent.“When someone takes their own life, the amount of times you hear ‘if only they’d reached out,’ but when someone speaks out about their mental health you get tweets like this,”tweetedone person sympathetic to Biles.Others debated to what extent Biles’ performance was caused by her mental state and vice versa. Some people agreed with Morgan.“Why are you so spot on 100% of the time??” a fan of the 56-year-old pundit tweeted.Jamaican gymnast Danucia Francis found Biles’ decision majestic and said called her the Greatest of All Time.“Don’t know about you but I think Simone Biles just empowered everyone to put their mental well-being above everything else,” she tweeted. “WHAT A QUEEN. GOAT in more ways than one.”Former Team USA Olympian and gold medalist Kerri Strug sent her support Biles too.“Sending love to you Simone Biles,” she tweetedMorgan wasn’t finished — nor were his critics.“Athletes are now deemed more courageous, inspiring & heroic if they lose or quit then if they win or tough it out, which is ridiculous,” he later added on Twitter. “I blame Twitter’s virtue-signallers for fuelling this culture of celebrating weakness. The real world doesn’t think like that.”That comment was replied to with video of Morgan walking off the set of “Good Morning Britain” andquittingthe show following a tense exchange with a colleague in March.

If after 10 months, knowing what we know now, people still don’t have a lot of confidence in the ability to patronize a business safely, well the only solution is a vaccine. And what we’re seeing is that half of Texas is not sure if they’re getting a vaccine and they’re concerned about the safety of it.”Blank added that this is something that every level of government, businesses and “really anyone who’s willing” needs to begin getting this message out if Texans want the state to have a strong recovery from the pandemic.Texas Lyceum is a nonprofit and nonpartisan Texas organization that conducts an annual poll in order to better understand public opinion. The survey polled 1,200 adults in the state from Jan. 8-17, 1,000 of which were contacted by live interviews over the phone.They also conducted an additional 200 online interviews of unregistered adults. Out of the 1,200 respondents, 835 self reported as registered voters.Immigration and border security were the state’s top concerns in 2020, but fell out of the top five in 2021 as the pandemic, political disruption, health care, the economy and unemployment rounded out the top five problems facing Texas, according to the survey.When it comes to both the national and state economy, the survey found that this is something Texans’ outlook is undoubtedly bleak on. Only 24% of respondents said they believe the state economy is better off than the national economy compared to 40% of Texans who said the national economy is in a better place than Texas’.Daron Shaw, the founder of the poll, pointed out that these numbers are a dramatic change from the poll’s findings in the midst of the Great Recession.“If you go back to 2009 at the height of the last great recession, 64% of respondents said that they felt the Texas economy was better off than the national economy,” Shaw said. “So for me, the standout result from this poll is that Josh and I refer to the bullishness that Texans have with respect to how Texas is handling things.”That bullishness is not quite as evident now in response to the pandemic and the economic consequences of the pandemic as it was back in 2009, Shaw said.Additionally, only 15% said their family’s economic standing has improved over the previous year and just 34% of Texans believe their children will be better off economically in the future than they are currently.When broken down by race, the poll showed that Hispanics (60%) were more likely to know somebody who has died from COVID than white (41%) and Black (40%) respondents.When it comes to confidence regarding job status, 57% of white Texans said they are very confident that they will be employed at the end of the year, though that number dropped to 42% for Hispanic Texans and 36% for Black Texans.Additional challenges for Texans with children under the age of 18 were also revealed in the survey. Aside from the increase in caregiving responsibilities, Texas caregivers also face the conundrum of whether or not to send children to school during the pandemic.Only 32% of adults with children at home said they feel safe sending their kids to school, 21% lower than parents who said they don’t feel safe doing so.White caregivers (44%) felt the safest in sending children to school, compared to 27% of Black caregivers and 23% of Hispanic caregivers.The overall margin of error on the survey is +/- 2.83 %",1
442,"No, Tucker Carlson Didn’t Reveal Evidence of Mass Voter Fraud in Georgia",-2.0,48.33,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tucker-carlson-georgia-voter-fraud/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,snopes,25,"Six months after a disinformation campaign pushed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlsontook to his showto again promote similar claims.In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstood scrutiny. Trump's own Department of Homeland Securitystatedthat the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the most secure in American history."" Georgia's ballots have been counted three times.None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or his supporters were successful in court and in fact, Trump's attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law licensesuspendedfor spreading election lies.Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them.The segment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or are statements based on supposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson's employer, Fox News,arguedin a court case that Carlson's show shouldn't be viewed as factual.)During his July 14 primetime show, Carlson stated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It's true.""Carlson's July 14 segment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA. The group supports Trump's false claims of massive election fraud and hasembarkedon a search for evidence of said fraud.Here's how Georgia Public Broadcastingdescribedthe group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia's elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia's old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has alsoquestionedthe authenticity of events surrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy theories about former President Bill Clinton and theassassination of John F. Kennedyand is now serving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election.We will now look at the claims Carlson made on his show.The segment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarm sounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlsonstated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clock surveillance by both private security and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office.Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-pound steel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- but someone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts.By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? We still don't know.In fact, we do know.Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from astorythat explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door.Fowlerreportedin June 2021 that the alarm didn't come from the area where ballots were secured.""The source of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the county said a test showed that alarm is audible from where the private security officers were stationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement.Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff's officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it themselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report.Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But there's no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia's official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times,"" Carlson stated. In this segment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellow shirt in a video he said was obtained by VoterGA.But that video doesn't prove that the state's election results were falsified by ballots scanned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia's election results were recounted after the election,including by hand. That means that if any ballots were scanned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recountsin the hand counts of the ballots.The video used by Carlson was from a surveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigatorslooked intoallegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing.The closest Carlson came to offering an independent source for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doing so, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematic source on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution's report. Carlson stated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that the strongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated.The AJC didn't report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. Itreportedthat ""nearly 200"" ballots were scanned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images themselves, further reported:The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots inballot imagesobtained under the Georgia Open Records Act andposted online.Although it's true that a small number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlson stated, the amount wouldn't have changed the outcome of the presidential election.The source for this assertion is a July 13news releaseposted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches.""This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from theinitialelection machine count to ballot batches from the state's manualrecountand audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath.But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we don't know how election workers sorted and counted ballots.But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. Theofficial resultscame from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count.Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" who stated she saw mail-in ballots without creases on them.""That's strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed.Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in aninterviewpublished Jan. 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and his supporters:TRUMP’S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted “pristine” ballots — meaning ballots that weren’t folded, indicating that they hadn’t arrived in an envelope.STERLING’S EXPLANATION: “Pristine” ballots aren’t unusual, Mr. Sterling said. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots aren’t the right size for scanners, so election workers have a standard process for transferring the votes to scannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and can’t be scanned may be transferred in the same way.""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12storypublished by thepro-Trumpwebsite The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it doesn't link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the U.S. Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county.But The Federalist admitted the reason for this isn't known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:While some of those nearly 35,000 voters may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily—situations which do not affect an individual’s residency for purposes of election law—everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we are seeing from Davis’ further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, thereby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent.Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is pure supposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Postreportedthat ""If true — again, this is unproven third-party analysis — it’s illegal in the sense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in the sense that you’re driving a stolen car.""",2
443,How You Can Help Get Justice for Breonna Taylor's Death,-5.0,46.67,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a32477844/breonna-taylor-police-shooting-kentucky/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-04,elle,17,"At the end of 2020, Louisville Metro PD reportedly notified two officers, who were involved in the death of Breonna Taylor, of their termination. Detective Myles Cosgrove, one of the officers who shot Taylor, and Detective Joshua Jaynes, who helped plan the raid, have now both officially been fired. A Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson confirmed the news, viaNPR.According to the outlet, interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry signed the letters of termination. On the same day, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced that Erika Shields will be LMPD's next police chief following her role as Chief of the Atlanta PD.Both Jaynes, whoreportedlysupplied false information in the search warrant, and Cosgrove, who fired dozens of rounds into Taylor's home, have 10 days to appeal their termination. Cosgrove and Jaynes have both been on paid administrative reassignment since March 13th. Previously, a grand jury indicted only officer Brett Hankison, who was charged with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment and fired in June.On Friday, the Kentucky attorney general’s office released recordings of the grand jury proceedings in theBreonna Taylor case. There is roughly 15 hours of audio in the recordings, but asnoted, the statements or recommendations from prosecutors to jurors about what charges the officers should receive were not included in the recordings.Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky attorney general who handled the case said the statements  ""were not recorded, as they are not evidence."" The Times reports that Cameron insists the jurors were given ""all the evidence.""The recordings come after a jurorspoke outabout why no one received a direct charge in the case.More than six months after police shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her Kentucky apartment, a Jefferson County grand jury decided to indict one of the three officers involved. Former officer Brett Hankinson has been charged with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment, a Class D felony in the state,for shooting into a neighboring apartment. As the New Yorkclarifies, none of the officers involved were charged for causing Taylor's death, and according toThe Appeal, a Class D felony is punishable by between one and five years in prison.Taylor, who worked as an emergency medical technician, was in her Kentucky apartment with her boyfriend when police attempted what has beenreferred toas a “botched” search warrant execution. Her family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and hired Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney who is also representing the families ofGeorge FloydandAhmaud Arbery. Thereports that the city will pay Taylor's family a $12 million settlement in the lawsuit, said to be the largest in the city's history and one of the top in U.S. history. Crumphad previously calledfor charges of second-degree manslaughter in Taylor's case and has sincesaidthe indictment is ""outrageous and offensive.""Prior to the grand jury's announcement, the Louisville mayorannounceda countywide curfew, and the interim chief of policedeclareda state of emergency for the Louisville Metro Police Department. Across the nation,protestors had preparedfor the announcement, setting up events in various cities.Now, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said that on Wednesdayhe will be releasing the recordingfrom the grand jury proceedings in Taylor's case. The decision comes after an anonymous grand jury member in the case filed a motion to have the records released; the judge at Hankinson's hearing also ordered that the recording be entered into the court record.Back in May, Crump told“They’re killing our sisters just like they’re killing our brothers, but for whatever reason, we have not given our sisters the same attention that we have given to Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Stephon Clark, Terence Crutcher, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Laquan McDonald. Breonna’s name should be known by everybody in America who said those other names, because she was in her own home, doing absolutely nothing wrong.” He continued, “Ifyou ranfor Ahmaud, you need to stand for Bre.”Below, what you need to know about Taylor’s case, her family's settlement from the city, and how you can help right now.In the early morning, police officers came to Taylor’s apartment where she was asleep with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker. According to the, police had a warrant to search Taylor’s apartment as part of a drug investigation, though the family’s lawsuit states the suspect in the investigation had already been detained at the time of the search. Police believed one of the suspects was using Taylor’s apartment to “receive mail, keep drugs, or stash money earned from the sale of drugs,” per theLouisville Courier-Journal.The suitstatesTaylor and Walker believed the plainclothes police were breaking into the apartment since they entered “without knocking and without announcing themselves as police officers.” A judge had signed a “no-knock” provision for the police, meaning they were able to go into Taylor’s apartment without identifying themselves, thoughpolice claimthey did. Walker shot at a police officer in what he says was self-defense. Police then fired into the apartment, hitting Taylor. The suit says Taylor was unarmed and Walker had a license to carry. The lawsuit filed by Taylor’s family also states that neighbors have confirmed the police did not knock or identify themselves before entering. An FBI ballistics lab later found that Myles Cosgrove was the officer to fire the fatal shot at Taylor, thereports. However, a state ballistics test ""was inconclusive.""One officer was shot in the leg, and Walker was arrested andchargedwith assault and attempted murder of a police officer. Prosecutors have sincedismissedthe charges. Thereports that no drugs were found in the apartment, and Taylor and Walker had no prior criminal history or drug convictions.New audio was released in July, revealing interviews with police and Walker,per. In the interview, Walker is heard recounting the night of March 13th and the events that led to his girlfriend's death.""It's a loud boom at the door,"" he said. ""First thing she said was, 'Who is it?' No response. We both get up, start putting on clothes, another knock at the door. She's like, 'Who is it?' Loud, at the top of her lungs. No response. I grab my gun, which is legal, like I'm licensed to carry, everything. I've never even fired my gun outside of a range. I'm scared to death."" He added that Taylor yelled ""at the top of her lungs"" again to ask who was there. ""No response, no anything."" He said Taylor put on clothes to answer the door, but then it came ""off the hinges.""He continued: ""I just let off one shot. Like, I still can't see who it is or anything. So now the door's, like, flying open. I let off one shot, and then all of a sudden there's a whole lot of shots and we like we both just dropped to the ground.""In an interview, Sgt. Mattingly, who broke down Taylor's door with officers Cosgrove and Hankison, said: ""The first banging on the door, [we] did not announce."" He said, ""I think after that we did. ... After that, each one of them said, 'Police, come to the door. Search warrant. Police, search warrant.'""In his interview, Walker said he did not hear this: ""All I can hear is a knock at the door."" He said, ""Even if somebody was saying something on the other side, you probably couldn't hear them. But as loud as we were screaming to say who it is, I know whoever will be on the other side of the door could hear us.""In June, Mayor Greg Fischerconfirmedthat Hankison, one of the three officers, would be fired from the Louisville Metro Police. The other officers involved are on administrative reassignment.""I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,"" the department's interim police chief, Robert Schroeder,wrote in a letterto Hankison. ""I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. The result of your action seriously impedes the Department's goal of providing the citizens of our city with the most professional law enforcement agency possible. I cannot tolerate this type of conduct by any member of the Louisville Metro Police Department. Your conduct demands your termination."" Schroeder also added in his letter that Hankison had been disciplined for reckless conduct in early 2019. According to the, Hankison appealed his firing but the hearing will be delayed until a criminal investigation is completed.Fischer named new interim police chief Yvette Gentry on September 27th, the first Black woman to serve as Louisville's police chief, perWDRB. She'll replace former police chief Schroeder, who is retiring. ""This is going to signal some change. A new day is coming,"" Gentry said at a press conference,CNNreports. She'll hold the position for no more than six months and hasn't applied for the job permanently. The mayor also said body cameras will now be required when executing a search warrant, and there will be a new civilian review board for ""police disciplinary matters,"" according to the.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear had said the local prosecutor, state attorney general, and federal prosecutor assigned to the region should review the results of the police investigation.reports: “On June 29, the Louisville Metro Council also announced a resolution to investigate the actions of Mayor Greg Fischer and his administration surrounding Taylor’s death.”In regards to the grand jury's decision, on September 28, an anonymous grand jury member filed a motion to have the jury's records and sealed transcripts released, according toNBC News. The anonymous juror also asked for permission to speak publicly about the proceedings.In the motion, the grand juror states that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron ""attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to them,"" though the jurorswere not offeredthe option to charge the other two officers. The motion states, ""Using the grand jurors as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for these decisions only sows more seeds of doubt in the process while leaving a cold chill own the spine of future grand jurors.""Previously,Cameron had said in a news conferencethat the grand jury agreed with his team's investigation, saying, ""While there are six possible homicide charges under Kentucky law, these charges are not applicable to the facts before us because our investigation showed, and the grand jury agreed, that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in the return of deadly fire after having been fired upon.""After Hankinson pleaded not guilty this Monday, the judge at his hearingalso orderedthat the grand jury recording be entered into the court record. (Taylor's family hadalso previously askedfor the grand jury details to be released.) Shortly after the motion was filed, Cameronannouncedhe would release the recordings on Wednesday and that the juror was free to share ""their thoughts on our presentation.""TheNew YorkTimesreportsthat Elizabeth Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said in a statement, ""Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.""Taylor’s family filed a lawsuit accusing the officers of wrongful death, excessive force, and gross negligence, according toWashington Post. It was reported on September 15 byLouisville Courier-Journalreports that the city of Louisville will pay a $12 million settlement to the Taylor family. ""I am deeply, deeply sorry for Breonna's death,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a press conference, surrounded by the Taylor family and their lawyers, per the outlet.The settlement also hasmultiple police reform mandates, including a demand that all search warrants be approved with a judge prior to their use by officers. Other measures include the establishment of a housing credit program to motivate officers to live in the areas they serve over and the utilization of social workers on specific police runs. ""The city's response in this case has been delayed and it's been frustrating, but the fact that they've been willing to sit down and talk significant reform was a step in the right direction and hopefully a turning point,"" attorney Sam Aguilartold CNN.Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said the settlement is only one step in the continued pursuit of justice for Breonna.""Her beautiful spirit and personality is working through all of us on the ground, so please continue to say her name: Breonna Taylor,"" Palmer said of her daughter, viaCNN.In early June, the Louisville Metro Council's Public Safety Committeeapproveda new ordinance called ""Breonna's Law"" that would make it so ""no-knock"" warrants could only be sought if there's ""imminent threat of harm or death"" and would also be limited to ""offenses including murder, hostage-taking, kidnapping, terrorism, human trafficking and sexual trafficking,"" per the.On June 11th, all 26 members of the Louisville Metro Councilvotedto pass the ban, which prohibits any search warrant that doesn't require police to verbally announce themselves and their purpose at the property. ""Breonna's Law"" also states that any Louisville Metro Police Department or Metro law enforcement must knock and wait a minimum of 15 seconds for a response, according toNBC News. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischersignedthe ordinance on June 12th.After the ordinance was passed, Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer said, ""I'm just going to say that Breonna, that's all she wanted to do was save lives. So with this law, she'll get to continue to do that,"" perNBC News.Nearly three months after Taylor's death, the Louisville Police Department released a four-page incident report from March 13th. You canread the report here, although there isn't much to see—and what's there runs contrary to what we know about the night Taylor was killed by police.The report details the location (with partially redacted address), age (with redacted birth date), and full name of the victim. (Thenotes that both Taylor's address and date of birth have been ""widely reported"" already.) Charges are listed as ""death investigation — LMBD involved."" Mattingly, 47; Cosgrove, 42; and Hankison, 44 (ages reported via theCourier-Journal) are listed as the three officers who fatally shot Taylor. Hankison is alsoundergoing a sexual assault investigationafter allegations by at least two women.Beyond that, rows of information are left blank and there are two major inaccuracies regarding the night Taylor was killed. The department's report lists her injuries as ""none,"" even though she was shot at least eight times by the officers. The ""no"" box is checked under ""forced entry,"" even though police are believed to have used a battering ram to break through Taylor's door.According to the, the Louisville police department blamed discrepancies on the reporting program. A statement from the department said, ""Inaccuracies in the report are unacceptable to us, and we are taking immediate steps to correct the report and to ensure the accuracy of incident reports going forward.""After the grand jury decision, Taylor’s sister Ju’Niyah Palmerposted an Instagramof her and Breonna with the caption: ""sister i am so sorry 🥺"" She also wrote on her Instagram Story: ""sister, you was failed by a system you worked hard for and i am so sorry""In a May 2020 interviewwith the, Taylor’s mother Tamika Palmer said she first found out something was wrong when she got a call from Walker, who said he thought someone was trying to break into the apartment. He then said, “I think they shot Breonna.”“I want justice for her,” Tamika said. “I want them to say her name. There’s no reason Breonna should be dead at all.”Tamika also told thethat Taylor was working on plans for her future: ""She had a whole plan on becoming a nurse and buying a house and then starting a family. Breonna had her head on straight, and she was a very decent person.""In a separate interview with the, Ju’Niyah said: “She was my person. I was her shadow.” She said, “Mostly at night is when I can really think, and I have moments—like, I’ll cry, but I haven’t grieved it, if that makes sense. I still don’t want to face it.”Writer Cate Young started the #BirthdayForBreonna campaign,compiling a list of action itemspeople can do to commemorate Taylor's life. Young told Refinery29, ""Very often when we have these moments where these stories [of police violence] bubble up, it's usually because several cases happen in a short proximity of time, and when women are involved their names get erased. . . It was frustrating because her life mattered, too, and I wanted to make sure that we were acknowledging that she deserves justice just as much.""AChange.org petitioncalling for justice in Taylor's death was signed by 11.4 million people, the second highest number ever for a petition on the site, according toCNN.Here, just some of the other ways you can help get justice for Breonna Taylor:According to the, Louisville Metro Council member Bill Hollander said he has received thousands of messages to his email and that his voicemail fills up multiple times a day with people asking to fire and charge the officers involved. Governor Beshear has also reportedly received thousands of emails, voice messages, and cards.Some Louisville activists have also taken more extreme measures in their fight for justice, includinggoing on a hunger striketo demand all three officers are fired and stripped of pension benefits.

444,Gun Shops Flouted State Closure Orders in April as Industry Notched Another Big Month,-7.0,48.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/coronavirus-gun-sales-state-closures-background-checks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-14,thetrace,16,"Gun stores in several states have defied orders to close their doors as the coronavirus pandemic drives historic demand for firearms, according to background check data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interviews with shop owners.Governors of five states — Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington — ordered gun dealers to close in April under statewide stay-at-home directives. But FBI data from April shows that dealers in those states initiated tens of thousands of gun background checks. In Washington State, where gun shops were shuttered by a March 25 stay-at-homeorder, 42,000 checks were initiated in April.Some businesses sell guns in addition to food and other household items that have been deemed essential — Walmart and hardware stores may have firearms departments, for example. At least two of the five states — Michigan and New York — permit these stores to continue selling guns under their orders, which may explain a portion of the checks in the FBI’s data. However, big-box stores typically account for only afractionof all gun sales. And phone calls to more than 50 dedicated gun dealers confirmed that many remained open in defiance of state orders to close.During April, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 2.9 million checks, making it the fourth highest month on record, dating back to 1998. The Trace compared the number of background checks for handguns, long guns, and transactions involving both types of gun with the same figures for 2019. Our analysis found that in some of the states where stores were ordered closed, dealers conducted more checks in April 2020 than during the same month in 2019. In Washington State, for instance, checks increased 45 percent over April 2019, and in New Mexico, they increased 15 percent.In Michigan, checks increased by 112 percent, but at least part of the surge may be attributed to a March 3rulingby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a spokesperson for the Michigan State Police. That ruling said that firearms dealers cannot accept a Michigan-issued concealed carry permit in lieu of conducting a background check, meaning that gun transfers to permit holders, which were previously not counted in the FBI data, are now included.Anthony Coulson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is an expert on the background check system, said the increased gun sales rendered states’ stay-at-home orders “meaningless.”“What’s the motivation for implementing a nonessential order if it’s not going to be enforced and has no impact?” Coulson asked.The two states that didn’t register any year-over-year increase in firearm background checks were New York and Massachusetts. In New York, the number of checks hovered just below normal levels. In Massachusetts, background checks saw a significant year-over-year decrease, falling 66 percent.Store owners offered a litany of reasons they are violating the orders. Some considered them a breach of their Second Amendment rights. Some felt emboldened by a March 28 revision to Department of Homeland Security guidance that deemed the gun industry an essential business during the pandemic.The DHS guidance, which is nonbinding, was heavily pushed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry trade group.Other store owners said they felt that, if they took reasonable precautions, they could operate safely. Still others said they considered their businesses exempt from statewide restrictions.“I would say that I’m supposed to be closed,” said Dennis Brown, who owns Shoreline Tactical, a gun shop in Shoreline, Washington. But with so many stores closed, “people can’t get their guns. So I’ve elected to stay open on an appointment-only basis.”Defiant stores more often than not went unpunished, The Trace found, despite proclamations from several governors that states would mete out harsh penalties to noncompliant businesses of all types.The April background check numbers continue a trend firstspottedby The Trace in early March, when gun store owners along the West Coast saw a surge in Asian-American customers fearful of xenophobic backlash to the virus. By the end of the month, fears of social unrest spread to the general public, driving a historic sales bump. The FBIprocesseda record number of checks in March, outstripping the prior high by 12 percent.As USA TODAY hasreported, the increase has overwhelmed the federal background check system, prompting the FBI to warn gun retailers that screenings could take up to a month to complete. An FBI spokesperson said NICS “remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.”In each of the five states where gun stores were deemed nonessential, The Trace contacted retailers to inquire whether they were open. In Michigan, 15 of 20 stores said that they were open to walk-in customers. The remaining five did not answer their phones. In Washington State, all 10 dealers contacted were also selling guns, but some emphasized that they required customers to schedule appointments to ensure social distancing.In New Mexico, 9 out of 10 dealers contacted were open throughout April; in New York, 4 out of 10 stores contacted said the same. The remaining stores in both states did not answer calls.Only in Massachusetts did most gun stores appear to be closed. Of 20 firearm retailers contacted in the state, only one — in Montague — reported being open. Three others declined to answer questions; the rest did not answer calls.Shawn Brancheau, who runs Guns Galore in Fenton, Michigan, said that he considers his store an essential business even though Governor Gretchen Whitmer has said the opposite.“Home defense needs to be a consideration of the governor at a time like this,” he said, adding that he felt justified staying open because of the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance. He questioned the constitutionality of any order that would require gun stores to close and said local police had already been in his store to shop, and took no action.“Either there is no Second Amendment or you have the right to bear arms,” Brancheau said.Steve Hayes, an owner of Bob’s Gun and Tackle Shop Inc. in Hastings, Michigan, said he understood that state orders superseded the federal guidance, but said Michigan’s order was too ambiguous. A call to the state Attorney General’s Office, he says, provided little clarity.“Local authorities are giving different answers,” he said. “It’s been very confusing for a lot of store owners, and probably for customers, too, when they see one store shut and one store open.”Hayes said he received a written exemption from his local police department allowing him to stay open, but declined to provide a copy of the document. Calls to the Barry County Sheriff’s Department, which has jurisdiction over Hayes’ store, were not returned.Other store owners said their livelihoods depend upon keeping their doors open. Chris Burnett, who operates Kokopelli Pawn and Gun in Aztec, New Mexico, opened his shop just before the coronavirus reached the U.S. He says the New Mexico State Police have visited three times in the last month, instructing him to close his store. On the third visit, troopers fined him $100 and warned him that continued noncompliance could result in a six-month jail sentence.Still, he stayed open. “I just threw everything into my business,” he said. “I have two little girls at home to feed.”Some retailers said that even in states where the closure orders were unambiguous, they had found wiggle room to continue operating.Ryan Blake, who runs High Plains Gun Shop six hours east of Burnett’s store, in Clovis, New Mexico, said his store had been approved to stay open by local authorities.“We’re essentially a department of an essential business since we’re located in a hardware store,” he said. “So we’ve fallen under a gray area.”Likewise, Paul Smith, who runs S&S Gun Sales in Auburn, New York, said he found a loophole in Governor Andrew Cuomo’s order.“We were not originally on the list of essential businesses, but being a single proprietor gun store owner, I realized I could be open when I choose to,” he said.New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, which has the authority to issue exemptions to New Mexico’s stay-at-home order, did not respond to requests for comment. In New York, a spokesperson for the Empire State Development Corporation, which determines which businesses are considered essential under Cuomo’s order, said that gun stores, like all nonessential retail, were permitted to have one person in the shop to fulfill online orders.As USA TODAY hasreported, many states have struck a hard tack on businesses violating stay-at-home orders, threatening fines and criminal charges for those who ignore initial warnings. But noncompliant firearm retailers appear to have largely avoided such penalties outside of New Mexico. A spokesperson for the New Mexico State Police said that six gun dealers there were issued cease-and-desist letters in April.In Michigan, for example, a spokesperson for the state’s Attorney General’s OfficetoldThe Detroit Free Pressthat nonessential businesses could face forced closures and up to 90 days in jail for refusing to comply with the governor’s order. The Michigan State Police recentlycitedan Owosso barber shop for noncompliance, asking it to close or face harsher penalties.But several of the Michigan gun retailers interviewed for this story said that local authorities were aware of their operations and had taken no action.When provided background check data suggesting noncompliance among gun stores in the state, a spokesperson for the Michigan Attorney General’s Office said that enforcement was being handled at the local level. He added: “There has been nothing in Governor Whitmer’s executive orders that has specifically referenced firearm retailers.”In Washington, Governor Jay Insleeoutlineda three-tier penalty system for offending businesses: one violation earned a warning; another led to citations and possible business license revocation; one more could result in criminal charges.But news media reports suggest that few if any Washington State businesses have been hit with severe penalties.The Seattle TimesandKOMO TV Newshave reported on lax enforcement efforts for noncompliant businesses like gyms and construction sites.According to records obtained from the Washington Military Department, which receives complaints about compliance in the state, several gun stores also have continued to operate after allegations of noncompliance.One, Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition, was the subject of more than 20 complaints in the state’s database, all of which alleged large crowds and a lack of enforcement of social distancing requirements. One complainant alleged that they had confronted the store’s proprietor and shown her that gun stores are not essential per the governor’s order. “She asked me to leave,” the complaint reads.A representative from Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition declined to comment.Overall, the Military Department received more than 200 complaints about noncompliant gun stores since the state’s stay-at-home order took effect on March 25th – and more than 100 requests from retailers for exemptions from the order. It’s unclear from the records whether any of those exemptions were granted.In Massachusetts, both the State Police and the Attorney’s General Office directed questions about compliance to the Governor’s Office, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the state’s enforcement efforts. The Massachusetts Department of Health said enforcement was handled by municipalities; spokespeople for police departments in Worcester and Framingham reported that gun stores in those cities were all compliant with the order.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation’s gun enforcement agency, said that violations of state and local laws could put dealers’ federal licenses at risk.Applicants must affirm that they are in compliance with local and state laws before licenses are conferred and every three years when licenses are renewed. License status for dealers charged with local offenses, the ATF said, likely would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.The National Rifle Association referred questions to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. There, General Counsel Larry Keane said it was “not surprising” that gun sales did not suffer in states where firearms dealers were restricted or prohibited from operating during the health emergency.Keane said that local enforcement of the state executive orders has not been consistent across the states.“In some areas, local sheriffs are not going to force gun shops to close because that’s where law enforcement buys equipment to do the job,” he said. “We are aware that local law enforcement have been advising dealers in some cases not to close because that’s where they are buying ammunition and firearms.”Keane said the foundation has made no effort to advise dealers on actual operations. Rather, he said the group has provided the industry with a running list of orders approved by the state, including the essential business operations recognized in those jurisdictions.“We are not telling people to open; we are not telling people to close,” Keane said. “We’re just providing access to good information.”Christian Heyne, the vice president of policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence called gun stores’ disobedience deeply concerning. The United States relies on gun stores, as federally licensed businesses, to follow state and federal guidelines to ensure the safety of communities across the country, he said. “So it is incredibly alarming to think that there are a number of gun dealers that are essentially going rogue.”Meanwhile, the NRA hasvigorouslycondemnedstates that ordered gun retailers to shutter and filed lawsuits against governors inNew MexicoandNew York.MassachusettsandMichiganalso face lawsuits over their orders.As states phase in their reopening plans, the situation for gun sales is rapidly changing. On May 1, New Mexico’s governor said gun stores could reopen on an appointment-only basis. On May 7, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the state’s shutdown of gun stores was unconstitutional. Stores there officially reopened for business on May 9.",2

In addition to St. Cloud, the firm has offices in eight other Minnesota cities including Brainerd, Duluth, Mankato and Rochester, and in the Twin Cities metro, Eagan, Maple Grove, Eden Prairie and Roseville.The three former partners charge that Scott accused them of planning a ""coup"" against him, according to the suit.On Tuesday, Scott said he hadn't seen the legal complaint and couldn't comment until he'd had a chance to read it. Quarberg said that she and the other former partners have been advised by their attorney not to comment.According to the complaint, Scott was disturbed by the Capitol riot and sent an e-mail in April to all the firm's lawyers, saying that the ""traitors on Jan. 6"" should have been shot.He then told the firm's operations manager to fire two employees he labeled ""racist"" because they had pro-Trump and pro-police posts on their social media accounts.When she refused to fire the employees, Scott fired her, according to the complaint. Scott then fired an additional employee and threatened to fire another.The three partners confronted Scott, according to court documents, and told him that firing an employee for political beliefs is against state law. Scott then fired them and called St. Cloud police to remove Quarberg, claiming she was trespassing and physically threatening him.Scott cut off the partners' phones and e-mail accounts and changed the locks on the offices, the complaint says.He told other law firm employees that the partners had been fired for insubordination, according to the complaint, and disparaged them in an online meeting with the firm's staff.""We have three employees … who are way over the top violating everything that is dear to us and I won't let it happen,"" the complaint quotes Scott as saying.Since firing the three partners, the suit alleges, Scott has tried to prevent them from collecting unemployment and health care benefits.What's more, the firm's ownership is in limbo. The three fired partners together own 50% of the firm, with Scott owning the other half.According to the suit, the fired partners negotiated a buyout under the firm's partnership agreement, but Scott reneged after first agreeing to it.""Scott engaged in conduct at the firm that was inappropriate for an employee, let alone the president of the firm,"" the complaint says.The three fired partners are seeking a number of remedies including back pay and benefits, as well as a judicial order to dissolve the firm and pay them for their shares under the buyout that they said had been negotiated.John Reinan • 612-673-7402",2
446,"After 2020 surge, Colorado gun sales continue at record pace in 2021",-1.67,44.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/10/colorado-gun-sales-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,denverpost,25,"Coloradans since last year have bought guns at such a rapid pace that gun store owners struggled to keep their shelves stocked.Bristlecone Shooting, Training and Retail Center in Lakewood generally carries several hundred guns at any time, but during the pandemic, the shop’s stock sometimes dropped to as few as 10, co-owner Jacquelyn Clark  said. The store’s supply of guns has improved, but it’s still limiting how much ammunition people can buy.“There’s been a massive increase in demand at every level,” Clark said.More Coloradans than ever before bought guns last year and data from the first five months of 2021 show the record pace of purchases continues.The Colorado Bureau of Investigation approved 487,097 gun sales in 2020 — a 45% increase over 2019 and the highest number ever recorded in the state,data collected by the agency shows.More gun sales were approved in 2020 than were recorded in 2000, 2001 and 2002 combined.“The manufacturers could not keep up with the demand,” said Chuck Lawson, a customer service representative at Centennial Gun Club. “It was a number of factors that really changed everything. When COVID hit, people rushed out and bought toilet paper and guns. Then the riots hit, and people bought guns. Then there was the election, which are always good for gun sales.”In the first five months of 2021, CBI approved 205,918 gun sales. If that rate continues, this year’s sales will exceed those recorded in 2020.The pre-purchase background checks conducted by CBI and other law enforcement agencies do not necessarily equate to a gun sale, but academics and the firearms industry use the number of checks as a way to keep track of demand and firearm sales trends since there is no centralized database of gun sales and ownership.Monthly data shows background checks spiked 59% month-over-month in March 2020 — the same month Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. The checks dropped slightly in the following months, but remained higher than pre-pandemic averages.Gun sales bumped up and down, but remained largely elevated, during the months following massive racial justice protests in many Colorado communities during the summer of 2020, data shows. Sales ticked back up near their early-pandemic level in January 2021, the month President Joe Biden took office following the riot at the U.S. Capitol that interrupted the certification of the election results.Many of the customers who came to Bristlecone Shooting in the last year were people who never owned a gun before and were looking to purchase something for self-defense, Clark said. People were searching for a way to feel safe as COVID-19 spread across the U.S. and upended normal life, she said.“We had people coming in every day saying, ‘I’ve never held a gun in my life,'” Lawson said.According to CBI data, about 57% of guns sold in Colorado last year were handguns, which are often peoples’ preferred type of firearm for self-defense.Wait times for CBI to complete the necessary background checks also skyrocketed during the pandemic. In 2019, the average wait time never exceeded 11 minutes, CBI data shows. In 2020, the maximum average wait time was 3 days and 23 hours.Demand for the classes required to obtain a concealed carry permit also skyrocketed, Clark said. Between March and December 2020, sign-ups for the safety classes at Bristlecone Shooting were up about 300% compared to the year prior. That’s a good thing, she said, because people are seeking training on how to use guns as safely as possible.“You need to know how to safely operate it and you need to know how to safely store it,” Clark said.The surge in gun purchases in Colorado is part of a national trend, federal data shows.TheNational Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2020processed 39.7 million firearm purchase background checks — the highest annual number ever recorded and a 40% increase from 2019.Like in Colorado, sales started to spike in March 2020. Phillip Levine, a statistics and economics professor at Wellesley College, pointed to an analysis published by the Brookings Institute that found3 million more guns were sold between March and July of 2020than would be expected if previous years’ trends held.“The primary driver of gun sales is uncertainty,” Levine said. “When Americans are uncertain about aspects of their lives, they turn to firearms.”Those uncertainties can take many forms. Gun sales often shoot up if there is talk of enacting new gun regulations and sometimes after mass shootings — but generally only when those tragedies spur calls for more gun control and there seems to be the political will to enact it, he said. Political uncertainty and the election of Democrats also fuel sales.Levine found that the rate of sales in states did not correlate with COVID-19 death rates or increases in unemployment. It’s also impossible that 2020’s nationwide surge in firearm purchases was fueled by people in cities where large racial justice protests took place after the murder of George Floyd, he said.“It’s not really localized, these responses. People are responding to the national mood,” Levine said.Clark and Lawson both said that sales have started to slow in the last month or two, just as supply chains are improving. The staff at Centennial Gun Club no longer has to spread out merchandise on the shelves to keep them from looking bare.But gun sales remain high. Two decades of CBI data show that Coloradans continue to buy guns at a higher rate than they did at the beginning of the millennium.Colorado’s population grew from 4.1 million in 2000 to 5.8 million in 2020 and the per capita rate of gun sales has more than doubled in that time.In 2000, CBI approved 3.3 gun sales per 100 residents. In 2020, that number rose to 8.7 sales per 100 people.",2
447,Human error in Michigan county vote tally sparks claims of election fraud,0.0,47.67,https://factcheck.afp.com/human-error-michigan-county-vote-tally-sparks-claims-election-fraud,https://adfontesmedia.com/agence-france-presse-bias-reliability/,2020-11-05,factcheck.afp,15,"“An update gives Biden 100% of new votes - 128k+,” claimed a November 4, 2020tweetfrom a Texas Republican columnist with 36,000 followers. Below the text, two electoral maps of the US show that a vote count update appeared to grant the former Vice President 138,339 votes and not a single one to his rival President Donald Trump.The tweet wasdeletedwith an apology, but the same maps were shared tens of thousands of times onTwitter,Instagram,Facebookand inan articlethat pointed to a discrepancy of 138,339 votes in Michigan. Most posts denounced the numbers as proof of fraud by Democrats in the Midwestern state.However, the maps actually show a 138,339 drop in Biden votes after a correction due to human error.Caroline Wilson, county clerk for the central Michigan county of Shiawassee, told AFP by phone, “I added an extra zero accidentally,” thereby reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371.“The minute it was discovered, it was corrected, probably within 20 minutes, so I’m amazed how fast this spread,” Wilson added.She said the state of Michigan alerted her office of the mistake “because we don’t even have that many voters.”The central Michigan county only has55,612 registered voters.When Biden’s 153,710 votes were lowered to 15,371 votes in a correction, 138,339 votes were removed from the Democrat’s total tally without any changes to Trump’s numbers.“The information contained in the graphic is entirely false,” Michigan Department of State spokeswoman Tracy Wimmer told AFP in an email about the map on Twitter.The image in the tweet showed two screenshots of the interactive vote results map from election data analystDecision Desk HQ(DDHQ).The two screenshots were taken at different times in the early hours of November 4.At 4:59 am, DDHQ reported results for Michigan that indicated 153,710 votes for Biden in Shiawassee county, promptingTwitteruser @ENGOLD to point out a mistake.DDHQacknowledgedthe mistake later on November 4, calling it a “clerical error” from the Shiawassee County data, and updated results on its website to reflect the changes, giving Trump a victory in the county with 23,154 votes.AFP Fact Check also found otherclaims of voter fraudthat turned out to be genuine mistakes, such as residents receiving mail-in ballots for deceased parents or previous tenants.With an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots cast, the presidential race remains too close to call.

The footage was made available at the request of Gaga's team who wanted to use it to track down the shooter.In the disturbingfootage, one of the assailants was heard cocking his gun and saying, ""give it up,"" before firing the shots.One of the singer's bodyguards was later photographed coming out of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood headquarters with Miss Asia.Police arrived at the scene and discovered Fischer conscious but having difficulty breathing. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment and is expected to make a full recovery.Various news outlets were unable to confirm if the suspects targeted the singer's French Bulldogs or if it was a random attack.According to the American Kennel Club, French Bulldogs are the 4th most popular breed of dogs and are prone to be targeted by thieves since they are expensive and their small size makes it easier to steal.Tara Bruno, the founder of SNORT Rescue, toldFrench Bulldogs cost roughly between $3,000 and $5,000.There are no suspects at this time.",1
449,"Semiconductor crisis has Biden administration sounding the alarm, with worries about China",0.0,45.67,https://fortune.com/2021/07/16/biden-administration-sounds-the-alarm-on-the-semiconductor-crisis/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,fortune,25,"U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo has a lot on her mind, but one thing tops them all: semiconductors.Semiconductors, or computer chips, act as the brains that power our technological devices. These chips, now smaller than a stamp and thinner than a piece of hair, have revolutionized the modern world. Innovation in the field has led to smarter, faster, and smaller technology (think pacemakers, smartphones, solar energy, self-driving cars, laptops, airplanes, just about everything you use). They’re also the second largest export in the U.S. and are responsible for 2 million American jobs.A recent shortage of semiconductors sent companies, who usually rely on a lean inventory of the chips, around the world into crisis as the pandemic drummed up demand for laptops, cellphones, and other technological devices. The blockage of the Suez Canal in March only worsened deliveries. Industry leaders likeIntelCEO Pat Gelsinger expect things to get worse before they get better. They don’t expect any real hope for recovery until 2022. Now, auto companies likeGM and Ford have announced that they’re temporarilyshutting down plants because of a semiconductor shortage.And that’s exactly why Secretary Raimondo is worried. “We have fallen very far behind from where we need to be with respect to semiconductors,” she explained this week atCEOI Collaborative discussion. “Semiconductors are the building blocks of our entire digital economy and unfortunately, we’re vulnerable now because we don’t make enough leading edge semiconductors in America.”China is a net importer of semiconductors, largely from the U.S. The country imported $350 billion in chips in 2020, an increase of 14.6% from 2019. But recent trade tension under President Trump has damaged the long standing relationship and spurred China to begin accelerating and prioritizing its own chip-making programs.In 2020, the former president cut off Huawei Technologies, the number two smartphone maker in the world, from access to U.S. chips in a fight over Beijing’s industrial practices. The Trump administration also publicly considered imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the largest manufacturer of semiconductors in China.The hostilities came as China promoted its Made in China 2025 initiative and Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development, which create financial incentives, intellectual property and antitrust standards to develop the Chinese semiconductor industry and end reliance on the U.S.“What I most often get asked about is China,” said Raimondo. “The fact of the matter is we have to run faster in America, and that means investing in our innovation and tech and unleashing all the opportunity that we have here.”U.S. semiconductors accounted for half of all global sales, or about$193 billion, in 2020, butonly 12% of those chips are actually manufactured in the U.S.So while the U.S. still leads in design, supply-chain issues have become a problem and gives China a lot of leverage over the U.S.In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to review America’s industrial supply chain, partially to review why there was a shortage of production in the United States. “It’s about making sure there’s a level playing field, so that we show every company can compete,” said Raimondo. But, more needs to be done to aid in research and development. “We have consistently fallen behind in terms of R&D as a percent of GDP,” she said.While Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and China invest billions annually in their semiconductor industries, the federal government has been slow to provide R&D funding and funding for domestic production.R&D now accounts for less than 1% of the U.S. GDP but that would change under President Biden’s infrastructure bill, which proposes $52 billion invested in domestic manufacturing and another $50 billion in R&D funding to focus on semiconductors and advanced computing.Still, Raimondo is weary. Even if the infrastructure bill were to pass as-is, $52 billion is not enough, she says. The money is just “a piece of the puzzle,” she told. But while it’s “not nearly enough to do what we need to do,” she hopes it will be able to unlock and stimulate private sector investment to the tune of $100 billion in the production of semiconductors and job training.Stimulating that innovation and enhancing innovative competition, she said, “is the bedrock of our capitalistic system, the bedrock of what has made America great.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential business stories straight to your inbox each morning.",2

In total, 3,580 Marylanders have died due to the disease or complications from it since officials began tracking the virus in March.As of Thursday, 412 people in Maryland are hospitalized due to COVID-19, 20 fewer patients than Wednesday. However, the count of people being treated in intensive care units increased by one to 107.The statewide seven-day average testing positivity rate is at 3.3%, down from Wednesday’s 3.35% rate. The World Health Organization recommends 14 straight days with a rate of 5% or lower before governments begin relaxing social distancing and business restrictions.Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Research Center pegs Maryland’s seven-day rolling positivity rate at 4.39%, making it one of 21 states the university says is below the recommended 5% rate. Hopkins calculates its rate using the number of people to whom tests have been administered, but the state uses the raw number of tests administered. In other words, Hopkins doesn’t count multiple tests administered to the same person.While the it’s the first time in the past three days the state recorded more than 500 new cases, 21,459 tests were completed in the past 24 hours, over 8,500 tests more than the number completed either Wednesday or Tuesday.Baltimore County led the state with 131 newly confirmed cases, although its seven-day average positivity rate remains below 5%.

The age demographic represented less than 13% of Thursday’s reported cases, while the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that it makes up 23% of the state’s population.The pandemic continues to disproportionately affect the state’s Black and Latino populations. A little less than two-thirds of the state’s confirmed COVID-19 cases where information on race was available, 59,516, were found in Black or Hispanic residents. The two demographic groups represent less than half the state’s population.In comparison, white residents, who constitute more than 58% of the state’s population, or about 50% when accounting for those who also identify as Hispanic or Latino, represented under 27% of all confirmed cases with 23,909.However, white people have a higher mortality rate compared with other races, with about 6.34% of known cases proving fatal. About 4.33% of cases among Blacks and about 1.62% of cases among Latinos were fatal. All of these rates have been slowly decreasing in recent weeks.The state does not have racial demographic data for 16,025 COVID-19 cases.The state also reported Thursday that 11,875 new unemployment insurance claims were filed the week ending Aug. 22, continuing a decline in newly filed claims. Since the week ending July 4, when 66,559 unemployment insurance claims were filed, the state has seen the number of weekly claims drop each week except one.While the number of claims is a far cry from the more than 100,000 people who filed for unemployment at the peak of the pandemic in May, the state is handling thousands more claims per week than it did in normal times. For example, 2,090 people filed for unemployment the week ending March 2, before Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order requiring certain businesses close and social gatherings be limited in size.",2

452,Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy Claims Network Doesn’t Spread Pro-Trump Lies—Despite All Evidence,-12.0,38.33,https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsmax-ceo-chris-ruddy-claims-network-doesnt-spread-pro-trump-lies-despite-ample-evidence,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,thedailybeast,25,"In fact, Ruddy claimed to The Daily Beast, the right-wing outlet has so much journalistic integrity that it has pissed off President Trump in recent days.Donald Trump-friendly cable outletNewsmax—which hasreaped massive ratings rewardsfor its refusaluntil recentlyto acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect—has tried to exploit that stance by repeatedly airing bogus claims that Trump didn’t lose the election and that antifa and Black Lives Matter, not aviolent mob of Trump supporters, are to blame for Wednesday’s lethal assault on the Capitol.At least one Newsmax commentator claimed after the mayhem—in which five people died, including a Capitol police officer—that George Soros was somehow involved.“Stop right here,” Newsmax majority owner and chief executive Christopher Ruddy admonished The Daily Beast on Friday when asked to explain his channel’s enthusiastic platforming of post-election falsehoods, especially in the aftermath of Wednesday’s insurrection. “We have acted very properly on this. We condemned the violence almost from the minute it was happening in real time. We were saying every time somebody raised antifa [that] we have no evidence they were involved at all.”Despite Ruddy’s assertion, there are numerous examples in which Newsmax guests, paid contributors, anchors and correspondents have made specious claims with no such disclaimers.On Friday, for instance, former New York Police Commissioner and convicted felon Bernard Kerik, a promoter ofthe election-related conspiracy theorythat Trump’s victory was stolen by a deep-state supercomputer named “Hammer,” told credulous Newsmax host John Bachman: “I was at the rally…but I can tell you that there were close to a million people on the Mall [a spectacular exaggeration] between where the president spoke and the Washington Monument, beyond the monument, and that area was completely peaceful.“Whatever happened, happened down at the Capitol, and I anticipate you’re gonna see a lot of instigators and anarchists from Black Lives Matter and antifa,” Kerik continued.Instead of casting doubt, Bachman eagerly agreed.“Anybody who knows anything about these protests knows that there is a professional class of protestors,” he declared. “They have no ideology. They have no real morals. They don’t really believe in anything other than tearing down the system.”Kerik, the recipient of a presidential pardon last year after serving prison time and pleading guilty to multiple counts of federal tax fraud and perjury, was only the latest Newsmax personality to go on air and spread sham conspiracy theories—which in recent days have also included the Soros conspiracy by frequent guest CJ Pearson, a teenage Trump acolyte from Georgia.“George Soros [would] like to see in the final days of what looks like will be Joe Biden’s quest to steal this presidency than to make it look like Joe—that Donald Trump is trying to wage some insurrection as the liberal media has said? It’s absolutely nonsensical. It’s a far departure from reality,” Pearson told highly rated Newsmax host Greg Kelly on Wednesday night,as first spotted byleft-leaning press watchdog organization, Media Matters for America.On the same show, Kelly mused: “We’ve heard about outside agitators all summer long with the Black Lives Matter protests that all the looting was done by, you know, foreign sources from some faraway place. Look, these don’t look like Trump supporters. Trump supporters don’t do these things.”On Thursday night, meanwhile, Kelly told viewers: “Sometimes the bank robber gets away with it. Joe Biden stole this election. You know it. I know it. Tens of millions of Americans agree with us… Donald Trump should not concede because he didn’t lose.”Also on Thursday, Newsmax anchor Grant Stinchfield hosted InfoWars personality DeAnna Lorraine, a QAnon acolyte who, among other interesting observations, has argued that Bill Gates is a space alien and Michelle Obama is a man.“I'm so proud of… the people that went to the Capitol yesterday because we needed to do this,” she told Stinchfield. “We needed to show them that we care, that our Constitution matters, that our America, our country matters. This is a foreign, hostile takeover and you know it. I know it. And it is time that we step up and that we fight.”Lorraine went on: “Yesterday, we told the truth. We were there at the Capitol, we were peaceful protesting. The violence was only coming from the police towards us who were there. And yet they're spinning this disgusting narrative that we are at fault or that Trump is at fault and this was domestic terrorism. No it wasn't. It was us fighting for our country. And we have never, ever been more at risk of losing our country.”Ruddy argued that it’s unfair to hold Newsmax accountable for giving free rein to those and other such baseless and reckless claims and Trump-reinforcing fever dreams.“We can’t control every guest that comes on Newsmax,” Ruddy said. “You’re expecting that every guest that comes on CNN and MSNBC—we should hold them accountable for all the batshit crazy things they said about Russian collusion over the years?...C’mon. Is Newsmax responsible? Are we really pushing the antifa thing? In all fairness! We have probably said three dozen times that we have no evidence that antifa is involved.”Regarding Kerik’s remarks, Ruddy added: “I don’t know what Bernie Kerik said. He’s the former police commissioner of the City of New York.” Kerik’s criminal record “doesn’t undermine the fact that he was the police commissioner and a law enforcement officer,” the Newsmax CEO said. “He has been completely pardoned for his crimes.”Ruddy added: “I don’t see what the story is. I really don’t.” He added that contrary to the general perception, Newmax has displeased Trump from time to time—including Ruddy’s recentcolumnarguing that his friend the president should concede and congratulate Biden—and has actually shown restraint in resistingsuch bogus claimsasretracted storythat facial recognition technology had identified antifa activists among the rioters.Ruddy added that his friend Trump, with whom he has dined at Mar-a-Lago, where he’s a longtime member, was upset when Newsmax started referring to Biden as “president-elect” on Dec. 14 after the Electoral College certified his victory.“I can tell you Trump’s not happy with Newsmax that we were calling Biden the president-elect,” Ruddy recounted, adding that he spoke to the soon-to-be ex-president over the holidays. “I said to him that we were accepting the constitutional process and thought that he should do that”—advice Trump rejected.Ruddy added that some Newsmax viewers have even complained about the channel’s alleged journalistic conscientiousness. Newsmax’s refusal to run the facial recognition story “has been fueling all the angst we’re getting from our viewership that we’re not covering this—that we’re part of the coverup. And now you’re calling me and saying we’ve been fueling it. No one else is arguing this.”On Wednesday, as the rampage at the Capitol drew to a close, Newsmax anchor Tom Basile fervently promotedthe antifa/Black Lives Matter canard: “So that you have a complete picture of what’s going on, the last couple of times we’ve seen these rallies, it hasn’t just been the president’s supporters. We have seen antifa, we have seen Black Lives Matter, we have seen other leftist groups that have tried to stir up violence.”Newsmax White House correspondent Emerald Robinson chimed in: “That’s a great point, Tom, because I am hearing from some people on the ground that there is a question of, if antifa has infiltrated the Trump rally-goers and are fomenting some kind of unrest.”MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, meanwhile, assured Newsmax viewers that Wednesday’s riot was “very peaceful” and that there was “probably some undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people and did some damage to windows and got in there.”Newsmax anchor Chris Salcedo concurred—“I’ve heard those reports, too”—never mind that there were no such reports, at least not from news organizations.Ruddy, who prefers that Newsmax be described as “center-right conservative” instead of “right-wing,” vowed that his channel will cover the Biden administration from the perspective of “the loyal opposition,” not as an illegitimate president.“I actually like some of his Cabinet choices,” he said, mentioning attorney general-designate Merrick Garland and secretary of state-designate Tony Blinken.“I’ve heard that Blinken is a good guy,” he said.Got a tip?

453,Plowshares Activists Pay Heavy Price For Resisting Nuclear Warfare,-32.67,31.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/17/kings-bay-plowshares-activists-pay-heavy-price-for-resisting-nuclear-warfare/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,shadowproof,22,"Patrick O’Neill gripped the hammer tightly in his hands. The police would soon surround him.O’Neill and six other Catholic peace activists had infiltrated the Kings Bay Naval Base in St. Mary’s, Georgia, with the goal of symbolically disarming the base’s six Trident submarines armed with first-strike missiles capable of holding 200 nuclear warheads.Some of the activists strung up crime scene tape and hung protest banners that read “The Ultimate Logic of Trident is Omnicide.” Others poured baby bottles of their own blood around the base.Using Google Maps, O’Neill and Mark Colville discovered a macabre shrine to nuclearism consisting of a half dozen statues of nuclear missiles that looked as if they were suspended in motion just seconds after launch.Staring up at a replica of a Trident D5 intercontinental ballistic missile, O’Neill’s mind turned to the book of Exodus in the Bible: the shrine offered proof that nuclear weapons were modern-day idols more powerful than a golden calf. Unlike that empty signifier, the pacifist recognized the immutable power of nuclear weapons. For him, it was the same as worshipping death.Time was running short. O’Neill sprinted up to the statue and beat it with the hammer. The missile was solid cement and the hammerhead broke clean off.“It was a formidable idol,” recalled O’Neill.Catholic peace activists like the ones who infiltrated the naval base at Kings Bay in 2018 have attempted to topple the formidable idol of nuclearism for 40 years, and they have paid a heavy price.Liz McAlister has already served 17 months behind bars and Father Steve Kelley continues to languish in a jail in Georgia. After spending more than 28 months under house arrest, O’Neill was slapped with a 14-month prison sentence in October. Carmen Trotta and Clare Grady will serve more than a year in prison, while Martha Hennessy expects to be incarcerated for 10 months. Mark Colville will be sentenced in December.On top of that, the activists are grappling with an establishment media blackout that they fear could be reflective of Americans’ apathy towards nuclear abolition at a moment when the threat of a nuclear holocaust is at its highest point in decades.O’Neill and the other Catholic peace activists knew they possessed neither the tools nor the numbers to physically disarm the nuclear naval base at Kings Bay. Rather, the goal of the Kings Bay action, like every Plowshares action dating back to the movement’s inception, was to call attention to the omnicidal threat that nuclear weapons continue to pose for humanity.The Plowshares movement began in 1980 when Roman Catholic priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan and six others surreptitiously gained access to the Re-Entry Division at the General Electric Space Technology Center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Carrying only hammers and pints of their own blood to symbolize the human cost of nuclear war, the activists pounded on nose cones that covered Mark 12A nuclear warheads and poured the blood over engineering blueprints and other documents.As their objective was to convert weapons of war into instruments of peace, the activists dubbed themselves the Plowshares Eight, a reference to a verse in the book of Isaiah in the Bible calling nations to “beat swords into plowshares.”The King of Prussia action captured the attention of the nation–thetocallit “one of the best-known antiwar incidents in this country since the Vietnam War”–and announced to the world the beginning of a bold new faction within the broader anti-war movement in the U.S. that fused religion with non-violent direct action against nuclear weapons.“They were different. They were risky. They were costly,” said McAlister, a former Catholic nun and longtime Plowshares activist.Since 1980, dozens of Plowshares activists have repeatedly penetrated sites across the country ranging from military installations to missile silos and in the process laid waste to the idea that nuclear weapons could ever be stored safely. The 2018 infiltration of the naval base at Kings Bay is estimated to be the 100th Plowshares action.Legal trials and prison sentences that were sure to follow their acts of civil disobedience were viewed as opportunities for the activists to draw more attention to their cause and often revealed the extraordinary lengths the government took to suppress dissent among those who dared to confront the American war machine.“You could count on serious time as a consequence,” McAlister said. “And [the federal government was] consistent about seeing to it that we did that time.”McAlister and Philip Berrigan were excommunicated from the Catholic church after they married in 1973 but their social justice activism continued. McAlister said she avoided participating in Plowshares actions at the same time as her husband so that one parent could be home with their children.The couple estimated that they spent more than 10 years of their marriage separated by the carceral system. McAlister served another two and a half years, including jail time for the Kings Bay action, since Berrigan died in 2002.When Grady first heard about the King of Prussia action, her initial reaction was alarm at the personal risks that the activists undertook to broadcast their message out to the public. Her second reaction was skepticism that their actions, though brave, would lead to any concessions on the part of the American military-industrial complex.After some consideration, Grady realized, “Oh, our friends are not asking the U.S. government to do anything. They’re doing it themselves.”Two years later, Grady joined McAlister and five others in penetrating the Griffiss Air Force Base in New York in order to gain access to a B-52 bomber, which were once outfitted to carry nuclear payloads that could be dropped onto the former Soviet Union. Base security did notappearuntil an hour after the activists started beating on the hanger doors, which incidentally were unlocked.“In 1983, when we hammered on the B-52 bomber and related parts, that plane was actually frozen for evidence for five months,” Grady said. “That is one of the few moments where nuclear weapons with these actions actually were disarmed. I’m not sure that too many efforts could claim that at that moment.”The grassroots movement against nuclear weapons in the U.S. reached a peak in 1982 when an estimated one million peopleconvergedin New York City for a massive demonstration. Grady remembered the thrill of being a part of the historic protest, which stands in stark contrast to the minority status that anti-nuclearism maintains today.“People were very much aware at that time of the danger of nuclear weapons,” Grady said. “Nowadays, very few people know about it and very few people are organizing around it.”The dearth of activism against nuclear weapons in the U.S. coincides with a new nuclear arms race as measures designed to mitigate nuclear proliferation that took decades to stitch together are being dismantled piece-by-piece.The world is currently just 100 seconds away from global destruction, according to the Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 as a way to remind people about the threat of nuclear annihilation.Here in the U.S., a new nuclear threat, one potentially more cataclysmic than the first, is currently underway. And not unlike the nuclear submarines that pass innocuously through the waters of Kings Bay in Georgia, it is happening right under the noses of the American public.“What has happened is the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of a single focused enemy with a peer competitor in the nuclear field,” Jessica T. Matthews told. Matthews is the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Older people remember getting under their desks for nuclear drills when they were in elementary school and putting their coats over their heads. Growing up in the era of above-ground nuclear testing all the time. All that went away with the end of the Cold War and I think it seemed as though the threat of nuclear conflict went with it.”The United States ushered in the nuclear age in 1945 and despite deepening wealth inequality and skyrocketing unemployment resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to spend billions of dollars to maintain its nuclear hegemony over the rest of the world. This new nuclear arms race is a reminder of how even in an era marked by entrenched partisan divisiveness, Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain united on maintaining America’s nuclear supremacy regardless of the financial, environmental or human costs.In 2001, Republican President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, an arms control agreement dating back to the 1970s. President Obama, a Democrat, secured passage of the New START treaty limiting the number of nuclear weapons but only after he struck a deal with Congress to spend $100 billion to refit American nuclear facilities and labs. That plan has now turned into an across-the-board modernization of the country’s nuclear apparatus, including the Trident II D5 nuclear missiles that are housed at the Kings Bay naval base, currently priced at $1.7 trillion, Matthews said.More than any other president, Trump seemed bent on turning the clock back to the 1950s when the country maintained more than 30,000 nuclear warheads and bombs in its stockpile, compared to roughly5,800weapons today. In May, Trump administration officialssignalledtheir interest in breaking the 28-year moratorium on nuclear testing to get China and Russia to agree to arms limitations under the New START treaty, whichexpiresin 2021.President-elect Joe Biden will likely extend the treaty but the result of all these infractions upon our already threadbare nuclear safety net amount to a running leap into a second nuclear arms race that is expected to continue regardless of who sits in the White House.“It’s a train that’s in motion and it’s going to be very hard to slow it down or redirect it,” Matthews warned.So hard that barring any unforeseen conflicts that might actually bring us closer to the brink of nuclear war, Matthews is dubious that Plowshares actions and other grassroots organizing will be enough on their own to force the issue into the national discourse.“I think it’s a really hard time for that to happen,” Matthews said. “If there were a confluence of events…if the [Trump] administration decided to test [nuclear weapons] and then if Korea got hot, and if several things happened at once, I can imagine it. But I just don’t think this is an issue whose time has come for public attention.”Calls to drop the charges against members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven elicited support from figures like Daniel Ellsberg, whistleblower and longtime anti-nuclear activist, along with religious leaders, including Reverend William J. Barber of the revived Poor People’s Campaign and former archbishop Desmond Tutu.Though he has not publicly commented on the legal fate of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, Pope Francis hasembracedthe Catholic peace activists’ once radical demand for the abolishment of nuclear weapons.“There is an urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons,” Pope Francistoldthe United Nations in 2015, “in full application of the non-proliferation treaty, in letter and spirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.”Media coverage, meanwhile, has failed to keep pace. News about the Catholic pacifists’ bold act of nonviolent civil disobedience at Kings Bay and their subsequent trial appears predominantly in progressive or religious publications like theNational Catholic Reporter. Mainstream outlets, including those in Atlanta and nearby Jacksonville, Florida, have steered clear of the Plowshares activists.The lack of coverage has prompted some Plowshares supporters to conclude the seven activists have become the victims of a media blackout.Journalist Jeremy Scahill recently gave voice to that concern following the recent sentencing of Kelley and O’Neill. Speaking in October on, Scahillslammedthe press’ refusal to cover the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven.“These Catholic peace activists, during the Trump administration, tried to confront that nuclear threat, and there was a total media blackout on the action that they did,” Scahill said. “And, you know, if we lived in a just society, the Kings Bay Plowshares activists’ trial would have been reported on as one of the most brave confrontations of the most dangerous aspect of this government, and particularly this administration.”O’Neill pointed to a 2019 hearing for the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven attended by the actor and Catholic activistMartin Sheen. Only one reporter from a local newspaper showed up to document Sheen’s public show of support.Rather than a concerted effort by the media to suppress the activists, O’Neill fears that the lack of press coverage is instead a reflection of how complacent Americans have become after 75 years of living on hair-trigger alert. In the absence of sustained grassroots mobilization aimed at keeping the issue of nuclear abolition in the spotlight, O’Neill imagines news editors and journalists view the Plowshares activists as if they are political outliers or relics of a bygone era, with little incentive to cover them.“The media is not blacking us out,” said O’Neill. “They just made a conscious decision to say we’re not worthy of coverage. It just says something about how relaxed people are about being under the shadow of the nuclear arms race.”The deadly coronavirus pandemic compounds what is sure to be an already arduous prison sentence, posing an additional threat for members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, all of whom are more susceptible to COVID-19 since they are over the age of 60.In October, United States District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood sentenced O’Neill to 14 months in prison. Since he lives at a Catholic worker house in Garner, North Carolina, O’Neill toldthat he preferred to serve out his sentence close to home at the nearby federal prison in Butner even though it has become a hotspot for coronavirus infections. More people at Butner havediedfrom COVID-19–26 prisoners and one staff member–than at any other federal federal correctional institution.Instead, O’Neill was ordered to report to the Elkton Federal Prison in Ohio. The facility was at the center of a COVID-19outbreakthat was so bad with one in four prisoners infected that it drew legal action from the ACLU. So far, nine prisoners havediedfrom the coronavirus. O’Neill said he is appealing the order but clearly both options pose a risk to his health.When asked about whether the Kings Bay action was worth losing his life over, O’Neill echoed the words of past Plowshares activists who saw a greater danger–in this case, the death of all living things–in not speaking out.“There are people in the world working to change the direction of the world, to move the world away from nuclearism and the development of more nuclear weapons and we’re very much in the minority right now,” O’Neill said. “But nonetheless, we’re not acting in vain.”“If we hadn’t gone to Kings Bay, people living in those communities there would never have given any thought to Kings Bay as being anything more than an employer, an economic boost. I think people now have to sort of think about things in a different light.”It is reasonable to think that at nearly 81 years old, McAlister’s 17-month stretch for breaking into the naval submarine base at Kings Bay will be her last time behind bars for nonviolent civil disobedience. But McAlister knows just as well as anyone else that nuclear annihilation is not reasonable and she stopped short at saying definitively whether Kings Bay would be her last Plowshares action.McAlister acknowledged her concern that fewer people are willing to join the Plowshares movement than they were 40 years ago at the height of anti-nuclearism. But just as the threat of nuclear war has not subsided since the end of the Cold War, McCalister is hopeful that people of conscience will continue to fight for a nuclear-free world.A former nun, McAlister says she never would have dared to undertake the risks that Plowshares activists must take if it weren’t for her faith in God. She firmly believes that it was God performing “minor miracles” that facilitated the entry of dozens of Plowshares activists into highly secured nuclear facilities and enabled them to put their hands directly onto the doomsday machine.“These are the most deadly weapons in the world,” said McAlister. “How is it possible for somebody like me to walk right in and be right next to them and pour blood on them? Use a hammer on them? But I’ve done it a number of times and so have some of my friends and my husband.”“And please, God, others will continue to do it,” she said.One person who answered the call was Martha Hennessy. The 2018 infiltration of the Kings Bay naval base was her first Plowshares action, which makes her an anomaly among the other activists.Hennessy, though, is no stranger to the movement. In fact, she is the granddaughter of Dorothy Day, who was one of the principal driving forces behind the creation of the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930s. Growing up, Hennessy witnessed firsthand the evolution of the Plowshares movement under the guidance of Catholic peace activists like McAlister and the Berrigan brothers who dared to take a stand against the threat of nuclear armageddon even in the face of assured retribution from the federal government.Her decision to infiltrate the Kings Bay naval base in a defiant act of civil disobedience against the world’s most powerful military came only after months of prayerful discernment, a kind of internal examination about what risks she was willing to take on behalf of her religious beliefs and moral convictions.The integrity of the Plowshares movement gave Hennessy the strength to take part in the Kings Bay action, a cohort that she believes will help her survive her 10-month prison sentence.“You know, walking onto a military base was not the first thing I wanted to do in this resistance work for nuclear abolition,” recalled Hennessy. “But the power of such an act can speak for itself and we had to bring the body of Christ there to the base.”“It’s our obligation to speak out,” she proclaimed.",1
454,Democrats Don’t Act Like People with Nothing to Hide,24.33,17.33,https://stream.org/democrats-dont-act-like-people-with-nothing-to-hide/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,stream,24,"ByJohn ZmirakPublished onJanuary 18, 2021•Speaking of presidential inaugurations … can I share with you what disappointed me about Trump’s swearing in, four LONG years ago? I’d really hoped that at some point during the ceremony,Barack Obamahad stood up to speak, taking the mic in hand as sometimes he liked to do.I wanted to hear him say, in his studied faux “urban” way: “My fellow Americans, there’s something I’ve wanted to share with you for eight long years. I think now’s at last the moment.” He’d pull out a piece of yellowed paper, a government document. “You see this? It’s myGood luck sortingthatout. Peace out!” Then he’d drop the microphone and saunter off stage, cackling to himself.So he would never have been constitutionally eligible for election. Had he ever really been president? American lawyers would have billed tens of millions of hours figuring out whether or not the laws he’d signed, theSupreme Courtappointees he’d picked, were in fact legitimate. Or would we need an eight-year “do-over”? That part would have been fun.The reason I can joke about the “birther” business is that it was never serious.Hillary Clinton’steam haddisseminated or concocted it during the primaries, and a few Republicans grabbed it. But the Democrats never saw it as a serious threat, for lack of evidence. Most Republicans treated it as a ridiculous distraction. (Trump, by contrast, talked it up — primarily I think as a cynical way to attract a following. It worked.) So while a few race-hustlers tried to cast it as “racist” (in which case Hillary’s team was racist), most people dismissed it. I used to joke about it, precisely because I knew it wasn’t real.So did Obama himself. He laughed the “birther” story off because he considered it baseless. He took office in 2009 without a shadow of genuine doubt over his legitimacy. Yes, a lot of us felt like he was un-American, but not because of his race or his (rumored) birthplace. We felt that way because his politics were rooted inpost-colonialMarxist resentment. Because his long-time spiritual mentor (who performed his wedding and baptized his children) had said “God DAMN America!” (Here’s newly “elected” senator Raphael Warnock of Georgiapraising that Jeremiah Wright speech.) And because he promised to “fundamentally transform” America. Which we didn’t think needed a sex change, as he did.Birtherism was a falsehood. But it encapsulated politics which were all too real. We saw them arise again in the attack on our nation’s public monuments, and the deadly 2020 riots Democrats (almost to a man) excused or endorsed.You know what Obama didn’t do in 2009? What no Democrats did? There follows a list of measures the Democrats didn’t take in the build-up to Obama’s inauguration:If the Democrats and their allies had done all those things and more, you know what we might have concluded? That there really was something to “Birthergate.” Why else were the Dems acting like a bunch of twitchy Mafiosi, shredding documents and running in circles at the first sight ofRudy Giuliani? That’s not how innocent people and organizations act.So why are leftist elites so panicked aboutelection 2020? Why are they treating the breach of the U.S. Capitol like the 1933 Reichstag Fire, and effectively trying to crush any opposition and suspend the Constitution?The Democrats in 2008 didn’t try to block any legal scrutiny over Obama’s place of birth, then to disbar the lawyers who’d sued them. They didn’t use all their power to “cancel” and personally destroy those who spread the claim that Obama was born in Kenya. They simply provided what documents they had, and shrugged, with apparently clean consciences, at further doubts. From that fact alone, more than anything else, I personally came to believe them.That’s not how they’re acting now. The way Democrats (and weak-kneed NeverTrumpsurrender monkeys) have behaved since the 2020 vote tells a very different story. What it tells me, most crucially, is this: The Democrats cheated, know they cheated, and by it gained one-party rule in America.Our elites, including the media, know this too. But they’re glad it happened. Anything, anything, to kick Orange Man to the curb. And to silence the Deplorable half of the country that supports him. AND to put everyone on notice thatThe Hivewill never tolerate a serious threat to its power again.The Democrats fully intend to cheat again next time — two years from now in Congress, then four years from now for the White House. And they want to pre-emptively cow and silence anyone who dares to question their cheating. (“NiceIvy League degreeyou got there. Be a real shame if something happened to it.”)For decades Democrats dismissed any efforts at ballot security as evidence of “racism.” Now they can also call it “dangerous,” an “incitement to riot.” Some even will dare call it “treason.”If following the procedures in the Constitution for validating elections be treason, then let’s make the most of it.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich certainly is. He’s not backing down under The Hive’s concerted pressure. Goread his latestatThe key takeaway is here:Officials in virtually every swing state broke their states’ own laws to send out millions of ballots or ballot applications to every registered voter. It was all clearly documented in the Texas lawsuit, which was declined by the U.S. Supreme Court based on Texas’ procedural standing — not the merits of the case. That’s the election.In addition, it’s clear that virtually every swing state essentially suspended normal requirements for verifying absentee ballots. Rejection rates were an order of magnitude lower than in a normal year. In Georgia, rejection rates dropped from 6.5% in 2016 to 0.2% in 2020. In Pennsylvania, it went from 1% in 2016 to .003% in 2020. Nevada fell from 1.6% to .75%.

Those two issue have been major sticking points in reaching a deal as the clock ticks on the current Congress.The bipartisan group plans to hold a news conference Monday to announce the modified proposal.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has long called for a liability shield from coronavirus litigation, while congressional Democrats have made money for states and cities their top priority. Breaking the proposal in two parts might give a relief package a greater chance to pass.Romney is among a group of lawmakers who have vowed to stay in Washington through the holidays to get a deal done as businesses across the country shut down, especially in the restaurant and hospitality industry, and Americans struggle to stay employed amid another COVID-19 surge.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., one of the leaders of the effort, said the bipartisan group and their staffs have met regularly the past month, including a call Saturday and another call later Sunday to “finish things up.”“The bottom line is there’s a lot of parts to this bill, and in the spirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that,” Manchin told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “But at the end, you can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”Romney expressed optimism earlier this month that Congress could get a relief bill passed before Christmas.“I think it would send a terrible message if we’re home celebrating Christmas and people’s unemployment has run out and businesses are being closed,” he said.",2

457,A Series of Tubes: Reclaiming the Physical Internet,-15.33,40.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/reclaiming-the-physical-internet,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-26,currentaffairs,25,"If you’re like me, you are largely oblivious to the world around you. The knowledge of the entire world, along with a direct line to everyone you know and love, lives in your phone or your computer and you carry those around with you. Occasionally you plug them into some magical holes in your wall so they keep running. And of course you need wifi or cell service, which floats around in the air as long as you’re in the right sort of place with the right password. If you can grab it, then there you are. Plugged in. Connected, networked,networked, webbed to the wide world. The internet is in the air. It’s a cloud. We’re all connected, somehow, by technology or something. The magic lives in our computers and phones and in the apps they run.There’s this anecdote in Michael Lewis’s: After most of its trading goes online, a hedge fund decides it might as well move from Manhattan to the midwest. Physical location has ceased to matter because business lives in cyberspace now. What a boon! What a time to save on rent. Of course, this turns out to be exactly wrong. As this firm is trying to save money by moving west, the high frequency traders on whom the book is focused are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get closer to the market, to put their computers as close as possible to the market computers.If you’re a hedge fund and you think about the internet like I usually do, you move to Oklahoma where the rent is cheap. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you pay huge sums of money to put your computers inside New Jersey warehouses directly next to the market servers, and even more money to get them a few feet closer than your competitors’ computers. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you spend untold millions to lay a few strands of glass, no thicker than human hairs, in the straightest possible line from Chicago to New Jersey. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you worry about mountains and rivers and oceans, about electricity generation and signal interference. And you might also worry about ownership, control, power, and coordination.The internet, after all, is simply a. Its job is to get information from one physical place to another physical place. It serves the same function as telephones, telegraphs, radios, smoke signals, and semaphore. It happens to operate through a complicated system of physical tubes. When you send a packet of information in the form of a letter, a federal government agency takes your letter and carries it across an intricate nationwide network of federally-, state-, and locally-owned and managed roads. When you send a packet of information in the form of bits, it is usually carried by a privately-owned internet service provider (or “ISP,” usually the local cable monopoly) along an intricate nationwide network of pathways owned by that company and a myriad of other private companies. It’s like if you could only send a letter with either UPS or FedEx (depending on where you live), and the letter had to travel on nothing but toll roads owned by a few dozen private corporations to get to anywhere from down the street to across the continent.This presents both a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that as more of our lives move online (whether in the normal course or all at once thanks to a global pandemic), we become ever more at the mercy of the private entities that control the internet. In normal times we have to use roads to get to work and to school, but at least wethe roads and exercise some control over them in the form of local government. We don’townthe internet. There are no city council meetings where we can go to complain about potholesandservice interruptions, or about local tax raisesanddata rates. The way that our public institutions tend to get more people connected to the internet is to give private internet companies grants to build more wires. But those companies stillownthe wires, and at the end of the day they tend to doonly what is most profitable.The opportunity is to flip this dynamic. But we must go deeper than the calls for municipal internet service providers that were in heavy rotation around 2017. Municipal ISPs are good, but they are only local. Every city in the country could have its own locally owned and democratically controlled ISP and the internet would still be at the mercy of private profit. Someone still has to connect all those cities to each other. Someone still has to carry the bits from Los Angeles through Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Omaha to the servers in Council Bluffs. Owning local tubes is great, but what we need is publicinternet infrastructure. To stay with the road analogy, owning local roads only gets you so far—we need democratic ownership and control over the highways and interstates, too. To see why, let’s talk a little more about what the internet is and where it came from.The physical internet is a lot more like a road system than you might think. Information superhighway cliches aside, a functional internet requires physical pathways reaching every home and business in the country (and, increasingly, in the world). Like road systems, the physical internet is very expensive to build but confers massive benefits once it is built. Like roads, the physical pathways of the internet are neither very technologically complicated nor likely to change much over time. The ways of packaging and transmitting information are always improving, just like the ways of packaging and transmitting things along roads, but the glass wires that internet information travels through have been in place for decades and will not become overloaded for many more decades.When the telephone system was first being built, its challenges were far less technological than logistical. The technology was relatively simple: every household with a telephone had one pair of continuous copper wires connecting it to a local switching center. The phone itself was two devices—one near the mouth that converted the sound waves of a person’s voice to a corresponding electrical signal, and the other near the ear that converted an electrical signal back to a sound wave. Picking up the phone closed that wire’s circuit,connected the wires together, creating an unbroken loop back to the switching center, where an operator was on the other end of the line. You told the operator which house you wanted to talk to, and they plugged your two wires into the two wires going from the switching center to that house, creating a continuous loop between you and the person you were calling.The logistics of this are mind-boggling. Every single home with a telephone had its own unique pair of wires. Those wires had to make it safely from the home to the switching center. Hundreds or thousands of wire pairs had to be color-coded, tagged, and bundled in such a way that they could be discerned, organized, and repaired at any point along miles and miles of physical distance, strung from pole to pole or running underground. The organization and maintenance of those wires was a monumental task for the telecom industry. And its most significant innovations came not in the form of new types of phones (though there were those), but in ways to cram together multiple conversations into the same sets of wires and to automate the task of the operators at the switching centers.The internet feels more distant from this past than it actually is. To exist online is to send and receive information. To be sent and received, that information must take some physical form. It could be a patterned flow of electrons, a patterned electromagnetic wave, or a patterned series of flashes from one or multiple lasers. In any case, it has tosomewhere. It has to be sent and then received, and it has to traverse physical distance between where it is sent and where it is received. For the vast majority of information and the vast majority of the distances it travels, it lives as signals in long strands of metal or glass. Unlike the early telephone system, many households and devices can share space on the same strands of metal or glass, but that metal and glassisthe internet.The glass—optical fiber line—is a thing of wonder. Fiber has been in widespread use for decades and we haven’t come close to reaching its bandwidth potential. The thing about fiber is that it is simply a medium for signalling with light. And, because the signals themselves are merely light flashes, and because light travels so fast (though somewhat slower in glass than in space), the number of signals that are theoretically possible is very, very large. The only constraint on how much data can travel through fiber right now is how fast we can make a laser flash. As we continue to develop faster sending and receiving equipment, the data capacity of the very same fiber that has been in use for ten plus years will continue to expand.The internet is not a metaphorical world wide web of connection, it is aworld wide web of connection. If I want to video chat with Current Affairs editor Eli Massey using a service like Zoom while he’s in Cairo, my computer has to send waves to my router, which converts those waves to patterns of electrons in my home coaxial cable, which heads up to the utility pole behind my building and along utility poles or in trenches to the routers at my local Comcast switching center—sometimes the same switching center the old phone company used, but with the windows bricked in and full of servers and routers instead of human operators—and from there likely along fiber-optic strands of glass to a major regional switching center, maybe in downtown Los Angeles or Las Vegas, and onward still until it hits a switching center where Zoom has some co-located servers (maybe down the street, maybe across the country). Then Zoom sends that data on through more switching centers into an undersea cable (yes! my face converted to 0s and 1s encoded into laser flashes whizzing by beneath the sharks and flounders and whales and jellyfish), up under an Egyptian beach and through some Egyptian switching centers until it hits Eli’s router and gets beamed to his computer. Meanwhile his face is making the reverse journey.Who is involved in this world wide web of strands of metal and glass carrying bits of ourselves over mountains and under oceans? Your ISP provides connection to your router, so they are the first custodians of everything you do online. But once your signal has passed through your router and into a cable that leaves your home, others are suddenly involved. That cable might be owned by your ISP, or it might be owned by a telephone company, or by your city or state. Your ISP might just be a tenant, leasing out some space (bandwidth) on someone else’s physical network. Whoever owns the cable, they probably do not own the poles it is strung along—those are often owned by the local telephone company or the local power company, and the owner of your cable probably has to lease space on the pole for your cable. (If your cable goes underground, the cable owner might be leasing space in an underground pipeline with a lot of cables, or the cable might simply lie in a tiny, permit-required trench in the dirt in city-, county-, or state-owned land.) Your ISP might own the whole switching center your data hits first, or it might rent space for its physical routers in someone else’s switching center, or it might rent capacity onsomeone else’s router inyet anotherparty’s switching center. Then onto the next switching center, on yet more cables, with yet different owners and lessees using yet different poles and/or trenches.Even if your ISP owns the physical cable in your area and is in full control of the signal and medium from your house to its switching center and beyond, it will have to hand your signal off to some other company at some point. The largest of the glass and metal strand owners are called Tier 1 networks. Roughly, this means they have enough physical reach to leverage free transfer agreements with the other Tier 1 networks. That is, if signals traveling on AT&T fiber need to pass through some CenturyLink fiber to get where they’re going, CenturyLink does not charge AT&T, and vice versa. They both own so much fiber (750,000 miles for CenturyLink, 410,000 for AT&T) that they consider each other “peers” and freely grant access to each others’ networks. Comcast, on the other hand, although the ISP for about 40% of all US internet subscriptions as of 2011, is not a Tier 1 network. It might have free peering agreements with most fiber owners, but there are still places on the internet (remember,) where it can’t send data without paying someone to use their fiber.This setup presents a serious challenge for the idea of municipal internet promoted by many progressives. The desire to focus on local control, local infrastructure, and local accountability makes perfect sense when you think of your ISP as connecting you to a magical and disembodied internet. But the fact of the matter is that your city cannot provide you with the internet. It will need to link up with someone else at some point. When you try to access a website whose data live on a server in Council Bluffs, your signal needs to get to Iowa and back. Unless you live in Council Bluffs, your city network is not going to get you there.So, without some larger democratic structure in place, municipal networks are somewhat at the mercy of the existing internet giants. Even if your local government manages to install a fiber optic connection in every home in town, it will still have to pay at some point down the line to access others’ networks and switching centers. It may have to paylike Comcast for access to those networks and switching centers, and Comcast will have little incentive to offer access on any reasonable terms to a government entity trying to cut into its profits. This is similar to the classic net neutrality problem, which is as follows: since Comcast is a private company with theoretically no obligations to the public, why can’t Comcast charge people extra to access high-demand websites like Netflix? What if Comcast decided it doesn’t like Current Affairs, and simply stopped providing access to our website at all? And since the companies that own the wires have largely acquired the companies that produce the content that travels along the wires (Comcast owns NBC, AT&T owns Time Warner, etc.), what if internet providers started making their own content much easier to access than the content of their competitors? You can see how this net neutrality problem could translate to physical networks: what’s to stop Comcast (or CenturyLink or AT&T) from charging entire cities more to send signals on the nation- and world-wide networks of wires, or not providing access at all to cities with the temerity to shoulder in on private ISPs’ market share? Own the wires, own the internet.There are a few different ways we might confront this problem. One would be simply to build hundreds of thousands of miles ofcable and fiber, creating a large enough network to replace the current major players, or at least to achieve Tier 1 status and leverage a free data exchange. No public project has attempted this yet, but this has been the go-to move for tech companies seeking complete internet dominance and control. Google Fiber is an ongoing attempt to build a nationwide fiber optic network, to literally string Google-owned fiber alongside CenturyLink-owned fiber across the continent, thereby capturing a large chunk of the physical space internet for Google alongside its increasing control over the cyber space of the internet. If Google ever succeeds with this project, traffic via Gmail or Youtube could travel from Google’s servers to your computer without ever passing out of Google’s control.Google isn’t alone in this ambition. Many of the big tech companies that dominate the cyber space of the internet have been trying to find ways to take over its physical space as well. Beyond the prospect of domestic control and profit, expanding internet access to offline parts of the world carries the potential for untold profits. Google had a short-lived project called Loon that attempted to float wireless routers on massive balloons in the high atmosphere to enable connection in remote areas without the infrastructure for physical cables. Facebook attempted a similar project using a giant solar-powered plane, essentially a flying cell tower. Eventually these two projects learned the same lessons as Motorola’sIridium satellite networkandAT&T’s microwave relay tower project: it’s very hard to transmit signals quickly, cheaply, and reliably through the air. Long strands of glass are the way to go.That’s not to say the air isn’t still in play. Both Tesla and Amazon are in the process of attempting to build networks of hundreds or thousands of low-orbit satellites to replace the strands of metal and glass on the Earth’s surface. The traditional problem with satellite internet is that you have to be able to send and receive signals from a satellite, meaning it has to be somewhere in the sky above you, and not on the other side of the earth. There are only two ways to make sure there is always a satellite above you. First, you could put the satellite in geostationary orbit, meaning it stays above the same spot on the surface of the Earth at all times. The problem with this strategy is that to maintain geostationary orbit, satellites have to be—approximately 22,000 miles above sea level. That is far enough away that, even travelling at the speed of light, there is a noticeable lag for data to reach the satellite and then get back down to its destination on the ground. The other way to make satellites work is to havea lotof them in lower orbits. In lower orbits the satellites move much faster, so no single satellite will be over the same spot for very long. But if you have enough of them, you could get a signal to the closest one and have it relay the signal between a few more before beaming it down to its destination. Up until now, the main challenge for creating such a system has been the expense. Launching satellites, until recently, has beenveryexpensive. You have to build a whole rocket for each launch. But with the Tesla/SpaceX creation of reusable rockets, building a network of a few thousand low-orbit satellites has become more feasible. Elon Musk may have cheered the successful rocket reentry for its potential in supplying the space station, but he was probably thinking instead about owning the entire internet.Assuming that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will not encase the world in more than 10,000 satellites to own the internet, and, as nearly all the experts seem to think, that ground fiber is still the way to go, what can we do to coordinate democratic municipal ISPs? How can we free them from the grip of giant national fiber owners? Could we accomplish what Google is attempting, but public? Could we lay a democratically controlled and accountable public physical internet alongside the private physical internet currently connecting most homes on the continent?It would be tough, but there are some regional examples worth examining. In Utah, the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency, or UTOPIA, is a consortium of sixteen cities working to build a fiber optic network that would reach every home and business across a significant swathe of the state. UTOPIA is a public enterprise, funded through government bonds, that is directly competing with the private owners of the physical internet. It makes use of peering agreements with other public and academic networks, thereby expanding its fee-free reach to internet locations around the country. But that reach is still very limited. UTOPIA owns the fiber in its area, but leases fiber to get to the major data centers outside its immediate area, data centers owned by yet more parties. And though UTOPIA peers with other publicly-minded networks, those networks themselves must pay to reach the privately-controlled bits of the internet. Maybe most interestingly, UTOPIA itself is not an ISP. That is, it provides people with the glass strands, but doesn’t code and carry their internet traffic along those strands. It doesn’t run the laser flashes that constitute the signals. Rather, approved private ISPs operate on UTOPIA’s physical network. UTOPIA calls itself an “open source” model, meaning that its physical network is available for use by any qualifying ISP, public or private.The idea of UTOPIA is encouraging. That a public agency can viably fundraise and execute construction of a door-to-door fiber optic network, even if only regionally, is a small proof of concept. It could conceivably serve as a model for a national UTOPIA, a publicly-funded national network of fiber connecting local, regional, and state systems across the country. But UTOPIA’s history calls for some caution. TheUTOPIA is not an ISP is that public entities in Utah are notallowedto be ISPs. And the reason they’re not allowed to be ISPs is that, after public internet efforts including UTOPIA initially got off the ground in Utah, the internet giants descended with near unlimited resources to fund lawsuits and lobbying efforts. They succeeded in effectively outlawing public internet service providers in Utah with legislation thanks to the American Legislative Exchange Council (yes, ALEC, the conservative legislative advocacy group responsible for a large percentage of the most private-profit-driven, scourge-of-the-left state laws across the country).The mere possibility of a public option for the internet in Utah led to a massive legal and lobbying effort that ended with a law banning public ISPs. The public broadband advocacy organization Community Networks offers an interactive map showing the country’s public internet networks, and notes that at least eighteen states have put up barriers to public internet. The millions of dollars spent by the likes of Comcast and AT&T to block net neutrality will be a drop in the bucket compared to the effort they will launch at every level of government to prevent any kind of nationwide network to shift power and leverage to local ISPs.If we can’t build our own public, national, physical internet, is there a way we can force the current owners of the internet to act in the public’s interest? Can they be prevented from hamstringing local internet networks? This sort of move would have historical precedent. The railroads were notoriously built with public money for private profit, often involving sweetheart deals with associated or co-owned industries at the expense of everyone else. Much like Comcast carrying its own content for free but charging others, railroads would provide cheap or free transport to their subsidiaries but would charge others exorbitantly. Once the scandals reached a fever pitch in the 1880s, Congress designated the railroads as “common carriers,” meaning that, given their status as essential services, they were legally required to offer their services on a fair and equitable basis, and were to be closely scrutinized by regulators to ensure that was the case.Congress did the same to the telecom industry in 1934. Rather than breaking up AT&T’s monopoly, or nationalizing the phone lines, Congress enacted a law to force AT&T to carry telephone transmissions from all customers on a fair and equal basis. Congress enacted a smaller but similar rule in the 1970s at the behest of the cable industry to restrict AT&T’s control over telephone poles. AT&T saw cable as a potential competitor both in terms of telecommunications and for its own plans to offer video delivery in the future. It also saw that the cable companies would have to spend a ton of money to run networks of wires if they couldn’t use the existing poles. So the cable companies found themselves being charged exorbitantly to hang cables on poles. The Pole Attachment Act directed the FCC to determine reasonable rates for pole owners to charge and thus set prices for pole leases.The internet seems a natural choice for “common carrier” status. But, through decades of regulatory capture, lawsuits, and savvy lobbying, internet providers—both ISPs and large networks—have evaded designation as common carriers and maintained an almost wholly deregulated existence. Is now a moment for revisiting this situation? Nearly the entire American economy is wholly dependent on the internet right now. Those of us who are lucky enough to be working are doing so online. Public schools are holding Zoom classes and public officials are suggesting that children locked out of the internet at home (whether due to geography or poverty) go attend class in McDonald’s parking lots. The canard that broadband internet access is a luxury rather than a necessity, although long false, is growing more obviously ludicrous every day. These wires are our highways now. They are the paths we travel to get to work and school all day every day. Surely they are common carriers.Of course, the viability of this argument looks no better today than it did during the net neutrality fight in 2017. The White House, Congress, and the FCC are aligned in the strongest possible opposition to any internet regulation. And at the point we have the power to impose common carrier status, we should use that power to do better.It would seem ridiculous to countenance a completely privatized system of roads and highways. Even with common carrier rules in place, imagine having to choose and pay for the use of various paths depending on where you’re going, what you’re carrying, what your means of transit are, etc. And imagine having to erect an entire bureaucracy to monitor the maintenance and conduct of the private companies in charge of the roads and highways. Maybe there are some libertarian readers salivating at this possibility, but I doubt it will appeal to most.Is there a good reason to treat the internet differently? Sure, we built it in a different way, but that was due more to historical accident than any logical reason. Roads have always been recognized as essential for commerce, and their rights of way set aside for public use. The advent and prominence of cars came while the depredations of the privatized railroad system were still fresh, and federal and state governments were all too willing during the Great Depression and in the glut after World War Two to make massive public investments in direct road building (even while it would only subsidize private ownership of telephone lines). Politicians looking for rural support pushed through the USPS Rural Free Delivery program starting in the 1890s, which spurred the building of public postal roads reaching nearly every home in the country, at great public expense but to immeasurable long term benefit, so that people could get their mail delivered to their doors.One potential rationale for public roads but private telecom is that the telecom system is more susceptible to innovation, and can benefit more from private competition. This hasn’t borne out for a whole host of reasons. AT&T operated as a government-sanctioned “natural monopoly” for decades, and after being forcefully broken up in the 1980s has consolidated nearly all of its former holdings back into itself. And, in fact, there hasn’t beenmuch innovation in telecom or internet hardware in the recent past. Fiber has been in wide use for decades and we haven’t come close to reaching its potential for bandwidth. There might be innovation to be had in the sending and transmitting equipment, whichmightbe a colorable argument for private ISPs on a public fiber backbone, similar to the UTOPIA model. But even this might concede too much. As Vanessa A. Bee has written in Current Affairs and In These Times, there is little evidence that market competition is or has ever been necessary for technological innovation. The internet itself, after all, is a creation of public institutions.What am I suggesting? Nationalize the wires. Rather than attempting to erect a whole new set of fibers to run alongside the existing fibers as a “public option” of sorts, we need to seize our soonest opportunity to take public ownership over the nationwide network of cables that is destined to continue serving as essential public infrastructure for the foreseeable future. And just as the federal government provided grants to improve and expand public infrastructure during the New Deal and post-war period, we need to provide funds for local and regional democratically accountable ISPs. This need not involve dismantling the existing ISPs. But a handful of private companies should not own the physical wires,the means of access to those wires,andthe content that flows along them all at once.(A note on privacy and security: A sane person may balk at the idea of government owning and controlling the internet. “The internet should be atechnology. They can already see too much. Do we really want to hand Stephen Miller and Palantir the skeleton key to every bit that travels the wires?” First, don’t kid yourself,the NSA is already in the private switching centers. Second, there is nothing more inherently trustworthy about Bank of America, Facebook, Google, AT&T, and Comcast than the government. But this is a legitimate concern. It is, however, a concern that can be dealt with using the right encryption protocols. Just in the past five years huge swaths of the internet have moved from HTTP to HTTPS, and end-to-end encryption has gone from the stuff of paranoid conspiracy theorists to an expected feature in communication apps. No security is perfect, and government-owned wires could still carry a risk of increased government surveillance, but Peter Thiel and Palantir will end up with your data as things stand now, and they willhappily sell it to any government that will pay.)The history of nationalizing resources and industries in the United States is complicated. The official story is often that “we don’t do that.” But, of course, we do do that. We nationalized the paper currency industry with the creation of the Federal Reserve. We attempted to nationalize steel to break a strike in 1952. We nationalized passenger railroads in the 1970s. We nationalized most of the mortgage market in 2008 when the Department of Treasury took conservatorship over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also nationalized General Motors Acceptance Corporation in 2008-09, rebranded it as Ally Financial, and sold it back to private owners in pieces up until 2014. The common thread among these precedents is that we stepped in with public money when things were going very badly in order to subsidize private owners. Then, when things improved, we handed the assets back over so they could continue generating private profits.These past examples are helpful precedents but they have things backwards. We should not have waited for a complete collapse of the banking system to nationalize paper currency. We should not have waited for a collapse in the housing market to take democratic control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So long as we use public money only to bail out private industry, we will forever be responding to suffering rather than preventing it. How many public school children are we going to send to the McDonald’s parking lot before we understand that internet access is a public good? In a better world, universal public internet access would be a political tool even more effective than the Rural Free Delivery Program. Politicians of all stripes and in all levels of government would see the golden opportunity presented by record dissatisfaction with private ISPs like Comcast, and would jump at the chance to institute a popular, useful program that would expand the economy and provide public works jobs. A champion of community internet would emerge, driving federal grants for municipal ISPs alongside federal and state programs to buy, build, or co-opt long distance transmission lines and switching centers.If we have a strong understanding of what it means for something to be a public good, we will see the need to reach beyond defending those we already have—public education, the mail, the roads—and toward the public goods currently in private hands. The wires are a public good, necessary for education and governance and commerce. Whoever controls the physical internet controls a great deal of our lives, and our lives should be up to. Freedom, as the saying goes, is participation in power. As the power of the internet grows, so must our participation grow. Isn’t that exactly what democracy is for?For further reading on the physical internet and its ownership and control, check out the following books:",1

459,Holcomb rejects bill limiting local health department actions in third veto of session,0.0,45.33,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/04/gov-holcomb-vetoes-bill-limiting-local-health-department-actions/4945283001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/indianapolis-star-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,indystar,19,"Gov. Eric Holcomb vetoed a bill that could have made it more challenging for local health departments to implement COVID-19 business restrictions and require masks.Until this legislative session, Holcomb had only used his veto powers twice. Now he's vetoed legislation three times this session alone, just the latest sign of discord between the Republican legislative supermajority and Holcomb, a fellow Republican.Throughout the pandemic, Holcomb allowed cities and counties to enact more stringent restrictions than his own, a power that Indianapolis especially found necessary to use.Senate Bill 5, though, would have required restrictions from those local health departments to be approved by their local legislative bodies and, in the case of local cities, by the mayor.In Indianapolis, that means the city-county council and Mayor Joe Hogsett. Opponents to the bill worried that adding that extra level of bureaucracy would cause unnecessary delays in times of emergency.Holcomb agreed, arguing in his letter on the veto that the legislation would ""restrict necessarily flexibility in the law, and further undermine local responses to future public health emergencies.""Four months into office, Spartz announces reelection campaign in 5th Congressional District""(Local health officers) and their departments must frequently make urgent, complex decisions to safeguard public health where time is of the essence and expertise is critical,"" Holcombsaid in the letter, which was addressed to Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray.Holcomb also argued the legislation could have far reaching impact beyond the COVID-19 pandemic with other illnesses.""Right now it is critical that we maintain our local health expertise, flexibility and all tools needed to respond,"" Holcomb wrote. ""We must not do anything that jeopardized this as our heroic local health officials remain critical in the months to come as we accelerate our recovery and work to vaccinate many more Hoosiers.""Senate Bill 5 also would have allowed people to appeal local health department actions during an emergency to the local legislative body. Likewise, a health officer would need approval from a legislative body to go to court to enforce an order if needed, another step opponents worried could slow the process.The bill also required local legislative bodies to approve the appointment of health officers, and enabled them to remove them for good cause.Holcomb criticized those provisions as well.Local health officials had widely condemned the bill as it moved through the legislative process, but the discussion became much more relevant after Holcomb ended the statewide mask mandate and all business restrictions in April, after months of pressure from conservative lawmakers.Local communities were the ones left making decisions on what restrictions should be required to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some communities, including Marion County, opted to continue their mask mandates. Health advocacy organizations worried this legislation would hinder local officials' ability to make those informed decisions rapidly without political pressure.Lawmakers who supported the measure, however, argued the bill in fact was pro-local control.""This language is not a knee-jerk reaction or a combative response to any enforcement action,"" said bill author Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown when the Senate approved the legislation April 21, ""Senate Bill 5 simply creates a structural check and balance on a position that has unparalleled authority under these emergency orders.""Because lawmakers only recessed anddid not officially adjournwhen they finished their business last month in order to redistrict in the fall, they could come back at any time and override Holcomb's veto. They would only need a simple majority to override it.The final version of Senate Bill 5 passed the House by a 65-29 vote, and passed the Senate by a 37-12 vote.When asked by IndyStar, Bray, a Martinsville Republican, did not indicate whether lawmakers would move to overturn the veto.""My caucus and I felt that SEA 5 created another productive check and balance on our government,"" Bray said in a statement to IndyStar. ""I have only just learned of the veto and will discuss the matter with my caucus before we decide how to proceed.""House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, did not immediately respond to request for comment.Holcomb had already vetoed two measures this year: one that would allow the General Assemblyto call itself into a special sessionand anotherthat would have increasedlabeling for ethanol fuel at gas stationsThe former veto was overridden before lawmakers left the Statehouse last month. Last week,Holcomb filed a lawsuitasking a Marion County judge to stop the law regarding the special session, an action he took over the objection of Attorney General Todd Rokita.Holcomb thinks the state constitution only allows the governor to call lawmakers into session. Lawmakers, though, think they can call what they termed a special session.It was clear from the beginning of this session that Holcomb and lawmakers were not entirely on the same page. Early on, they voted to override a veto from the 2020 legislative session that prohibited local units of government from regulating most aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship.",2

Excluding autos, sales jumped 1.3% in June.The June increase in overall sales topped all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The median projection called for a 0.3% decrease in June sales, and a 0.4% gain excluding autos.The value of retail sales has risen sharply this year, supported by government stimulus, elevated savings and vaccinations. Consumers are beginning to shift more of their purchases toward services. Combined with still-solid retail demand, economists forecast household spending expanded at a robust pace in the second quarter.Nine of 13 retail categories posted increases in June sales, including solid gains at electronics and appliance outlets, clothing stores and restaurants.Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers fell 2% in June, likely in response to limited inventory as automakers face a supply chain crunch. A global semiconductor shortage has restrained vehicle production and pushed up prices.So-called control group sales, which are used to calculate gross domestic product and exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations, rose 1.1% in June after a sharp downward revision in May.The reopening of the economy, especially those businesses hit hardest by the absence of social activity during the pandemic, is helping bolster sales.PepsiCo Inc. reported its fastest sales growth in at least a decade, benefiting from consumers returning to restaurants, bars and stadiums. Meanwhile, Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants Inc. boosted sales 80% last quarter — returning to the revenue levels it saw before the pandemic.",2
463,Pandemic 2.0: Amazon Deforestation Could Unleash A Wave Of Pandemics Sooner Than We Think,-19.0,39.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/pandemic-2-brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-amazon-indigenous-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-09,therealnews,23,"Picture the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus spread from Wuhan, China,global deaths from COVID-19have surpassed 400,000. Economic loss estimates range from an optimistic$3.3 trillion up to $82 trillionin case of a depression. And social norms changed overnight as people adjusted to self-isolation, face coverings, and social distancing.Now imagine the world coping with a new pandemic every month. This is not a prophecy or a piece of dark fiction, and surely not a plot for an upcoming Hollywood flick. This is what the world’s leading climate scientists are warning will happen when, not if, the planet’s ecological balance with microorganisms tips over, unleashing waves of pandemics of varying severity.:At the heart of this cataclysmic scenario is the loss of global ecological reservoirs, such as the Amazon rainforest, which maintains the delicate balance between the natural world and the human colony. But despite the recent fires that ravaged the rainforest and drew global calls for action, Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing government is encouraging rapid deforestation to facilitate agribusinesses owned by political establishment figures with links to Brazil’s military and police.Antonio Oviedo, a researcherat the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a nonprofit defending indigenous rights in Brazil,told The Real Newsthat deforestation in the Amazon in the first three months of 2020 was 51% higher than in the corresponding period last year. “And it shot up by a whopping 170% in April compared to April 2019, and about 90% of this deforestation is illegal,” Antonio added worryingly. Terra Brasilis, another Brazilian organization, estimates the current year (Aug 2019—Jul 2020) is the worst ever for deforestation, with almost 6000 km2of the Amazon chopped down. That’s almost twice the area cleared last year.According to Greenpeace, the present waves of deforestation “pose a serious and imminent threat to the roughly one third of indigenous land that has not yet been demarcated by the state, and will encourage even greater deforestation.” Bolsonaro’s government has tried to pass legislation in recent weeks tolegalize huge land seizures, mostly comprising indigenous territories. The proposed law is still before Brazil’s congress and is expected to go to a vote in the coming weeks.Dismantling of Environmental Institutions and SafeguardsTo facilitate large-scale agribusinesses and other commercial use of the Amazonian forest, Bolsonaro’s government has employed tactics such as defunding regulatory bodies and relaxing environmental safeguards through executive orders. A number of indigenous lands in Brazil await formal approval from the president’s office for their protected status. On April 16, the government agency which implements policies relating to indigenous people, FUNAI, received  instructions that those lands can be made available for agribusiness. Claudio Angelo, spokesperson for the Climate Observatory organization in Brasilia, estimates some 90 indigenous territories out of more than 700 lands are awaiting the president’s signing, the last step in a lengthy bureaucratic land claim process.The pressure on federal regulatory agencies to relax rules has emboldened illegal operators who have reportedly moved inside protected lands. Oviedo says an estimated 20,000 illegal gold miners are inside the Yanomami lands alone—the largest of indigenous tribes located in the north of Brazil, with lands equaling the size of Portugal—“and they are within 5 kilometers of local tribes.” He added that in March FUNAI enacted a law forbidding outsiders from entering the protected lands, “but illegal miners are crossing over freely, increasing the risk for native populations’ exposure to COVID-19.”Despite the attempts by native tribes to self-isolate and move deep inside the forest, COVID-19 has spread to indigenous communities, causing the deaths and suffering forewarned by experts. According to theSpecial Secretariat for Indigenous Health(Sesai), Brazil’s federal body for providing healthcare for the native peoples, 2085 indigenous people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 82 have died so far. But theBrazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association(APIB), which tracks all indigenous cases, has reported 2600cases and 247 deaths among 94 ethnic groups. APIB claims the actual count is likely much higher due to underreporting.And health provisions are nauseatingly inadequate because of the budget cuts that severely constrain Sesai and its suboffices from delivering healthcare to the native people. Problems caused by Sesai’s shoestring budget are compounded by low staffing and a dearth of ventilators, and the nearest healthcare units are located nearly 200 miles from native communities,reportssuggest. “Medical facilities are working as hubs for spreading COVID-19 because of untrained staff and indigenous people have reportedly contracted COVID-19 after visiting there,” Oviedotold The Real News. “Also, food security is becoming another problem and indigenous people are told to go to cities for food assistance, which serves as an invitation to get the virus and take it back to the community,” he added.A Pandemic A MonthThis systematic dismantling of regulatory bodies and healthcare systems that protect the Amazon and its native people has already resulted in massive deforestation and created conditions for environmental catastrophe of epic proportions. In an exclusive interview with The Real News,Dr. Carlos Nobre, the leading environmental scientist in Brazil, said all new COVID and SARS viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics are generated by the lack of ecological balance with microorganisms.“There are hundreds of species of coronavirus present in the Amazon and there are hundreds of thousands of other types of viruses found there,” Dr. Nobre said. “If we disturbed this most diverse sanctuary of biological diversity that would mean disturbing the ecological balance of millions of species of microorganisms. If we moved beyond the tipping point in the next few decades, we have to be prepared for one pandemic a month.”Dr. Nobre adds the native people of the Amazon survived in the forest for 11,000 years because of their sense of maintaining a balance with the natural world. “Given the number of microorganisms existing in the forest, you can be certain that a virus or bacteria would have exterminated them. But they are very smart and they evolved the vision of living with the forest. And for 11,000 years there was not a single pandemic across the indigenous communities.” He lamented that the number of indigenous people in Brazil fell from 10-15 million to a mere 70,000 in the 1940s. “We’re the ones to cause that imbalance and bringing viruses to these native tribes.”Dr. Nobre’s three decades of research also warn of the Amazon reaching a tipping point in the face of growing deforestation, urbanization and global warming. “Those three factors happening simultaneously are driving a very large portion of the forest becoming a dry savanna (a drier forest compared to tropical rainforest where it rains all year). In our estimates, we are seeing 50%-60% of the Amazon almost at the edge of suburbanization and the tipping point almost being crossed because the forest in those areas are becoming drier.” He warned that if global warming and deforestation is not halted, most of the Amazon will irreversibly begin the transition to savanna, inevitably disturbing the ecological balance.The Right-Wing Orchestration of Death and DestructionDr. Nobre blames the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro for encouraging illegal activity inside the Amazon. “The political discourse the president has been issuing since he came into office in January 2019 has been encouraging environmental criminals because they feel there will be no punishment.” He observed that Brazil’s law-enforcing agencies have shrinking budgets, and some of the heads of divisions were fired because they were acting lawfully. “So, the message that went to the Amazon criminals was, we are never going to jail anymore because we have a president who supports what we are doing, who supports opening up more areas, who supports invasion of indigenous territories for illegal mining for illegal selective logging.”Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch echoes Dr. Nobre’s sentiment.In aninterview with The Real News, Poirier said the Bolsonaro regime has been an abject disaster for the Amazon, its peoples, and for the planet. “When we saw essentially fascists come into power last year with a package of regressions, regressive actions to cut down hard-fought human rights and environmental protections, we saw a process that has led us to the catastrophe we’re seeing today, which is actually not being talked about enough.” He lamented that not enough is being said about the catastrophic impact the Amazon’s destruction will have on the climate crisis, and that “all of this is being spurred simultaneously by this recklessly, this criminally irresponsible regime.”Highlighting the mitigation actions Amazon Watch is undertaking, Christian Poirier said: “We helped spearhead a moratorium on all industrial activities and criminal activities in and around indigenous territories during the COVID crisis that were signed onto by more than 200 global organizations and endorsed by all of the principal indigenous federations and organizations in the Amazon areas in which we work.” He said this action calls on governments to fulfill their duties, and for companies to be mindful of the consequences of their actions in the Amazon. “These businesses should know their activities are exacerbating this crisis gravely and they need to respect the moratorium at this critical moment,” he asserted.Principled journalism that gets to the roots of the crises we face is more important today than ever.Journalism that doesn't dwell in despair, but empowers you to take action.

Neither of the two, he argued, was a naturalized citizen at the time of Harris’ birth.Eastman pointed to the 12th Amendment and Article II of the U.S. Constitution. He also wrote that Harris cannot serve because of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.The law professor concluded that Harris’ background needs to be reexamined amid reports of Russian and Chinese election interference, writing that “it would be an inauspicious start for any campaign for the highest offices in the land to ignore the Constitution’s eligibility requirements.”Eastman was slammed for writing the column, with critics pointing out that his views on birthright citizenship are not shared by most constitutional law scholars.Asnoted, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth was also vetted by Biden’s team.Although a natural-born citizen, Duckworth was not born in the United States, so Democrats reportedly feared that Trump and his allies would attack her with birther conspiracy theories.“But with another Black nominee on the ballot, Trump is returning to his wheelhouse, questioning the citizenship of a candidate born in the United States,” the publication concluded.In their first joint press conference, Biden and Harris accusedTrumpof leaving the nation “in tatters.”The duo also slammed Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Biden saying that the commander-in-chief spends more time golfing than addressing the unprecedented public health crisis.Biden talked about Trump’s attacks on the California Democrat, suggesting that they do not come as a surprise “because whining is what Donald Trump does best.”",1

As protests raged around the world,1,400 researcherssigned an openlettercalling on their colleagues to stop collaborating with police on algorithms, and cities likeSanta Cruz,New Orleans, andOaklandvariously banned predictive policing, facial recognition, and voice recognition. But elsewhere, police chiefs worked to deepen partnerships with tech companies, claiming that the answer to systemic bias and racism was simply more data.In her new book, “Predict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policing,” sociologist Sarah Brayne slays that assumption with granular detail. An assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Brayne did months of fieldwork at the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the area, tagging along as cops used software from Palantir, PredPol, and other companies. She learned that software vendors routinely show up at the department to peddle their wares, like pharmaceutical representatives visiting doctors’ offices. She noted how police used an automated license plate reader mounted outside an emergency room to build out networks of victims’ associates. A sergeant explained that family or friends would often drop off an injured person and then speed away. With the automated license plate reader, he said, police could use plate numbers to determine who else was connected to the victim, even if there was no other evidence linking them to a crime.Riding along in department helicopters, Brayne saw how data was used to justify extreme measures. In order to get a reduction in crime in one division, police concluded that they had to fly helicopters overhead 51 times per week. They often increased that to 80 to 90 flyovers for good measure, meaning that many residents’ days were regularly interrupted by the noise of buzzing choppers. The cops seemed to register the intrusion. They dubbed the copters “ghetto birds.”Image: Courtesy Oxford University PressFor years, scholars and activists have critiqued the algorithms used in data-driven policing, arguing that they merely techwash bias by making sloppy investigative work seem objective. Leading the charge in Los Angeles is theStop LAPD Spying Coalition. Through public records requests, the group’s activists have obtaineddocumentson police use of data analytics, and in 2018, they successfullypushedthe city’s Office of the Inspector General toauditthe department’s use of technology. “Surveillance is basically the tip of the policing knife,” said Hamid Khan, a co-leader of the coalition. “When you look at policing and the history of policing, from our vantage point, it’s not about public safety when it comes to nonwhite folks. It’s about the content to cause harm.” Big data, he added, simply gives police more ways to do that.Brayne’s contribution is showing exactly how data is distorted in the hands of police. “Most sociological research on criminal justice has focused on those who are being policed,” she told The Intercept. “I very deliberately wanted to flip the lens to focus on those doing the surveilling — on the police themselves.”Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at American University and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement,” said that Brayne’s work is an unflinching look at what happens when people in power use emerging technologies. “Her book is a completely original inside look at the development of big data surveillance at the height of the first generation of its adoption,” he said. “Sarah has been given access to the reality of big data policing in a way that no one else has — and probably, because of her success, no one else ever will.”LAPD Captain Elizabeth Morales shows a printed map of predicted crime hot spots in the Foothill Division of Los Angeles, Calif., on Monday, October 24, 2016.Brayne first embedded with the department in 2013 as a 27-year-old graduate student. It was a critical moment for policing tech, and the LAPD and other departments were ramping up their use of technology. The LAPD had signed on with Palantir Gotham, whichmerges datafrom crime and arrest reports, automated license plate readers, rap sheets, and other sources. The department also had a contract with PredPol, which generates “boxes,” or hot spots, where property crimes like burglaries and auto theft are predicted to occur. A third program, Operation LASER, which stands for Los Angeles’ Strategic Extraction and Restoration program, used a points-based system, called a LASER score, to evaluate the risk that individuals posed.In Brayne’s first interview, a captain boasted that the LAPD was at the forefront of technology adoption, detailing how software that had been developed for counterterrorism work was helping the department ward off future crimes. Afterward, Brayne asked to go on a ride-along with an officer. That trip revealed a more complicated picture. Instead of pulling up PredPol’s software on the laptop mounted to his dashboard, the cop worked with a printout of PredPol’s hot spots. He explained that the department’s in-car laptops had trouble loading even standard internet browsers. So much for technological wizardry.Brayne and the officer took a break to eat In-N-Out burgers under a highway overpass, where they watched his colleagues bust up a grow operation and drag marijuana plants onto a flatbed truck. Then when they drove to a new location, Brayne noticed that the officer typed in his address manually, rather than let the car’s automatic vehicle tracker register his location. The union opposed officers being tracked, he explained. While predictive policing systems had caught average citizens in an opaque dragnet, police grew squeamish when the technology was turned back on them.The notion that better technology can fix policing dates to at least the early 20th century. Back then, police departments were closely tied to city government political machines. Arguing that a data-driven approach would make policing more professional, reformers introduced tactics drawn from military operations, including signal boxes, telephone kiosks, and pin mapping. The militarization of police accelerated during the 1960s and has continued to the present day, to the point where even departments in placid American suburbs now havearmored vehicles, night vision viewers, and bayonets.“That’s a very visible manifestation of the militarization of policing,” said Brayne. “But something that’s more invisible is this creep of surveillance software into the daily operations of policing.”A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s patrol car, outfitted with a computer system developed for the battlefield by a military contractor, is seen in Los Angeles on Nov. 16, 2011.After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security gave state and local police $35 billion in grants, a portion of which was spent on developing data infrastructure. The infusion of cash created needs where there had been none. Police chiefs realized that the data they collected for Homeland Security could also be used for regular policing. In Los Angeles, some officials came to believe that predictive analytics and big data might also solve the department’s many problems. The LAPD had been racked by a stream of high-profile scandals, most infamously the 1991 beating of Rodney King. In 2001, the Department of Justice imposed a consent decree, a court order mandating that the department conduct regular audits and capture more data on officers and crimes. (A spokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment for this article.)A key figure behind the shift toward predictive policing was William Bratton, who brought the data management system COMPSTAT to New York City before becoming the chief of the LAPD in 2002. Bratton oversaw the LAPD’s effort to merge various streams of data.One result was Operation LASER, which was funded with nearly a million dollars from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. When they came into contact with someone who seemed suspicious, officers filled out a card with the person’s name, address, physical characteristics, vehicle information, gang affiliation, and criminal history. Each new point of contact with police earned a person one additional point. “There are a lot of chickenshit violations you can stop someone for,” a sergeant explained to Brayne during a ride-along. “Yesterday, this individual might have got stopped because he jaywalked. Today, he might have got stopped because he didn’t use his turn signal or whatever the case might be. So that’s two points.” The sergeant went on to argue that even such minor violations could help police predict the next crime because, taken together, they show “who is out on the streets.”Such a system means, of course, that individuals in overpoliced neighborhoods can easily get caught up in a vicious cycle where they are, as Brayne writes, “more likely to be stopped, thus increasing their point value, justifying their increased surveillance, and making it more likely that they will be stopped again in the future.” But some of the administrators whom Brayne encountered were apparently less interested in accuracy than they were in amassing more records. The goal, one captain told her, was simply to get people “in the system”: to capture larger and larger amounts of data on seemingly harmless individuals in the hope that the data would help solve a crime later on. Once an officer had a person in the system, they could set an alert to automatically track changes in that person’s profile.Brayne watched Los Angeles police fill out cards for Operation LASER and noted that they often listed the people who were with a person when they were stopped. She calls this a “secondary surveillance network.” You don’t actually need to have contact with police to be caught up in the system; you just need to have had contact with someone who did. Similarly, Brayne learned that images captured by automated license plate readers sometimes showed the faces of people who were stopped with a person of interest. Those people too became data. When Brayne raised the issue of possible legal constraints around the rampant collection and sharing of information, an employee in the Los Angeles County Chief Information Office declared bluntly, “Consent is anachronistic.”In some cases, even being the subject of a query can boost someone’s suspiciousness. Brayne watched one detective search a national database for a juvenile. He remarked that he could see how many times other users had queried the same name. He claimed that the feature had helped police catch criminals because it told them other officers had suspected the same individual. When Brayne asked why that was useful, he replied, “Just because you haven’t been arrested doesn’t mean you haven’t been caught.”Decades of research and years of cellphone videos have shown, of course, that police regularly target people who haven’t committed crimes. On ride-alongs, Brayne watched cops run the plates of law-abiding drivers stopped at traffic lights, just in case the numbers turned up a record. But the anecdote underscores how thoroughly big data reinforces existing police biases. One captain claimed, “It’s just math.”A banner displays Palantir signage during the company’s initial public offering in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 30, 2020, in New York.In Brayne’s fieldwork, Palantir’s technology came in for special praise. “They catch bad guys during every training class,” one sergeant told her. A captain rhapsodized about the platform’s constant addition of new data sets, marveling at the addition of foreclosure information: “I’m so happy with how big Palantir got.” Another said of Palantir, “We’ve dumped hundreds of thousands [of dollars] into that. They are so responsive and flexible about what we want. They’re great. They’re going to take over the world. I promise you, they’re going to take over the world.”But up close, the software was only as good as the people maintaining and using it. To make sense of Palantir Gotham’s data, police often need input from engineers, some of whom are provided by Palantir. At one point in her research, Brayne watched a Palantir engineer search 140 million records for a hypothetical man of average build driving a black four-door sedan. The engineer narrowed those results to 2 million records, then to 160,000, and finally to 13 people, before checking which of those people had arrests on their records. At various points in the search, he made assumptions that could easily throw off the result — that the car was likely made between 2002 and 2005, that the man was heavy-set. Brayne asked what happened if the system served up a false positive. “I don’t know,” the engineer replied.There were dissenters. Some of the people tasked with implementing data-driven policing at the LAPD complained to Brayne that the software didn’t work as advertised. One person working in information technology said, “Our command staff is easily distracted by the latest and greatest shiny object.” Data integration was uneven. Some divisions had certain software, while others didn’t. Another employee told Brayne that the detective case management system was “sort of like a pimple,” adding, “they just, like, stuck it on top.”When management was out of the room, police were honest about their doubts. “Looks bitching, but it’s worthless,” one sergeant told Brayne of the LAPD’s data analysis infrastructure, which is housed at the department’s Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. One group of officers bought their captain a Ouija board to mock his faith in algorithms. A captain told Brayne that person-based predictive policing was “a civil liberties nightmare” and that he would never adopt it. (His division adopted it after he left.)Activists who have fought for years against department use of technology told The Intercept that Brayne’s work is useful — but only to a point. “It was very helpful to uncover and learn about the extensive amounts of stuff that LAPD was doing,” said Jamie Garcia, an organizer with Stop LAPD Spying. “But then what?” In general, she added, she is tired of academics treating surveillance like a problem to observe and evaluate. “The information goes back to the ivory tower, and the ivory tower has this conversation with themselves about what they think about it instead of that information being brought directly to the community.”Brayne said that she hopes her work can be useful to a broad variety of people. “Transparency is the first step towards accountability,” she said. “It is impossible to hold an individual or organization accountable if you don’t know what they’re doing.”Forrest Stuart, a sociologist at Stanford who studies policing, said that her book is essential at a moment when anti-racism protests have prompted some law enforcement officials to further embrace technology as a means for reducing bias. “Some of the most popular proposed solutions to the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and brown communities have involved new technologies,” he wrote in an email. “There is a sense that if we could just design a good enough computer program, we could deploy police more fairly and reduce, or perhaps even eliminate, unwarranted disparities in criminal justice. Brayne’s book makes us take real pause and recognize the faults in this techno-optimist dream.”The LAPD ended its contract with PredPol last April,citing financial constraintsbrought on by the pandemic. Operation LASER ended in 2019. But a range of othercompanies, including heavyweights likeAmazonandMicrosoft, have moved into the space nationally, and aguidebookpublished by the LAPD last year makes clear that big data will continue to prominently figure in policing in Los Angeles. Palantir, meanwhile, has lately expanded its access to data by moving into coronavirus tracking and vaccine safety analysis. Last year, the company brokered lucrative contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It went public in September. Since then, its stock prices have more than tripled.Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe U.S. risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, experts say.Schuyler MitchellProposed laws to curtail the use of PVC plastics have failed amid heavy lobbying.Prem ThakkerA new report shows Norfolk Southern spent $2.3 million to lobby the government in 2023.",1

Last month, Netanyahu – Israel's longest-serving PM (who'son trial for corruption) – failed to piece together a gov after Israel's March election...the fourth in two years. So centrist Yair Lapid and far-right leader Naftali Bennett teamed up to try to reach 61 seats, the number needed to rule parliament. Just before yesterday's deadline, the duo managed to pull it off.

472,Here is Everything to Know about Current Gun Control Legislation Efforts,-17.33,41.67,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36155972/gun-control-leglislation-austin-shooting/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-18,esquire,23,"In an appearance on CNN’son Sunday, public health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci spoke about the current epidemic attacking the United States. No, not that one; the other one. “When you see people getting killed, in this last month it's just been horrifying what's happened. How can you say that's not a public health issue?"" said Fauci when asked by host Dana Bash if gun violence was a public health emergency.Fauci’s comments came days after a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility left nine people dead, including the shooter, and only hours after a gunman opened fire outside of a bar in Kenosha, Wisconsin, killing three and injuring two. Later on Sunday afternoon, a shooter in Austin, Texas opened fire and killed three civilians.For those who are counting, that’s six innocent Americans dead within 24 hours in two separate shootings. It’s no wonder President Biden recently called America’s woefully predictable pattern of mass shootings “a national embarrassment” and urged Congress to take action.At the same time, the President doesn’t appear to be holding his breath. After the shooting in Boulder, Colorado, he announceda series of executive ordersmeant to begin the process of tackling gun violence in America. One of the most significant orders calls for a two-month review of homemade “ghost guns” which experts say will likely lead to a ban. Ghost guns are handmade fireguns that can either be assembled from a kit or 3-D printed. Because they don’t come with a serial number, the federal government has no way to trace them.Another important order deals directly with a weapon accessory used by the Boulder shooter known as a pistol-stabilizing brace. Stabilizers effectively turn a standard pistol into a deadlier and more accurate short-barreled rifle. Biden’s order will require pistols with stabilizers to be registered with the federal government and force buyers to go through a more rigorous application process. “There’s no reason someone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets, that can be fired from that weapon,”Biden saidwhile discussing the executive orders last Thursday. “Nobody needs that.”The president also announced his intentions to strengthen the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency in charge of enforcing federal gun laws, by nominating gun control advocate, David Chapman, to lead it. The notoriously beleaguered agency hasn’t had a director since 2015. If confirmed by the Senate, Chapman would be a reliable partner who Biden could count on to enforce new gun control legislation.These steps, though narrow in scope, indicate that Biden is willing to bypass Congress if and when it fails to take action.For the most part, executive orders can only be used to direct current legislation. They cannot create it. For better or worse, the power of lawmaking belongs to Congress. That’s why the NRA and the gun lobby have poured billions of dollars into congressional races for decades. But with the NRA now bankrupt and the Democrats in control of Congress, some lawmakers sense arenewed opportunityto pass meaningful gun control legislation. In fact, the House of Representatives has already voted in favor of two significant bills.The first measure expands background checks to include those purchasing weapons over the internet and at gun shows. Currently, neither type of purchase requires vetting. In-store purchases, which account for the majority of gun sales, require a routine background check. Eight Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the legislation.The second bill grants authorities 10 business days to complete federal background checks before a gun sale must be licensed. Currently, sales can proceed if the government fails to complete a background check of a prospective buyer within three days. Only two Republicans voted for the legislation.Gettings bills passed in the House is the easy part. The real hurdle is the Senate. That’s where gun control legislation has historically fallen apart. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said this time will be different and vowed tobring the bills to a vote.For the bills to pass in their current form, Sen. Schumer would have to secure 10 votes from Republican senators and also convince Sen. Manchin (D-WV) to vote for them. There’s virtually no chance of that happening. Sen. Manchin alreadytold reportershe opposes the legislation. That means for any legislation to make its way to President Biden’s desk for signing, congress will have to engage in a process they’re criminally bad at: negotiation.For what it’s worth, minority leader Mitch McConnell said he was open to the discussion of gun control but opposed the House legislation. Meanwhile, nearlytwo-thirds of Americanssupport stricter gun laws and over80 percent supportuniversal background checks. All of this begs the question: What kind of reforms are Republicans open to and how many more Americans must die before they finally propose a solution?Abigail Covington is a journalist and cultural critic based in Brooklyn, New York but originally from North Carolina, whose work has appeared in Slate,,Oxford American, and Pitchfork",1
473,The COVID Tracking Project is (nearly) gone. Can we see clearly now?,-4.0,45.0,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/the-covid-tracking-project-is-nearly-gone-can-we-see-clearly-now.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,cjr,18,"Alexis C. Madrigal and Robinson Meyer, colleagues at, set out to answer a simple question: how many people had been tested for the coronavirus in the US so far? The answer, it turned out, was actually quite complicated: in the absence of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was hard to tell whether low reported case rates to that point reflected lowincidenceor lowtesting. Madrigal and Meyer sent a form email to health officials in every state; they soon found out that the answer was the latter, and that the federal government did not have a handle on the numbers.As Emily Sohn reported for CJR, Jeff Hammerbacher—a data scientist who had been working to track the same information, and who knew Madrigal from college—saw their work and reached out. They teamed up, and soon, the COVID Tracking Project was born. It was meant, initially, as a short-term gap-filler. “Every day,” Erin Kissane, its managing editor, told Sohn in late March, “we hope the CDC will put us out of business.”But the days went by, and the CDC did not, leaving the Tracking Project’s collective of journalists and tech folk to serve,in their own words, as “a de facto source of pandemic data for the United States.”agreed to host the project; its team grew to include hundreds of volunteers, and the project’s founders solicited philanthropic donations to pay some of them. “It just got really complex,”Madrigal told CNN’s Brian Stelter recently. “At first, we just thought you could pull numbers off dashboards and that was gonna be the main process. As it turned out, we actually needed to do deep research. We made hundreds and hundreds of contacts with state officials… We added race and ethnicity data, we added outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, we added tracking of long-term care facilities. So all of those things came together to just require tons of labor; I mean, tens of thousands of hours of people’s time.” State and federal officials cribbed the project’s data. Other journalists became reliant on it.Now, finally, the project is winding down. It stopped collecting data ten days ago; it plans to spend the next couple of months on analysis work and archiving before shuttering completely. The analysis will mainly focus on data streams—around race and ethnicity, for instance—that are still insufficient, but the project’s founders are confident that federal officials are finally adequately replicating much of its core data, and, crucially, that the new Biden administration can be trusted not to turn off the lights at a moment’s notice.Writing last week, however, Madrigal and Kissane warned that the landscape of coronavirus data is “persistently messy.” The pandemic response “has been nominally or actually based on the idea that we know what is happening across the country to a precise degree,” they wrote. “And although this idea—that we have solid data about the movements of the pandemic and the effects of the response—is much closer to truth now than it was a year ago, it’s very far from universally accurate.”This week, Madrigal and Meyer expanded on that themein an essay for, pinpointing key truths about pandemic data and officials’ handling of it. The initial pandemic response plan assumed the presence of good data, and failed to account for kinks at every part of the data-production pipeline, from the local, to the state, to the federal. We now have much better national-level data on cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths—but this still offers a rather messy compilation of snapshots and time lags, not a real-time “window” into the current state of the pandemic, as officials sometimes imply. (Deaths often substantially lag cases, and commonly go unreported for weeks.) At least five states still “have disturbingly incomplete testing data”; nationally, tens of millions of rapid antigen tests appear to be unaccounted for. “Datamight seem like an overly technical obsession,” Madrigal and Meyer write. “But data are how our leaders apprehend reality.”The press, too. Over the course of the pandemic, responsible news organizations have pledged to “follow the science” and extolled the virtues of data-driven analysis, but as Madrigal and Meyer note, looking at data is less like “peering into a crystal ball” than “watching city sewers empty into a wastewater-treatment plant”—it’s more useful than not looking, “but you shouldn’t delude yourself about what’s in the water.” And yet,as I wrote in the early days of the pandemic, reporters moved quickly to paint unduly certain pictures with extremely incomplete information; reported cases and deaths, for example, were routinely relayed as “totals,” not as clear undercounts, which, of course, they were.Over time, data flows improved; testing, in particular, expanded, even prior to the election of a president who doesn’t view it asa conspiracy to make him look bad. But testing remains highly imperfect.Per the Tracking Project, reported daily tests hit a high-water mark close to 2.3 million in December—a figure,some experts then calculated, that was adequate tomost symptomatic COVID cases and close contacts, but still fell well short of the daily rate that would be needed to properlycontrolviral spread by identifying asymptomatic people. From a public-health standpoint,these metrics are subject to healthy scientific debate; from a journalistic standpoint, every additional test is an extra confirmed truth about the world, and yet media-industry leaders have never pushed with any real consistency or urgency to frame expanded testing,as I suggested last year, as a freedom of information issue. (We’re better at demanding to see information the government is hiding than information the government is failing to collect.) In the absence of a further massive ramp-up, thepercentageof tests coming back positive often offers more useful insights than flat numbers, yet many outlets haven’t pivoted to this metric with any consistency either. And in recent weeks, testing rates have generally declined.This could be a function of fewer people needing one (though, again, it depends how you define “need”), but it could also reflect public exhaustion with mitigation measures, bad weather, states’ shift to vaccine infrastructure, and other contingencies.As I wrote recently, journalists covering the pandemic still have to grapple, over a year in, with massive uncertainty. We still haven’t figured out how best to communicate this—not only around new challenges like vaccines and variants, that currently attract the bulk of our attention, but around the very basic building blocks that we use to define and measure surges and lulls, sickness and death. The visibility of these underpinning realities is still murky. Some outstanding journalists—not least at the Tracking Project—have focused on finding outlines of clarity, and for that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Many of us have instead acclimated to the murk, preferring to see what’s in front of us, even though it isn’t the full picture.Below, more on the pandemic:",2

The bill imposes fines on registration groups that turn in too many incomplete registration forms, while also allowing criminal penalties, including jail time, if the groups violate certain rules regarding voter registration.Republicans, including Secretary of State Tre Hargett,pushedthe bill after local election officials in Tennessee’s Shelby County weresuedin 2018 by a black voter group for their handling of voter registration forms.Under the new proposal, voter registration groups that turn in more than 100 “deficient” registration forms can be fined up to $2,000, and those that turn in more than 500 deficient applications would face fines up to $10,000. The groups also must be registered in state, are required to submit the registration forms within 10 days of collecting them, and are banned from paying workers per registration completed, under the legislation.Violating those rules could land a paid worker of a voter registration drive in prison for nearly a year and also impose a $2,500 fine. The penalties apply only to groups that pay workers for the collection of registrations.Voting rights group say that the legislation is geared at chilling voter participation efforts in a state that has one of the lowest registration rates in the country. Its supporters say it will prevent counties from having to spend thousands on correcting the deficient forms.In the 2018 litigation, the Tennessee Black Voter Project alleged that the officials in Shelby County, which contains Memphis, had failed to process thousand of applications the group had submitted. The county election commission claimed that the registration group had bombarded officials at the last minute with nearly 10,000 applications — some 55 percent of them either missing information, coming from felons, or being duplicates. The group countered that the applications were being deemed incomplete for minor deficiencies, like a failure to check the “Mr./Mrs./Ms” box.A state court judgeruledthat the election officials had to let those with incomplete applications vote with regular ballots on Election Day once they corrected the deficiencies at their polling place. That order, however, was mostly blocked by an appeals court in the state.The new legislation now heads for a vote in the Senate, where it has already been approved by a committee.",2
475,Only the Church Does Anti-Racism Right,4.33,32.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/anti-racism-tolton,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,ncregister,16,"In the decades I have been alive, I have seen herculean efforts to address racism. From kindergarten through college, adults taught against racism at every stage of my life. Institutions everywhere poured time and money into diversity. Newscasters were diverse, movie characters were diverse, the most popular family on television was the Huxtables, the most popular talk show wasOprah!, and the most popular actor was Will Smith. We celebrated Harriet Tubman in school, celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day at home, and then celebrated a Black American in the White House.So — why didn’t it work? Why is race the pressing issue that it is, as if the last 50 years never happened?In the wake of the killing of George Floyd in May, it is more clear than ever: You have to pick one or the other — either secularism or racial harmony. You can’t have both.All the secular-racial-diversity money in the world can’t solve a problem that stems from the human heart. Only faith can do that.If you believe that one God created all people in his image and commands that you love them, you will eventually have to confront your personal feelings, whatever they are, about people of different races. But relativism breeds intolerance. If there is no objective truth that we all have a duty to discover and honor, then whoever has the most power in a given situation determines what is right and wrong — whether it be your schoolteacher, the media or a police officer. You can’t teach that racism is wrongandthat “your truth is as good as my truth.”It is no accident that the greatest advances of human rights in the United States have come from religious people, from Sojourner Truth to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Catholic Church.So, why aren’t more people looking to the Church for answers? Mylast column, comparing the anti-racism movement and the pro-life movement, was the perfect introduction to this column, because there are two stories to the Church’s response to racism, just as there are two stories about the Church and abortion.One story is the Church’s unwavering condemnation of abortion, from the DidachetoPope Francis and U.S. bishops calling abortion the “preeminent” issue of our day. The other, darker, story is the fact that many of those who wrote, defended and expanded abortion laws were Catholic-raised, Catholic-educated, proud self-proclaimed Catholics: Joe Biden, Andrew Cuomo, Nancy Pelosi and Sonia Sotomayor, to name just a few. And don’t leave out Catholic voters who propped up the abortion industry with their votes.The Church’s fight against racism is the same way: There are Catholic heroes and villains, but the Church’s teaching gets it right.The Church’s history in Africa starts when Jesus fled there as an infant. It continues with the first individual baptismstoryin the Acts of the Apostles—Philip baptizing an Ethiopian. The Ethiopian Church became one of the world’s earliest and most beautiful expressions of Christianity.The Church’s teaching on slavery has certainly developed, but you can see it unfolding from the beginning. Paul preached obedience to slaves, just as he preachedobedienceto the citizens of unjust Roman rulers. But he alsourgedChristians to showkindnessbeyond what is owed to “property” to slaves, madeone slave“a brother,” andtold usall that we are “neither slave nor free.”It is difficult to track Church teaching on slavery, because countries have embraced various economic arrangements that bind laborers to bosses, including: serfs, indentured servants, apprentices, the military draft, wards of the state, etc. Certainly, though, chattel slavery has always been “the fruit of covetousness, of degradation, of savagery,” as Church Father John Chrysostom put it in the fourth century.As racial slavery grew in the 15th century, so did the Church’s denunciations, with papal threats to excommunicate slavers as early as 1435, thenrepeatedagain and again for centuries.When the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, Black Catholics had already been on the continent for nearly 100 years in St. Augustine, Florida, Father Cyprian Davis points out in hishistory,Black Catholics in America. The nearby Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, Florida, established in 1738, would become the oldest Black town in America. On the West Coast, when Los Angeles was founded in 1781, more than half of its families were Black.But racist Catholics were here early, too: Bishops were sometimes part of the solution and sometimes part of the problem, often keeping silent on race issues. Bishops’ sins included agreeing to slave owners’ demands that slaves not be catechized, taking sides with unions against black laborers, and treating black women religious orders shamefully. Startling Vatican interventions were sometimes necessary, as when Pope Pius IX agreed to place one bishop’s terrible pastoral letter about slavery on the “Index of Forbidden Books” in 1864, or when, in 1904, the Vatican complained that the “condition of Catholic negroes” in the United States was “not in conformity with the spirit of Christianity, which proclaims the equality of all men before God.”But that’s how the Church works. People are sinners; the Church corrects them — and alongside the villains are saints and heroes. Saints celebrated by the Black community are well known, from Perpetua and Felicity to the Venerable Augustine Tolton. Black Catholic heroes likejournalistDaniel Rudd (1854-1933) are less known.He was a pioneering Catholic journalist in 19th-century America who had a clear-eyed view of race in America. “The Catholic Church alone can break the color line. Our people should help her to do it,” he wrote. “We need the Church; the Church wants us.”He saw the Church as the world’s best answer to racism. Why?First, he said, “because she has up to this time been the only successful leader of men of all the other races,” he wrote.That’s a great point. Anyone who dreams of an international multiracial organization dedicated to love should be advised that one already exists. The Catholic Church doesn’tstrivefor diversity. Itisdiverse. Worldwide, more than two-thirds of Catholics are nonwhite. By 2050, five of the 10 countries with the largest Christian populations will be in Africa. In America, Catholic churches aremore diversethan other denominations.Second, Rudd wrote, “[T]he Catholic Church is not only a warm and true friend of the Colored people but is absolutely impartial in recognizing them as the equals.”Jesus said we were to love every neighbor as ourselves — even strangers; even Samaritans; even our enemies — and the Church teaches that we all have infinite dignity.A third reason is the Church’s social teaching. “We have noticed in many of the papers published by Colored men statements that the Catholic Church is not and has not been the Negro’s friend,” Rudd wrote. “[W]e call attention to the encyclical letter of our Holy Father, Pope Leo XII. … In its treatment of the rights of rich and poor it has not been equaled by any writer upon this subject, because it comes from the authority of the teaching Church.”A last reason the Catholic Church is best on race is its focus on reconciliation. Author Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers is a modern-day Daniel Rudd.“If we are to defeat the evils of racial injustice, we must always lead with love,” he said in a recent speech, “not rioting or looting or vandalism.“Racism is learned behavior, and Catholics can play a significant role … by taking a hands-on approach.”The Church’s approach has always been to convert, not just condemn. Relativism and violence will always fail. The Church has the only answer to racism — God’s.",1
476,Data Brokers Are a Threat to Democracy,-7.0,37.67,https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-data-brokers-are-a-threat-to-democracy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-13,wired,25,"You’ve probably neverheard of Acxiom, but it likely knows you: The Arkansas firmclaimsto have data on 2.5 billion people around the world. And in the US, if someone’s interested in that information, there are virtually no restrictions on their ability to buy and then use it.Enter the data brokerage industry, the multibillion dollar economy of selling consumers’ and citizens’ intimate details. Much of the privacy discourse has rightly pointed fingers at Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, which collect users’ information directly. But a far broader ecosystem of buying up, licensing, selling, and sharing data exists around those platforms. Data brokerage firms are middlemen of surveillance capitalism—purchasing, aggregating, and repackaging data from a variety of other companies, all with the aim of selling or further distributing it.Data brokerage is a threat to democracy. Without robust national privacy safeguards, entire databases of citizen information are ready for purchase, whether to predatory loan companies, law enforcement agencies, or even malicious foreign actors. Federal privacy bills that don’t give sufficient attention to data brokerage will therefore fail to tackle an enormous portion of the data surveillance economy, and will leave civil rights, national security, and public-private boundaries vulnerable in the process.Large data brokers—like Acxiom, CoreLogic, and Epsilon—tout the detail of their data on millions or even billions of people. CoreLogic, for instance,advertisesits real estate and property information on 99.9 percent of the US population. Acxiompromotes11,000-plus “data attributes,” from auto loan information to travel preferences, on 2.5 billion people (all to help brands connect with people “ethically,” it adds). This level of data collection and aggregation enables remarkably specific profiling.Need to run ads targeting poor families in rural areas? Check out one data broker’s “Rural and Barely Making It” data set. Or how about racially profiling financial vulnerability? Buy another company’s “Ethnic Second-City Strugglers” data set. These are just some of the disturbing titles captured in a 2013 Senatereporton the industry’s data products, which have only expanded since. Many other brokers advertise their ability to identify subgroups upon subgroups of individuals through criteria like race, gender, marital status, and income level, all sensitive characteristics that citizens likely didn’t know would end up in a database—let alone up for sale.These companies often acquire the information through purchase, licensing, or other sharing agreements with third parties. Oracle, for example, “owns and works with” over 80 data brokers, according to a 2019report, aggregating information on everything from consumer shopping to internet behavior. However, many companies also scrape data that is publicly viewable on the internet and then aggregate it for sale or sharing. “People search” websites often fall into this latter category—compiling public records (property filings, court documents, voting registrations, etc.) on individuals and then letting anyone on the internet search for their information.All of these unchecked practices undermine civil rights. Companies that boast holding thousands of data points on millions or billions of people—all for selling them to whomever is buying—themselves represent the aggregation of unrestrained surveillance power. This is particularly dangerous to the less powerful. As centuries of surveillance in the United States have madeundeniably clear, the impact of stockpiling individuals’ personal information will fall hardest on the already oppressed or marginalized: the poor, Black and brown communities, Indigenous populations, LGBTQ+ individuals, undocumented immigrants. “People search” websites in particular can publicize addresses and thusenableintimate partner violence ordoxing. The strong financial incentives to sell data, with virtually nonexistent limitations, gives these companies every reason to share their data with others, including those who use it for harm.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoLaw enforcement already buys up data from brokers. The Department of Homeland Security, including subagencies responsible forputting children in cages, have purchasedcell phone location dataon millions of Americans,home address informationto support deportations, andhome utility datafor investigations, among others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has alsobeen purchasingcell phone location data from data broker Venntel. These practices circumvent democratic accountability: Agencies buy the information without warrants, and in doing so may bypass prohibitions on companies handing data directly to law enforcement. Plus, the data may not even be accurate. Aninvestigationbyidentified dozens of US cases over the last decade where individuals were denied housing because screening companies used bad information, often purchased from data brokers or pulled from “people search” broker websites. Citizens also getrejectedfrom jobs because of background checks relying on incorrect data.The unregulated sale of massive databases of citizen information—and the unregulated aggregation and publication of that information online—also undermines national security. This was one of themissing elementsof the policy debate over TikTok. If the US government is concerned about foreign authoritarian powers building detailed profiles on citizens, or even just on government personnel, then data brokers’ ability to sell, share, or publish intimate data sets on Americans with virtually no restriction should be of urgent concern too. Foreign powers could buy this data through shell companies or steal it by hacking. It could then be used to run microtargeted election ads. It could be used to inform counterintelligence operations or identify persons of interest in the business community. Criminal groups could even use this information to target politicians or judges.Not to mention, the largest data brokers are lobbying more aggressively in Washington. Another recent investigation byfound that25 such companies spent $29 million on lobbying in 2020, rivaling the efforts of Facebook or Google. That's why it’s more urgent than ever that legislators and regulators address this industry as a key part of protecting Americans’ privacy and curbing harms the industry causes abroad. With zero safeguards, this data sale will only continue threatening democracy. Federal privacy legislation should consider all companies that sell data as part of the data brokerage economy,not justthose who sell data on third parties. Local and state laws on public records should likewise account for the intimate partner violence and doxing risks of that information getting scraped and published on the global internet. The unregulated practice of data brokerage is incredibly dangerous and ever more harmful—and policymakers can ignore it no longer.WIRED Opinionhere, and see our submission guidelineshere.

477,Fauci says US would still have smallpox & polio if vaccines got the same pushback then as they do now in attack on Fox,9.33,38.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/529515-fauci-smallpox-disinformation-fox/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,rt,25,"White House Covid-19 adviser Anthony Fauci has argued that if the US government faced the same level of vaccine hesitancy when smallpox and polio vaccines were rolled out, the diseases would still run rampant in the US.While US President Joe Bidenpointedthe finger at Facebook as the main culprit behind underwhelming vaccine uptake in the US, Faucitooka shot at the conservative cable news media.Responding to CNN’s Jim Acosta question of whether Tucker Carlson’s hugely popular show on Fox News would have prevented the eradication of dangerous diseases in the US had it been around decades ago, Fauci appeared to agree.“Do you think we could have eradicated polio or defeated the measles if you had Fox News night after night warning people about these vaccine issues that are, you know, bunk?”Acosta asked Fauci during an interview on Saturday.Dr. Anthony Fauci to@Acosta: ""We probably would still have smallpox and we probably would still have polio in this country if we had the kind of false information that's being spread now.""pic.twitter.com/MVUxEPX5yf“If we had had the pushback for the vaccines the way we’re seeing on certain media, I don’t think it would have been possible at all not only to eradicate polio, we probably would still have smallpox,”Fauci said, before adding that he was“certain”that polio would have been still active in the US.The US had its last outbreak of smallpox back in 1949, and since 1972, the vaccine is no longer commonly administered. The last wild case globally was in 1977. Shortly after 9/11, President George W. Bush ordered smallpox vaccinations for 500,000 US troops in high-risk parts of the world and frontline healthcare workers who were willing to get vaccinated. However, at the time there were concerns about possible life-threatening side effects of the jab, with the New York Timesreportingthat“the decision had been difficult for President Bush, given the probability that some people would die of the vaccine’s side effects.”According to a 2003 modelstudy, published in theNew England Journal of Medicine, if 60 percent of the US population was vaccinated, this would be beneficial in an unlikely scenario of a national bioterrorist attack with the smallpox virus, but otherwise would have caused some 482 deaths nationally.The US has been polio-free since 1979, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) crediting“a successful vaccination program”with two vaccines introduced in the mid-1950s and early 1960s for uprooting the disease in the US. Worldwide, polio cases have plummeted dramatically since the late 1980s, with the World Health Organization reporting only 22 cases in 2017. And while polio has been almost eradicated, save for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it remains epidemic, the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign was called into question in light of a 2019 WHO report voicing concerns that more polio cases were attributed to a cheap oral vaccine than to a wild virus.",1

Biden said July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today’s job news brought us something else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs.""Biden went on to say, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.""Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do?Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed over some important context.Theofficial government datashows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million.In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs.Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context.A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he’s not No. 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden’s 2.1%.Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting aside subsequent increases in population).Given the severity of the pandemic recession, that would be a significant bounceback — but it hasn’t happened yet.Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first few months go, so Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples.That said, experts say that Biden does deserve some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief.The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Biden said, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history.""Biden is right on the numbers and on how they compare with his recent predecessors in the Oval Office.However, this talking point glosses over the reality that the U.S. economy remains almost 6.8 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, comparing presidents as Biden did is highly sensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration; Biden entered office during a deep recession, but he took over on the upswing, a situation that not all presidents have benefited from.We rate the statement Half True.",1

Also, one mention of the Daily Progress in Charlottesville bungled the name. We apologize for the errors, they have been corrected.Update:We’ve removed one item from this list — The Cleveland (Ohio) Plain Dealer announcedit would cut 22 newsroom employees— because it was announced before the coronavirus hit.According to The Associated Press, “The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland has been reduced as an organization to little more than the name atop its front page after owners laid off 10 of its remaining 14 union journalists.”If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails.

Ro Khanna Says He’ll Vote Against Democratic Party Platform Because It Doesn’t Include ‘Medicare For All’,-17.0,42.33,https://dailycaller.com/2020/08/13/ro-khanna-vote-against-democratic-party-platform/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-caller-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,dailycaller,25,"Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna said Thursday he will be voting against his own party’s platform during its national convention.In anop-ed, Khanna said the main reason he will be voting against the platform because it does not include “Medicare for All.” Khanna voiced his passion for the issue, comparing health care to civil rights. Khanna also added that while he won’t be voting for the Democratic party’splatform, he will “do everything possible” to help elect 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris against President Donald Trump.“I believe that moving away from a profit-based healthcare system is the moral issue of our time. And in the final analysis, because of that belief, I could not vote for a platform that lacks a clear statement supporting Medicare for All,” Khanna wrote in his piece.“Harry Truman ran and won on universal healthcare in 1948, and it was part of Democratic Party platforms until 1980. Thirty-six years later, the 2016 platform merely called for lowering the eligibility age for Medicare to 55. The 2020 platform proposes raising the goal to 60. That is not incrementalism; that is moving backwards,” Khannacontinued. “I will be voting ‘No’ on the platform because when we say that healthcare is a human right, we must truly mean it—and fight for it.”Harris haspreviously saidshe would like to get to universal health care coverage by growing Medicare. Bidencriticized Harrisfor her position on healthcare at a debate in July 2019, saying she has had “double talk” on the costs of Medicare for all.The Democratic National Convention will take place from August 17 through August 20, 2020.",1

Erickson asked.'I know you'd ask it,' Biden replied heatedly, wearing two masks. 'I have no response, it's another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.'I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir?He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it.

Hunter is seen with Biden above in 2016On Thursday night, ABC News host George Stephanopoulos, a former Democratic advisor, sparked controversy when he declined to ask about Hunter's emails during a 90-minute town hall.Biden's campaign previously responded to the Post report with a statement saying 'Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing.'Hunter's emails were provided by Rudy Giuliani to the New York Post after a computer repair store owner said he'd found them on a hard drive.The store owner said a man who he was unable to identify brought three computers into his store for repair last fall and never picked them up. He said he then made a copy of the emails and images on the hard drives, and provided them to the FBI and to Giuliani, Trump's lawyer.The emails suggest that Biden, who has always denied knowledge or involvement in his son's business dealings, was more deeply involved than he has previously admitted.'Mr. Biden, what is your response to the New York Post story about your son, sir?' CBS News reporter Erickson asked'I know you'd ask it,' Biden replied heatedly, wearing two masks. 'I have no response, it's another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask'The trove of emails have set of a series of political shockwaves including:Twitter added to the controversy when it blocked links to Post articles about the revelations, a decision the social media platform later backtracked.On Friday, President Donald Trump claimed Biden had a 'very bad showing' at his town hall with ABC's Stephanopoulos and slammed the network for not asking about Hunter.'Sleepy Joe Biden had a very bad showing last night, despite the fact that @GStephanopoulos didn't ask him any questions on his being a 'corrupt politician'.

482,Hillary Clinton admits she wanted to tell Donald Trump to ‘shut up’ during presidential debate,-6.33,51.0,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hillary-clinton-admits-she-wanted-to-tell-donald-trump-to-shut-up-during-presidential-debate-2020-09-30,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,marketwatch,25,"The combativefirst presidential debate of the 2020 electionsaw both candidates talking over each other and exasperating the moderator —not to mention disgusting many of the viewers.Among those watching was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the previous presidential candidate to face off with Donald Trump on a debate stage back in 2016 — and she has some thoughts about last night’s debate debacle.Tuesday night’s chaotic debate saw President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden insulting each other, interrupting each other and often straying from the agreed-upon topics. And while both men interrupted each other,by Slate’s count, Trump interrupted Biden at least 128 times, compared with Biden interrupting “dozens” of times. Biden got so exasperated early into the roughly 90-minute debate that he said, “Will you shut up, man” — which quickly became the line of the night.Trump, Biden blast each other on economy, coronavirus in fiery first debateThe hashtag #shutupman was trending on TwitterUS:TWTRwell into Wednesday morning, and the Biden campaign was already selling $30 T-shirts sporting the phrase online by the end of the debate.While many viewers lamented that political discourse has boiled down to the candidates insulting each other rather than speaking about the issues most important to the American public during a health and economic crisis, some wished that Clinton had also told Trump to “shush” or “keep yapping man” like Biden did back when she faced off with Trump in 2016 — when by Slate’s count, Trump interrupted her at least 51 times during the first debate.Presidential debate antics leave many viewers disgusted“I so feel for Hillary now,” wrote author and lawyer Jill Filipovic on Twitter, “because I’m positive she wanted to say [shut up] and couldn’t.”To which Clinton responded, “You have no idea.” Her response was “liked” more than 61,00 times, retweeted more than 11,000 times and drew almost 900 comments by Wednesday morningClinton has expressed regret that she didn’t push back harder on Trump four years ago when he interrupted her — or when, in their infamous town hall debate, he stalked behind her on the stage.“He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled,”she wrote in her 2017 memoir “What Happened,” adding that she thought of turning around to tell Trump to back off, with a dismissive line such as, “I know you love to intimidate women, but you can’t intimidate me.” But she ultimately decided against it.First Trump-Biden debate: Fox News’ Chris Wallace, the moderator, criticized after chaotic clash in ClevelandShe tweeted later on Tuesday night that she was “so proud” of Biden for his debate performance, and “more confident than ever that he’s the leader with the experience we need right now.”And when Pete Buttigieg’s husband Chasten tweeted his concern about Clinton, writing, “Girl I’m so sorry,” she responded with, “Thanks, I’m fine. But everyone better vote.”Google searches for K-shaped recovery, white supremacy and ‘how to move to New Zealand’ spiked during the debateThe remaining two debates will have “additional structure,”the Commission on Presidential Debates promised in a statement on Wednesday, “to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues.” There are two more presidential debates scheduled in October, andthe vice presidential candidates will square off next Wednesday.",2
483,Symbols and Words from the Pope in Iraq,1.67,38.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/symbols-and-words-from-the-pope-in-iraq/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-09,theamericanconservative,25,"It was the clumps of beard hair on the ground that stay in my memory, even more than the destroyed buildings. Walking around the Old City of Mosul in May 2018, accompanied by an Iraqi police general and armed guards, we were guided along the paths that had been cleared of ISIS booby-traps and unexploded coalition bombs. Several of the churches had only been cleared of bodies in the previous days, and the unpleasant sludge of remains was still visible on the floors.The Islamic State had used many of the churches in the Old City, all now destroyed or severely damaged, as headquarters, prisons, and torture chambers. My friend—a journalist and fellow Englishman traveling with me—remarked that there was human hair on the floor; I told him it was just carpet. Yet as we looked into a room where another body had been, I realized that ithuman hair, facial hair. The general told us that ISIS fighters had shaved their beards in the last days of fighting in order to avoid capture. During their brutal control of Mosul, where Abu Al-Baghdadi had proclaimed the caliphate, from 2014 to 2017, men of the Islamic State were expected to grow their beards long, and could face 20 lashes if they shaved.Destruction was all around: cars riddled with bullet holes or upside down, and so many buildings destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A year later I was back. The situation had improved somewhat, with some of the rubble cleared and many buildings, including the building where ISIS threw homosexuals from the roof, fully demolished. However, the churches were still in wreckage, and the only church due to reopen was a prefabricated building that had been in a refugee camp in Erbil, which was being moved to Mosul. Virtually no Christian families had returned, and there was no resident priest or bishop.This last Sunday, Pope Francis became not only the first pope in history to visit Iraq, but one of the very few international figures to venture into the Old City of Mosul. His short visit, to the same square, surrounded by the destroyed churches of the different denominations that had once thrived in this ancient city, was a remarkable moment, perhaps the most remarkable picture of the three-day visit to Iraq. It was not so much what he said—he recited a prayer for all the victims of war and violence and called for peace and toleration—but the symbolism of his presence. There is still no resident bishop, only one resident priest, and that pre-fabricated building is now the Church of the Annunciation, the only functioning church in the city. Very few Christian families have returned.Mosul has not been rebuilt and many residents feel that the Iraqi government has greatly neglected the city. It is still considered dangerous, with ISIS cells re-emerging and, more importantly, the different Shia militias (who are the real powerbrokers) vying for control. Add to that the story that was barely touched on by the world media—the desire of an expansionist Turkey to claim back Mosul, a city it once controlled under the Ottoman empire—and the full import of the moment becomes apparent: The pope of Rome came when so many fear to return.Iraq’s beleaguered Christian population, and other religious minorities, especially the Yazidis, hoped that the pope’s visit will bring the world’s attention to their plight, and that the civil powers in both Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government would fully recognize their civil rights. Christians specifically wanted Pope Francis to encourage them, acknowledge the martyrdom that many suffered, and be a voice for their future. His words to Iraqi civic leaders on his arrival, apart from the usual niceties, had two direct challenges that the precarious minority groups wanted to hear: He challenged corruption and “disregard for law” in Iraqi society, and he asked that “no one be considered a second-class citizen.” The Iraqi Constitution treats all non-Muslims as second-class citizens, not equal under the law, so this statement was essential, but not as forceful as many had hoped it would be.Perhaps the most powerful words addressing the suffering Christians had endured were uttered in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation, after the meeting with civil leadership. That was the church where, in 2010, Islamist terrorists had attacked the congregation during mass, detonating suicide vests to kill two priests and more than 40 men, women, and children. The pope described the cathedral as a place “hallowed by the blood of our brothers and sisters who here paid the ultimate price for their fidelity to the Lord and His Church.” He reminded the Christians, and more importantly those who deny the Christian population a place in Iraq, that Iraq is a “land so closely linked to the history of salvation, and you are a part of that history.”Many Christians in Iraq had worried that the emphasis of the Vatican would be on religious dialogue and “Human Fraternity.” And that was certainly a major feature of the visit, referred to in almost every speech. The key moment, joint prayers with other religious groups at the birthplace of Abraham in Ur, was certainly a striking spectacle, but noticeably absent and unmentioned was the former Jewish community of Iraq. The great fear of Christians is that what happened to the Jews will happen to them.  Francis strongly condemned the persecution of the Yazidi community, something to be welcomed, and particularly drew the world’s attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and children still missing. The courtesy visit to the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraq’s Shiite Muslims, did not bring his signature to the Abu-Dhabi agreement on “Human Fraternity,” signed in February 2019 that the Vatican had hoped for, but Sistani’s words on the right of Christians to equality in Iraqi society were very valuable.Apart from the hugely symbolic moments in Mosul on Sunday, the last two events of the trip were meant to be entirely devoted to the Christian communities of the Nineveh Plain who have suffered so much at the hands of ISIS. Undoubtably the pope’s presence was the cause of the greatest joy. Perhaps his rather understated words both in Qaraqosh, the largest Christian town on the Nineveh Plain, and in the final mass in Erbil will not be remembered for their lack of emphasis on the sufferings the communities had endured. While encouraging Christians to “not give up,” and “not lose hope,” peculiar phrases in the last homily at the soccer stadium in Erbil warned that “hearts must be cleansed from the temptations of power and money,” which caused a degree of confusion, given that most of the Christians on the Nineveh Plain have neither. Some are speculating that the influence of Fr. Antonio Spadaro, one of the Pope’s closest advisors, could be seen in many of the speeches and homilies.The long-term success of the visit will be judged on two factors: firstly, whether Christians and other religious minorities are given equal rights under the Iraqi Constitution; and secondly, whether the dangerous level of emigration of Christian families and young people can be reversed, which may depend on economic stability and the hope of employment. The fact that the pope came, in a time of pandemic and danger, is something all Iraqis, and certainly the indigenous Christian community, welcomed and appreciated with great joy. Whether the visit will be remembered as a beautiful symbol, and not much else, remains to be seen.",1
484,White House faces bipartisan backlash on Haitian migrants,-2.33,46.67,https://apnews.com/article/texas-del-rio-alejandro-mayorkas-de6e8368484e5a45788c808596a9b4d3,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,apnews,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is facing sharp condemnation from Democrats for its handling of the influx of Haitian migrants at the U.S. southern border, after images of U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback using aggressive tactics went viral this week.Striking video of agents maneuvering their horses to forcibly block and move migrants attempting to cross the border has sparked resounding criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who are calling on the Biden administration to end its use of a pandemic-era authority to deport migrants without giving them an opportunity to seek asylum in the United States.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., an administration ally, said images of the treatment of the migrants “turn your stomach” and called on the administration to discontinue the “hateful and xenophobic” policies of Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.“The policies that are being enacted now — and the horrible treatment of these innocent people who have come to the border — must stop immediately,” Schumer told the Senate on Tuesday.At the same time, the administration continues to face attacks from Republicans, who say Biden isn’t doing enough to deal with what they call a “crisis” at the border.Reflecting the urgency of the political problem for the administration, Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday the images “horrified” him, a seeming shift in tone from a day earlier, when he and others were more sanguine about the situation at the border.Mayorkas announced later that the agents involved have been placed on administrative duties pending the outcome of an investigation. “The actions we’re taking are swift and strong, and we will take further action as the facts adduced in the investigation compel,” he said on Twitter.It’s a highly uncomfortable position for the administration, led by a president who has set himself up as a tonic for the harshness of his predecessor. But immigration is a complex issue, one no administration has been able to fix in decades. And Biden is trapped between conflicting interests of broadcasting compassion while dealing with throngs of migrants coming to the country — illegally — seeking a better life.The provision in question, known as Title 42, was put in place by the Trump administration in March 2020 to justify restrictive immigration policies in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But the Biden administration has used Title 42 to justify the deportation of Haitian migrants who in recent days have set up an encampment in and around the small city of Del Rio, Texas. The provision gives federal health officials powers during a pandemic to take extraordinary measures to limit transmission of an infectious disease.A federal judge late last week ruled the regulation was improper and gave the government two weeks before its use was to be halted, but the Biden administration on Monday appealed the decision.“The Biden administration pushing back on this stay of expulsions is another example of broken promises to treat migrants with respect and humanity when they reach our borders to exercise their fundamental right to asylum,” said Karla Marisol Vargas, senior attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project and co-counsel on the litigation.NAACP President Derrick Johnson demanded a meeting with Biden to discuss the situation and called the treatment of the Haitian migrants “utterly sickening.”“The humanitarian crisis happening under this administration on the southern border disgustingly mirrors some of the darkest moments in America’s history,” he said in a statement.Shortly after the judge’s decision on Friday, Homeland Security officials formed a plan to begin immediately turning the groups of Haitian migrants around, working against the clock. But people kept coming.Trump essentially put a chokehold on immigration. He decreased the number of refugees admitted to a record low, made major changes to policy and essentially shut down asylum.Biden has undone many of the Trump-era policies, but since his inauguration, the U.S. has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials. The Haitian migrants are the latest example.More than 6,000 Haitians and other migrants have been removed from the encampment in Del Rio, and Mayorkas predicted a “dramatic change” in the number of migrants there within the next two to four days as the administration continues the removal process.As the controversy swirled around him, Biden spent his Tuesday address at the U.N. General Assembly in New York calling for the global community to come together to defend human rights and combat injustice worldwide, declaring, “the future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it.”The remarks stood in notable contrast to images of the Border Patrol agents on horseback. Biden himself seemed to acknowledge the challenge his administration faces with immigration, offering a clipped response when asked by a reporter after his U.N. remarks to offer his reaction to the images.“We’ll get it under control,” he insisted.Vice President Kamala Harris also weighed in, telling reporters in Washington that she was “deeply troubled” by the images and planned to talk to Mayorkas about the situation. Harris has been tasked with addressing the root causes of migration to the U.S., and emphasized that the U.S. should “support some very basic needs that the people of Haiti have” that are causing them to flee their homes for the U.S.Videos and photos taken in recent days in and around Del Rio show Border Patrol agents confronting Haitians along the Rio Grande near a border bridge where thousands of migrants have gathered in hopes of entering the country.One Border Patrol agent on horseback was seen twirling his long leather reins in a menacing way at the Haitian migrants, but not actually striking anyone. There was no sign in photos and videos viewed by The Associated Press that the mounted agents were carrying whips or using their reins as such when confronting the migrants.The agents, wearing chaps and cowboy hats, maneuvered their horses to forcibly block and move the migrants, almost seeming to herd them. In at least one instance, they were heard taunting the migrants.Asked about the images on Tuesday, Mayorkas told lawmakers that the issue had been “uppermost in my mind” ever since he had seen them. He said the department had alerted its inspector general’s office and directed that staff from the Office of Professional Responsibility be present round-the-clock in Del Rio.“I was horrified to see the images, and we look forward to learning the facts that are adduced from the investigation, and we will take actions that those facts compel,” Mayorkas said. “We do not tolerate any mistreatment or abuse of a migrant. Period.”Previously, during a Monday news conference, both Mayorkas and Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz played down the incident, with Ortiz telling reporters that the agents were working in a difficult and chaotic environment and trying to control their horses.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mayorkas spoke Monday before he had seen the images. “He believes this does not represent who we are as a country and does not represent the positions of the Biden-Harris administration,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday.Criticism was withering from members of Congress, including Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. He called on Mayorkas to “take immediate action to hold those responsible accountable.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for an investigation.Republicans, meanwhile, stepped up their continued criticism of Biden’s approach to the border, with 26 Republican governors calling on the president to change his border policies.“A crisis that began at the southern border now extends beyond to every state and requires immediate action before the situation worsens,” they said in a statement.",2
485,"Navajo and Hopi voters turn out in force on Election Day, hoping for a clear voice",0.0,51.33,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2020/11/05/native-american-voters-turn-out-large-numbers-election-day/6169022002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,azcentral,24,"As voting got underway Tuesday on the Hopi Nation, Karen Shupla, the tribal registrar, set out to visit three Navajo County polling stations serving Hopi voters. The Hopi Nation reaches into both Navajo and Apache counties in northern Arizona.What she found was part of a larger story on Election Day: Even with concerns about coronavirus, Native voters on the Hopi and Navajo nations showed up in large numbers at in-person polling locations.“Turnout has been great,” Shupla said.“We’ve even had people come in trying to register to vote,” she said, but Arizona does not allow same-day voter registration.Her first stop was a polling site inside the Kykotsmovi Village Community Center, near the Hopi tribal office. Shupla said the location offered curbside voting, along with a ballot drop-off box for the first time.In Sipaulovi Village, Shupla stood outside the Sipaulovi Youth & Elderly Building and worked with local Native Vote volunteers as they handed out teal-colored shirts to Hopi voters leaving the polls.Native Vote is a nonpartisan initiative developed by the National Congress of American Indians that focuses on voter registration, election protection, education and data collection.Because of the pandemic, all the Hopi Villages are closed to nontribal citizens and many of them have security posts set up in front monitoring traffic. One is set up in front of the Sipaulovi Village, and the staff was directing voters toward the polling site only. No one was allowed into the village unless they were a resident.“They’re busy,” Shupla said. There had been a steady stream of voters since the site opened and she was impressed with how smoothly the location was running.The final Navajo County polling station was at the Hopi LDS Church in Polacca. Shupla said she didn’t encounter any voting issues at any of the three sites, but she saw a lot of first-time voters.“I’ve never seen lines and we’re seeing lines,” she said. “I think people are seeing the importance of this election.”In Arizona, nearly 6% of the voting-age population is Native American, making it one of the highest percentages among Indigenous communities in the U.S., according to the National Congress of American Indians.The Navajo and Hopi nations stretch across parts of Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties. Of Navajo County's 108,000 residents, 43% are Native American. Of Apache County’s population of about 71,000, Native Americans make up 73%.ASU law student MacArthur Stant, a volunteer with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project, was also out visiting polling places on the Hopi Nation. He stopped in Polacca and SipauloviThe project is part of the ASU Indian Law Clinic and provides resources to tribes and tribal citizens in Arizona, “to ensure access to the polls and to prevent voter disenfranchisement,” the project's website says.At the polling stations, Stant said he saw a steady flow of voters throughout the day.“It’s been very exciting. A lot of first-time voters and it feels as if those first-time voters are going to stay voters,” Stant said. He noticed a lot of the first-time voters are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.“These are people who haven’t voted in their life and they’re starting to see the value and importance of it,” he added. “I think as a whole this starting to be very important.”For state elections, there were 14 Native candidates on ballots across Arizona and 11 of them won their election.Apache County voter Andrew Simpson said he felt both the Democratic and Republican parties haven’t spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,” he said.“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Simpson said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”Simpson voted early by mail, but still showed up to the polls on Tuesday at the Steamboat Chapter House. As a former council delegate on the Navajo Nation, Simpson said he wanted to see the turnout.In Chinle, voters were able to use one of the few early in-person voting sites in Apache County. The polling station was inside a blue warehouse and had two entrances, one for voters in the Chinle precinct and the other for the Canyon De Chelly precinct.Election official Karsteen Draper, 43, from nearby Del Muerto, greeted voters who walked toward the building, directing them to the correct precinct or to a poll worker who could help ensure they were in the right line.He said he's volunteered for elections before and has always enjoyed working with people. He likes answering their questions and helping them vote.""The line has been flowing smoothly. No long waits,"" Draper said. He planned on being the final voter of the night. As an election official, he had to make sure no one tried to get in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m.Volunteers with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project were set up in front of the polling station, providing voters with hand sanitizer and answers to voting or ballot questions.ASU law students Aspen Miller and Seth Jensen had been set up in front of the polling site since about 6 a.m. Miler said the site wasn't even open when they arrived.They talked to hundreds of voters throughout the day and the biggest confusion they encountered was that the Navajo Nation was having a tribal election, too.The Apache County polling site was set up only for the state and national elections. The tribal election took place at the Chinle Chapter House about two miles away.Jensen said turnout was steady and Miller agreed, saying there was always somebody inside voting.""Nobody's been turned away,"" she added.Married couple Ashley and Marlyn Willie from Chinle both knew they wanted to vote in person rather than by mail.“My vote will count then and there,” Ashley Willie, 27, said. ""Our voices can be heard through voting.""Marlyn Willie echoed his wife's thoughts. He said he's been voting since he turned 18, and now at 29, voting is still important to him because his future, his kids' future and eventually his grandkids' future all depend on who leads.""Not just this election but all the elections,"" he said. ""People have to get up and vote so they can be the change. We choose who gets to be in there.""In the 2016 election, Maryln Willie said he did vote for Donald Trump and he has tried to vote Republican much of the time, but that changed this election. He voted for Joe Biden.He doesn't believe the current division in the United States will change this election. ""Not with the two candidates we have,"" he said, and he doesn't believe either candidate can deliver on their campaign promises.""Not much is being said about our future,"" he added, and he said he changed his candidate this election year because of his kids.He believes that Trump has not handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly, and he said has to think about his children's health and safety. The coronavirus had hit Indigenous communities the hardest and no one knows how long it's going to last.""My children deserve to be safe,"" He said. ""I'm just hoping for a little bit of change.""As the polls closed on Tuesday night, Chinle Chapter House voter Joanie Hunter stood in line along with about 100 other tribal voters waiting to cast their vote in the Navajo Nation Chapter general election.Hunter already voted in the state and national election, casting a ballot early because she thought the polling line would be too long on Election Day.“I thought the chapter (election) should be fine,” she said but was proven wrong by the time she made it to the polls just before 7 p.m. Hunter said she was mentally kicking herself for not voting early.“I didn’t think there would be this many people,” she said.By the time Hunter got in line, it looped around the Chinle Chapter House complex with about 100 voters still waiting. At one point during the day, the line stretched past the parking lot toward the main highway.“I don’t mind waiting,” Hunter said, even as a few of her fellow voters walked away from the line. She said she cares about her chapter election because she feels it’s an election where her voice is really heard.“You get a say in whose running things,"" she added. ""I believe it does make a difference.""Thousands of Navajo voters cast a ballot for chapter leaders on Tuesday. Native voters often turn out in higher rates for tribal elections than nontribal elections, according to the National Congress of American Indians.In chapter elections, Navajo voters elect leaders for their local community governments at 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation.The Navajo Nation is about the size of West Virginia and spans three states, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It is split into five agencies: Western, Chinle, Fort Defiance, Shiprock and Eastern. Within those agencies are chapter houses and they serve as local governments for surrounding communities. It’s operated along the same lines as a city council.On Tuesday, Navajo voters elected chapter presidents, vice presidents, secretary-treasurers, commissioners, election supervisors, farming board members and grazing committee members.Local chapter elections are usually full of candidates campaigning until the polls close and free food is always nearby. Many of the candidates tend to share their platforms with Navajo voters while serving coffee, stew and frybread.But because of the coronavirus, the scene was different this year. There were no food stands set up in the chapter house parking lots or candidates hosting rallies for voters.The Navajo Election Administration and the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors implemented public health safety guidelines for voting at polling places and discouraged candidates from setting up food stands. Tribal voters were also encouraged to vote early or by absentee ballot to avoid large crowds and wait times on Election Day.At the Steamboat Chapter House as voters left their vehicles and walked toward the door, they were often greeted by an election official asking if they were voting in the chapter election or for Apache County. The Steamboat Chapter House served as a polling station for the state and national election on Tuesday.Chapter voters were directed toward the entrance of the chapter house on the right side of the building, while Apache County voters were directed toward an entrance on the left side of the building.Navajo voters waiting in line maintained social distancing, wore masks and often used the handwashing stations set up near chapter house entrance. Election officials also checked temperatures before voters entered the building.Andrew Simpson and his wife, Bessie Yellowhair Simpson, from Steamboat, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for relatives to arrive from Phoenix to vote. They both voted early, but as community leaders, they enjoyed sticking around on Election Day.But rather than their usual hugs and handshakes, they both wore masks, waving to people from inside their truck or bumping elbows with the few who walked up to the truck window. Yellowhair Simpson occasionally walked the grounds to greet people or talk.She is currently the commission secretary-treasurer for the Steamboat Chapter and was up for reelection this election. She did not retain her seat,according to unofficial results.The husband and wife also believed that Election Day is a great way to build relationships among the Navajo people, but because of the pandemic, they’ve lost that.It has prevented them from leaving their house, Simpson said, and at 74 he’s been told he is at high risk for contracting the coronavirus. The only time they leave home is to restock on essential items, so being at the polls on Tuesday gave them a chance to see and interact with people at a safe distance.“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” Simpson said, and he’s recognized most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”The unofficial results for the Navajo Nation Chapter General Election can be found on the Navajo Election Administrations website atnavajoelections.navajo-nsn.gov.",2
486,The White House refuses to say whether or not Trump will accept results of the election,-25.33,31.67,https://occupydemocrats.com/2020/08/19/the-white-house-refuses-to-say-whether-or-not-trump-will-accept-results-of-the-election-1/,https://adfontesmedia.com/occupy-democrats-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,occupydemocrats,25,"A core component of the Republican Party’s strategy to reelect Donald Trump is consistently and unapologetically lying about just about every political issue on the table.Yet there are some things that Donald Trump says about his future intentions that the American public must take deadly seriously — his refusal to confirm that he will abide by the results of an election that he is already calling rigged before a single vote is cast and while he is doing everything in his power, including destroying the U.S. Postal Service, to suppress the ability of Democrats to vote against him.This unprecedented refusal to commit to an orderly transfer of power once the election results are confirmed was the subject of a question posed to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today during a press briefing.McEnanay was asked to explain Trump’s comment earlier this week that “the only way he would lose this election was if this election was rigged” and whether there was “any circumstance under which he could lose the election fairly.”The Press Secretary’s answer was a perfect example of why she’s been dubbed “Kay-lie” by many observers who are amazed at her ability to spout misinformation and outright fabulism in her defense of the president.Actually, it’s difficult to fault the truthfulness of McEnany in the opening line of her response to the question since she couches it with the qualifier “The president believes” which could provide an excuse for a large multitude of delusional notions.“The president believes that he has done a great for ther American people and he believes that will show in November,” the Press Secretary began her answer. “He believes that, uhh, that voter fraud is real, in line with what we see all across the country, particularly wirth mail-in ballots which are prone to fraud,” McEnany concluded by repeating Trump’s false talking points.While this level of misinformation regarding phony claims of mail-in voter fraud is frightening, what McEnanay said in response to a follow-up question should result in many a lost night’s sleep for anyone who values our nation’s democratic principles.A reporter asked whether Trump’s claims — that the only way he will lose will be if the election is rigged — means that he won’t accept the election resultshe wins.“The president has always said he’ll see what happens and make a determination in the aftermath,” McEnany replied.“He wants a free election, a fair election, and he wants confidence in the results of the election, particularly when you have states like Nevada doing mass mail out voting to their voting rules and when they tried this in the primary, it was a massive failure, ballots were piled up in trashcans, ballots were pinned to apartment dart boards, and with that being the system, the president wants to take a hard look at this and make sure these are fair election results and not subject to fraud,” the Press Secretary replied, rapidly repeating her talking points with barely a breath between her words.McEnany’s regurgitation of Trump’s self-serving attempts at reducing the confidence in an absentee ballot practice that has functioned without major problems – with the exception ofRepublican-planned election fraud— for decades is a dire forecast for an era of post-election turmoil as the president is already preparing the nation for the monumental tantrum he will throw if his attempts at skewing the playing field through voter suppression and the summoning of foreign interference do not yield the desired victory that he foolishly believes that he deserves.You can watch McEnany respond to the questions about Trump’s willingness to accept the election results in the video excerpt below.Reporter: ""Is the President saying if he doesn't win this election that he will not accept the results unless he wins?""Kayleigh McEnany: ""The President has always said he'll see what happens and make a determination in the aftermath.""pic.twitter.com/iH606u3V38— The Hill (@thehill)August 19, 2020After watching that, hopefully you’ll be convinced of how imperative it is that Trump is defeated in a landslide.Now is the time to double-check your voter registration and make sure everyone you know is committed to casting their ballot for Jow Biden and rid the White House of the scourge currently occupying it.FollowVinnie Longobardo onTwitter.We want to hear what YOU have to say.

487,"Say Her Name: On Average, Police Kill One Black Woman A Month",-14.67,46.67,https://therealnews.com/stories/say-her-name-police-brutality-kill-black-women,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,therealnews,23,"Historically, Black women like Fannie Lou Hamer, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, Korryn Gaines, and Eleanor Bumpers, who were killed or brutalized by police officers, receive less community outrage and media coverage than their male counterparts.Eddie Conway: Welcome to The Real News. I’m Eddie Conway, your host coming to you from Baltimore. We have been witnessing worldwide protests, strikes, demonstrations, destruction of monuments. When you look in the crowds you see men, women, children, white, black, brown, yellow, red, etc. And you hear more often than not a lot of names being shouted, or posters being bannered with Eric Garner’s name. Trayvon Martin’s name, Tyrone West’s name, Mike Brown. And of course we know all of this started with the killing of George Floyd. But what’s missing in this whole scenario, and not getting a lot of publicity is the name of women. Now of course we are Breonna Taylor’s name, because that’s an incident that’s closely associated with this whole thing. And some of us are aware of Sandra Bland, some of us are aware of other names of other women.But in looking back at our history, of course we could go back all the way to slavery, but in looking back in our history, we can see names like Fannie Lou Hamer’s, being beaten by police, that affected her for the rest of her life. We see a case that I looked at in particular, was a case in Tyler, Texas in which an 84 year old … 82 year old grandmother was sleeping in her bed, police mistaking her house for a place to raid raided her house, charged upstairs and shot her six times in her bed. And walked away from the whole thing. The Grand Jury in Tyler, Texas found that it was an accident, the black community was outraged, they decided to do jury nullification. They in turn decided that they wasn’t going to convict any black person that didn’t do harm to the black community. And that was in ’92.:So young women, as young as seven, has been murdered in their beds by police. And women as old as 92 has been murdered in their houses by police. And so I wonder why we don’t hear more voices in these protests about the women that has been murdered by police.This is not a black male thing, this is a people of color thing at this present time. So joining me today to talk about this a little bit is Dominique Conway, who is also my wife, writer, activist, organizer, educator. Also joining me is Professor Talitha LeFlouria. Thanks for joining me, Dominique and Talitha.Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you for having me.Dominique Conwa…: Thank you for having me.Eddie Conway: Okay, my first question goes to you, Talitha. Over the years it seems that the police have killed one black woman a month. On average, which means sometimes there was two and then sometimes there might have been a month and a week passed by. But, why don’t we hear black women’s name? Why is this disparity between what the protestors are shouting out and what’s really happening in our lives?Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you, Eddie, that’s a … a wonderful question. And a question that I’ve thought a lot about. Because as we know, the silence is deafening, right? And the level of outrage that we see shown toward the killing of black men and boys is just not shown when it comes to black women and girls. And I thought really hard and very long about this, and I can’t say that I have the answer, but one thing that I will say is that I believe that the numbers game has something to do with this. The fact that black women are killed in seemingly negligible numbers when compared with black men. So those staggering statistics that you shared, if one black woman is killed a month, then that means probably 10 black men are killed a month, right?And so unfortunately people minimize the murder of black women and girls, because their numbers don’t compare with black men. But when you compare those numbers with the white women who are not being killed by the police, then that changes things. That helps us to see this in a different light, right? And so I’m not one who supports of promotes comparative suffering, and I believe that we need to move away from this narrative that somehow well, the numbers of black men that are being murdered are so much more, that we have to address that issue first, and then we can get to the black men. No, all black lives need to matter equally, including the lives of black women. And Kimberle Crenshaw recently said something that was so eloquent, and I want to share it because I think that it applies to what I’m saying now. She said that if your story doesn’t exist within a movement, that story isn’t entirely for you.And so we have to lift up the stories of black women and girls, and we have to convey the message to the rest of the world that all black lives matter. Because if we don’t do it, if we show indifference toward the killing of black women and girls as a result of vigilante violence and state sanctioned anti-black violence, then if the black community doesn’t show outrage, then why should the rest of the world show outrage?Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, the same question, why you think this silence around the death of black women at the hands of vigilantes, of police correctional officers, because a lot of black women are also killed in prisons. Dominique?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I pretty much agree with what Talitha has said. I also do think it’s a difficult question because there are so many complexities. I think history, the devaluation of black women and the black female body, the black body in general, but particularly the black female body lends easily to that. So I think it’s very complex. I feel that white supremacy has set up a system in which there is a hierarchy. And even sometimes within struggles we reinforce that hierarchy, and I think we have to undo our thinking about how we view people within our own groups. And so I think that that’s part of the difficulty of really answering the question.And I also don’t want to get into reinforcing a hierarchy and saying that well, it’s more important that we view the deaths of black women versus black men. No, we need to look at all of this because it’s not just black men, it’s not just black women, it’s our children, too. We’re pretty much all in the scopes of the rifle, and I think we need to view this as a war. And war takes everybody out.Eddie Conway: Well Talitha, and I heard you say that it’s our story, we need to raise these stories up. What’s the role of black men in this, and what’s the role of black women? Because I see black women out there on the line also, talking about Trayvon Martin, and supporting protests around Eric Garner. And most of the time, and to be quite honest, most of the movements that I have witnessed throughout history and studied throughout history are actually led by women, and they are actually supported and pushed forward by women. And women has, from the time we got on the boats apparently, has been protesting, fighting, pushing, and in fact keeping us alive to fight the next day. But whose responsibility for bringing our story, the story of black women’s deaths also, whose responsibility is that?Talitha LeFlour…: In response to your question, Eddie, about whose responsibility is, I think that it’s our collective responsibility to lift up the stories of black women and girls who have been killed by the police, or who have died at the hands of vigilantes. As Dominique said, white supremacist violence is indiscriminate. And so … but one of the things that I want to say is that as you mentioned black women have been doing a lot of this work. Black women have essentially been carrying the labor, they’re the ones who are showing up at the protests and who are committed to the defense of black women.So when black men show up, even though unfortunately black men haven’t shown up at the same level that black women have, when black men show up for black women in these spaces and for black girls, what it says is that our lives are worthy of protection. That our lives are worthy of saving. As Dominique mentioned before, historically black women have not been afforded the same protections as white women.Black women and girls, their lives haven’t been seen as worthy of the same protection. The dehumanization that slavery … the types of dehumanization that black women and girls and black people experienced during slavery, I think is part of the reason why we see this complete disregard for black life, and it’s part of the reason why black people can be killed with impunity. It’s because slavery set that precedent that our lives did not matter.And so when a black woman is killed, or harmed, or injured, or when a black man is killed, or harmed, or injured, we’re all hurt.Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, I’ve heard you say thousands of times that black men has a certain responsibility to speak up to other black men around this issue. Talk a little bit about that protest of Black Lives Matter activist, a young lady that reported a rape and after a rally she disappeared. Could you talk a little bit about the safe space, or the lack of safe space, and what’s the role of men in all of this?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I feel like I don’t know enough about her particular situation to really speak to it. I’ve gleaned a few bits of information. So I don’t want to like go into that because I don’t … I just don’t feel comfortable speaking about her situation not knowing enough about it.But I think in general … I mean, as a black woman it’s very difficult to feel safe in the belly of the beast. History has told me enough to know that I’m not safe, my children are not safe. When I have grandchildren, they will probably be … not be safe until this whole paradigm here is changed. But I do feel that it’s not just necessary for men to kind of take responsibility and acknowledge the deaths of these women as well, I feel like men need to be conscious of how they take up space when it comes to speaking to these issues a lot of times. My experience here in Baltimore and what I saw in 2015 was men taking up a lot of the talking space. But out on the streets I saw mothers, I saw grandmothers, I saw little girls. But when you looked at the interviews, what was reflected back very often were men who were not necessarily doing the organizing. And so I feel like brothers need to be conscious about taking up that space. Just like we tell white folks they need to be conscious about taking up our space, we need to look at who’s really being afforded ample room within our spaces.Eddie Conway: Okay, and I [inaudible 00:14:06] one of the questions I was going to ask, and I realize that it’s probably not necessarily a valid question, considering that a lot of these cases that I’ve looked at of black women being killed, has happened in the spaces in their houses. They’ve been in their bedrooms, they’ve been in their living rooms, they’ve been away from videos and so on. So the video footage is not there, but I’m wondering about the 17 year old young lady that videoed George Floyd’s case, now I understand she’s receiving death threats, and she’s got to be hidden and protected. What should we be doing about stuff like that? Talitha, do you have any opinion on that?Talitha LeFlour…: Wow, that’s a tough question to answer. I believe that we all have to obviously rally behind her, and support her, and support anybody who is a victim of white racial terror, even if it doesn’t result in death. Our community is being tremendously impacted, our public health … I mean, excuse me, our mental health is being affected. Racism is a public health issue. It’s a public health crisis. And so we as a community need to get around her and support her and lift her up, but we also need to hold the people who like, for example, people who provide mental health services, and social services, hold our local governments, our state governments, and any entity that could provide these kinds of resources in lieu of hiring additional police officers.Part of the defunding of the police could involve channeling more resources into public health. Yeah, public health and mental health services for people in our community, including that young woman who I understand now is extremely agoraphobic and can’t even leave her house at this point because she’s afraid that she’s going to lose her life or that she’s going to be bullied or terrorized. People kill themselves when they are harassed and when they are terrorized in this way. So I just pray for her mental health and that she’ll be able to get the kind of healing and the attention that she deserves on an individual level, but we as a community need to also champion around her and other people who are brave enough to film these murders, and who are brave enough to speak out against these atrocities.I think about Ida B. Wells. That young woman is the Ida B. Wells of our generation. She documented that horror, she documented that lynching, right? And so we have to get behind our brothers and sisters who are willing to document and put everything on the line, including their lives and their safety on the line to document these lynchings.Eddie Conway: Dominique, and I guess this is like the final question, I would like for you to give us an idea of what should happen. I mean, we talk about defunding the police, some people talk about disbanding the police. Is that the real problem, or is the problem deeper than that, or what you think should happen to kind of like … the outcome of all this worldwide protests?Dominique Conwa…: One, I do feel that it’s necessary to abolish police forces, but also I see the police as simply being the armed wing of a government that is at war with us and has been at best indifferent to our suffering, but a lot worse than indifferent. When you consider black Wall Street, and consider what happened in Tulsa, when you consider the attacks upon people of African descent, our communities as well as what is done to indigenous communities in this land. So I think yeah, it’s very necessary to abolish the police, but I think we also need to begin to determine … we need to determine our own destinies, and I hope that doesn’t sound too cliché at this point, but it’s true. And part of that is determining who’s going to really protect the communities. I feel like if we were in that kind of position, there wouldn’t be no question about protection for this young woman. As you all were talking about that situation I’m thinking we need a Deacons for Defense, we need some folks that’s going to stand outside that house armed and assuring her safety. Or whatever she feels would assure her safety, because that might not be it for her.And so it is a matter of giving voice to everybody in the community to determine what their destiny is going to be, and what makes them feel comfortable. So I think that it’s very hard for me to say what needs to come out of this, because so much needs to come out of this, it’s been 500 years, okay? I think we have enough time for me to even go through the long list of things. But I think more important is that this is a young person’s game at this point. It’s their future, they need to be able to determine how they’re going to live that future, how they’re going into that future, and if there even is going to be a future.Eddie Conway: Okay, Talitha, you get the final word. Do you have any final comment to share with our audience?Talitha LeFlour…: So I just want to first of all thank you, Dominique, for your final word, and I agree with you wholeheartedly. I want to say that it is critical and it is paramount that we say the names of black women and girls. That we do not perpetuate or continue to perpetuate the invisibility that black women and girls face when it comes to these issues around police violence, and police brutality, and police terror. Black women and girls should not be a footnote, they should be at the center of these stories, at the center of our public discourse around police violence and anti-black violence. And it’s our responsibility to make sure that all black lives matter.So whenever we can, we need to lift up the voices and the stories of black women, and join activists, local activists, nationally recognized activists who have really large platforms to speak out on these issues, including the African American Policy Forum. I would encourage you to contribute to and to support the Say Her Name movement. And to plug into the work that Kimberle Crenshaw and the African American Policy Forum and people who are committed to this work, and amplifying these stories all over the country are doing. And so that would be my final word.Eddie Conway: All right, thank you. There’s a rally today, in fact, to support Say Her Name. So thank you for joining me Talitha and Dominique.Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you.Dominique Conwa…: Thank you.Eddie Conway: Okay, and thank you for joining this episode of The Real News.Studio:Cameron GranadinoProduction:Cameron Granadino, Ericka Blount DanoisPrincipled journalism that gets to the roots of the crises we face is more important today than ever.Journalism that doesn't dwell in despair, but empowers you to take action.

488,"Even with a Ceasefire, Israel Must Face a Changed Reality",-1.33,44.67,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/even-with-a-ceasefire-israel-must-face-a-changed-reality,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,newyorker,25,"The ceasefire between Hamas and Israel went into effect at 2local time on Friday, and seems to be holding. Israelis woke up to their military claiming to have “achieved all our operational goals.” Many Gazans, in turn, celebrated in the streets through the night—among them Khalil al-Hayya, a leader of Hamas’s slate in the now essentially cancelled Palestinian parliamentary elections, whose home in Gaza City was bombed. “This is the euphoria of victory,” he said.Theviolencelasted eleven days, long enough for the Israeli military to give its operation a name, Guardian of the Walls, though its briefings to the media have mainly been about tunnels. Hamas has built a web of them, many dozens of miles long, under Gaza’s cities; the defense establishment commonly refers to them, with perverse respect, as the Metro. Israel has mapped them, owing to “very high-quality intelligence”—so the leader of the Southern Command, Eliezer Toledano, told television reporters, last Sunday evening. By Tuesday morning, a military spokesman had claimed that the Air Force had bombed nine launch sites, including some in the tunnels, destroying sixty-five weapons launchers. It even bombed parts not immediately involved in the current action, Toledano added, just to send a message to the Hamas military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammad Deif—themselves now targets—that the tunnels are a “death trap.” Before the ceasefire, the Israeli military claimed to have destroyed more than a hundred kilometres—sixty-two miles—of the tunnels, which is, notionally, the main goal “achieved.”Some buildings above the tunnels also became death traps. The Jerusalemreports that the military claims to have destroyed buildings containing “10 government offices, 11 internal security targets, and five banks that manage terror funds.” The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least two hundred and forty Palestinians, including sixty-six children, have been killed; the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that seventy-five thousand people have been displaced or made homeless. Israeli government spokesmen, in contrast, say that two hundred and twenty-five militants have been killed, including twenty-five senior commanders—numbers that, for obvious reasons, do not quite match up. By midweek, Israel’s strategic logic seemed to have been reduced to destroying more tunnels and, collaterally, what was around them, including vital infrastructure such as the water and power supply; and destroying alleged command centers in multistory buildings—including, now famously, the Gaza headquarters of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. By Friday morning, more than four thousand rockets had been launched toward Israeli cities, especially Ashkelon, on the coast; many of the rockets got through the Iron Dome anti-missile shield. Thirteen people were killed in Israel, including two Thai workers; among the Israeli victims were an Arab father and his sixteen-year-old daughter, in the city of Lod.The mayhem is Hamas’s fault, Israeli officials say, as they often do, because Hamas attacks Israeli civilians and hides behind civilians in Gaza. (TheNetanyahu governmentis clearly more comfortable briefing diplomats and reporters about rockets and tunnels than about settlers enforcing evictions inSheikh Jarrahand Israeli police officers harassing Palestinians during Ramadan—actions which sparked disturbances the previous week.) The point of Israel’s operation seems to have been new entries in a grotesque ledger, shared with Hamas, whose bottom line is “deterrence,” a more strategic-sounding word than “intimidation.” “No question,” Channel 12’s military correspondent, Roni Daniel, said, “the longer this fighting lasts, the more direct hits—this will push the next round further off into the future.” By Thursday, talk of deterrence was superseded by President Joe Biden’s demand for de-escalation, and the imminence of a ceasefire. So military analysts began speaking instead of an anticipated final flurry of Hamas rockets, and final Israeli bombing runs, expecting each side to try for,asput it, an “image of victory.” In the end, thankfully, both sides satisfied themselves with the images that they already had.It is an indication of how stale such tit-for-tat rhetoric has become that a segment by the comedian John Oliver, mocking the phrase, has gone viral, even in Israel. The Israeli military’s claims fall especially flat, he said, because Israel has an enormous power advantage—which has yielded the disproportionate number of deaths. (That’s true, though of course it does not exonerate Hamas.) Oliver further argued that the Gazan civilians who are paying that price have no collective power over what Hamas does. He might have added that, as many Israelis have suggested, if Gazans did have such power, the Israeli government might have prompted them to exert it by, say, distributing-19 vaccines, or offering to rehabilitate the power station, rather than conducting air strikes. But the military’s rhetoric has grown stale in Israel for a quite different reason. This latest escalation has given Israel a glimpse of a widening potential threat thatBenjamin Netanyahuand his military, whatever their specific contingency plans, have not prepared the public for: emboldened defiance, from the West Bank to the Lebanon front, and from the streets of Lod to Washington, D.C. Palestinian euphoria derives from justified Israeli anxiety.A potential sequence of resulting events seems all too obvious now. The suffering in Gaza might spark protests in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem, or vice versa; Israeli responses to such protests could provoke accelerating violence, much like what happened with the al-Aqsa intifada, which Ariel Sharon provoked, in 2000, and which led to the deaths of three thousand Palestinians and a thousand Israelis. (On Friday afternoon, just hours after the ceasefire, tens of thousands of Palestinians took part in afternoon prayers at al-Aqsa, some waving Palestinian flags; by the end of the afternoon, there were fresh confrontations with Israeli police.) Such violence could cause further unrest in Israel, which, during the past week, has experienced street fighting between its Arab and Jewish citizens. That, in turn, could well incite Palestinians in Jordan, who are ambivalent about the Hashemite monarchy’s legitimacy and impatient with its peace treaty with Israel. The chaos would almost certainly mobilize Iranian-backed Hezbollah cadres in Lebanon, who have seen the damage that volleys of rockets can do. Netanyahu, or any right-wing successor, would be hard-pressed to counter such a changed landscape, on multiple fronts, without America’s backing. But a growing number of Palestinian supporters in the United States (and particularly in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party) would argue that the Prime Minister and his decade-long Likud dominance in the Knesset brought the catastrophe on themselves. And they would not be wrong.Hamas drove the Fatah leaders of the Palestinian Authority from Gaza, in 2007. When Netanyahu took office for the second time, two years later, he dissociated himself from the progress that his predecessor Ehud Olmert had made with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, within the scope of the Oslo peace process. Netanyahu redoubled the government’s commitment to settlements and an exclusive claim to Jerusalem, implying that Palestinian sovereignty could be endlessly deferred, and Greater Israel persistently built, as long as the Palestinian leadership was riven. It served Netanyahu’s interests to keep Palestine divided; indeed, he instigated the last round of attacks on Hamas in Gaza, in July, 2014, in part to foil the unity agreement that Abbas and Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh had implemented that June. In 2015, the Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich, a settler zealot and Netanyahu ally, put it bluntly: “In the international arena, in the game of delegitimization,” he said, “the Palestinian Authority is a liability, and Hamas is an asset.” The challenge was to keep Hamas both solvent and in check: the former by allowing Qatar to subsidize the organization, the latter by periodically attacking it—like “mowing the lawn,” as some in the military grimly put it.This all now seems desperately outpaced by events. To think that pure force and “very high-quality intelligence” could preserve the status quo is to engage in, well, tunnel vision. The Hamas leadership is staying put in Gaza, in part because Israel has no stomach for a full-scale invasion to remove it. Major General Yitzhak Brick, the former Army ombudsman, warned, in 2018, that the military might not have the ground capability, either, given how much it had invested in technology and airpower. In any case, an invasion would risk a high civilian death toll, just as the air strikes have done. It suddenly seems clear that Hamas can, at will, threaten to heat up Israel’s borders and roil its cities by sending another rocket in the direction of Jerusalem. Some asset.In the West Bank, Palestinians currently have no reliable political process by which to give their leaders legitimacy. Recent polls show that increasing numbers of young people are willing to endorse armed struggle. “The real failure here is Abbas’s inability to unify and rejuvenate the Palestinian political system,” Sam Bahour, a management consultant and activist in Ramallah, told me. In the lead-up to the most recent violence, Hamas, for its part, had “failed in their governance of Gaza, and their problems were mounting.” It was “poised to be legitimized” by participating in parliamentary and Presidential elections, and when Abbas called off elections that had been scheduled for this month, “the rug was pulled out” from under them. By resorting to violence, Hamas could “remain relevant.” But Abbas’s supporters and Fatah-aligned militants are now struggling to remain so as well. Thousands of mainly young people spontaneously demonstrated at Israeli checkpoints. Eleven were killed by security forces last Friday, and hundreds have been injured. Abbas mobilized the Palestinian Authority’s security forces to maintain order in the West Bank. What if, next time, he does not?This may all seem far removed from Hezbollah, in Lebanon. But, last Saturday, Haniyeh, who is still the Hamas chairman, made a speech to a crowd in Qatar, depicting Hamas as the defender of Jerusalem. The same day, he was on the phone with Esmail Ghaani, the military head of Iran’sQuds Force, on which Hezbollah depends. Hamas rockets, Ghaani reportedly said, are a “unique and successful answer” to Israel. Hezbollah, for its part, is reported to have more than a hundred thousand rockets—and several thousand medium-range and several hundred long-range missiles with guidance systems.Then there is the situation in Israel itself. The violence and destruction in the cities have beenwidely reported. Hundreds of rioters have been arrested. On Tuesday, Israel’s Arab Higher Monitoring Committee, which coördinates Arab civil-society organizations in the country, called ageneral strike, which was also honored in the West Bank. Mudar Younis, the chairman of the Committee of Arab Local Council Heads, toldthat more than half of Arab-Israelis participated. The Israel Builders Association said that only a hundred and fifty out of sixty-five thousand Palestinian construction workers went to work. Large parts of the private sector, from retail to tourism, could be paralyzed by actions of this type, and many employers would likely not countenance dependency on Arab employees, exacerbating the polarization.None of this denies that, in Israel’s mainly Hebrew-speaking civil society, much of the Arab community is successfully integrated. Arabs make up perhaps a fifth of Israel’s population, but, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, just under a fifth of the country’s doctors, a quarter of its nurses, and half of its pharmacists, are Arab. Sixteen per cent of undergraduate college students are Arab; at Haifa University they make up forty per cent. The sixteen-year-old girl killed by a rocket in Lod was a student at the ORT High School, part of the experimental “Tovanot” chain of high schools, funded and mentored by Israeli Jewish entrepreneurs, organized by the veteran investor Yossi Vardi. For the first time in the country’s history, Arab political parties are negotiating for key roles in governing coalitions.And yet Netanyahu’s neo-Zionist revanchists, wedded to theocratic forces in the Rabbinate and the Knesset, have been openly pushing Arabs and other non-Jews to the margins. Thenation-state law, framing Israel as the state of the Jewish people alone, and calculated to counter the legal right to equality, has enraged even the Druze community, which serves in the military. The Arab poverty rate in Israel is four times higher than the Jewish poverty rate. A recent study by Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, and Merav Shaviv, a former research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, shows that nearly thirty per cent of Israeli-Arab males between nineteen and twenty-four—some thirty thousand young men—are neither in school nor employed. These youth are often implicated in gang warfare, which the Israeli police have done little to address. The spontaneous attacks on Jews in or near Arab towns—including Umm al-Fahm, which protested en masse against police neglect in March—are hard to explain without understanding how youth violence may be channelled into anti-Israel rage. And there are similar militant Jewish youth gangs. An Israeli monitoring group, FakeReporter, has identified some twenty thousand Jewish extremists using social media to organize attacks, and another eighty thousand far-rightists fomenting anti-Arab sentiment on Telegram and WhatsApp. In my neighborhood in Jerusalem, the words “Under Jewish Management” have suddenly appeared on the local hummus shop, presumably to stave off attacks from those gangs.The situation, in short, is fluid, agitated, and reminiscent of the atmosphere after the 1973 war, when, in spite of a putative Israeli victory, the idea that military force was all the foreign policy Israel needed—and that the Palestinian question would wait—was suddenly revealed to Israelis as delusional and arrogant. Before that war, the government spoke not of deterrence but of “security borders,” which neighboring Arab states, it claimed, wouldn’t dare attack. They did. Now, as then, there is a growing sense that Israel cannot come out of this crisis the same country it was when it went into it. On the right, there is more bravado: calls to disarm Gaza, and to suppress Israeli Arabs as a fifth column. On the left, which has found renewed energy, there are calls for reëngagement with the Palestinian question, and, correspondingly, for democratic norms that are vital enough to resist theocracy and to lessen anti-Arab discrimination.All sides are suddenly turning to the Biden Administration, which must realize, despite an understandable desire to stay out of the region, thatcannot elide the Palestinian question—that, in fact, as in 1973, the sudden blow to Israeli certainties creates diplomatic opportunities. Netanyahu, whose tenure may well be extended by the violence, is hardly the leader to inaugurate the necessary changes. Yair Lapid, the centrist leader who is still trying to form a government to replace the Prime Minister, has called the escalation before this violence “convenient” for Netanyahu. Biden, in any case, need not wait for either. A ceasefire, and a renewed peace process, may yet advance a Palestinian state and save Israel from the worst. The next round, or the next, will almost certainly invite it.",2

I get the whole sentiment behind the bigger thread… but this post shouldn’t stand alone.— **Rachel** (@Rachelerella)March 8, 2021A Burger King spokeswoman, Adrianna Lauricella, explained to theWashington Postin an emailed statement that the company realized in hindsight that the company may have distracted from its intended message by choosing to release the information in separate tweets:We are committed to helping women break through a male-dominated culinary culture in the world’s fine dining restaurants — and sometimes that requires drawing attention to the problem we’re trying to help fix. Our tweet in the UK today was designed to draw attention to the fact that only a small percentage of chefs and head chefs are women. It was our mistake to not include the full explanation in our initial tweet and have adjusted our activity moving forward because we’re sure that when people read the entirety of our commitment, they will share our belief in this important opportunity.GettyBurger King.GettyBurger King.The scholarship program the Burger King UK Twitter account was promoting is actually taking place in the United States. It’s called the Helping Equalize Restaurants scholarship or H.E.R. program.According to the Burger King Foundation website, at least two women will receive scholarships of $25,000 each that can be used for accredited culinary programs. Burger King employees who have worked at the restaurant for at least six months are eligible to apply and need to have plans to enroll in a culinary institute or program for the 2022-2023 school year. Applicants also need to have earned a high school diploma or GED to be eligible.Burger King also bought advertising space in the print edition of the New York Times to promote the scholarship.According to AdWeek,the Times advertisement included the “women belong in the kitchen” headline but added the following language: “Fine dining kitchens, food truck kitchens, award-winning kitchens, casual dining kitchens, ghost kitchens, Burger King kitchens. If there’s a professional kitchen, women belong there.”Why would we delete a tweet that’s drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well? We've launched a scholarship to help give more of our female employees the chance to pursue a culinary career.— Burger King (@BurgerKingUK)March 8, 2021In the Twitter thread, Burger King wrote that only 20% of chefs are women. According toData USA,which compiles statistics based on government data such as census information, about 77% of chefs and head cooks in the United States were men as of 2019. It also found that women earned, on average, about $10,000 less than their male counterparts.NPR reportedin 2018 that among restaurants in the United States, only about 7% of those businesses had lead chefs who were female. It’s a similar situation across the pond.The Guardianreported in 2016 that women accounted for about 18.5% of professional chefs in the United Kingdom.These statistics may account for why Burger King decided to keep the “women belong in the kitchen” tweet on its thread despite the criticism.KFC Gaming commentedon the original tweet with a meme that read, “The best time to delete this post was immediately after posting it. The second best time is now.”Burger King responded, “Why would we delete a tweet that’s drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well?

490,Why America keeps turning its back on Haitian migrants,-14.33,38.0,https://www.vox.com/22689472/haitian-migrants-asylum-history-violence,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-24,vox,25,"The images left many sickened and outraged: Border Patrol agents on horseback hounding Haitian migrants near the US-Mexico border,more than 14,000of whom were camped under the Del Rio bridge on September 19. The uniformed men swung their long horse reins — which many interpreted as whips — to keep the migrants from crossing into Texas. In one photo, an agent grabbed the T-shirt of a migrant, while another shouted in a video, “Get out now! Back to Mexico!”Condemnation of the agents’ behavior was swift, with advocates drawing parallels to slave patrols, or the white men on horses who whipped enslaved people in cotton fields. But inhumane treatment of Black migrants, particularly Haitian migrants, is not new; it’s closely linked to the history of immigrant detention in the United States.Haitians have sought asylum at US borders for decades, but every presidential administration since the 1970s has treated Haitians differently than other migrant groups, rejecting asylum claims, holding them longer in detention, and making it harder for them to settle down in safety. In the early 1990s, for example, when the United States detained more than 12,000 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo indefinitely, Immigration and Naturalization Servicesdenied the vast majority of them asylum.According to CarlLindskoog, the author of, the United States’ inhumane treatment of Haitian refugees, whom the country has often cast as criminals, unskilled, diseased, and poor, has been a central part of the immigration detention story.“Policies were specifically designed to deter Haitians from coming in. These policies became the prototype for what became a global system of migrant incarceration,”says Lindskoog, a professor of history at Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey.The current wave of Haitian migrants is fleeing a country that has experienced compounding crises.This summer, Haiti suffered a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tropical storm that killed an estimated 2,200, with thousands more missing or injured. The July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse worsened violence and instability.Haitians are still reeling from the January 2010 earthquake that affected 3 million people, causing irreparable damage to homes and infrastructure. Gangs havesince risen in power, leading many Haitians to live in fear for their lives and families.As Lindskoog says, what Haitians are experiencing is the kind of calamity that asylum was designed for in the period following World War II: “It is their legal right to seek asylum.”However, some migrants hoping for asylum are instead being chased down and shut out at the border —images showthem being removed from airplanes in Port-au-Prince with their belongings scattered on the airport’s tarmac — whilean undisclosed number are being allowed intothe United States.Biden’s decision to fly Haitians back to deadly circumstances, under a Trump-era policy,underscores the United States’ longstanding animus toward Black migrants.I talked to Lindskoog about the history of Haitian migrant detention in the US and why America has consistently rolled out harsh policies for Haitians, without displaying compassion for immigrants from the embattled Caribbean nation. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.This week, images and video of Border Patrol agents mounted on horseback rounding up Haitian migrants at the southern border sparked national outrage. The images depicted officials using horse reins, which many likened to whips, to control the movement of the Haitians. Can you tell me what came to mind when you saw those images?The images are horrible. I agree with everyone who said it was so terribly resonant of the long history of anti-Black racism and racial violence. Those images bring a lot of strands of history together, from why the Border Patrol was created, to how violent that institution has been, to how our modern policing system comes from the enforcement of slavery. And then there is how our immigration system has been criminalized and merged into our criminal justice system, both of which have anti-Black elements. What’s happening at the border is horrifying and fits into the long intersecting history of anti-Black, anti-immigrant sentiment and anti-Haitian exclusion.Let’s talk more about the Border Patrol’s racist history, whichhas been well documentedand began with its formation in the early 1920s as a kind of brotherhood with KKK members and racist Texas Rangers. Can you tell me more about how these origins were likely at play in Del Rio with Haitian migrants?There is a really good book about this by Kelly Lytle Hernández calledin which she describes how the creation of the US Border Patrol in 1924 happened amidst a much broader anti-immigrant moment. There was the nationalImmigration Restriction Act of 1924that placed new racist immigration quotas and exclusions as part of American immigration policy.It was the gatekeeping mechanism at the time for keeping out who we don’t want to come across on American shores. [Author’s note: For example,the lawfavored migration from Northern and Western European countries and decreased the annual immigration cap from 350,000 to 165,000.]Simultaneously, the Border Patrol — which evolved out of a longer history of anti-migrant, anti-Mexican white supremacist violence along the US borderlands — was introduced to police to control the movement of Mexican migrants in particular, but also other people who might cross the southern border.Yes, many people tend to only think of Mexican migrants trying to cross the southern border. But there are people from Caribbean countries taking long, arduous treks across water and through numerous nations and terrains to seek American asylum. For example,reports have suggestedthat many of the more than 14,000 Haitian migrants who were camped under the Del Rio International Bridge had actually left Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and had stopped in places like Brazil and Chile but have been on the move to Mexico due to various circumstances. What kinds of conditions have these migrants faced in the past 10 or so years?From what I’ve learned from organizations like the Haitian Bridge Alliance and from reporters who have gone down to places like Brazil to report on conditions, especially after the economic downturn and other crises in Brazil, is that they couldn’t stay there. So they went to Chile and didn’t have the greatest reception there and sometimes faced a harrowing journey through jungles and across borders.There’s agigantic immigration detention facility in southern Mexico, where Mexico does a lot of the dirty work of the United States by detaining people who’ve crossed the border with Guatemala. If they got out of there, and were able to make it through the dangerous terrain up to the US-Mexico border, that is a major act of survival because of everything that they had to face in coming so many miles and facing so many police forces, prisons, and natural challenges. And then to see the images and read the reports that they’re living in that large encampment now, and just trying to get food and water and then to face that violent reprisal by the US Border Patrol — it’s just unimaginable.And how does this modern-day situation compare to the kind of treatment Haitian migrants have traditionally received over the past couple of decades, whether they’re entering through the southern border or trying to get to Florida’s shores by boat?They have, for most of history, been met with exclusion. During the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, most Haitians were coming on student visas or tourist visas, and then if they didn’t have authorization to stay, they were overstaying their visa. There were also a number of political exiles. So they weren’t really on the radar and seen as a big problem. They were establishing themselves in neighborhoods in New York primarily, and in Boston and elsewhere in Canada.It’s really in the early to mid-1970s when the so-called “boat people,” which is a different demographic — more working-class, urban, displaced Haitians — started to come by boats and ships, trying to make it to American shores. When they tried to put in asylum claims was when they started to be more on the radar of American authorities.That triggered this racist backlash, especially in South Florida, because it was at a moment when there was already a racist backlash to the civil rights movement. So to have all these poor unauthorized migrants who don’t speak English, that are Black, showing up, there’s this really racist reaction.South Floridians started to put pressure on their local officials, who then turned to Washington, and there was a very concerted effort to keep Haitians out. The Carter administrationintroduced something called the Haitian Program— a punishing set of policies designed to deter Haitians from coming in. And if they were already here, it tried to keep them out of the mainstream population. That meant putting them in detention facilities and local jails, basically denying them carte blanche their asylum claims and just sending them back.There was a big legal challenge in 1980,,where Haitian migrants and their advocates got a federal judge named James Lawrence King to recognize in a ruling that this practice was not only discriminatory but also racist. Haitians were being excluded because they were Black and because they were Haitian. King overturned the Haitian Program, but the Carter administration worked to circumvent it like subsequent administrations would.When the Reagan administration came into power, they introduced a new Haitian detention program and the policy of interdiction, in which Coast Guard cutters would intercept boats of Haitian asylum seekers before they could even reach land and send them back, often to violence and death in Haiti. That process continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s.The Biden administration’s mass denial of asylum claims, which they’re doing by invokingTitle 42— a 2020 Trump administration coronavirus policy that has been used to expel more than a million migrants without hearings before an immigration judge — is not something new. This is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have done, and it very much fits with the long history of the US government denying the legitimacy of Haitians’ asylum claims and sending them to a dangerous and often deadly situation.It seems presidents of all backgrounds and in both parties have engaged in harm toward Haiti and Haitian migrants. US involvement in Haiti has often led to periods of instability there, but then the US has at times in the past turned around andinterned Haitians at Guantanamo.The coup d’état against Haiti’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, happened when George H.W. Bush was in power, and hesort of paid lip service to the illegitimate military governmentthat was ruling after Aristide was put out of office. But Bush refused to accept Haitian asylum seekers and did everything the US government could to keep Haitians from being able to seek safe haven, even though the human rights atrocities after the coup were well-documented.There was another set of legal challenges and legal battles in the courts to give Haitians asylum, some of which were somewhat successful, but that’s the period when Guantanamo was first established as an offshore prison to try to serve as a buffer for people whom you don’t even want to allow to get to American shores to seek asylum. And Haitians were the first Guantanamo detainees.When Bill Clinton was running for president and trying to defeat George H.W. Bush, he promised to reverse that. A lot of Americans and people around the world were indignant about the Bush administration’s treatment of Haitians.Of course we’re gonna let Haitians in,” Clinton said. But after he was elected, he reversed course and turned his back on the Haitians and said, “Well, we don’t want to trigger another humanitarian crisis by taking people because then more people will go out on this perilous journey across the ocean.”He was trying to invoke humanitarian reasons for still denying people the right to seek asylum.Meanwhile, more Haitians filled up Guantanamo, some of whom were HIV positive and had AIDS. That began another chapter in what one scholar calls the carceral quarantine of Haitians for medical reasons. This was similar to what’s happening today because Title 42 is built on the basis of public health mandates to exclude people. While many people were forcibly returned from Guantanamo to Haiti, a number of those Haitians who remained at Guantanamo were able to make it to the United States after intense political and legal struggle.There’s historically also been a difference between how Cuban migrants and Haitian migrants have been treated,which many scholars point out is based on skin color. Is it useful to compare the plight of various migrant groups trying to make it into the United States?I think it is useful. I think there are a lot of interesting polarities in the experience of Haitians and Cubans in how they come to the United States. The best example of course was the summer of 1980 when more than 100,000 Cubans came by boat seeking asylum, and so did approximately 15,000 Haitians.The Refugee Act of 1980 had just passed, but it didn’t have clear instructions for how to treat vast numbers of asylum seekers, so initially, both Cubans and Haitians were placed in refugee camps on military bases across the United States. But pretty quickly, Cubans, for the most part, were released and allowed to be with family members and the Cuban community. Haitians languished in detention much longer.For the Haitians that came after, a special piece of legislation was passed to adjust their status known as theCuban-Haitian Entrant Act of 1980. But the Haitians that came after the act were again treated just like the ones that came before — excluded and barred. Cubans never suffered the same kind of exclusion or mass detention that Haitians did, despite the fact that they’re both coming from Caribbean nations and seeking asylum.How do these exclusionary policies translate to how Haitians are treated once in America?For the Haitian community and Haitian migrants in particular, they’ve repeatedly been targeted as disease carriers, which historically has also been a racialized notion not only of the foreign-born but especially of the nonwhite foreign-born. In the 1970s, their incarceration exclusion was sometimes justified on the basis that they were carrying tuberculosis. In the 1980s and especially in the 1990s, it became the notion that they were carrying AIDS. But Haitians said all along that singling them out is discriminatory because they aren’t any more likely to be diseased than other people. It is racialized stigmatization.The same thing goes for criminalization. TheBlack Alliance for Just Immigrationhas documented how Black immigrants are much more likely to be incarcerated, how they spend much more time in detention, and how their asylum cases, deportation cases, and immigration appeals are much more likely to be denied. That’s part of how immigration enforcement blends into the criminal justice system and policing — now that there’s a criminalized racial immigration system, often a migrant’s first point ofcontact in this country is with law enforcement.A lot of municipalities and localities have an agreement between their local law enforcement in the immigration system that they will refer any unauthorized or undocumented person or someone with some kind of immigration issue over to the immigration system. They then get put into the immigration system based on some racialized reading about who they are and are disproportionately likely to be detained or deported.So it’s clear that Haitian migrants are particularly demonized and criminalized, but I also think another element to their story is erasure. It feels like not many people know about this history. Even in the past decade or so, conversations about immigrants tend to leave out Black immigrants in general. Research from the nonprofit organization RAICESfound that 44 percent of familiesthat ICE locked up during the pandemic last year were Haitian and that this information was underreported.A February 2021reportfrom the American Immigration Council stated that at one detention center in 2020, nearly half of the families threatened with family separation were Black and originated from Haiti, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and Afro-Latino communities in Latin America. What does the erasure signify?Black migrants, Black immigrants, and Black asylum seekers are often left out of discussions of immigration, immigrant rights, and immigrant justice. In the media, when we are having these big national debates, we tend to think more about Central Americans and other Latin Americans, not the Caribbean so much. And, of course, in recent years, there were large numbers of displaced people coming from Central America — and that’s part of why that drew the attention.But it’s also true that Haitians only appear from time to time in conversation, and it’s not understood that their experiences track really closely to a lot of other asylum seekers.Even with the current attention being paid to the treatment of Haitian migrants, it’s still unclear how the United States is going to decide which Haitians they allow in and which they don’t. The Biden administration’s initial response was to schedule seven flights a day to send Haitians at the border back. But then the Associated Pressreportedthat Haitians were being released to El Paso, Texas; Arizona; and other places for 60 days before they’d have to appear at an immigration office. There’s not much transparency about how these decisions are being made.​​The Biden administration is under intense political pressure from different sides and from different interests, just as previous administrations have been. The administration is trying to maintain its image as being very different from the Trump administration, especially when it comes to racism and anti-immigrant nativist xenophobia, but I don’t believe that his policies have yet proven to be very different.[Vice President] Kamala Harris can stand there and say she is horrified, and [press secretary]Jen Psaki can say the same. But the whole reason the inhumane treatment of Haitians is happening is because the Biden administration is continuing the Trump administration’s illegitimate and unjustified use of Title 42, which is a way of denying the asylum process to which Haitians and all other people are entitled, by both our own federal law and international law.US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorcas made a strong statement to migrants saying that if they come here illegally, they’re going to be removed, that they are going to fail. But it’s not illegal to claim asylum. It is a legal right to claim asylum. Migrants have to have a legitimate fear of past or future persecution in their home country on the basis of a number of categories — if they can prove that, then they’ve proven their asylum case and are supposed to be allowed to stay.Many activists have used the phrase “Haitians are owed.” There’s this idea that the world owes Haitiand has played a role in its plight. What do you think about this in the context of what took place at the border this week?We do all owe Haitians for the Haitian Revolution, which successfully ended in 1804 and was the most sweeping human rights revolution in all of human history. Haitian liberation, first from slavery and then from colonialism and achieving independence, was a victory for all enslaved, oppressed people, including Black Americans.In many ways, Haitians, sadly, because they’ve so often been targeted by racism and injustice, have kept fighting in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s in this country and in others. Their determination to liberate themselves and other people they’ve struggled alongside continues to be a model for how all incarcerated, enslaved, and otherwise abused people can find their liberation. That’s one major reason we owe a debt of gratitude to Haitians.That’s even more reason to fight alongside them for justice today at the US-Mexico border and wherever they encounter racism and discrimination.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following the suspension of U.S. sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who tested positive for THC — a chemical compound found in marijuana — during a drug test at the recent U.S. Olympic trials.Ocasio-Cortez called on the IOC to “reconsider its suspension” of Richardson, as well as any other similarly “penalized” athletes, arguing that the criminalization of cannabis is an “instrument” of policies related to racism and colonialism.“The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “The IOC should reconsider its suspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial of swim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.”The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy.The IOC should reconsider its suspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial of swim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.https://t.co/Ao1Yu8Ax9G— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)July 2, 2021AstheNew York Postnoted, “Following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) relaxed the threshold for what constitutes a positive marijuana test from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 nanograms per milliliter in an effort to detect use during competition rather than in the days and weeks before.”“However, marijuana remains on WADA’s list of prohibited substances, with THC — the chemical Richardson tested positive for — classified as a so-called ‘Substance of Abuse’ along with cocaine, ecstasy and heroin due to their use in society outside of a competitive context,” the Post added.Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s claims, colonialism was actually a driving factor behind the cultivation of cannabis. Indeed, one of the three primary crops George Washington grew at Mount Vernon was hemp. It wasn’t until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 that cannabis products were required to be accurately labeled, which then opened the door to regulation and criminalization.While Ocasio-Cortez issomewhat accuratewhen it comes to racist elements of the history of cannabis criminalization, the argument that the IOC is therefore racist is arguably unfounded, given that it is applied to all athletes, regardless of race.“The rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels; hopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we can successfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her,”saidUSADA CEO Travis T. Tygart of Richardson’s suspension.Indeed, Richardson herself did not make any accusation of racism against the IOC.“Honestly, I just want to apologize for my actions,” Richardsonsaid. “I know what I did. I know what I’m supposed to do, I’m allowed not to do, and I still made that decision. Not making any excuse, or looking for any empathy in my case.”“At the Olympic trials, Richardson ran the 100 meters in 10.86 seconds, even though she informed the world after the race that her biological mother had passed away the week before,”The Daily Wire’sJoe Morgan reported. “Richardson admitted to using marijuana in order to cope with the loss.”“We all have our different struggles, we all have our different things we deal with. But to put on a face, and have to go in front of the world, and put on a face and hide my pain,” shesaid. “Who am I to tell you how to cope when you’re dealing with a pain, or dealing with a struggle that you’ve never experienced before?”",1
492,"Early Voting Begins in the Georgia Runoffs Today, With Control of the U.S. Senate at Stake",-9.33,45.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/ossoff-warnock-early-voting-georgia-senate-runoffs,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,vogue,23,"Today, as Georgians begin early voting in two races that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate for the next six years, Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock are taking to the road, spreading the message that their opponents are unfit to hold office.Ossoff and Warnock, both of whom are trying to unseat incumbent Republicans, have been conducting a largely joint campaign that mixes in-person and virtual events (the latter featuring guest appearances by such notable figures asthe comedian Leslie Jonesand former president Barack Obama) as they try to win a state that hasn’t elected a Democratic senatorsince 1996.But history—and the changing demographics of Georgia—may be in their favor: Joe Biden won the state in the presidential election, the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992. (President-elect Biden will join the two candidates at a campaign rally in the Atlanta metro area on Tuesday.)And the two senators they are facing, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Perdue seeking his second term, Loeffler her first full one—may well be vulnerable. Both have faced scrutiny over questionable stock transactions that may have benefitedfrom inside informationthe two received at Senate briefings. It’s an idea that both Ossoff and Warnock have leaned into on the campaign trail—bestowing on Loeffler and Perdue the catchy nickname “the Bonnie and Clyde of Political Corruption”—and one that Ossoff has been particularly enthusiastic about in his messaging, mostly on his very active Twitter account:This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.Ossoff went for the jugular in his first debate, held before the November 3 election, as he attacked a visibility uncomfortable Perdue for failing to aggressively respond to the health and financial crises that Georgians have suffered because of the coronavirus. “Perhaps Senator Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you hadn’t been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading,”Ossoff said. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator. It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You did say COVID-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You did say there would be no significant uptick in cases. All the while, you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.”That exchange might have been the reason Perdue skipped the runoff debate on December 6, leading to the slightly surreal scene of Ossoffconfronting an empty podium across the stage. At the debate, Ossoff called Perdue a “coward” and slammed him for not showing up. “It shows an astonishing arrogance and sense of entitlement for Georgia’s senior U.S. senator to believe he shouldn’t have to debate at a moment like this in our history,” Ossoff said, gesturing toward the empty podium. “Your senator is refusing to answer questions and debate his opponent because he believes he shouldn’t have to. He believes this Senate seat belongs to him. This Senate seat belongs to the people.” (On that same day, Warnock and Loeffler held their own debate, an exchange mostly notable for the number of times that Loefflerrefused to acknowledge that Joe Biden was the president-elect.)ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThis content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.Ossoff also hammered away at Perdue in his Instagram Live conversation with Leslie Jones, telling her that his opponent “has been treating his Senate office like an E-Trade account.”Democratic PACs, including one associated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are pouring millions of dollars into this race, investing in commercials and campaign literature that stress the theme that Perdue and Loeffler are ethically compromised. “We plan to fully expose their unethical and potentially illegal behavior in the weeks ahead,” J. B. Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC,recently told Politico. “Georgians simply can’t trust David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler when they’re knee-deep in the swamp and profiting at their expense.”If Ossoff and Warnock win, the Senate will be split 50-50, with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris having the power to cast the deciding vote. If Perdue and Loeffler win, the Republicans will hold a slim 52-48 majority, made even more precarious by the possibility that one or more senators will be struck by COVID in the coming months, rendering them unavailable for floor votes. (At least ahalf-dozen Republican senatorshave already tested positive for the coronavirus in the past few months, including Loeffler herself.)ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesOne wild card in the race is Donald Trump. When the president isn’t pursuing yet another hopeless challenge to the presidential election, heis attacking Georgia’s elected officials, including the governor and secretary of state (both Republicans, by the way), for helping Joe Biden’s campaign “steal” the race. At a campaign rally in Valdosta, Georgia, nominally held to help get out the vote for Perdue and Loeffler—both of whom Trump casually called up on stage and then ushered off a few minutes later—Trump spentmost of the hour and a half bemoaning his loss.“They cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we’ll still win,” Trump told a crowd of about 10,000 supporters, many of whom chanted, “Stop the steal!” And he renewed his attacks on Governor Brian Kemp, who had run as a Trump-faithful candidate just two years ago. “Your governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,” the president said.Some Republicans fear that Trump’s relentless attacks on the voting system could depress voter turnout between now and January 5. “You can’t say the system is rigged but elect these two senators,” Eric Johnson, a campaign adviser to Kelly Loeffler and a former Republican leader of the Georgia Senate,recently told the. “At some point he either drops it or he says I want everybody to vote and get their friends to vote so that the margins are so large that they can’t steal it.”Today, as part of his Health, Jobs, and Justice Bus Tour, Ossoff will lead a march to the polls in the town of Duluth and later attend an outdoor campaign event in Atlanta alongside Reverend Warnock.If the Democrats are to win, turnout is key, particularly in counties like Fulton and Gwinnett, in the greater Atlanta area, which werekey to Biden’s razor-thin victory in the state. That surge of newly Democratic votes is largely attributable to the efforts of Stacey Abrams, who, after narrowly losing the 2018 governor’s race to Kemp, has spent the last two yearsfocusing on ballot access and voter registration, particularly in the Black community. Abrams has built a network of organizations, includingNew Georgia ProjectandFair Fight, that highlighted past voter suppression in the state and havehelped register an estimated 800,000 new voters in Georgia.ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThere was a strong turnout of early voters on a rainy Monday morning, withCNN reportingthat in Marietta, part of the key Democratic stronghold of suburban Atlanta, lines of voters began forming before sunrise and “people wrapped themselves in blankets, carried umbrellas, and huddled under lawn chairs.”After speaking to a crowd of labor union canvassers on Friday,Warnock said early turnout would be key to the race:“It’s how we won in the general and it’s how we’re going to win in the runoff.”",2
493,College Enrollment Dip Hits Students of Color the Hardest,-2.0,47.33,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/college-enrollment-dip-hits-students-of-color-the-hardest/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,edweek,25,"Corrected: An earlier version of this story incorrectly noted the drop in two-year college enrollment for new graduating seniors in 2020; it was 12 percent, not 12 percentage points.During the 2020-21 school year, 120,000 fewer new high school graduates entered the nation’s colleges and universities than the year before, according to anew analysis by the College Board.The pandemic has particularly set back students of color, and seems to have set up significantly different education trends in two- and four-year colleges.For students heading to four-year, public universities, the pandemic was more of a road bump than a road block—and for some, it was even an opportunity. Public four-year colleges saw an enrollment decline of less than 3 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. At some more selective four-year colleges, enrollment actually increased, because the institutions started to accept more students with lower GPAs after seeing more of the highest-performing high school graduates opting to sit out this year. Likewise, the incoming students at four-year colleges became more likely to stay through their freshman year.But community colleges and other two-year institutions—which several states have promoted through tuition “promise” programs and similar scholarships—experienced a different story. Overall enrollment in those schools dropped 12 percent among new graduating seniors in 2020 compared to the prior class.Moreover, the drop in enrollment for most students of color at two-year colleges was several times worse than the decline for such students at four-year colleges. At two-year colleges, for example, Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian students’ enrollment rates dropped by about 15 percent each, while at four-year colleges, the drop in enrollment was only 1.9 percent for Hispanic students and 2.6 percent for Native Hawaiian students. There was no statistically significant change in Black student enrollment at four-year colleges in 2020, compared to the prior year.“We usually see college enrollment increase during recessions, particularly at community colleges, but not this time,” said Jessica Howell, vice president of research for the College Board and a co-author of the report. “When we start to look under the hood of that top-line result we start to start to see a new picture of disparate impact emerging.”That’s because community colleges disproportionately serve some of the same students whose communities have also been hit hardest by the pandemic, Howell said. She noted that the two-year college sector typically attracts “many of the subgroups of students who are historically under-resourced or vulnerable or underrepresented in higher ed., or disadvantaged more broadly in terms of educational opportunity—underrepresented minority students, first-generation students, students who live in some of the most educationally disadvantaged neighborhoods and attend some of the highest poverty high schools—and the impact of the pandemic on college enrollment rates is quite clearly most severe among those students.”Moreover, the College Board found about 5 percent fewer students entering two-year colleges in 2020 returned after their first year, an opposite trend from what was seen in four-year colleges.Researchers did find that college enrollment was lower in counties with high COVID-19 infection rates—generally those above 15.8 daily cases per 10,000 residents—but again, the effect was strongest for two-year colleges.College Board researchers analyzed data from more than 3 million graduating high school seniors from each of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 classes. They also accounted in the data for trends in enrollment at different kinds of colleges that had already begun before the pandemic.Other recent studies have suggested students who graduated in communities hit hardest by the pandemic’s economic downturn alsohad more competition for financial aid. That could mean the disparities in college enrollment could worsen next year, as separate studies have found the Class of 2021 already falling behind even the prior year in applying for colleges andarranging financial aid.“It’s important to note that the students we’re talking about [in the class of 2020] really didn’t have too much disruption to their learning,” Howell said. “They didn’t have any disruption to their testing. They didn’t face widespread changes to admissions practices—all of which are things, of course, that affected the class of 2021 much more.”",2
494,Republicans Like Bob Corker Have Nowhere to Go,-7.67,35.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/bob-corker-republicans-trump/619436/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,theatlantic,25,"The former senator from Tennessee famously clashed with President Donald Trump. After two years of silence, he still thinks his party is the future.Senator Bob Corker had just gotten out of a hot-yoga session with his wife on a Sunday morning in 2017 when his phone started blowing up. President Donald Trump was tweeting about him, falsely claiming that the Tennessee Republican supported the Iran deal (he did not) and that he had begged Trump for a reelection endorsement (Corker says he never did such a thing). “I got to my house, and I was dripping wet, standing in my closet, getting undressed to go jump in the shower,” Corker told me recently from his office in Chattanooga. He typed out a response: “It’s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” Corker sent it to a couple members of his staff—“No public officials should ever send their own tweets,” he says—whom he expected to talk him down. “No, it’s too good,” they told him. “We’re going to let it go.” Thecommenthas now been retweeted nearly 148,000 times.Corker’s tweet seemed to resonate because it stated plainly something that few Republicans were willing to say out loud at the time: The country was being run by someone who regularly broadcasted false information, seemingly without forethought or input from his staff. But Corker, who left office in 2019, gets frustrated by the focus on this kind of dramatic episode. “I spend not one second of my day thinking about any of those things. Okay? Not one second,” he said. “It’s such an irrelevant part of our life.”Still, he is also starting to recognize that his legacy as a United States senator—and as mayor of Chattanooga, where he got his start in elective office—was defined not just by the legislation he passed or his work as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee but by his willingness to call out racism and moral failings in his own party. Corker still believes in what he sees as the core mission of the Republican Party: to promote free enterprise, fight for equal opportunity for everyone, and protect citizens’ safety. But it’s not clear where a person like him fits in today’s version of the GOP. In 2020, Corker didn’t vote for Trump, but he also couldn’t bring himself to support Joe Biden. He cast his ballot for a Republican senator who, Corker believes, has no desire to be president. (He wouldn’t say which one—even his wife doesn’t know.) That ethos is hard to find in Washington, but Corker still believes it’s worth pursuing.Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.Let’s start with some ancient history. In 2006, you were running for Senate, and the Republican National Committee financed aninfamous adaboutyour opponent,Harold Ford Jr.(The ad showed fake “man on the street”–style interviews, including one with a scantily dressed white woman who declares, “I met Harold at the Playboy party!”) At the time, you said, “We don’t want this. We want it pulled,” and it was gone in a few days.The ad seems to be an early sign of where the Republican Party might have been headed. Were there elements at that time in the national leadership of the party who might have been thinking,You’re maybe overthinking what actually happened. Probably the type of person who thought up that ad was some political operative or some pollster. Matter of fact, I had very tough conversations with the entity that ran that ad.What were those conversations like?Oh, it just cratered us. We were at plus-six in the race, and it took us to minus-four over seven days. The ad came out on a Friday night, and it ran throughout the weekend, but you can’t pull it down. And we couldn’t talk directly with the RNC, because it was illegal. The ad was constantly on the air—Wolf Blitzer and Chris Matthews. Every outlet in the country was talking about it.And it painted me. I mean, how did I evolve to the public arena? I saw that we had poverty in our inner city and people who weren’t able to live in decent housing. I led thecreation of a nonprofitthat helped 10,000 people here in our community have decent, fit, and affordable housing. Predominantly, they were African Americans. That was my history. So I come to this race. People didn’t differentiate between me and the RNC. They did so much damage to us and hurt me personally. People who didn’t know me thought I was a part of that.Was your criticism that the ad was strategically unwise? Or was there a bigger-picture conversation about, “Who are we as a party, and what kind of message are we trying to send?”When you’re 30 days or three weeks away from a nationalized election, you’re not thinking at that moment about what this says about us as a party. You’re livid over what people have done to you in the election in the name of helping you.I’ll fast-forward to an event that, to me, is more indicative. When I ran for Senate in 2006, we had a Democratic governor, and the election was very close. We were a mixed state. West Tennessee was Democratic. Look at what happened when President Obama was elected. Lookat west Tennessee today. To me, that’s a little more indicative of how race possibly affected the state of Tennessee.Say a little bit more about that. You felt, even at the time when President Obama was running in 2008, that there might be political changes happening?We were in the height of a financial-system breakdown. I was highly involved, as a young senator, inshaping the futureof the automobile industry. So, no, I’m not thinking about that at the time. What I’m reflecting upon is that by 2010, Tennessee had become a solidly red state. Obviously, people in our state railed against President Obama’s policies and health-care bill. But there was certainly a turn in our state to bright red from being purple just a few years earlier.Can I say that race had nothing to do with that? I don’t think that I can.In the period you’re pointing to—2008, 2010, the Tea Party surge—there was a turn within the Republican base. At the time, did you look around and say,?I mean, obviously, I was very aware. During the Tea Party period of time, I did 66 town-hall meetings across our state. I remember walking into the Loudon High School auditorium. Town-hall meetings typically are not particularly interesting. But there were over a thousand people there with placards. They were angry—at Republicans, too. I was very concerned about where we were going fiscally as a nation, but I was unaligned with them because I was from Washington, and I didn’t say the red-meat things because I don’t believe them. I’ve never been able to say those kinds of things. I cannot bash the other side of the aisle. I’ve just never been able to bash a Democrat because they’re a Democrat.The Tea Party—they liked me. They didn’t love me.Read: The evangelical politician who doesn’t recognize his faith—or his partyWhen you first saw candidate Trump coming onto the scene a few years later, it seems like you thought,You’re shaking your head.There were other candidates I preferred who washed out. I was just amazed at it. But I’ve always attempted to be constructive. I remember watching a foreign-policy speech that Trump gave. It was okay. What I tried to do, especially being chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was to take a few sentences of what he said and applaud those and try to build on those—almost leave a trail to a better place. Not to flatter him or get in his good graces. But, hopefully, I would be one of the few people saying something positive at that time, and he would read that and think,Sure enough, he called right after that, thanking me for saying something positive.You talk about the rally in Charlottesville as a defining moment. What were you thinking as you were watching that on television and the press conference that happened afterwards?I took a few days to take in everything that happened. I think the rally was on a Saturday. Tuesday at Trump Tower, the president made the comments that he made. I knew I was going to be here in Chattanooga on Thursday, in my hometown.I got a call early one morning from someone at the White House. I was a recipient of calls from a number of people—almost like they were standing in a coat closet in the White House: “Corker. You cannot believe what has happened.” I received a call from someone well known, probably about 6 a.m. Everybody knows I get up early.I knew what I was going to do. I thought throughthe words I was going to usevery carefully. I used the words: “The president hasnot yetdemonstrated …” That gives this person the ability to become something different than they were at that time.In retrospect, we can all recognize that Charlottesville was a turning point in the Trump presidency. But what was it about that moment that made you think,?I was mayor of a city. I spent my time dealing with issues in our inner city. These were my friends, my fellow citizens, my constituents, the people that I worked with on a daily basis. To have a person who was blatantly dog-whistling to white supremacists was totally unacceptable. Something needed to be said. Not in a way that was a personal attack but to focus on the fact that this person was not rising to the occasion as a president.In the days leading up to January 6, the two senators from Tennessee were part of the effort to challenge the certification of the Electoral College results. One of those people was your replacement. Did you call them up and say, “This is not how we do this”?I made astatement. I go out of my way to not ever name people. I just don’t think that’s constructive. But we know from other quarters that it stung. I served for 12 years in the Senate, a year and a half as commissioner of finance, and four years as mayor. I know how receiving calls like that is. I’ve tried to not be one of those people. They’re the senators now, and I am not.What do you imagine your work ahead will be? Where will your labors be most valuable?I’ve got a lot of energizing, fun things going in business. But I know, down in here [], that while I will always continue to love the world of business, there will be some missional thing that will evolve as a part of my life. I don’t know what that is yet, but I just know what my DNA is. It’s been that way since I was in my late 20s. I’ve had the greatest privilege of my life serving publicly. The most rewarding period of time was being mayor of a city, where you touch people in a real way.I’ve earned the right for a period of time to be in this state that I’m at. I’ve got the freedom to be uncluttered, mind-wise, with all these things that you’re talking about.Read: Eric Metaxas believes America is creeping toward Nazi GermanyI want to ask you about something that’s actually more local, and perhaps more symbolic. The once-defunct Walnut Street Bridge, which isnow a vibrant pedestrian pathway, is a beautiful symbol of Chattanooga’s future. It’s also where theEd Johnson lynching memorialhas been built. To me, this really captures the challenge ahead for the city: to thrive and grow and attract people to live here, but also to talk more openly about the history of this place, where lynchings occurred.This is a really big struggle in the country right now—figuring out how to work optimistically toward the future, but also to be more open and honest about our past. I think people in your party have struggled with this. What I want to know from you is: What’s the right way forward in this hard moment?Just as it relates to the memorial, my wife and I contributed to it. I read about it in the paper, and I signed a check the next day. That’s something that we, as a family, support.Neither party is addressing the race issue in a manner that represents the greatness of our nation. I think the Democratic Party is doing as much damage—or more—on the issue of race today than even some of these subtle but real undertones in the Republican Party that you’re speaking of. We should be doing everything we can to give every student of every race and every young person every opportunity possible. But then to say, “We’re not going to do everything we can to have equal opportunity. We’re going to have equal outcomes”—all that does is exacerbate it, and then you’ve got white people who feel disenfranchised.I can’t believe what’s happening in Atlanta right now. I cannot believe the total lack of concern for allowing the crime issue to be what it is. I don’t understand what’s happening with these big-city mayors, how they would disrespect their citizenry so much that they would let crime be rampant.Generally speaking, Black people in our country somehow have had lesser opportunity. That’s what we ought to be focusing on, because that’s the future. That’s solving a problem. That’s taking us someplace. Should we be aware of our past? Yes, we should be aware of our past. But some of the things that are happening right now today are not benefiting racial equality. They’re actually taking us down a hole that leads to a place that is not constructive.",1

There are 94 county residents with active cases of Covid-19, the fewest in more than 14 months.McMahon declared a state of emergency in the county March 14, 2020, and issued a variety of executive orders in the following months to deal with Covid-19. His orders expedited county purchasing procedures, required face coverings at county facilities and capped food delivery fees, among many other measures.Given the waning threat from the virus, McMahon said he expects to let most or all of them expire next week.“When it comes to responding to Covid-19, neither the county of Onondaga nor the state of New York is really in an emergency,’' he said.Increasingly, McMahon said he will focus county efforts on reviving the economy and dealing with human service needs that were exacerbated by the pandemic. He mentioned drug abuse, mental health and youth violence specifically.The county on Tuesday finished giving away $100,000 worth of vouchers that can be used at local restaurants. For the second time, the vouchers were snapped up quickly, leaving many people frustrated.Some $75,000 in vouchers became available online Monday evening and were taken within 18 minutes, McMahon said. The giveaway attracted some 60,000 unique visitors to the county website.Another $25,000 in vouchers was awarded today to senior citizens, who could claim them by phone.  Those vouchers were gone within two hours, McMahon said.So far, the county has given away a total of $500,000 in vouchers, which can be used to double the value of gift cards purchased from restaurants. McMahon called the program a “wild success’' that will help local businesses recover from the pandemic.“I understand people may be frustrated if you didn’t get a voucher,’' he said.McMahon said he plans to provide more vouchers in the near future.“We will do another round,’' he said.",2

And in these trying times, perspective is key.For those daily awaking to the societal harm caused by colored, interlocking plastic, I deliver relief at last.LEGO will no longer offer “Girls” and “Boys” toys.Per astatementdated October 11th, the company observes, “New research commissioned by the LEGO Group reveals that girls today feel increasingly confident to engage in all types of play and creative activities…”Now the unnerving news:[They] remain held back by society’s ingrained gender stereotypes as they grow older.A probe’s been performed, courtesy of a group founded byHollywood actressGeena Davis.The study was carried out by theGeena Davis Institutein recognition of the UN’s International Day of the Girl and to mark the launch of a new LEGO® campaign, “Ready for Girls,” which celebrates girls who rebuild the world through creative problem solving.The study took place domestically, as well as in China, Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, and the UK.The research findings show that girls are ready for the world, but society isn’t quite ready to support their growth through play. Girls feel less restrained by and are less supportive of typical gender biases than boys when it comes to creative play (74% of boys vs. 62% of girls believe that some activities are just meant for girls, while others are meant for boys), and they are more open towards different types of creative play compared to what their parents and society typically encourage.As an example, “82% of girls believe it’s okay for girls to play football and boys to practice ballet, compared to only 71% of boys.”LEGO laments “girls are typically encouraged into activities that are more cognitive, artistic and related to performance compared to boys who are more likely to be pushed into physical and STEM-like activities (digital, science, building, tools).”What’s a maker of rectangles that click together to do? LEGO’s “calling on parents and children to champion inclusive play.”To assist moms and dads, the company’s developed “a fun 10-step guide and [invites] parents to share photos of their child’s LEGO creations against a pre-defined…backdrop featuring the words ‘Get the World Ready for Me.'”Perhaps more potently, the toy titan is sockin’ it to stereotypes by lifting labels.Literally.As relayed byThe Guardian, LEGO’s chief product and marketing officer — Julia Goldin — ensures it’s “working hard to make LEGO more inclusive.”Hence:Goldin [says] Lego no longer labelled any of its products “for girls” or “for boys.” On LEGO.com, consumers cannot search for products by gender.Surely time-constrained parents will appreciate the assist.Instead, the website offers themes that it calls “passion points.”If you’re still not convinced something must be done, the Geena Davis Institute “foundthat parents of both sexes rated men as ‘more creative,’ were six times as likely to think of scientists and athletes as being men rather than women, and more than eight times as likely to think of engineers as men.”With each passing day, headlines make it clear: Our unwoke days are over.Some might suggest a certain societal sect isn’t so much bothered by the sexes assuming different roles as they are intent upon forcing them intoones.Personally, I believe everyone should generally do what they wish — and we shouldn’t care what choices are made.But culture’s new normal is one of colossal care.There once was a savage system in which men and women were not the same. Therefore, they were inclined toward dissimilar things.But that was (not) long ago.These days, we’re building something new.And now, we can construct it with LEGO.To be clear, it’s not the building block behemoth’s first time to help:Don't Confuse the Kids: LEGO Requests All Marketing for Its Police and Fire Sets Be Removedhttps://t.co/Lu3GLH4dtb— RedState (@RedState)June 3, 2020Lego Announces Its Gender-Nonbinary Playset Featuring a Black Drag Queenhttps://t.co/E8UpkowTbs— RedState (@RedState)May 21, 2021For those unready for the revolution, there’s alwaysLincoln Logs.On second thought, the wrecking ball of cancellation is likely dangling in the wings:Lincoln's Name Yanked From California School: He Didn't Prove 'Black Lives Ever Mattered' to Himhttps://t.co/clUXpom7b3— RedState (@RedState)December 17, 2020So get with the progressive program, load up on LEGO, and let’sBuild Back Better.-ALEXSee more pieces from me:Pulitzer-Finalist Professor Gets Canceled for Showing Students a Film From 1965Glimpse of the Future?

497,Greta Thunberg Hilariously Trolls Donald Trump on Twitter With His Own Tweet,-10.0,31.0,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a34599592/greta-thunberg-trolled-donald-trump-tweet/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-06,cosmopolitan,16,"Greta Thunberg, 17-year-old environmental activistand overall badass, is a literal icon…but with that icon status comes more than a few people who just cannot bear to witness and accept the greatness. Sadly, one of those haters includes Donald Trump—a 74-year-old man who seems to enjoy picking on a teen for some reason.Case in point: After Greta was named’s Person of the Year in December 2019, Trump saw it as an opportunity to try to drag her and her efforts to combat climate change. “So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!” Trump tweeted at the time.But Greta got to have the final laugh in the matter. As you may know, Trump refuses to acknowledge thathe’s currently trailing Biden in the 2020 presidential election, so when Trump tweeted “STOP THE COUNT” yesterday, Greta saw it as an opportunity to embarrass him.Greta quoted Trump’s tweet to her verbatim and wrote, “So ridiculous. Donald must work on his Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Donald, Chill!”Now, this? This is what you call a comeuppance, my friends.",1
498,Orange deputy said trainer threatened him. The agency’s probe led to his own firing,0.0,48.33,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange-county/os-ne-orange-deputy-terminated-untruthful-flawed-case-20201102-r7qrlclogvf7hokdhd2fojltae-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/orlando-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-02,orlandosentinel,22,"During one of his first weeks as a provisional Orange County deputy sheriff, Jacob Stewart said his field training officer became angry and threatened to kill him — pulling out a gun and a knife, before threatening to use his bare hands and “bury him in the woods.”But when the Sheriff’s Office began investigating the incident 18 months later, Stewart said he quickly went from being treated as a potential victim of aggravated assault, to the target of an internal investigation into whether changes in his testimony amounted to lies.That probe led to his firing from the agency for being untruthful, after OCSO investigators said he initially claimed Deputy First Class Keith Mobley pointed the gun and knife at him, but conceded in a follow-up interview that he didn’t see the Mobley point the weapons at him.Stewart — who has now twice appealed his firing without success — says the investigations that led to his termination were biased against him, that he felt coerced to change his story and that the probes violated his rights as a crime victim and officer under investigation.The truthfulness violation also landed him on the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s OfficeBrady list, which tracks officers with credibility issues. He said his inclusion is unwarranted.“Nothing I said about it is untrue, and that’s what disheartens me the most,” Stewart, 24, told the Orlando Sentinel. “I wanted to be as open and honest. … I’ve been brutalized during this entire process.”Stewart and attorneys for the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 93, which represents OCSO deputies, said theyare now considering filing a lawsuit, having exhaustedinternal reviews.Michelle Guido, an OCSO spokeswoman, said the agency affords officers accused of wrongdoing “all elements of” the state’s Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights.Stewart says the incident occurred in June 2018, during one of his first weeks of in-the-field training. He was driving when he missed an update on his laptop about a call to which he and Mobley were responding, angering Mobley.From the passenger seat, Mobley grabbed the steering wheel while the vehicle was moving, forcing Stewart to pull over, the OCSO investigative report said.Stewart said he then heard the “distinct sound” of Mobley’s agency-issued firearm being removed from its holster, and in his peripheral view saw Mobley holding the gun “pointed directly at [him],” the report said. Mobley re-holstered it, but continued to threaten Stewart, this time with a knife, Stewart said. Mobley then threatened to kill him with his bare hands and bury his body, Stewart said.Mobley told investigators he remembered getting upset and possibly yelling or cursing at Stewart, which he said was in response to an insubordinate comment by the new deputy. But he denied ever threatening to kill him or pointing any weapons at him, describing the incident asa training “misunderstanding.”There was no video evidence and only Stewart and Mobley were in the vehicle.Stewart reported to a supervisor that he was threatened by Mobley, and soon after requested a new field training officer, but the OCSO probe wasn’t opened until about 18 months later. It began after a colleague who Stewart had told about the incident reported it to the Professional Standards Division.After talking to Stewart, investigators interviewed six deputies and Stewart’s wife, who he’d toldabout what happened. All said Stewart had described being threatened by Mobley, though some said they thought Mobley only threatened to beat him up. Two recounted the full scenario Stewart had described to investigators. One said he’d heard Stewart was threatened only with a knife, but had learned from Mobley that wasn’t the case.Investigators then spoke again to Stewart “to clarify discrepancies in his initial testimony,” the report said. After officials pressed Stewart on whether he embellished any part of his testimony, he conceded that he didn’t see the gun pointed at him or know for sure if it had been.Under Florida law, an assault charge requires only that person made a credible threat “by word or act to do violence” to another, and an assault is considered aggravated when any deadly weapon is involved. There is no distinction made for whether the weapon was pointed.Stewart attributes his uncertainty to the difficulty of trying to relay a traumatic incident months after the fact. He also feels he was coerced into changing the story.“To me it was clear I was going to be held in that room… until they got what they wanted,” Stewart said at his appeal hearing Monday. But OCSO investigators determined the coercion claim was “not reasonable” because he was a deputy with two years of experience.Though Stewart’s appeals were rejected, acaptain tasked with reviewing his first appeal found the investigations were biased, as Stewart claimed, and the findings should have been overturned.Capt. Susan Wallis noted investigators asked another deputy if Stewart may have “embellished” the incident, before that word had come up in interviews with Stewart. She also felt investigators were “accusatory and argumentative” with Stewart, while Mobley’s interviews were “cordial, calm, polite and professional.”Wallis also found investigators did not press Mobley on questionable training practices he described using, like “frightening verbal commands” and changing his voice tone and speed to “intentionally induce stress.”Without adequate explanation, Mobley’s admission that he used those methods “gives validity” to Stewart’s claim of having felt threatened, Wallis wrote.Investigators also interviewed 16 deputies who were trained in recent years by Mobley. None said he ever pointed a gun or weapon at them, but three mentioned they had concerning interactions with him.One said he would “randomly start to yell,” almost causing her to crash her car, while two others said Mobley mentioned that if the deputies got into a physical fight, Mobley would watch until they were near death before helping,the report said.Wallis said she was also concerned by the lack of separation between the two investigations: the criminal probe into whether Mobley had threatened Stewart and the administrative probe to determine if Stewart had lied.Both were conducted by the professional standards division, as is OCSO’s procedure, but assigned to different investigators.Wallis said Stewart was not quickly enough granted the rights that officers are afforded when they are under investigation. But Sheriff John Mina’s administration — which has the final say in all disciplinary decisions — overruled Wallis’ findings.At Monday’s hearing, three OCSO officials voted to uphold the investigation and his termination.Stewart said he still wants to return to being a deputy, because it’s always been his goal to serve the community. Other than the incident with Mobley, he said he enjoyed working for OCSO and even encouraged his wife to join the civilian staff.“That’s how highly I thought of it, I brought my family in,” Stewart said. “The Stewart name is still helping the citizens of Orange County. I take pride in that.”gtoohey@orlandosentinel.com",2
499,Biden's EPA Rolls Back Trump-Era Rule that Reduced the Number of Protected Wetlands,-7.0,44.67,https://www.newsandguts.com/bidens-epa-rolls-back-trump-era-rule-that-reduced-the-number-of-protected-wetlands/,https://adfontesmedia.com/news-guts-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-09,newsandguts,25,"The EPA announced on Wednesday that it is repealing the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, the latest sign that the Biden administration is committed to rolling back Trump-era policies that imperil the environment.The rule reduced the number of streams, marshes and other wetlands that fall under federal protection. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said it “is leading to significant environmental degradation.”With the announcement, the Biden administration is wading into a decades-long battle over how far federal officials can go to stop contaminants from entering small streams and other wetlands.https://t.co/z2s5FGmBKeIn ajoint statementwith the Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA said it will work on a new policy that increases  waterway habitats for wildlife and provides safe drinking water for millions of Americans.“The science says those streams and these wetlands are an important part of our clean-water system in the United States and should be protected,” Tom Kiernan, head of American Rivers, toldThe Washington Post.But the Trump administration yielded to home developers, oil drillers and growers who considered the regulations associated with the Clean Water Act too onerous. Regan said the Trump-era rule limiting the number of protected waterways gave a green light to 333 projects that would have previously required a Clean Water Act dredge-and-fill permit.The Biden EPA is moving to reverse the Trump admin's sweeping rollback of the Clean Water Act, taking on an issue that has plagued farm country Democrats for more than a decade.https://t.co/aTTBmyke6pPoliticoexplains that the regulations surrounding clean water have been a constant source of partisan fighting:The issue of which streams and wetlands are subject to federal regulation has been the source of intense debate virtually since the Clean Water Act was passed, and has been a legal and political quagmire for the past decade and a half after the Supreme Court issued a pair of muddled opinions that created enormous confusion on the ground.Over the past two presidential administrations, the country has ping-ponged back and forth among three different regulatory definitions, sometimes with different rules in effect in different parts of the country.",2
500,5 Essential Questions Teachers Should Ask During Job Interviews,0.0,37.0,https://www.edweek.org/jobs/5-essential-questions-teachers-should-ask-during-job-interviews/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,edweek,25,"Interviewing for a teaching job can be a nerve-wracking experience. As a candidate, you can expect an onslaught of questions on everything including your strengths and weaknesses, classroom management strategies, and educational philosophy.But your job interview should not be a one-way street. Interviewers typically offer job candidates the chance to ask questions of their own.This year, the need to do so is more pressing than ever, as the pandemic begins to recede and everyone wants to know: Will schools return to “normal” in the fall? Will there be a “new normal” and, if so, what will that look like? Interviewing for teaching positions provides you with the perfect opportunity to find out. As you prepare to interview this recruiting season, make sure your list of inquiries for prospective employers includes the following:Will teachers be expected to teach in-person and remote learners simultaneously?As the worst of the pandemic began to recede and schools returned to in-person classes, many families chose to keep their kids at home. That often meant teachers were tasked with “hybrid teaching”—doubling up on their duties by providing instruction to both in-person and remote learners simultaneously.“It is nothing short of exhausting,” Jennifer Atkins, a 7th grade English teacher at Howell Middle School in Victoria, Texas,told Education Week last fall. “It’s basically like teaching two different classes at the same time in one class period.”That seems to be the general consensus from teachers and others familiar with this demanding form of teaching. “We know for sure what doesn’t work: doing both at the same time [teaching both online and in person],” said Jeff Plaman, online and digital learning specialist for the Minnesota education department.But, as late as this spring, some teachers still didn’t know if they would be required to continue hybrid teaching in the 2021-22 academic year.Before the interview ends, make sure you know if hybrid teaching could be in your future.What health and safety protocols has your district permanently adopted to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 and other contagious viruses?After the onset of the H1N1 flu in 2009, hand sanitizer dispensers began cropping up in schools and other public spaces; some of them remained years later. The COVID-19 pandemic, whose devastating impact has dwarfed that of the H1N1 flu, may come with its own set of lasting health and safety protocols.For teachers who come in contact with dozens or even hundreds of people in a given work week, such protocols may be of considerable interest. Whether the pandemic has left you weary of mask-wearing or willingly continuing to don one or even two masks when you leave your house, you’ll want to learn where a prospective employer stands on this and other health and safety policies.What resources has your district implemented or reinforced since the pandemic in support of students’ social and emotional learning needs?Even before the full impact of the pandemic had been realized, awareness of students’ social and emotional needs began to rise. In an exclusive survey by the EdWeek Research Center published in April 2020, 43 percent of respondents—principals, teachers, and district leaders—agreed that social-emotional learning is a “transformational way to improve public education.”A year later, educators continue to express the need to make SEL a priority.“The pandemic has made me realize that unless we find ways to focus on students as people and engage them as people and make the work we’re doing important to them where they are now, everything is for nothing,” said David Finkle, a veteran language arts teacher in Florida’s Volusia County school district.To find out how serious a prospective employer is about responding to the SEL needs of its students, ask specific questions like the following: Could you describe any initiatives and resources the school dedicates to SEL? How is SEL embedded in the curriculum? What types of training related to SEL do your teachers receive?How does your district support the mental health of its teachers?It’s no secret that the pandemic has been hard on teachers; statistics bear this out. In anationwide poll of K-12 employeespublished in February 2021, 63 percent of respondents reported that, during the pandemic, work made them feel stressed. More than half felt high levels of burnout/fatigue, while 47 percent said they experienced anxiety.Given the demanding circumstances surrounding the pandemic, preventing such negative feelings from surfacing may not have been possible. But how employers responded to their employees’ struggles during the pandemic—from simply acknowledging the challenges of teaching during the pandemic to making relevant resources available—can be revealing.To gauge a prospective employer’s commitment to its teachers’ mental health, ask direct questions like: What did you do to support the mental health of your teachers during the pandemic? As a result of the pandemic, what new or expanded services have you added to support your teachers’ mental health?What did you learn about your school community’s culture during the pandemic, and how will you apply that next year?The pandemic challenged school leaders in new and unforeseen ways; for instance, exposing deep equity gaps within and between school communities and shedding light on how rapidly social isolation can lead to student disengagement and academic failure. On the upside, the waning of the pandemic may afford school leaders time to reflect on the past year and a half, perhaps reinforcing or reevaluating their priorities.Find out by asking a prospective employer the following: What were the biggest challenges your school community faced during the pandemic? How did individual members of your school community demonstrate resilience in the face of the pandemic? What do you plan to do differently next year as a result?Listen carefully to the responses, both what is said and how genuine and confident the answers sound. If a prospective employer seems overwhelmed and defeated by what’s taken place over the past 18 months, you may want to cross this school or district off your list.“You don’t want to jump into a position that you don’t feel capable of navigating,” said Jacqueline Rodriguez, the vice president for research, policy, and advocacy at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.After the year-and-a-half that educators have been through, Rodriguez’s advice is more relevant than ever. Asking the right questions and getting clear answers in your upcoming job interviews is, too.",1
501,‘Last responders’ brace for COVID deaths,-3.67,45.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/24/last-responders-brace-for-covid-deaths/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-12,montanafreepress,15,"They watched as New York hospitals and funeral homes marshaled refrigerated trucks to store bodies. More than 600 bodies of people who died in the spring COVID surgeremain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfrontbecause officials can’t find next of kin, or relatives are also sick or unable to pay for burial.People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana’s chief medical examiner, took heed. Last spring, he worked with funeral directors and others to study the state’s morgue capacity. After looking at COVID projections, the state arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigerated semitrucks ready to dispatch anywhere in the state.“We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present a scary proposition,” he said. “We need to be ready for worst-case scenarios.”Chad Towner, CEO of St. Joseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigerated semitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit.“I told a friend who was a COVID doubter that if my wife needed a bed today, I could not arrange one. That’s the dire situation we face here,” Towner said. “All our competitors in the area are in the same boat, and we’re working together instead of competing.”“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people. Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that the sharp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary.“We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,” said Towner. “A priest approached me to say he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.”Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is a slower process than usual, he said. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that are sick or quarantined at the time of the loved one’s death often can’t work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entire system is stressed to the tipping point,” said Towner.Private enterprise has created a solution for smaller communities. In Bozeman, Montana, a specialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup.Acela Truck Co. has already sold hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We’re very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48 states,” said CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsy supply company, to help sell and deliver the new product.Billings Clinic in Montana also anticipated a flood of deaths last spring by reserving a semitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morgue spaces, has dealt with 80 COVID deaths, including seven on the weekend after Thanksgiving.Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smith said the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting office space and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds, so far has handled the additional deaths through what she calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannot store.The hospital does its best to allow relatives to say goodbye, but that often involves family members standing at an interior window outside the patient’s room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words.That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID.Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs.“We are using mostly recordings, sometimes a soloist,” said Spitzer.Funeral home directors who pride themselves on spending time comforting grieving families say they are so busy that some days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one.“Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing the support of having friends and family around them,” said Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota.Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the most seriously disrupted.“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,” said Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”COVID has even affected body disposal. Asurveyby the National Funeral Directors Association found that more than half of their members reported increased cremation rates due to COVID. The NFDA also found that half its members have clients who have postponed services to hold a memorial later.In the largely impoverished Hidalgo County, a Texas border area, county officials began using COVID funds to help cover the burial costs for struggling families. Then they begin hearing of the emotional costs, including the anguish of videoconferenced funerals, such as for a family that had lost a husband, a mother and an aunt in one month. They wondered if there would be interest in an alternative way to honor the dead.“We sent out a social media post asking if anyone wanted to post a photograph of a relative who died of COVID if we created a county memorial page,” said county spokesperson Carlos Sanchez, who himself barely survived a bout with COVID in July. “Within minutes, we got more than 20 emails. Several sent photos of multiple relatives. They want them to be remembered.”(Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

The ACLU decided to make its argument against the question in the form of an “elevator pitch,” or a discussion no longer than the time it takes to ride an elevator.We watched the video, but now we really want that question on there. They say correctly that the census is used to decide how many representatives a state gets, and then estimate that 6.5 million people won’t fill out the census if the citizenship question is on there — more people than the population of Tennessee. We’re not that hot on an imaginary 16th largest state being represented in Congress.Is it bad that we don’t think non-citizens should count toward the number of representatives a state gets? California certainly wants those representatives, not to mention federal funds for social services.We're headed to the Supreme Court next week to protect the 2020 census.Here's everything that's wrong with the citizenship question — in the time it takes for@ikebarinholtzto ride an elevator:pic.twitter.com/GPfzpesEqP— ACLU (@ACLU)April 17, 2019Cute video.

505,Trump considered high risk for coronavirus because of age and weight say experts,-6.67,37.0,https://www.independent.co.uk/us-election-2020/trump-coronavirus-covid-melania-test-positive-risk-weight-age-how-latest-b744603.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,independent.co.uk,25,"President’s doctor says he will quarantine at White HouseFind your bookmarks in yourIndependent Premiumsection, under my profileDonald Trumpis considered high risk to the dangers of the coronavirus because of his age and because he is judged to be overweight.Experts have long warned the virus, which causesCovid-19, is a particular threat to those aged in the 70s or older, those with some pre-existing health conditions, and people who do not exercise.“This evening I received confirmation that both President Trump andFirst LadyMelania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” White House doctor Sean Conley said in a statement.“The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.”He added: “The White House medical team and I will maintain a vigilant watch, and I appreciate the support provided by some of our country's greatest medical professionals and institutions.”Yet experts warned that given he is aged 74 and because he is considered overweight, Mr Trump will be in the high risk category for those who contract the disease. There was no immediate word from Joe Biden, who debated with Mr Trump on Tuesday night in a noisy, unappealing event during which the president repeatetedly talked over the former vice president.He even mocked him for wearing masks “I don't wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask,” he said. “He could be speaking 200 feet away from it, he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.” Mr Trump’s positive test result came after news that Hope Hicks, a top adviser and trusted aide, had tested positive for the new coronavirus earlier on Thursday.The president. who is tested regularly for the virus, has held rallies with thousands of people in recent weeks in the run-up to the November 3 election, despite warnings from public health professionals against having events with large crowds.  The president largely eschews wearing masks and has criticised others who do.

507,Salvaging the Nuclear Deal Before It Is Too Late,-1.33,42.0,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/state-of-the-union/salvaging-the-nuclear-deal-before-it-is-too-late/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,theamericanconservative,25,"One of the early priorities of the new Biden administration has to be rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and they can expect to encounter stiff resistance from the Iran hawks that have been working overtime to destroy the agreement for the last five and a half years. Hard-liners have already fired off two salvos with anarticleinand anop-edinThe Wall Street Journalthis week. The first is supposed to be a “case against the nuclear deal,” but it might as well be titled “the case against diplomacy with Iran.” Michael Oren and Yossi Klein Halevi misrepresent what the JCPOA does, exaggerate the benefits that Iran is supposed to get (but has never actually received), and cling to an absurd maximalist demand of “zero enrichment” that Iran would never accept. It is very much the same tedious and disingenuous argument that we have heard before, and we can expect to hear it repeated many more times in the coming months.Robert Kaplan’s piece is supposed to be an argument about countering China, but he starts it off by claiming that rejoining the JCPOA will “undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia” while “ignoring” the growth of Chinese influence. It never seems to occur to Kaplan that his call for countering Chinese influence is in direct opposition to his criticism of reentering the nuclear deal. If the U.S. wanted to limit Chinese influence in the Middle East, giving Iran the promised sanctions relief as part of the JCPOA would be the obvious move. Thanks to “maximum pressure” cutting Iran off from Europe and many other markets, the ties between Iran and China have been increasing. Ending the economic war on Iran would allow Iran to rely less on China and it would reestablish trade ties that the Trump administration’s sanctions had severed.Preserving the JCPOA is consistent with trying to curb Chinese influence, but Kaplan can’t or won’t admit that because he is really just using fear of Chinese influence to support continued hawkish policies in the Middle East. This is why he begins by fretting over the possible “undermining” of “key allies” that are neither allies nor key. That is why he never tries to explain how rejoining a successful nonproliferation agreement would undermine countries that actually benefit from it. It is knee-jerk hawkishness against Iran masquerading as strategy.The first thing to understand about hawkish objections to the nuclear deal is that they really have nothing to do with the specific terms and requirements of the deal. These objections have never been about the nuclear issue itself. Iran hawks are alarmed bydiplomatic engagement with Iran that reduces Tehran’s international isolation. Their technical objections to provisions in the agreement are usuallywrong or misleading, but they are also being made in bad faith. They harp on the nuclear issue when they can use that as a pretext for sanctions and conflict, and then when that issue is resolved they harp on others at the expense of undermining the nuclear deal that successfully addressed the earlier issue.Before the deal was negotiated, Iran hawks insisted that it was pointless because the Iranian government would cheat. When Iran consistently complied with the agreement even after the U.S. reneged on its commitments, they switched to arguing that Iranian compliance was proof that the deal was too favorable to them. When confronted with evidence that the nuclear deal had succeeded on its own terms, they tried to move the goalposts by whining about all the things that it didn’t and couldn’t possibly address. No agreement that would satisfy their extreme demands would ever be acceptable to Iran, and no agreement that might be negotiated would ever be good enough for them. Having failed to destroy the nuclear deal during the Trump presidency, Iran hawks are now desperately fighting a rear-guard action to delay U.S. reentry long enough so that hard-liners in Iran finally kill the agreement for them.Thearticle refers to recent Iranian actions to increase enrichment to 20% as proof that Iran is engaging in “nuclear blackmail.” The authors misrepresent this as an attempt to “intimidate” Biden, when it is really the result of the failed “maximum pressure” campaign that the authors support. In fact, the reason that Iran has been steadily reducing compliance with the agreement since 2019 is the failure of the other parties to honor their end of the bargain and the constant provocations from the U.S. and Israel during this period. As any minimally informed observer knows, the most recent Iranian moves were a direct response to the Israeli government’smurder of Mohsen Fakhrizadehlate last year. Iran hawks cheered the murder, and now they seek to use the inevitable Iranian response as the latest pretext for scrapping the nuclear deal. It takes some gall to use the consequences of a terrorist attack that you supported as an excuse for sabotaging diplomacy with the victim of the attack.Iran hawks make a lot of noise about provisions in the JCPOA that gradually expire, but these provisions are a necessary part of any negotiated agreement. No government is willing to accept onerous restrictions in perpetuity, and there is no reason to require that such restrictions remain in place forever as long as the purpose of the agreement is still being served. These so-called “sunset clauses” are probably among the least understood and most often misrepresented parts of the agreement. To the extent that some restrictions end, that will be because Iran will have proven over the course of years and decades that it intends to keep its nuclear program peaceful. Some restrictions loosen as it becomes clear that they are no longer needed. The hawks also conveniently fail to mention the many provisions that never expire that will make it practically impossible for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon later on. Ali Vaezdiscussedthese several years ago:Assuming the other parties to the deal reciprocate by holding up their end of the bargain, Iran will ratify in 2023 the IAEA’s Additional Protocol, which allows short-notice inspections of undeclared facilities in Iran and which it is now voluntarily implementing. To date, no country on earth has developed nuclear weapons under the watchful eyes of the IAEA’s inspectors who are empowered by the access that the Additional Protocol affords them.The Biden administration has a chance to salvage the agreement in the next few months. If they do that and the U.S. rejoins the JCPOA and lifts both old and new sanctions, then we can expect that Iran will be ratifying the Additional Protocol in just a couple years. That will effectively eliminate the path to an Iranian nuclear weapon, and that will deprive Iran hawks of their main pretext for sanctions and conflict from then on. The next two years will be a critical time for repairing and reviving the agreement so that its gains are locked in and secured, and the Biden administration will need to get started on that repair work at once. The first thing that Biden will have to do in starting that repair work is tune out the lies and bad faith arguments of Iran hawks.",1

The compromise bill marks the beginning of the end of a fraught legislative process that began in April, when theHouse passed the initial version of the bill. The bill initially faced stiff challenges in the state Senate, where a series of proposed amendments prompted the House toreject earlier iterations of the legislation. Sunday's vote, however, marks a breakthrough in that stalemate, with the Senate's widely expected approval the last remaining obstacle between the bill and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's signature. Abbott has previouslystatedhe will, indeed, sign the legislation into law.""By working together, the House and Senate will send Gov. Abbott the strongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history, and protect the right of law-abiding Texans to carry a handgun as they exercise their God-given right to self-defense and the defense of their families,"" Republican state Rep. Matt Schaefer, who authored the legislation,said in a statement announcing the compromise bill.According to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the Texas Senate will vote — and almost certainly pass — the bill early this week.""H.B. 1927 is a historic bill and a national model,"" Patrick said in astatement. ""It includes the thinking of national gun rights advocates and many in Texas law enforcement and affirms our commitment to protect the rights of gun owners and the safety of those in law enforcement.""According to the, the compromises agreed upon in the legislation include provisions allowing police to question people based on their carrying a handgun, tougher penalties for felons who are caught carrying a handgun, and an optional free online gun safety course to be offered by the Texas Department of Public Safety.Texas alreadyhasaconspicuously lax suite of gun lawsto begin with, so much so that its gun culture has taken on a life of its own as aunique feature of the Lone Star State. Accordingly, the state has seen multiple mass shootings in the past several years — a fact not lost on Democratic lawmakers, who spoke out against the permit-less cary legislation on Sunday.""This is our first session since those tragedies [inOdessaandEl Paso], and this is our response, a bill to allow permit-less carry,"" state Rep. Chris Turnersaid during debate on the legislation. ""A bill to say you don’t have to have any training to carry a handgun in the state of Texas. And I can't imagine a worse slap in the face to all those people who have advocated, to the victims and to the family of those victims.""Abbott, however, has come out strongly for the bill,saying late last monththat ""I support it, and I believe it should reach my desk, and we should have 'constitutional carry' in Texas.""",1

The P.D.'s initial statement seemed to justify the incident, and it appears it was released before the video surfaced.The Mayor of Minneapolis has expressed outrage, saying, ""When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense.""Of course, the cop responsible for the knee to the neck had a partner during the arrest, and Crump believes that officer's actions make him complicit in the killing. As Crump says ... this cop also ignored Floyd's cries and protests from people watching, and didn't do a thing to help.Minneapolis PD Chiefseems to have reached a similar conclusion -- on Tuesday afternoon he announced the firing of 4 officers involved in the incident. The officers names have not been released yet.Crump feels it's long overdue for police officers tofor their actions -- or inaction -- like this ... no more benefit of the doubt or obligatory moral high ground given. Listen to how Ben explains it, though ... he makes a very good point.Finally, this case is being compared to the death ofin 2014 because of the obvious similarities, and Crump says he's going to try to get Eric's family in touch with Floyd's ... a request made by Eric's mother.Along with representing Floyd's family, Crump is the lawyer for's family and he's a renownedcivil rights attorney, who alsoworked withTrayvon Martin's family in the past.",1

Ron DeSantis expressed increasing impatience with not only coronavirus business restrictions but also social distancing at a notably maskless indoor discussion with bar owners andcraft beer makersin St. Petersburg on Thursday.The lack of masks and 6-foot distancing at the meeting, held indoors at the Green Bench Brewing Company, drew fire from St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman.Desantis, Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears, and the other participants sat just a few feet from each other at a V-shaped table.“Here’s an example of what not to do, especially in Pinellas County and St. Petersburg, where our mask mandate & policies have led the way in the fight against COVID,” Kriseman wrote next to a photo of the event. “Indoors, no masks, no distancing. We believe in science here, governor. We also believe in leading by example.”DeSantis did not say when he would allow drinking at bars, which has been suspended by Beshears since June because of multiple cases of crowding.“We really want to get to ‘yes,’ so we’re working hard on it,” DeSantis told owners.DeSantis also said it would ultimately be his decision to reopen bars, not Beshears.’ DeSantis has repeatedly described the June decision to close bars as one made by Beshears and not himself.“He was getting inundated with stuff,” DeSantis said of Beshears’ attempts at regulating bar capacity after the initial reopening in early June. “And there was just no way to be able to play whack-a-mole. … But I’ve told him, I want every business in Florida operating. And we pretty much have 99%. You guys are kind of the last step.”The lack of masks and social distancing fit the tone of the discussion Thursday, during which DeSantis and bar owners repeatedly expressed frustration over coronavirus rules and questioned some of the limited capacity restrictions in place since the spring.“Somehow it slipped [from] ‘slow the spread, protect hospitals’ to ‘we could never have another case again,'” DeSantis said. “So it really turned into something that was not how it was sold originally to the country.”The governor continued, “I just worry that when we talk about things like social distancing, all this stuff, how long of a period of time is that natural for people to do?”When a bar owner said people concerned about the virus should just improve their own health and lifestyles, adding they should get more Vitamin D, DeSantis responded that was something to consider.“There’s a new vitamin D study I haven’t had [the chance] to look through, but it purports to show a decline in ICU hospitalizations in people who have had significant vitamin D,” he said. “So so we’ll have to see.”slemongello@orlandosentinel.com",2

517,Metro Council approves Oracle deal on East Nashville riverfront in final hurdle for $1.2B development,0.0,47.33,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2021/05/04/oracle-nashville-deal-approved-metro-council-east-bank-cumberland-river/4924010001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tennessean-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,tennessean,20,"Metro Council members voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve the development plan of tech giant Oracle Corp. in East Nashville, clearing the last hurdle for a historic $1.2 billion investment on Music City's industrial riverfront.Metro Council's approval Tuesday night means Oracle can now begin its work on a more detailed design of its 65-acre riverbank campus,according to company spokesperson Jim Murphy. Construction could begin as early as June.The development, hailed by some supporters as ""transformational"" and ""once in a lifetime,"" marks the biggest economic development deal ever made in Tennessee. The proposed investment will transform the cityscape along the East Bank of the Cumberland River into the city's largest business hub.""This is the largest private investment and the largest job creation deal in our history – all with no expense in our budget and no new debt,"" Mayor John Cooper said in a statement moments after the council vote.The deal could bring a record number of jobs to Nashville. The company hopes to create 8,500 new jobs in Nashville by the end of 2031, with an average annual wage of $110,000. The project is also expected to bring almost 11,500 ancillary jobs and 10,000 temporary positions during construction.By approving the deal, Metro government also has signaled its intent to use half of the annual property tax revenue generated from the site to pay for affordable housing, in addition to any funding already allocated for that purpose in the budget. The actual dedication of the funds, however, will still be at the council's discretion.Thelanguage, proposed by At-Large Council member Zulfat Suara, was added to the development plan during a Monday budget and finance committee meeting and was approved by the council Tuesday.As part of the deal, Oracle will receive a 25-year, 50% property tax discount in exchange for its up-front $175 million investment in public infrastructure near Germantown. That includes streets, parks, greenways, a pedestrian bridge from the Oracle campus to Germantown and an expanded sewer system.While the deal received an overwhelming support from the council Tuesday night, many council members and local activists have voiced concerns about Oracle's proposed job creation, commitment to diversity, as well as its actions to address affordable housing with a booming workforce.Community advocacy group Stand Up Nashvilleposed 20 questions about the Oracle dealand received responses Monday. The group challenged the way Metro government does business with the tech company and demanded actions from Oracle to address the affordable housing crisis and hire minority workers.""Overwhelmingly, we hear from our communities that housing and economic inequality are the priority,"" Stand Up Nashville co-founder Odessa Kelly said in a Tuesday statement. ""What the answers to our questions tell us is that while it is good that Oracle wants to be in Nashville, and this deal is better than deals of the past, it was not a community driven process and we can still improve the way our city operates.""Both local and state leaders have welcomed the development.""Oracle’s $1.2 billion investment will create thousands of quality jobs and help our kids succeed in the digital economy,"" Cooper said Tuesday. ""After a challenging year, this helps kick off Nashville’s next decade of prosperity.""Council member Mary Carolyn Roberts said Tuesday the deal could attract other tech giants to land in Nashville as well.""We are in a position to have a deal changer in Nashville,"" she said.Tennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe also urged council members to approve the deal during a Monday committee meeting.""This is transformational, once in a lifetime,"" Rolfe said.Howard Schiller and Don Allen of Monroe Investment Partners applauded the vote in a statement Tuesday night. The company created River North, the 100-plus-acre mixed-use development district where the campus would be located.“My partner has been investing in the east bank of Nashville for 20+ years and I am truly excited to see his vision of River North become a reality,” Schiller said in a text message.Monroe will continue to own a significant amount of property at River North after the transaction with Oracle closes.“This is an exciting day for the State of TN and the City of Nashville,"" Allen said in a text. “We look forward to working cooperatively with Oracle and the City and State as River North continues its transformation into a vibrant mixed use environment.""But at the Monday meeting, many council members feared the historic-scale development may be too large for Nashville to swallow.The development and the workforce it may bring, they said, could drive up the cost of living in Nashville and force out low-income families.""You see a house on the market. Before you click on it, it's gone,"" Suara said Monday. ""You have students that cannot afford to pay for housing in the neighborhood that they grew up in. You have people being gentrified out of their homes.""In response to Stand Up Nashville's questions on affordable housing, the company pointed to Suara's amendment and Cooper's proposed budget, which wouldallocate $30 million in local and federal funds to affordable housing initiatives.Doug Kehring, executive vice president of corporate operations for Oracle, said Monday the company does not intend to exacerbate Nashville's affordable housing problem.""How we support housing may come through ownership, may come through donations, may come through other support mechanisms, but we are very focused on making sure there's enough (affordable) housing for employees,"" he said. ""We don't want to come to Nashville to create a bigger problem. We want to come to Nashville to create a great solution.""It is alsounclear how many of the proposed 8,500 jobs are high-paying positionsand what the lowest hourly wage would be for most employees. Council member Emily Benedict posed the question Monday, but received no direct answer from Oracle representatives.""I haven't been able to find out in the past two weeks, the multiple times that I've asked, what is the lowest wage that you pay your full-time and part-time employees?"" she asked.Jennifer Birk of Oracle said Monday the company would like to make local hires ""as much as we can."" But under Tennessee law, Metro government has no power to establish local hire mandates or require the level of workforce diversity, the company said in its Monday response to Stand Up NashvilleMultiple council members also demanded concrete actions from Oracle advocating for the LGBTQ communities. The company is considering moving to Tennessee as the state legislature passes several bills targeting LGBTQ youths. Gov. Bill Lee, a conservative Republican,became the third governor this year to sign into lawa measure barring transgender students from playing sports under their gender identity.Oracle last monthjoined 94 businesses in signing a letter by the Human Rights Campaignopposing anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country. But the company has not threatened to pull out of the state because of the legislation.At-Large Council member Bob Mendes asked Oracle on Monday what concrete actions the company would take apart from signing the letter. He previously defended the letter-signing on social media as an important move""even if a fight can't be won today.""""We get real criticism from well-meaning people that we are just engaging in nonsense theater and it doesn't actually mean anything,"" he told Oracle representatives. ""How do you match (what you said)? Are we just being hypocrites?""Kehring responded by arguing the company has a track record of diverse culture and values.""You have the opportunity to attract companies that can help your effort, or you can push those companies away in your attempt to deal with the concern you just raised,"" he said. ""We are gonna bring our culture and values.""Council member Jonathan Hall urged the council Tuesday to invest in education and workforce training to supply quality candidates to the job market Oracle would create. Council member Colby Sledge cautioned his colleagues Tuesday night to continue to address the community concerns around the Oracle deal.""We will have invited the horse in,"" he said. ""For it to be useful to the people of Nashville, it will take all of us working together to tame that horse. If we do not, it will trample our people.""",2
518,All Church Buildings Have a Story to Tell—Not Just the Tourist Magnets,0.33,41.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/june-web-only/history-church-buildings-architecture-allan-doig.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,christianitytoday,25,"The church is not a building, but it certainly has buildings.My own church has a stone structure by a creek in Johnson City, Tennessee. We know that the first Christians here baptized believers in that water and worshiped together on the banks, nearly 200 years ago, before building the fellowship hall and sanctuary with stone and stained glass.Around town, I see churches that meet in storefronts, in renovated factories, and one above an upscale barbecue joint. There are big, towering church buildings on the main streets downtown and, further out, churches with wide, rolling, golf-course-worthy lawns. There’s a clapboard church tucked into a hill where they painted over the word, and now, in slightly unsteady freehand, the sign saysHoliness. There ’s a church with a gazebo pulpit in an expansive parking lot, built for drive-in worship; another with space designated for a taco truck; another where the windows have been covered up; and another that looks like a giant Hershey’s kiss. At each of these places, Christians sing and socialize, pray and think about their lives—what they love and what they should love—and they listen to the Word of the Lord.None of these places, unfortunately, appear in Allan Doig’sA History of the Church through Its Buildings. The “church” of the title turns out to be incredibly narrow, the “history” even narrower.Charlemagne is crowned emperor six times in these pages, while Martin Luther shows up only once, critiquing the funding mechanism for the construction of St. Peter’s in Rome. There are no Puritans in the book, despite their intense opinions about church buildings. No Pentecostals, despite their radical reimagining of sacred space. There is only one mention of Baptists, and that is a passing reference in an extended quotation.Nor does Doig’s scope extend to Africa, Latin America, North America, or Asia (with the exception of a brief mention of Jesuit missionaries to Japan). The book discusses 12 buildings: three in Rome, six elsewhere in Europe, two in Istanbul, and one in Jerusalem. These are all churches one might see on a humanities tour with a liberal arts college—tourist attractions and World Heritage sites.In fact,A History of the Church through Its Buildingswould be perfect for that kind of trip. Doig, a recently retired chaplain for a college at Oxford University, frequently describes the best way to approach these historic buildings. In Aachen, Germany, for example, he recommends “coming round the eastern end of the Rathaus … from the market square past the” a tower, for the best view of the Basilica of the Holy Mother of God. In Istanbul, Doig suggests taking the tram to the Hagia Sophia, since it “closely follows the ceremonial route of the emperor, from the former site of the Hebdomon military grounds near the airport, via the Golden Gate, past theforaand on to themilion, the marker from which all distances in the Byzantine empire were measured.”The book also focuses its explanations on why each building exists, enlisting history as necessary to explicate a structure’s particular size, shape, and composition. Rather than using the churches to illuminate the history of the church, it’s the reverse.For example, Doig doesn’t show how the Basilica of St. Vincent, in Cordoba, Spain, sheds light on Arianism, the Christological heresy that dominated in Spain at the time of its construction. Instead, he offers Arianism as the explanation for the location of the cathedral, as a sixth-century king of Hispania moved the bishop’s seat in an attempt to unite and reform Arian Christianity.After Arianism was condemned at the Council of Toledo in 589, the Roman Catholic Pope Gregory attempted to secure the orthodoxy of the church with a series of gifts, including purported relics of Christ’s cross, Peter’s chains, and John the Baptist’s hair. But since the structure was built before the Roman influence was well established, the Cordoba church has “a four-bay nave with side-aisles, transepts, and chapels to either side of the sanctuary.”As the narrative moves on, it becomes clear that for the author, “Why does this church have a four-bay nave with side-aisles, transepts, and chapels to either side of the sanctuary?” was the most interesting question to be asked.The book’s deepest insight into church history is that the structures always reveal something about a church’s relationship to power. While churches are set apart as houses of God and places of prayer, they are never entirely apart. Each structure has a place in a legal regime, an economic order, and a political system.Sometimes, in fact, the church is the symbolic foundation of state power. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, in Paris, for example, was rebuilt by King Pepin the Short and finished by his son Charlemagne to sanctify their replacement of the Merovingian royal line. Father and son were both buried in Saint-Denis, as were all but three of the subsequent kings of France and many other monarchs. The church—set apart—served a crucial function in the construction of the idea of the French state.“As a space for the performance of the rituals of kingship,” Doig observes, “no other could compete with Saint-Denis.”My church’s building in East Tennessee certainly doesn’t compete with Saint-Denis on this count, though it too reveals a relationship with power. The property lines have put limits on our expansion over the years. On Sundays, worshipers have to park in a neighbor’s lot, requiring us to take care to maintain that relationship. Last year, we used COVID-19 relief funds to pay the utilities for the building we mostly didn’t use during the pandemic.As I readA History of the Church through Its Buildings, though, my mind turned to the relationships that Doig does not explore. A church building arranges a congregation’s relationship to baptism, Communion, and preaching. It is in the design phase that a church decides whether the pulpit will be in the center or off to the side, whether or not there will be a fixed structure for serving the Lord’s Supper, and how new Christians will be buried with Christ and raised with him.The building also structures the relationship between the church and its music. Sometimes worship leaders are literally spotlighted, but I’ve also prayed in a church, converted from a house, where the music came from another room. It felt like eavesdropping on the morning’s hymns.The building can physically represent church hierarchy—saving a seat for a bishop, offering an exclusive entrance for the senior pastor, or setting up a greenroom for a guest speaker.A church also organizes a congregation’s relationship to itself. In Doig’s own Church of England, there’s a huge difference between buildings with fixed pews and buildings with movable chairs. Some congregations sit in a circle while they worship. Here in Tennessee, it’s not uncommon to bury the deceased behind the church building, until the Resurrection. The building may be passed down to us through the generations—along with the faith itself—so that as we worship on a Sunday, we also realize we are taking care of something that we ourselves did not build and that we will one day leave to others.The church, in the end, is not a building. But it does have them. And the history of the church happens, in part, through buildings. That history shouldn’t be limited to buildings that attract tourists and World Heritage designations. If we learn to look carefully at even the humblest churches, we can see a record of relationships and traces of the faithful witness of believers before us who used these buildings to sing and pray, live their faith, and receive and proclaim God’s good news.Daniel Silliman is news editor forChristianity Today.

520,"After a plea to combat antisemitism, the White House convened a meeting with Jewish leaders",-2.33,45.33,https://forward.com/fast-forward/470282/combat-antisemitism-biden-white-house-convened-meeting-jewish-leaders/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,forward,25,"Image by Getty ImagesWASHINGTON (JTA) — The letterwent outat midday Friday, from five major Jewish organizations, asking President Joe Biden to “use your bully pulpit to call out antisemitism” in the wake of a spike in attacks on Jews since the launch of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict.By 8 a.m. Monday, Biden was at his Twitter bully pulpit, saying “the recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they must stop.”At 4 p.m. the same day, representatives of all five organizations were on a video conference call with top staffers at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.The participants were knocked back by the immediacy of the response.“You know, the next business day after the letter was sent, they brought a good group of key officials together who are really substantive,” said Elana Broitman, the director of the Jewish Federations of North America’s Washington office, who attended the meeting.The White House would not comment and the three Jewish officials who returned the Jewish Telegraphic Agency’s calls did not feel comfortable describing what the White House officials said, or naming on the record who was present. The White House did not return a request for comment.The groups that sent the letter and which were represented at the meeting in addition to the JFNA are the Orthodox Union, the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League and Hadassah.The participants said that each of the five requests they made was addressed during the meeting. These included nominating an antisemitism monitor at the State Department, naming a Jewish liaison, convening a summit on antisemitism, adding funds to secure nonprofits and keeping in place an executive order by President Donald Trump that combats antisemitism on campuses.The last request, having to do with Trump’s executive order, could stir controversy. Some liberal groups, including a number of Jewish ones,have expressed concernthat it targets legitimate Israel criticism, and Biden has shown a tendency to purge Trump’s more controversial executive orders.“We went through the specifics that we did raise in our letter, and they were certainly open to all of those things and indicated that they were all good suggestions and they’re working on the things that we raised,” said Nathan Diament, the Washington director for the Orthodox Union.“We should not take for granted the importance of the president recognizing that America has a problem with antisemitic violence and President Biden recognizes that action is required to protect Jewish communities and rollback the rise in hate against religious and ethnic minorities, over the short and long term,” said Karen Paikin Barall, the Washington director for Hadassah.The groups are convening a virtual rally on Thursday to combat antisemitism, which they say will include top lawmakers from both parties in Congress and from the Biden administration.Broitman said the meeting was likely the first of many.“I was left with the impression that more meetings and more steps to come,” she said.Our founder, Ab Cahan1960s Yiddish hipi hoodieIt's spelled Khanike teeThe Forverts est. 1897 hoodie",2
521,“We’re Not Allowed to Hang Up”: The Harsh Reality of Working in Customer Service,-7.67,44.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/not-allowed-to-hang-up-the-harsh-reality-of-working-in-customer-service,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,propublica,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receiveour biggest storiesas soon as they’re published.Last year ProPublicawroteabout the world of work-at-home customer service, spotlighting a largely unseen industry that helps brand-name companies shed labor costs by outsourcing the task of mollifying unhappy customers.As we reported on the industry,we invitedcurrent and former customer service representatives to contact us. They did. We heard from more than 100 and interviewed dozens. Often, their stories disturbed us. One woman, afraid to take a bathroom break, kept a jar under her desk in case she needed to urinate. Another, afraid to call in sick, paused calls to vomit. A third, afraid to hang up on a customer, didn’t know what to do when she realized a caller was masturbating to the sound of her voice.These accounts captured how agents are simultaneously ubiquitous and invisible. Customers talk to them all the time but know little about their work conditions.So we’re providing accounts from seven agents, many of whom describe the experience of being caught between abusive callers and corporate directives to appease. These seven are highly representative of the 100-plus agents we heard from, as well as the agents we interviewed in our first article. The agents, including some who told us they love their setups, laid out common themes, describing problems that people at various levels of the industry, including managers, have told us are endemic. We’ve also found echoes of these complaints in lawsuits and arbitration claims. Abusive callers are such a concern that, a few years ago in Canada, a union for telecommunications workers launched a campaign called “Hang Up on Abuse.” Airbnb, recognizing the emotional strain of taking such calls, offered their in-house customer service agents free therapy sessions.The reps we spoke to needed these jobs, which allowed them to work from home even before the pandemic. They included people with disabilities, caretaking obligations or limited opportunities in rural towns. Recruitment ads touted flexibility and the chance to be your own boss. But many agents discovered the roles came with limited hours, close monitoring and strict performance measurements that put them in constant fear of losing their jobs. A Department of Labor investigatorconcludedthat one contractor, Arise Virtual Solutions, exerted an “extraordinary degree of control” over agents.Most customer service agents are women. Many describe being sexually harassed. One said a caller told her, “I really like the way you type.” Their work belongs to a grim history of women in outsourced roles stretching back to the piecework manufacturing era. A half century ago, temp work exploded, driven by companies hiring women to cut costs compared with full-time employees. These magazine ads from 1970 and 1971 show how women temps were viewed at the time, and the attitudes have certain parallels to how customer service agents are viewed today. While many agents work full time, a growing segment are independent contractors who don’t get paid holidays, vacation time or fringe benefits.In the accounts below, most of the agents asked not to be identified, citing nondisclosure agreements that are common in the industry. (To work for some companies, agents must sign NDAs before they can even accept the job.) We’ve condensed for clarity and verified details wherever possible, collecting Facebook screenshots, email exchanges, company performance review forms, tax records and other proof of employment, along with contemporaneous recollections from agents’ relatives or friends. But there were instances in which we couldn’t get such documentation, owing in part to the premium placed on privacy and security by the companies. Some agents said they weren’t even allowed to have their personal phone in their workroom while helping customers. Some lost access to their email and the company platform when they quit or were fired, and they hadn’t made copies or screenshots beforehand. In every case we invited the companies that these agents worked with to comment.Christine Stewart has social anxiety and depression. “I have a really hard time being out in public,” she said. She wanted to work from home, so she became an independent contractor for Sykes from 2017 to 2018. The company bills itself as “a leading provider of multichannel demand generation and customer engagement services for Global 2000 companies.” At Sykes, she helped customers using Intuit’s TurboTax.“I was actually sick one day, I called, they have a supervisor line, and told them I was going to be [out] sick. And without actually saying it, the lady said, you’re going to be in trouble if you don’t show up. And me, I don’t like to get in trouble at work, I’m a good employee. I went to work. I kept hitting my mute button every time I had to throw up.”During training, she said, “they told me if you wanted to work nights, you could work nights. If you want to work days, you can work days. Once you finish the training they’re like, ‘This is your schedule.’ I said I can’t work that and they were like, ‘Well, this is the schedule, and if you can't work the schedule, you don’t want the job.’ I was like, ‘I need the job, I do want the job.’ I said, ‘I can do 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.’ They wanted me to do 12 to 12. I have to get my kids on the bus in the morning, I was like, ‘I need to take a five-minute break when the bus pulls up.’ Even that was a huge problem for them. They would say, ‘You can’t keep taking these five-minute breaks.’”Customers berated her. “One person called me the C-word. I’d call my supervisor. They’d say, ‘Calm them down.’ … They’d always try to push me to stay on the call and calm the customer down myself. I wasn’t getting paid enough to do that. When you have a customer sitting there and saying you’re worthless … you’re supposed to ‘de-escalate.’”“There can be no background noise, no nature noises or cars passing by. I had a den. I had to insulate my den,” she said. (To confirm the expense, she shared a tax form with ProPublica that showed a $100 deduction.) “I had to turn the AC off; you could hear the AC blowing. They called me out on that. When I was training, the lady said she could hear the air conditioner in the background.”One time, she said, “my kid broke his hand.” She dropped her call, dropped everything, to help him, but then she needed a story, because, she said, had she told her supervisors the truth — that her kid broke his hand and needed her help — “I would’ve gotten in trouble even if I had a hospital note.”“I said my internet went down. I pulled the plug on everything, because it was their equipment. ... I didn’t know if they had any kind of monitoring software that wasn’t on the webcam or anything. It was better not to take any chances and unplug the whole thing.”full statement.)She needed money for a medical procedure, so, during the pandemic, she began working for Liveops as an independent contractor, helping customers for Bath & Body Works. She worked from home.For online orders, Bath & Body Works allows shoppers to use just one promotion per order. A customer, for example, can use a code to knock down the price of a particular item, but they can’t combine multiple codes. Customers can get upset when this is explained to them.“We encounter customers who ordered the wrong items and want us to send them the right items for free. We receive calls from customers who have had their packages stolen. And then we get customers all the time who find out we don’t sell a particular fragrance anymore, and they can be just incredibly abusive.”“I may as well say it out loud. We get called bitches all the time. One woman called me a ‘stupid fucking cunt.’”“It can wear on you. We’re not allowed to answer back in the same way, nor are we allowed to hang up on them. Nor can we hang up on them after giving them one warning. The policy I am told is, we’re not allowed to hang up on any customer under any circumstances, even if they question our race or ethnic background or anything like that. My understanding is that we’re not even allowed to give people a warning.”“We have to sit there basically and listen to these people until they run out of steam. It’s like they don’t see us as a person.”With the pandemic, she said, a lot of agents are young women who lost their jobs and are desperate for anything. A lot of her fellow agents are Black women. “I’ve heard them say they were called ‘stupid n-----,’ ‘you stupid Black bitch.’”Read MoreWhile some customer service reps are pressed to work more hours than they want, she got too few. Last fall, she signed up to work for four and a half hours during one day. She was paid 31 cents per minute of talking time. So when she wasn’t getting calls, she wasn’t getting paid. For those four and a half hours, she said, she sat there with her headset plugged in.“No calls in those four and a half hours. Nothing. … I got some personal budget stuff done. Surfed websites unrelated to work. Familiarized myself with products on the website. I hate to say it, but I think I dozed off at one point.”Were there other days in which you got no calls? we asked.“Oh, yes.”“How many?”“I lost track.”Liveops has quality auditors who listen to at least four of an agent’s calls per month, she said. They score agents using an audit form, which she shared with ProPublica. It says agents should make a “connected recommendation for each opportunity throughout the interaction” based on the customer’s orders. Say a customer buys soap. The agent should ask, “Did you want a soap holder, too?” If a customer buys candles, the agent should also pitch candleholders.“A customer calls to say, ‘Hey, I didn’t get my package.’ So I’m supposed to say, ‘Hey, do you want to buy some more products when you still don’t have your package?’ Oh, for crying out loud. Really.”The audit form has 20 questions. They include: “9. Did the agent compliment the customer’s selections, reassure about the fragrance choices and/or give general positive reinforcement about the items? … 18. Did the agent apologize when necessary, show empathy and/or recognizes customer emotion? 19. Did the agent let the customer know that we have ‘heard’ them, that we genuinely care, and did the agent remain engaged throughout the entire interaction?”A Liveops document said that if an agent’s scores fall within the “unacceptable” range for three months in a calendar year, “the agent may be subject to removal from the program.”She said she recently received an email saying she had used profanity on a call, so Liveops was terminating her contract. She didn’t remember saying anything profane. The company provided no recording for her to listen to. She emailed Liveops and called corporate to ask for details or a chance to hear whatever it is she was supposed to have said, but she got no response. (She said she didn’t make copies of these emails before her email account was closed.)“No appeal,” she said.full statement.)She worked as an independent contractor for Arise Virtual Solutions, a company that bills itself as a pioneer in the work-from-home industry.Customers, she said, “get mad at us. They start cursing at us. They start threatening to report us to the main office.” One customer, she said, told her he was going to keep her on the line until he got what he wanted; he “started with the F-word,” then apologized, then carried on. He “wouldn’t stop and wouldn’t stop” until finally, realizing the agent wouldn’t give in, he gave up.At one time she handled calls from Barnes & Noble customers. “A lot of cursing, a lot of crying — crying — believe it or not. I’ve been called every name in the book. And I do mean from A to Z. Everything in between. I’ve been hung up on, threatened, told I’m going to lose my job. I had one woman tell me, ‘I hope you have a miserable day.’ You can’t laugh. I can’t laugh. I’m thinking to myself, ‘You ordered the Bible. You’re some Christian person?’ She’d ordered a Bible! Those are the worst! Those are the worst hypocrites! They scream, curse, yell, carry on, threaten. They’re the worst.”“The women, their mouths are unbelievable. Or they start crying. They’re worse than the men. I’m like, ‘It’s a book, for God’s sake.’”full statement.)She was employed by iQor (pronounced I-core) as a retention specialist and sales agent, taking calls from customers for Sprint (which has since merged with T-Mobile). She worked in a call center.“If the customer is angry and wants to completely cancel, you have 14 minutes to resolve their issue, get them to stay and sell them a new phone,” she said.A unit called workforce management would push agents along. One workforce management monitor would sit at a computer, checking the length of each agent’s call. Another would walk the floor. These two would communicate by walkie talkie, one alerting the other to any agent whose call was running long.“At 10 minutes you had somebody tapping on your shoulder. At 12 minutes you had someone tapping on your shoulder and saying, ‘Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.’ At 14 minutes, ‘What’s going on? You need to wrap this up. You need to move on.’”“We had this guy who would run around on the floor yelling, ‘Move it along, people, all hands on deck, move it along, move it along.’”Agents would have management in one ear and customers in the other. Customers would often be insulting, sometimes shockingly so.She remembered one customer in particular. “He was very, very upset. And it’s personal. You get called names. ‘I hope you fucking die.’” Another Sprint customer told her: “‘I hope when T-Mobile takes over, you all lose your fucking jobs, your fucking families, your fucking homes, and you all kill yourselves.’”She said she was not allowed to hang up. Only a supervisor could do that. “Where’s the line where you no longer have to take that?” she said. “I spent more than one instance in the bathroom, crying, then shaking it off and going back to work.”“I’m pretty thick-skinned, and I had nightmares. It beats you down. Everybody is angry. Eight out of 10 calls, they’re angry and they’re cursing by the time they get to you. Usually it’s the men who make it personal. That’s why I coined the term AngryWhiteManistan. ‘I have another resident of AngryWhiteManistan here.’ They’ll say things like, ‘Well, then, you better get me someone who is not incompetent.’”In her nightmares, she said, she would be doing some mundane task, such as making dinner in the kitchen, when the phone would ring. She’d pick up and hear: “Are you done yet? We need to move on. We need to move on. We need to move on.”heavily prioritizes customer and agent experience over more traditional call center metrics.”The company’s statement added, “We have a long-held policy that all of our experts do not have to tolerate abusive speech or behavior.” (Read the company’sfull statement.)did not respond to requests for comment.She’s lived in “many, many states” and worked in many call centers. Now she lives out west in a rural setting where jobs, and options, are scarce. A few years ago she found a job that lets her work from home. She started as an agent at Convergys (since acquired by Concentrix), then became a supervisor.“It’s just enough of a wage that you’re going to be ineligible for most public support. I’m not eligible for any financial aid whatsoever. And yet I go to the food bank every month because I don’t make enough money. … I don’t go to the doctor, even when I should.”She said the job attracts a lot of new parents. And retirees. And people with medical issues. She said that in her experience, the turnover is “tremendous.” Within months, many people get fired, or “termed,” short for terminated. “We fire more than they resign. A lot more.”Most firings are over attendance. What counts as an attendance infraction? “Anything. It doesn’t matter if it’s in your control or not. … Your power goes out and, bam, you’re absent. ... Doesn’t matter if you had a hurricane.”“You don’t know if you’re going to have a job tomorrow.”Once, as a supervisor, she listened to a recording of a call that had been made to an agent working at home, answering calls from customers for DirecTV. “DirecTV had a policy, you never hung up on a customer, ever. You simply weren’t allowed to, no matter what they said.” (ProPublica interviewed another agent who also understood this to be the case.)“There was a guy who called in and masturbated on the phone. It was awful. … Just imagine being a woman in your office in your home, alone. And here’s this guy doing this, and it takes you a few minutes to figure out what that sound is, and when you do you’re horrified, and you don’t know what to do. All you know is, you’re not allowed to hang up the phone. That would be horrible. I felt so terrible for her.”The agent, crying, asked if she could quit for the day without an attendance infraction. “We had the recorded call, it’s not like it was ever in doubt. My boss was a man, at first he didn't understand why that was an issue.” He didn’t understand why the agent was so troubled. “I had to go to HR to get them to explain to him why it was an issue.” Only then could the agent stop taking calls.: “We recognize that the work-at-home environment isn’t foreveryone. … We take the health and safety of our staff very seriously and do not have a no hang-up policy. Our staff are given extensive training to manage each interaction with techniques to deflect anddiffusesituations should they arise. If subjected to harassment or abuse they are trained and empowered to end the conversation.” (See Concentrix’sfull statement.)She’s in her 60s and wanted a work-from-home job to keep her family safe during the pandemic. She saw a company called Arise Virtual Solutions mentioned online, but she was skeptical. She would be an independent contractor, required to absorb substantial startup costs. (ProPublica’sprevious articleon customer service noted that Arise’s agents often spend more than $1,000 on training and equipment.)Then she saw Bob Wells, a real-life nomad featured in the movie “Nomadland,” talking about Arise on YouTube. She decided to give it a chance. “I was like, ‘I need work.’ … I’d kind of given up on finding something more legit, frankly, because of the pandemic. So it was a pandemic Band-Aid for me.”She answered calls from customers for Home Depot. One, a nurse’s aide, had ordered a portable toilet for a client. “This woman was like, ‘I have a 90-year-old lady who needs this thing like, yesterday, and you haven’t delivered it for three weeks, what is your problem?’” To the agent, this was urgent. “When it became a humanitarian issue, and there were plenty of humanitarian issues, especially during the pandemic,” she would send the matter to people above her, who would then send it to Home Depot to do something. The customer’s problem might then be resolved. “But my stats would go down,” she said, because she hadn’t resolved the matter herself. (She shared Arise’s performance metrics with us.)On days when the phone didn’t stop ringing — and there were many — she couldn’t step away from her desk. “I had a bottle I kept under my desk in case I had to urinate. I never used it, but I had it there if I needed it. I’m in my 60s. … There could be an emergency.”The work was isolating. She joined Facebook groups (and provided screenshots to ProPublica) and began to talk with other frustrated agents. She realized she was among the few white women in her work cohort. And she realized customers were nicer to her — an immigrant with a British accent. “When I first came to this country, I couldn’t believe people could tell the color of a person over the phone. That was a culture shock. ... When people are calling in, I think they find it easier to yell at a Black woman. … I’m not the most evolved person, but I began to look at the work through a racial lens. ... I answered the phone, and there were people who called, and right at the beginning of the call, they were full of white-hot rage.” Then they would hear her accent. “Well, the amount of comments I got from people who were like, ‘Wow, they’ve got classy people here!’ … I was born in a British colony. People think I’m a butler or a classy servant.”network of agents, whom it callsservice partners. “Arise does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the statement said. “Service Partners interacting with individual customers through the Arise® Platform are protected by both client and Arise policies and processes that include the ability to disconnect callers without penalty or transfer these calls to support resources if they are unable to de-escalate the situation.” (Read Arise’sfull statement.)Mara M. was a hairstylist and cosmetology teacher when her health began worsening. “Probably in about 2015, I started sleeping a lot. Any time I would stand up I would get really dizzy, really lightheaded. One of the requirements to teach hair is to be able to stand. I couldn’t stand up. It was a walker and wheelchair for me. … I have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.”Mara eventually discovered Concentrix, a global customer service outsourcing company, while searching for work-from-home jobs on Indeed.com. She signed on at age 23, hoping she might be matched with a company that sold beauty products.At her orientation three weeks later, Mara learned which account — that is, which of Concentrix’s corporate clients — she would be matched with. She would be working part time, doing video calls and live chats for Intuit. She would be helping people use TurboTax.Mara didn’t have an office. But she did have a closet. So she turned her closet into an office. (She sent us photographs.) “They sent me a blue screen to put behind my chair,” she says. That way, customers wouldn’t know she was working from home, much less from inside her closet. She bought a computer, a monitor, a headset.“We were not supposed to hang up. … You’re supposed to hear them out, then empathize with them, then acknowledge that the problem was made. I had tried all that. They say, you know, apologize, but the people stay angry.”One customer called her, moaning. “I was very uncomfortable. I couldn’t tell if he was sick; I couldn’t tell if he was watching porn in the background. I just tried to get through the guy’s questions.” Afterward she told a friend that she thought the man on the other end of the line had been masturbating. (The friend confirmed this conversation.)She learned that agents were monitored. “We had a webcam, and [the monitors] can see you through the webcam. … I’m not sure how often you were watched. But the trainer did say you should shut down your computer after your shift because they can still see you. I was like, that’s really Big Brother. … That freaked me out because I spend a lot of time in my room.” And she learned there were no built-in breaks for part-timers. “You can’t step away when you’re on the clock.” She said it felt confining, like her closet was a prison cell.She struggled to answer questions about complicated tax forms. She would Google for answers in a different window while trying to look confident to the customer, who could see her on the video call. “I had a nightmare so bad that I’d wake up at 6 in the morning over this job. I cried. I’m a sensitive person, so a lot of people probably wouldn’t have cried. … I didn’t know what I was doing. … I was like, ‘I finally have a job, but I don’t know what the answers are.’”Mara didn’t feel like she could quit. For the most part, she said, her metrics were high. But customers weren’t responding to survey questions about her performance. And her lowest score was her “doc rate” — documentation rate — which penalizes agents for not closing out a chat with a customer. They get credit only when a customer says, “Yes, you have answered all my questions.”“Some people don’t answer back after they get the answers they need. For those types of chats and everything, we couldn’t close those cases. My doc rate dropped because ... I couldn't close the case on some of them.”Read MoreEventually, Concentrix emailed to say that TurboTax wanted her off the account, citing “a review of stats … done over the weekend.” (Mara shared copies of the exchange with ProPublica.)“I do apologize for the inconvenience,” a Concentrix representative wrote. “Please feel free to apply for other Concentrix accounts!”Mollie Simoncontributed reporting.",2
522,We Need Help': Haiti's Interim Leader Requests US Troops,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/haiti-president-killed/2021/07/10/id/1028149/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,newsmax,25,"Haiti’s interim government has asked the U.S. and U.N. to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination.Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we’ve asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.”The stunning request for U.S. military support recalled the tumult following Haiti’s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy.The request was received but there has been no decision, according to a US official familiar, speaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance.For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff.Haiti also sent a letter to the United Nations requesting assistance, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Saturday. The letter asked for troops and security at key installations, according to a U.N. source speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the letter are private.On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government’s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government.One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country.Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse’s murder for political gain.“I’m not interested in a power struggle,” said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy: a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a private security firm operating out of a warehouse in Miami and a cameo sighting of a Hollywood star.Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed more than a dozen former members of Colombia’s military.Some of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought.The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. She issued a statement Saturday implying the president was killed for trying to develop the country. “The mercenaries who assassinated the president are currently behind bars,” she said in Creole, “but other mercenaries currently want to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology.”Colombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are often recruited by security firms and mercenary armies in conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and drug cartels.The sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse’s murder — when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.“He told me not to tell our mother, so she wouldn’t worry,” said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears.It’s not known who masterminded the attack. And questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president’s residence posing as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president.Capador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti.Capador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants.The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia’s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, noncommissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their pensions.Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented as someone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia’s U.S.-trained army more than a decade ago.CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp.CTU’s website lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other is a small suite under a different company’s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother’s reputation does not remain like it is,” said Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations.""Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans.Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday.Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his Haitian hometown of Jacmel.He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His now-deactivated Facebook page features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing.Joseph refused to specify who was behind the attack, but said that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts.Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged.Analysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,” said 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the U.S. Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his own security, I have no protection whatsoever if someone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse’s security detail, including the president’s security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president’s security, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”",1

They will roll back to Phase 3, Step 1.Thirteen communities in Massachusetts will roll back to Phase 3, Step 1of the state’s reopening plan Monday after being designated high-risk for COVID-19 for three straight weeks.For many businesses in those cities and towns, that means scaling back — or worse, closing their doors altogether.On Thursday,the state reported 986 new coronavirus cases,the highest count in nearly five months.The state also released its weekly town-by-town data,which identified 77 cities and towns as high-risk, including Boston. Among those 77 are the 13 that have been listed in the red, or high-risk category, for three consecutive weeks.AdvertisementThe towns reverting back to Phase 3, Step 1 are Acushnet, Brockton, Chelmsford, Holyoke, Hudson, Kingston, Leicester, Malden, Plymouth, Randolph, Waltham, Webster, and Woburn.Capacity will be cut back from 50 percent to 40 percent in arcades, driving and flight schools, gyms, libraries, and museums.Indoor theaters and performance venues, as well as roller skating rinks, trampoline parks, obstacle courses, laser tag and escape rooms must close.Some businesses now closing had only reopened a few weeks ago when the state moved into Phase III, Step 2, on Oct. 5.That’s the case at Roller Kingdom in Hudson, which reopened Oct. 5 for the first time since the governor declared a state of emergency in March in response to the pandemic.“We’ve been so careful, taking every precaution, and now we’re told we have close again,"" said Lisa Hores, an assistant manager at Roller Kingdom.Guests at the roller rink have their temperatures checked before coming in, Hores said. Everyone wears a mask, she said, and staff are frequently disinfecting surfaces around the facility. If any kids, or grown-ups, forget their masks, Hores said they keep fresh extras on hand to give out.AdvertisementCapacity has been limited at the roller rink since it reopened, but Hores said business has been steady with kids looking for something fun to do.“We love being here for the kids,” said Hores, who has four children, two in the Hudson school system. “If you don’t give them a safe place to go, where they’ll be monitored and reminded of safety, they’ll just get together on their own.

524,Why used cars are so expensive now — and when prices may drop,0.0,45.67,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-used-cars-so-expensive-now-shortages-pandemic-rentals-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-12,businessinsider,17,"If you're looking to get a sweet deal on a used car to take advantage of the warm summer weather, it's not going to happen.The market for secondhand cars is absurdly and unprecedentedly hot right now. Used vehicles went for a whopping 40% more in June than they did before the pandemic in February of 2020, according to data from JPMorgan.The average nine-year-old car changed hands for $13,250 in June, according to automotive research site Edmunds. That's a 30% hike over the same month in 2020, while a five-year-old vehicle will run you a staggering $24,000 — up more than $6,000 from a year ago.The insanity all comes down to simple economics: demand for used cars far outweighs their supply, pushing prices higher and higher. But the reasons for scant inventories and such high interest in used cars get a bit more complicated.The market for used cars is deeply intertwined with the market for new ones, says Kayla Reynolds, an analyst at Cox Automotive. The latter is going through a rough patch, and those troubles are trickling down into the used market.Adevastating shortage of microchips— which are necessary for all manner of critical electrical components — is slowing car production worldwide, choking the supply of new models and driving their prices skyward. High dealer markups and a lack of options are forcing more buyers to shop secondhand, chipping away at used-car inventories, Reynolds said.To put the magnitude of this shortage into perspective, new-car inventory in the US was down 54% in June as compared to the same month in 2019, according toCox. Dealer incentives have plummeted and transaction prices for new cars have hit all-time highs as a result.That's bringing a whole new set of customers to the used market, people who were prepared to spend serious money on a brand-new set of wheels and are, in turn, driving up used-car prices, says Ivan Drury, senior manager of insights at Edmunds.A drop in new cars rolling off assembly lines has upended the flow of vehicles to and from rental agencies, which are typically a major source of used inventory. Rental companies, whichsold off cars en masseduring the pandemic, usually buy some 2 million new cars every year and turn them over every 1-2 years, Drury said.With travel surging back, they'veresorted to snatching up used cars— and they're not giving them up.Moreover, with new-car prices through the roof, people areholding onto their aging vehicles longerinstead of trading them in, cutting off the flow of cars onto the used market. For the same reason, they're opting to buy their leased vehicles at the end of the term, rather than swap them in for a new lease.There is good news. Prices seem to have peaked in May and are heading back to Earth.Between May and June, wholesale car pricesdeclinedfor the first time since December, suggesting that demand and supply are on a path toward some kind of equilibrium, Cox's Reynolds said.She expects that retail prices will soon follow, and that shoppers will start to notice prices on car lots gradually dropping by the fall. The pandemic-induced car-buying frenzy tapering off partially explains the shift, she said.But the supply crunch brought on by the chip shortage isn't going away anytime soon, meaning it could be quite a while before shoppers see used-car prices they're accustomed to. Even once new models are back in stock, the secondhand market won't snap back to normal overnight, Drury said.His advice to car buyers: ""I'd say give it at least six months. And in all honesty, if you can hold off for an entire year, you're better off with that.""Read next",2
525,Court ruling: Big Ten must disclose additional documents in next 10 days,2.67,48.67,https://omaha.com/sports/huskers/football/court-ruling-big-ten-must-disclose-additional-documents-in-next-10-days/article_5dfb72e7-3bb7-586d-b354-b488c91441f3.html#tracking-source=home-trending,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,omaha,22,"The Big Ten must disclose additional information related to its decision to postpone fall sports and do so in the next 10 days, the Lancaster County District Court ruled Wednesday.The order comes less than a week after eight Nebraska football players sued the league on multiple counts for its decision to push back fall sports. The Big Ten must produce all documents reflecting whether an official vote was taken on the decision, including the official tally but not including how individual members voted. It must also reveal in full its governing documents and bylaws — it submitted 13 pages of bylaws to the court last week but redacted more than 11 full pages.“The court’s order recognizes the time-sensitive nature of the lawsuit,” said Mike Flood, the lead attorney for NU players, in a statement.The typical timeline for discovery in Nebraska is 45 days. Between NU players filing their lawsuit Aug. 27 and the Sept. 12 deadline, the Big Ten will be compelled to disclose documents within 16 days. Players’ argument to speed up the process is based on the idea that the decision to postpone wrongfully interferes with their business expectations to build their personal brands and potentially profit from their name, image and likeness within a fall college season.Not all of the player requests were granted in the order. Meeting minutes, including audio and video recordings and transcripts, are not included in the order to produce. Players also asked for all medical assessments, studies and data between July 1 and Aug. 12 — the day after the postponement announcement came down — that went into the decision to postpone. In her order, Judge Susan Strong said that request was “potentially burdensome.”Though the Big Ten won’t be forced to reveal how individual presidents and chancellors voted, The World-Herald and other media outlets have confirmed the dissenting votes came from Nebraska, Iowa and Ohio State. The league has already submitted a sworn affidavit from Northwestern President and Council of Presidents and Chancellors Chairman Morton Schapiro saying the vote was 11-3. Wednesday’s ruling, in essence, forces the league to confirm that tally and not just one member of the COP/C.“Requiring the (Big Ten) to formally produce a limited amount of information is not unduly burdensome and may expedite the resolution of some of the issues in this time-sensitive lawsuit,” Strong said.The court ruling is only on the motion for expedited discovery, not the merits of the players’ case at large. NU player reps can take the suit in a variety of directions after reviewing documents of the vote and the full league bylaws.The lawsuit’s top stated objective is to invalidate the Big Ten’s decision to postpone fall sports. It also seeks greater transparency in how the league arrived at the decision and limited damages not exceeding $75,000.Nebraska fans topple the goal posts following the Huskers' 24-7 home victory over No. 2 and 3 ranked Colorado on Saturday, Oct. 29, 1994.

But the race turned out to be much tighter than many people expected, with the president outperforming Biden in several states.FiveThirtyEight predicted, for instance, that the former vice president had a nearly 70% chance of winning Florida, which did not happen.Silver explained that the site considered Biden “a fairly heavy favorite” nationwide because “he could withstand a 2016-style polling error or a bit larger” and still win.“People have false impressions about how accurate polls are,” he told Druke on Wednesday.“On the one hand, you have the 2016 criticism, where maybe the polls were close but they were wrong directionally, and then in 2020 say, ‘Oh, well the polls, I mean they may have been the right call, except in one state, but the margins were off.’ That’s the better criticism, but you have to pick one of those two. You can’t do both.”Disappointed voters on social media still blamed Silver for not offering a precise forecast of how tight the race turned out to be.“But for real, how the hell does Nate Silver have a job?” author Dan Areltweeted.“Nate Silver spent all year analyzing congressional districts and polls and everything possibly related to the election. And again, he couldn’t have been more off,” podcaster Jason McIntyrewrote. “This isn’t an NFL game, this is *the country.* How’s this possible?”",1
527,Biden Regime Suspends Border Patrol Mounted Unit Over Debunked Claims Haitians Were Whipped › American Greatness,12.33,26.0,https://amgreatness.com/2021/09/23/biden-regime-suspends-border-patrol-mounted-unit-over-debunked-claims-haitians-were-whipped/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-23,amgreatness,25,"The Biden White Houseannounced Thursdaythat Border Patrol agents will no longer be allowed to ride horses in the Del Rio sector due to debunked allegations that agents used “whips” to stop Haitian migrants from getting into the U.S.Viral images of border patrol agents on horseback pursuing Haitian illegal immigrants spurred liberal outrage when many observers—including the entire Democrat-Media Complex—mistook split reins for whips.The controversy began with the emergence of images showing agents on horseback blocking Haitian migrants from entering the U.S. in a Del Rio riverine, and in one case grabbing onto a migrant’s shirt.However, some media outlets and Democratic lawmakers misidentified the agents’ split reins, which they use to control the horse, as “whips” and accused the agents of whipping the migrants. Some outlets later qualified their description as “whip-like cords” but many Democrats forged ahead with the claim.Border Patrol agents on horseback cracking whips and charging into crowds of Haitian asylum seekers in Texas, shouting at them to go back to Mexico — strong reporting from@psskowon the situation in Del Rio/Ciudad Acuñahttps://t.co/ZVeS6j3gnM— Ryan Devereaux (@rdevro)September 19, 2021The White House has condemned a video of US Border Patrol agents on horseback whipping Haitian migrants.The Homeland Security Secretary says reports of abuse will be investigated.

Agents also need to maintain control of their reins so they don’t lose control of the horse, which can cause injuries to immigrants, the agents, and the horses.”The source said, “we are not aware of anyone being struck with the reins.”Fox News reporter Bill Melugin explained how the reins flop around while agents are riding.The narrative that mounted Border Patrol agents were whipping migrants is false. They do not have whips. They have split reins to control the horse. They are long & have slack, & flop around while riding. They sometimes spin them like a propeller to signal horse to move forward.pic.twitter.com/oM9KzNZkKA— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA)September 23, 2021No images have emerged showing Haitians being hit by the reins.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas initially supported the agents, but changed his stance amid the harsh condemnation from the White House and left-wing Democrats.It appears the administration recognized an opportunity to pander to a core constituency, so pander it did.Mayorkas told a House Committee that the agents had been taken off the frontlines amid an investigation that he expected to take days, rather than weeks.“I was horrified by what I saw,” Mayorkas told CNN. “I’m going to let the investigation run its course. But the pictures that I observed troubled me profoundly. That defies all of the values that we seek to instill in our people.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday harshly criticized the Border Patrol agents. alleging that they used “brutal tactics” against illegal Haitians.Kamala Harris jumped on the bandwagon on Tuesday, claiming to be “deeply troubled” by the images.“What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback treating human beings the way they were, was horrible,” Harris told reporters. “And I fully support what is happening right now, which is a thorough investigation into exactly what is going on there. But human beings should never be treated that way. And I’m deeply troubled about it. And I’ll also be talking to Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas about it today.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decried “images of inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants by Border Patrol—including the use of whips.”During Thursday’s press briefing, Psaki said that it was important to “convey” that the images are “horrible and horrific” and that an investigation is ongoing.“I can also convey to you that [DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas] also conveyed to civil rights leaders earlier this morning that we would no longer be using horses in Del Rio,” she said.👀 Based on a debunked, false narrative about mounted Border Patrol agents supposedly using whips on illegal aliens, Psaki says agents are now banned from using horses in#DelRio.This administration excels at taking tools away from law enforcement.pic.twitter.com/DUTKP53H3j— John Cooper (@thejcoop)September 23, 2021A Border Patrol agent told Fox News “It will make patrolling extremely difficult, along with security.

528,White House orders eviction ban through end of year,0.0,53.5,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/01/eviction-ban-white-house-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-01,rollcall,23,"The White House announced on Tuesday a blanket eviction ban through the end of the year covering nearly all residential renters, asserting the authority to do so through public health authorities provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent further spread of the coronavirus.Renters who can’t pay their lease due to COVID-19 will be able to go onto the CDC website to fill out a form seeking eviction protection. According to senior administration officials on a background press briefing, that CDC-granted order would bar residential landlords from pursuing eviction against tenants for failing to pay the rent because of the pandemic.“Today’s announcement from [the Trump] administration means that people struggling to pay rent due to the coronavirus will not have to worry about being evicted and risk further spread of, or exposure to, the disease due to economic hardship,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters. “The administration has also made federal funds available to alleviate any economic impacts to tenants, landlords and property owners.”No additional funds were made available on Tuesday, and the senior White House officials later clarified that this referred to funds given to states and localities in March as part of the $2 trillion economic relief package and earlier appropriations. Landlords, who have joined renter-advocate groups in calling for an additional $100 billion in direct aid, may face an uptick in unpaid rents, which could disrupt the mortgage bond market.On Twitter, Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called the eviction moratorium “long overdue and badly needed,” saying it would “provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.” But she added that the eviction suspension, without additional financial support, was only delaying the inevitable, calling it “a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed.”The CDC eviction ban would go farther than the expired suspension enacted by Congress in March, which covered the 30 percent of renters who live in apartments with federally backed mortgages. That statutory moratorium ended in July.The Aspen Institute estimated in August that between 30 million and 40 million Americans, out of 110 million renters, could face eviction in the next several months absent additional government assistance.To qualify for the eviction protection order, a tenant must have been qualified to receive a stimulus check this year. That tenant would need to certify that they were unable to pay the rent due to coronavirus-related economic hardships, had made best efforts to seek rental assistance, and that an eviction would leave them homeless or forced into crowded housing.As with earlier eviction moratoria, the CDC protection would cover just evictions for failure to pay the rent. Landlords would still be allowed to evict tenants for other lease violations.Trump announced an executive order on Aug. 8 directing the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments to come up with a response within existing legal authorities and appropriated funds. That move came after Democratic leaders appeared to deadlock with White House negotiators on talks for another economic rescue bill.Last week, the Federal Housing Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency extended their foreclosure moratoria on federally backed home mortgages, which had been set to expire at the end of August, until Dec. 31. Those orders protect fewer renters from eviction because they only cover properties that the FHA, or government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, currently own due to a pre-moratorium foreclosure.Federal extended unemployment insurance benefits expired at the end of July. Even without that extra $600 a week, 27 million Americans continued to file for unemployment insurance into the second week of August.Another Trump executive order allowed states to tap into Federal Emergency Management Agency relief funds to pay out an additional $300 per week in unemployment insurance. So far, 41 states have been approved to offer the funds, but just a handful have begun to do so. The FEMA funds are a stopgap. The extra benefits will run out as the $44 billion available runs dry.A Morning Consultsurveyreleased Tuesday showed how the unemployed were struggling with the reduced benefits: 50 percent of those surveyed in late August said they could not cover basic expenses with unemployment insurance, compared to 27 percent in late July.On the press call, the senior White House officials said that the eviction ban’s legal authority stemmed from the broad powers given to the CDC by Congress to fight pandemics by issuing public health orders. The earlier moratorium authorized by Congress was limited to properties with federally backed mortgages, giving the federal government additional authority to regulate them. The White House’s unilateral eviction order would cover millions of purely private contracts, inviting a potential legal challenge from affected landlords.The CDC order contends that housing stability helps prevent the spread of COVID-19.“Eviction moratoria facilitate self-isolation by people who become ill or who are at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition,” it reads. “They also allow State and local authorities to more easily implement stay-at-home and social distancing directives to mitigate the community spread of COVID-19.”",2
529,How well does the media cover the climate movement?,-10.33,40.33,https://www.cjr.org/covering_climate_now/climate-activists-fridays-for-future.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,cjr,18,"thousands of young activists around the world will march and strike for climate action as part of Fridays for Future, a movement launched by Greta Thunberg and other organizers. Events are planned on five continents. The theme: #NoMoreEmptyPromises. “Those in powercontinue to only deliver vague and empty promises for far off dates that are much too late,” reads a statement by Fridays For Future. “What we need are not meaningless goals for 2050 or net-zero targets full of loopholes, but concrete and immediate action in-line with science.”For some journalists, covering activism presents an uncomfortable dilemma. Too much coverage might come across as cheerleading or make journalists look like they are activists themselves, contradicting institutional notions of neutrality. A reporter’s job is to cover the news, the argument goes, not boost one side or the other.Fair enough. Butactivists are newsmakers—just like the politicians, scientists, and corporate officials we cover all the time.Youth-dominated groups have upended global climate politics over the last two years and injected a much-needed emphasis on environmental justice into the public conversation. Whether by scolding jet-setting elites at Davos for their obliviousness, as Thunberg did, or occupying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Capitol office, as Sunrise Movement activists did to demand that Democrats walk their talk on climate change, youth activists have forced the climate issue onto government and, yes, media agendas around the world.During the 2020 US election campaign, youth activists’ grassroots pressure pushed then-candidate Joe Biden to dramatically strengthen his climate proposals even as it helped raise climate change to a top-tier campaign issue. For the general election in November, Sunrise and other youth-led groups mobilized large numbers ofnew voters, including in Georgia and other swing states, that helped elect Biden president and gain Democrats a razor-thin majority in the US Senate. Now, with Biden in the White House, activists are continuing to push him to make good on his promise to treat climate change as the “existential crisis” he rightly says it is.In short, climate activists are a potent political force. Covering them is no act of favoritism, but simply a matter of accurately telling the climate story.Indeed, one could argue that activists, as a whole, have been ahead of journalists on this story. Media coverage of the climate crisis has long lagged behind warnings from scientists and other experts—especially in the US, where coverage was sporadic at best, and often descended into a scientifically indefensible bothsidesism that portrayed corporate flaks and real scientists as equally credible. Improved news coverage overlaps with the emergence of the youth climate movement: According toa 2020 analysisby the watchdog outfit Media Matters for America, the outpouring of climate activism in 2019—especially a global youth strike in September of that year, led by Thunberg and involvingsome 6 million people—was largely what finally shocked the media out of their collectiveclimate silence. In other words, despite a wealth of evidence establishing climate change as a story of massive, global importance, many news organizations still needed to beledout of the darkness.With a climate realist now in the White House, a new era of possibility in the climate story has arrived. It’s more important than ever for journalists to cover activist groups and their activities accurately and fairly, showing them no more fear or favor than we show any other type of newsmaker.That task begins with doing a better job of portrayingwhothe climate movement actually is. Even after news organizations finally recognized that young climate activists were making news, too many stories fixated on the celebrity of Thunberg and a small handful of others while giving short shrift to the substance of their message. “Instead of focusing on the climate and listening to the scientific message, people are instead listening to and talking about me,” Thunberg remarked in September 2020. Such coverage gives the impression that Thunberg was the only young activist worth hearing, a grievous misrepresentation. “Dear media, I see you are writing about the international climate crisis lawsuit @GretaThunberg and I launched today with 15 other child plaintiffs,” Alexandria Villaseñor, a prominent activist from New York,wrote on Twitter in 2019. “The other plaintiffs have names, experiences and stories. Make sure you write about them, too.”Some outlets have done well on that front, featuring a range of activists in their stories and even profiling them or publishing their op-eds. For example, both CNN and PBS NewsHour recently ran extensive stories about the Indigenous activists in Minnesota fighting the Line 3 tar sands pipeline overseen by Enbridge, a Canadian multinational company. PBS correspondent Ivette FelicianointerviewedWinona LaDuke of the Indigenous climate justice organization Honor the Earth, who said the greenhouse gas emissions of the Line 3 pipeline are “the equivalent to 50 new coal-fired power plants. So, you know, if you’re trying to save the planet, this is not the way to do it.”Other times, outlets have struggled to show the diversity and breadth of the climate movement. In an emblematic incident from January 2020, the Associated Press cut Vanessa Nakate, a 23-year-old climate activist in Uganda,out of a photodepicting four other influential young activists, including Thunberg, all of whom are white. (Reuters, at the same time, misidentified Nakate as Zambian activist Natasha Mwansa.) At first, the AP said the crop was a deadline decision made to improve the photo’s composition; the agency later apologized for the error. Nakate responded that the AP’s action was evidence of how Africans and others from poor countries areoften excludedfrom the climate conversation. “It showed how we are valued,” Nakate said.The modern climate and environmental movements are diverse and enormous. Rather than select, elevate, and revisit a handful of celebrities, journalists should seek out a range of voices, especially activists at the local level representing Indigenous groups or people of color whose communities are often disproportionately affected by climate change.That said, thoughtful reporting on climate activism should not preclude journalists from asking probing questions about the activists’ platforms, tactics, and operations. For example, many young activists engage the climate crisis as an intersectional issue, in which individual and overlapping identities—including those of race, class, and gender—shape their platforms and their work, including dealings with older activist organizations and policymakers. Some of the best-funded climate-advocacy groups have long been far from diverse in their staffing and leadership, despite repeated promises to improve. News coverage should engage the full substance of activist groups’ agendas in an ongoing way, with attention to their complexities and efficacy—and not only when they’re marching in the streets.As many activists would say, ultimately the climate story is not about them; it’s about whether humanity can defuse the climate emergency in time to preserve a livable planet. By tellingthatstory, journalists can get themselves, and their audiences, up to speed on the defining challenge of our time.",1

And I love Roseland, Indiana, but it should not take longer to get to a job in the heart of Chicago from the Roseland community of Chicago than it does (to drive) from the Roseland community in Indiana, 90 miles east of here. And this extension is going to change that,” Buttigieg said.“When you think about equity — both in terms of who has access to transit and transportation, and who has access to the jobs that are created by new transit and transportation projects — we know we’ve got to do better.”Lightfoot echoed the sentiments, saying the current CTA system “does not equally serve all of our South Side communities. She said the city stood ready to match federal dollars that might become available and to invest money along the planned four stops of the extension to improve the quality of life in those neighborhoods.“It takes partnership, and we have to have federal resources to do this, but I want to be clear: The city of Chicago will have skin in the game,” Lightfoot said to Buttigieg. “We’re going to keep on lobbying and advocating, but trust that we will be doing the right things on behalf of our residents to make sure that those federal dollars have a catalytic and transformative effect on our city.”Buttigieg was careful not to assure the project would be built if the infrastructure deal passes Congress, but he said it’s the type of project that likely would get priority from local officials in their use of federal dollars while also being eligible for federal transportation grants.Even with a massive influx of federal dollars, an extension of the Red Line remains years off into the future.The CTA spent $80 million on the first phase of design and engineering required by the federal government and is currently in search of the roughly $100 million needed to embark on the second phase, said CTA spokesman Brian Steele. The entire project — including the 5.3-mile rail extension, four stations and a rail yard — is estimated to cost $2.3 billion.With funding secured, the earliest construction likely could begin is 2025 with the project expected to take three years to build, Steele said. Asked about the long-term nature of the project, Buttigieg stressed that the infrastructure deal is envisioned as more than just an immediate boost of stimulus, but also a long-term improvement in the nation’s long-neglected infrastructure.“This is about making sure we have a vision for the next 10, 20, 50 years. Some of the ideas we will fund with these dollars are shovel-ready,” Buttigieg said. “But this isn’t just about what’s shovel-ready, it’s about what is shovel-worthy.”While touring the 95th Street station, which was renovated and expanded under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Buttigieg also took note of the handicap accessibility of the station and viewed an electric CTA bus parked outside.U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth emphasized that CTAhas a planto make all of its 145 “L” stations 100% accessible, with 42 stations still in need of the necessary elevators and escalators to come into compliance at an estimated cost of$2.1 billion. Biden’s plan also is expected to bolster efforts to convert the CTA’s fleet to all-electric buses by 2040.Following the CTA stop, Buttigieg visited a CSX rail yard in Bedford Park. He boarded a charter bus with Gov. J.B. Pritzker, members of Congress, and rail and labor leaders to tour one of the nation’s largest intermodal freight terminals.Pritzker has said his six-year, $45 billion“Rebuild Illinois”program, passed by legislators in 2019 and funded largely by an increase in the state gas tax, means Illinois will immediately have the money available to match federal funds made available through Biden’s infrastructure plan. The state plan includes a slate of repairs and upgrades to roads, bridges, university buildings, state facilities and other infrastructure.Asked how the passage of the infrastructure package might accelerate the state’s plans or what additional projects his administration could pursue as a result, Pritzker ducked the details.“There are projects people have been dreaming about, desiring that might not have started until 2028 or 2030 that we might be able to move forward,” the governor said. “We’re looking at all those opportunities, but we don’t want to get the cart before the horse here, but we are absolutely excited about the new projects we could take on as a result of this major, major infrastructure plan.”While the infrastructure package totals $1.2 trillion, about half of that money covers existing programs. The roughly$600 billion in new moneyincludes spending on roads, bridges, electrical grids, passenger and freight rail, public transit, broadband access, airports, ports and waterways among other provisions.Buttigieg’s visit came as the White House has ramped up its public relations campaign in a bid to push the package through Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he will call the proposal for a vote before the August recess, includingan initial test votescheduled for Wednesday.Biden emphasized the importance of the bipartisan deal during avisit to the Chicago arealast week while pushing for a separate, larger investment in “human infrastructure,” including making community college free, extending the additional child tax credit and creating universal pre-K programs across the country.The president alsoheld an infrastructure meetingat the White House earlier this week with a bipartisan group of eight mayors and governors, including Pritzker. While the governor said there wasn’t an opportunity to pitch specific projects, Pritzker said he made sure that Biden knew “Illinois is shovel-ready for those federal dollars and the matching dollars that we’ll need at the state level.”In Washington, a bipartisan group of senators has  agreed upon a framework for the package, butquestions remain overhow to pay for the massive spending plan.The Congressional Budget Office is expected to find some funding mechanisms in the bill, which includes leftover COVID-19 relief money, will fall short of what lawmakers have projected, which means the bipartisan group may need to find other revenue sources while holding the support of the 10 Republicans needed to cross the 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate.Republicans have refused to raise corporate taxes, and some conservatives, including anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, have embarked on a pressure campaign to remove a portion of the plan that would generate $140 billion by spending $40 billion to increase IRS enforcement on tax cheats. The White House and Democrats have been unwilling to increase the gas tax or consider a user fee on drivers, which they argue would hit working and middle-class Americans hardest.Asked Friday whether he thought the deal could come apart on Capitol Hill, Buttigieg exuded confidence it  would pass, citing the urgency by Democrats and Republicans alike to fund infrastructure.“There will be more twists and turns, there’s no question,” he said. “What we know is Republicans are impatient. The president is impatient. And there is a bipartisan will to get this done.”bruthhart@chicagotribune.comTwitter@BillRuthhart",2

532,Questions for Dr. Fauci,16.67,26.0,https://spectator.org/questions-for-dr-fauci/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-17,spectator,23,"As you may be aware, health-care providers across the country and around the world have reported great success in using Hydroxychloroquine + Zinc + Azithromycin (the “HCQ cocktail”) to treat COVID-19. According to these physicians and researchers, the key to success is to use the HCQ cocktail within the first seven days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms.Nevertheless, ever since President Trump endorsed Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), its use has become a highly politicized and controversial matter. The opposition to HCQ started with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At the same press conference that the president first expressed hope about using HCQ to treat COVID-19, Dr. Fauci challenged its effectiveness and stated that he would not take it outside the confines of a clinical trial.Since then the opposition to HCQ has increased even to the point where it is almost impossible to find physicians willing to prescribe it and pharmacies willing to provide it.Three practicing physicians have published the following “Open letter to Dr. Anthony Fauci regarding the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19.” It is a devastating written cross-examination of Dr. Fauci that contains much valuable life-saving information and squarely addresses the needless deaths that have occurred due to the opposition to the HCQ cocktail.When the history of the COVID-19 pandemic is written, one of the key issues will be why the United States’ medical and government establishments joined forces to deprive the American people access to a safe, inexpensive, and highly effective outpatient treatment that could have saved tens of thousands lives and definitively obliterated the purported justification for the social and economic lockdowns that have destroyed lives, livelihoods, and the economy.So, here’s the article. Although it is lengthy, I urge you to read it carefully and share it with one and all. Lives, livelihoods, the economy and our very social fabric remain at risk.August 12, 2020Anthony Fauci, MDNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesWashington, D.C.Dear Dr. Fauci:You were placed into the most high-profile role regarding America’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Americans have relied on your medical expertise concerning the wearing of masks, resuming employment, returning to school, and of course medical treatment.You are largely unchallenged in terms of your medical opinions. You are the de facto “COVID-19 Czar.” This is unusual in the medical profession in which doctors’ opinions are challenged by other physicians in the form of exchanges between doctors at hospitals, medical conferences, as well as debate in medical journals. You render your opinions unchallenged, without formal public opposition from physicians who passionately disagree with you. It is incontestable that the public is best served when opinions and policy are based on the prevailing evidence and science, and able to withstand the scrutiny of medical professionals.As experience accrued in treating COVID-19 infections, physicians worldwide discovered that high-risk patients can be treated successfully as an outpatient, within the first five to seven days of the onset of symptoms, with a “cocktail” consisting of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin (or doxycycline). Multiple scholarly contributions to the literature detail the efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine-based combination treatment.Dr. Harvey Risch, the renowned Yale epidemiologist,an article in May 2020 in thetitled “Early Outpatient Treatment of Symptomatic, High-Risk COVID-19 Patients that Should be Ramped-Up Immediately as Key to Pandemic Crisis.” He further published anarticleinNewsweekin July 2020 for the general public expressing the same conclusions and opinions. Dr. Risch is an expert at evaluating research data and study designs, publishing over 300 articles. Dr Risch’s assessment is that there is unequivocal evidence for the early and safe use of the “HCQ cocktail.” If there are Q-T interval concerns, doxycycline can be substituted for azithromycin as it has activity against RNA viruses without any cardiac effects.Yet, you continue to reject the use of hydroxychloroquine, except in a hospital setting in the form of clinical trials, repeatedly emphasizing the lack of evidence supporting its use. Hydroxychloroquine, despite 65 years of use for malaria, and over 40 years for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, with a well-established safety profile, has been deemed by you and the FDA as unsafe for use in the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Your opinions have influenced the thinking of physicians and their patients, medical boards, state and federal agencies, pharmacists, hospitals, and just about everyone involved in medical decision making.Indeed, your opinions impacted the health of Americans, and many aspects of our day-to-day lives including employment and school. Those of us who prescribe hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin/doxycycline believe fervently that early outpatient use would save tens of thousands of lives and enable our country to dramatically alter the response to COVID-19. We advocate for an approach that will reduce fear and allow Americans to get their lives back.We hope that our questions compel you to reconsider your current approach to COVID-19 infection.QUESTIONS REGARDING EARLY OUTPATIENT TREATMENT:QUESTIONS REGARDING SAFETY:QUESTIONS REGARDING METHODOLOGY:COMPARISON BETWEEN U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES REGARDING CASE FATALITY RATE:GIVING AMERICANS THE OPTION TO USE HCQ FOR COVID-19:FINAL QUESTIONS:While previous questions are related to hydroxychloroquine-based treatment, we have two questions addressing masks.CONCLUSION:Since the start of the pandemic, physicians have used hydroxychloroquine to treat symptomatic COVID-19 infections, as well as for prophylaxis. Initial results were mixed as indications and doses were explored to maximize outcomes and minimize risks. What emerged was that hydroxychloroquine appeared to work best when coupled with azithromycin. In fact, it was the president of the United States who recommended to you publicly at the beginning of the pandemic, in early March, that you should consider early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and a “Z-Pack.” Additional studies showed that patients did not seem to benefit when COVID-19 infections were treated with hydroxychloroquine late in the course of the illness, typically in a hospital setting, but treatment was consistently effective, even in high-risk patients, when hydroxychloroquine was given in a “cocktail” with azithromycin and, critically, zinc in the first five to seven days after the onset of symptoms. The outcomes are, in fact, dramatic.As clearly presented in the McCullough article from Baylor, and described by Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, the efficacy of the HCQ cocktail is based on the pharmacology of the hydroxychloroquine ionophore acting as the “gun” and zinc as the “bullet,” while azithromycin potentiates the anti-viral effect. Undeniably, the hydroxychloroquine combination treatment is supported by science. Yet, you continue to ignore the “science” behind the disease. Viral replication occurs rapidly in the first five to seven days of symptoms and can be treated at that point with the HCQ cocktail. Rather, your actions have denied patients treatment in that early stage. Without such treatment, some patients, especially those at high risk with co-morbidities, deteriorate and require hospitalization for evolving cytokine storm resulting in pneumonia, respiratory failure, and intubation with 50% mortality. Dismissal of the science results in bad medicine, and the outcome is over 160,000 dead Americans. Countries that have followed the science and treated the disease in the early stages have far better results, a fact that has been concealed from the American Public.Despite mounting evidence and impassioned pleas from hundreds of frontline physicians, your position was and continues to be that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not shown there to be benefit. However, not a single randomized control trial has tested what is being recommended: use of the full cocktail (especially zinc), in high-risk patients, initiated within the first 5 to 7 days of the onset of symptoms. Using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin late in the disease process, with or without zinc, does not produce the same, unequivocally positive results.Dr. Thomas Frieden, in a 2017article regarding randomized clinical trials, emphasized there are situations in which it is entirely appropriate to use other forms of evidence to scientifically validate a treatment. Such is the case during a pandemic that moves like a brushfire jumping to different parts of the country. Insisting on randomized clinical trials in the midst of a pandemic is simply foolish. Dr. Harvey Risch, a world-renowned Yale epidemiologist, analyzed all the data regarding the use of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail and concluded that the evidence of its efficacy when used early in COVID-19 infection is unequivocal.Curiously, despite a 65+ years safety record, the FDA suddenly deemed hydroxychloroquine a dangerous drug, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity. Dr. Risch analyzed data provided by the FDA and concluded that the risk of a significant cardiac event from hydroxychloroquine is extremely low, especially when compared to the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with high-risk co-morbidities. How do you reconcile that for forty years rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients have been treated over long periods, often for years, with hydroxychloroquine and now there are suddenly concerns about a 5 to 7-day course of hydroxychloroquine at similar or slightly increased doses? The FDA statement regarding hydroxychloroquine and cardiac risk is patently false and alarmingly misleading to physicians, pharmacists, patients, and other health professionals. The benefits of the early use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent hospitalization in high-risk patients with COVID-19 infection far outweigh the risks. Physicians are not able to obtain the medication for their patients, and in some cases are restricted by their state from prescribing hydroxychloroquine. The government’s obstruction of the early treatment of symptomatic high-risk COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used extensively and safely for so long, is unprecedented.It is essential that you tell the truth to the American public regarding the safety and efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail. The government must protect and facilitate the sacred and revered physician-patient relationship by permitting physicians to treat their patients. Governmental obfuscation and obstruction are as lethal as cytokine storm.Americans must not continue to die unnecessarily. Adults must resume employment and our youth return to school. Locking down America while awaiting an imperfect vaccine has done far more damage to Americans than the coronavirus. We are confident that thousands of lives would be saved with early treatment of high-risk individuals with a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin. Americans must not live in fear. As Dr. Harvey Risch’sarticle declares, “The key to defeating COVID-19 already exists. We need to start using it.”Very Respectfully,George C. Fareed, MDBrawley, CaliforniaMichael M.

533,The Death of Faith in America,1.67,28.67,https://www.newsmax.com/michaelsavage/faith-michael-savage-america/2021/07/23/id/1029741/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,newsmax,25,"Today, I am going to talk about the death of faith in America.This has a double meaning: The death of faith, per se, in America. And the death of “faith in America.”You could say the death of religion and we still have religion, but do we still have faith?I will talk about the differences between faith and religion, glimpses of God in things we see and do.I will talk about how Christianity seems to be dying while Islam is growing.I will discuss the crucifixion and what Christ means if you're not a Christian.I will talk about my early days, my travels to the South Pacific islands collecting medicinal plants, and how they had a deeper meaning than I may have known at the time. I discussed spirituality with the indigenous peoples of the South Pacific islands.All good religions teach “Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.” There's not a religion on earth that does not teach that except one.The Jewish religion is the hardest to follow because it's complicated.I will discuss the meaning of the garden of Eden, and the land of nod. And I will tell you how religion and faith connects you to the power of the universe.Let me begin with this.We now have churches in America, let's call them the “United churches of the woke.”A friend of mine wrote and said, ""Michael, churches won't be destroyed or repurposed under the new communism as they were in Russia. Rather, communism is the new religion and the churches, their indoctrination facilities, are woke.""""The new Bible interpretation is really communist indoctrination. The plague spreads. It's a full on attack on every institution,"" the friend added. ""And we ask what is next? Evil knows no limits.""What began with Karl Marx and the Unitarian church is now infecting traditional churches as well.You have to go back to the schizophrenia of Christianity itself, faith versus good works, which is an ambiguity that goes all the way back to the disciples and early councils.Faith is about personal belief and a relationship with Jesus: confession and salvation. Good works is about living your life as the man Jesus supposedly did.Christianity was almost entirely faith-based for many centuries, but in the 20th century the faith interpretation took a beating from science.Darwin bashed creationism. Freud bashed religion as an illusion based on childish impulses.And then totalitarian regimes used science as leverage to gain control. As you know, Marx called faith “the opiate of the masses” and right now communists are burning churches, especially in Canada.In the 20th century, faith became unfashionable among Western intelligentsia.There were notable exceptions, such Albert Einstein, but even the Catholics got in on it with Vatican II.It was intended to update the church; they killed the Latin liturgy.And now the current Pope — whom I call “the bouncer” — is lecturing us on immigration and climate change.If you can believe this? A Pope lecturing us on immigration and climate change!At the middle of the 20th Century there was the advent of secular humanism, which filled the gap left behind by the death of faith. Remember the famous saying “Is God dead?”And then along came the thoroughly secular Unitarian church, the main front organization for secular humanism. ""Atheists with children.""Their tenets contain not even a hint of faith. Here they are from the Unitarian Universalist website:“The inherent worth and dignity of every person.”“Justice equity and compassion and human relations.”“Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations.”“A free and responsible search for truth and meaning.”“The right of conscience, the use of the democratic process within our congregations & society at large.”“A world community with peace, Liberty, and justice for all.”“Respect for the independent web of all existence in which we are all a part.”And then of course the tenet that drives it all is that poor people are good, and rich people are bad.This flows directly from the good works interpretation of Christianity.Jesus supposedly said to his disciples “Truly. I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. (Matthew 19: 21-24)And now, we arrive at a new place: the worship of technology.These days, everyone carries an iPhone.Everyone is an intelligentsia wannabe.Education: Everyone is supposed to be brainwashed in the college. Technology: Today is where the high priest is the high-tech guru.Faith is falling even more and more out of fashion than ever before.And so, what began with Karl Marx and the Unitarians is now infecting traditional churches.I will give you much more on faith and our search for meaning, on today’s Michael Savage podcast.",0
534,In Defense of Liberal Conspirators,-20.67,33.33,https://newrepublic.com/article/162318/astra-taylor-defense-liberal-conspirators,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,newrepublic,25,"The following is an excerpt from Astra Taylor’s new book,Remake the World.“It’s as natural as breathing” is a cliché because, when all is going well, nothing else is more effortless than inhaling and exhaling, something we do approximately twenty thousand times a day. Typically, most of us don’t think much about it. We breathe as we sleep, breathe as we eat, breathe as we move, and breathe as we talk. But that changed in 2020. We worried about our lungs and gasped for air. A novel illness sickened millions and tanked the global economy, thousands ingested tear gas protesting police violence, and cities were smothered by plumes of dark, noxious smoke from nearby forest fires.During the first tense few weeks of the Covid-19 shutdown, we thought we could stop the spread of the disease by washing our hands. Our hands were something we could control. We could keep them in our pockets, wear latex gloves, have sanitizer at the ready, and scrub off the pathogen with soap and hot water. We didn’t have all the facts. The coronavirus, as U.S. authorities knew by early February, is airborne, transmitted through invisible particles and droplets emitted and ingested during the most automatic of physical acts. The pandemic has revealed “that our bodies function more like sponges than fortresses,” my sister, the disability rights activist and scholar Sunaura Taylor, observed. “In a variety of visualizations, we see our bodies extending beyond their usual bounds: graphics of our coughs, sneezes, and even breath show how far beyond our own skin our bodies reach; the six-foot rule of social distancing a daily acknowledgment that our bodies not only leak and ooze, but that they absorb the conditions of others.” Epidemiology and physics colluded to prove that even at a seemingly safe distance, we touch by virtue of breathing the same air.In the worst cases, Covid-19 causes acute respiratory distress. Experts describe succumbing to the disease as akin to drowning. Early in the outbreak I read a piece by a doctor attempting to educate readers about how our lungs operate and what contracting the illness might entail. A healthy lung is so soft, she wrote, it “has almost no substance”; touching it feels like “reaching into a bowl of whipped cream.” Covid changes that, filling the twin organs with a yellow goo that blocks the free flow of oxygen: “The lung texture changes, beginning to feel more like a marshmallow than whipped cream.” To be soft and permeable like a sponge is to be healthy. To be rigid and closed off, fortresslike, spells doom. This is true, it turns out, not just for our lungs but also for our very selves.When we breathe, we pull air into our windpipe, or trachea. That pipe than splits into our lungs’ two main airways, calledbronchi, which then branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, leading to tiny twig-like tubes calledbronchiolesthat culminate in clusters of microscopic sacs calledalveoli. In medical diagrams these passageways resemble the branches of an upside-down tree, as though every human being contains a piece of an inverted forest inside their chest. It’s a fitting image, because if it weren’t for trees, we wouldn’t be able to breathe. By photosynthesizing, plants generate carbohydrates and oxygen in equal measure, nourishing our bellies and filling our lungs. Without them we’d starve, but not before we choked on lethal levels of carbon dioxide. In this sense, the thousands of fires that raged across North America in 2020, burning more than eight million acres, charred the lungs of the earth.In those months, some communities gagged on smoke, others on pepper spray. On May 25, forty-six-year-old George Floyd was asphyxiated by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police offer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds with an expression of untouchable, detached superiority. Floyd’s alleged transgression was using a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The assault was caught on video, and perhaps because the pandemic had slowed things down, people paid attention. Floyd’s murder galvanized the biggest protest movement in U.S. history, attracting up to twenty-six million participants by midsummer. Police and federal agents responded with unrelenting force, blinding over a dozen eyes with rubber bullets and burning thousands of people’s lungs with chemical weapons, including smoke grenades. In Portland, Oregon, residents used leaf blowers for self-defense, redirecting fumes away from innocent crowds and back toward the cops. Floyd’s last words echoed Eric Garner, who uttered a phrase that would become a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests as he was killed by police in New York City in 2014: “I can’t breathe.” In streets full of tear gas, demonstrators couldn’t breathe either.The right wing, predictably, responded to these developments with aggressive denial. Millions of people already devoted to conspiracy theories merely had to add a few new twists to preexisting narratives to bring them up to date. The coronavirus, like global warming, was a hoax, an elaborate ruse by an elite and evil cabal to control the populace—not a pandemic but a “plandemic.” Likewise, the fires in California and Washington were not connected to shifting weather patterns caused by greenhouse gas emissions, but the result of arson, violent acts committed by mythic anarchists and anti-fascists who were never found but who were certainly in cahoots with Black Lives Matter. From his White House perch, Donald Trump amplified falsehoods, uplifted racists, and sowed confusion and doubt. Research showed he was the single largest source of disinformation about Covid-19. While condemning millions to disease and destitution, Trump told his followers they were victims not of a vastly unequal society (helmed by a sociopathic plutocrat no less) but of public health protocols and marginalized groups seeking equal rights; he comforted those afflicted with delusions that a reassertion of white supremacy and a revolt against a spectral “deep state” could cure the crisis. A network of right-wing individuals and foundations funded and fomented discontent, emboldening armed vigilantes who gathered at state capitols demanding a return to business as usual. In Michigan, fourteen men, aggrieved by coronavirus restrictions, were arrested for plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Court documents show they also discussed storming the legislature to “take hostages, execute tyrants, and have it televised.” Instead of being snapped back to their senses by a deadly illness, people retreated further into fantasy and fallacy, in which face masks were part of a far-reaching conspiracy to suffocate patriots and stifle freedom.According to my dictionary, a conspiracy is “a plotting of evil, unlawful design; a combination of persons for an evil purpose.” This is the definition that describes the most popular conspiracy theories of our day, which claim to ferret out a demonic sect pulling society’s strings, whether they are nefarious globalists, Jewish bankers, a Satanic pedophile ring, a “shadow government,” or some dastardly combination thereof. While such misapprehensions are as old as the nation itself—some historians point out that the United States was born of a conspiracy theory, as evidenced by the Declaration of Independence’s paranoid litany of Britain’s “abuses and usurpations,” including unleashing “merciless Indian savages” and “absolute despotism”—the Trump era was uniquely steeped in them. Trump’s rise to power began with the racist lie of birtherism (insisting that Barack Obama was not a true U.S. citizen) and ended in the authoritarian insistence that the election was rigged and stolen by “socialist” Democrats, with the help of some disloyal Republican officials (among them Attorney General William Barr). While people on the political left are not immune to it, this kind of conspiracism is more endemic among and useful to the right wing.If we go further back, however, we’ll find the wordconspiracyhas a different, more profound meaning that might help us comprehend our present predicament. It comes from the Latinconspirationem,“agreement, union, unanimity,” andconspirare,“to be in agreement; to ally”—or, literally, “to breathe together.” That is what the more powerful segment of society, the ruling class, have never wanted the rest of us to do—to come together as allies and, god forbid, form unions. Throughout U.S. history, the most influential and destructive conspiracies have emanated not from the fringes but from the country’s political and financial centers of power, and their goal has been preventing regular people from banding together to improve their lot. Polls reveal shockingly high levels of isolation and loneliness among the U.S. population, conditions that are known to make people more susceptible to the destructive, paranoid conspiracy theories that abet the right wing. We are all living amid the wreckage of a long, ongoing, and intentional sabotage of progressive collective action: a profit-driven health care system ill-prepared to cope with a pandemic, runaway climate change threatening the future, a bigoted and broken criminal justice system, a misinformation-addled (and conspiracy-promoting) corporate media sphere, and an economy in which the majority of people can barely keep their heads above water. Our inability to truly conspire is why so many people are struggling to breathe today.“The power to define what is and is not a conspiracy is a jealously guarded privilege,”Michael Mark Cohenwrites in his fascinating bookThe Conspiracy of Capital: Law, Violence, and American Popular Radicalism in the Age of Monopoly.In the early days of the United States, this battle would be fought overwhelmingly in the courts.The first labor conspiracy case in the United States was thePhiladelphia Cordwainerstrial of 1805 to 1806, and it remains one of the most significant trials in labor history to this day. “A group of journeyman shoemakers attempted to combine to demand higher pay and prevent the hiring of replacement workers,” Cohen explains, and in response they were charged with forming “a combination and conspiracy to raise wages.” Shoemaking was one of the city’s most profitable industries, and it was also the most contentious. A dispute over wages led to a seven-week strike and then a lawsuit, with eight journeymen indicted. A scab testified that the “workers were foreigners seeking to overthrow the laws of the United States” (the trope of the outside agitator was already in effect). The prosecution argued that the workers’ collusion threatened not only the shoemaking industry but also the entire city’s economy. While the workers got off with a small fine, the case set a disturbing precedent. Other courts interpreted the verdict as a ban on labor unions, which meant that organizing efforts were henceforth subject to suppression from both employers and the state. Between 1806 and 1842 there were more than twenty-one labor conspiracy trials involving “cordwainers, tailors, hatters, spinners, and carpet weavers,” Cohen reports. Strikers won six of them. But in each and every case, unions were deemed illegal “combinations” and “conspiracies” and forbidden.Speaking for countless others, Philadelphia labor leaderStephen Simpsonrailed against a double standard that tilted the playing field in favor of employers. “If mechanics combine to raise their wages, the laws punish them as conspirators against the good of society, and the dungeon awaits them as it does the robber,” he wrote in 1831. “But the laws have made it a just and meritorious act, that capitalists shall combine to strip the man of labour of his earnings, and reduce him to a dry crust, and a gourd of water.”Robert G. Ingersoll, a famed agnostic and social reformer, would later express the same sentiment in a pithier formulation: “If the rich meet to reduce wages, that’s a conference; if the poor resist the reduction, that’s a conspiracy.” The double standard would be etched into law: At the same times workers were under attack, the owning class was provided with a bevy of new rights. A corporation would be redefined as a “legal person” entitled to equal protection. Limited liability companies received state sanction and support while labor unions were deemed illegal.As the age of monopoly wore on, conspiracy charges ramped up. The common law doctrine of criminal conspiracy allowed the captains of industry to regulate working-class organization with incessant litigation, turning courtrooms into centers of class conflict. A vague and broad accusation, the conspiracy doctrine implied guilt by association and was used to suppress dissent, “to ban unions, outlaw strikes, pickets, and boycotts, to criminalize radical ideologies like anarchism and communism,” in Cohen’s words. The doctrine was considered “the darling of the prosecutor’s nursery” for its sweeping application and loose evidentiary rules, which meant it was perfect for suppressing dissent—anyone could be sucked into the ring of conspirators, even those who had never met before. “If there are still any citizens interested in protecting human liberty, let them study the conspiracy laws of the United States,” the famed radical lawyer Clarence Darrow, implored. “No one’s liberty is safe.”Born in 1857, Darrow defended countless workers and organizers from conspiracy charges over his career, inspired, in part, by the famous Haymarket trial, a miscarriage of justice that saw eight anarchists charged with conspiracy and seven sentenced to death for an explosion at a small rally (a pardon would be issued in time to save three of them). In an attempt to mount more successful defenses, Darrow dug into the conspiracy doctrine’s history to uncover its basis in English common law, only to discover that its original purpose had been turned on its head. First codified in 1305, the conspiracy doctrine began as a medieval English law designed to prevent malicious persecution. “It was an ancient law that a man who conspired to use the courts to destroy his fellow-men was guilty of treason to the state,” Darrow concluded. “He had laid his hand upon the State itself; he had touched the bulwark of human liberty.”The Age of Revolution flipped the script, shifting the doctrine’s purpose from the prevention and punishment of private abuse of the jury system to the subversion of efforts to build working-class solidarity. In 1721, English judges ruled inRex v. Journeymen Tailors of Cambridgethat workers’ efforts to strike to raise wages amounted to an unlawful and criminal conspiracy, setting the stage for the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800, which made trade unionism illegal in Britain, though laborers continued to put up fierce resistance. “The aristocracy were interested in repressing the Jacobin ‘conspiracies’ of the people,” Cohen explains, while “the manufacturers were interested in defeating their ‘conspiracies to increase wages.’” The Combination Acts did both. A cross section of elites gained power, and labor was forced into the shadows. As a result, the historian E.P. Thompson notes in his study of the English working class, organizing became more furtive, or “conspiratorial” in its modern-day sense. Workers could unite only in secret, ever watchful for employers, magistrates, parsons, and spies who might be their undoing.Workers fought back, but always from a defensive crouch. In the United States, laborers exploited on the job faced retaliation for demanding better treatment. They could be fired, wounded, or lynched, whether by hiredPinkertonguards or volunteer reactionary mobs. World War I inflamed ethno-nationalist tensions and put targets on the backs of radicals, with thousands arrested and often deported in the infamous Palmer Raids. The wartime Espionage Act strengthened the hand of the state, making it possible to prosecute labor partisans for words alone. The legendary organizer Eugene Debs was jailed for declaring that the only war in which he would enlist “was the war of the workers of the world against the exploiters of the world.” Voicing that sentiment landed him in prison for sedition, a charge held up by a unanimous Supreme Court decision.With hindsight, we regard theHaymarket affair, the first wave of the Red Scare, and the Palmer Raids as egregious abuses of state power. But rather than being aberrations, they epitomize a troubling current that has coursed through U.S. history since the colonial days, carried across the Atlantic via British common law all the way to the present day—a disastrous determination to squelch the efforts of working people to become organized. “The most dangerous conspiracy theories, especially rightwing conspiracy theories, do not exclusively populate the extremist margins of American politics and history,” Cohen observes. “Rather, the most dangerous conspiracy theories in American politics emerge from the very center of power, in which white supremacist, anticommunist, and anti-terrorist ideologies, each defined by shifting fears of subversive conspiracies, are promoted and enacted by presidents, business leaders, military men, judges, prosecutors, police, and vigilantes.” The most destructive purveyors of conspiracy theories are not average people who anxiously embrace half-truths. Rather, the real threat comes from those who hold official positions of influence and who actively trade in damaging lies to maintain dominance, fully aware that their continued authority depends on the disorientation, distraction, demoralization, and disarray of millions of others. If that sounds conspiratorial, it is. “I think a little conspiratorialism on the left is sometimes healthy. There actually is a cabal of ruling elites that seek to poison and imprison this world in the name of profits,” Cohen told me by email. “And those people have names, addresses and regularly meet to plot their crimes against humanity and nature. We have much to gain by naming and fighting them both individually and as a group.”In 1961, sociologist Daniel Bell speculated that there is “in the American temper, a feeling that ‘somewhere,’ ‘somebody’ is pulling all the complicated strings to which thisjumbled world dances.” The esteemed historian Richard Hofstadter echoed that sentiment, publishingThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto great acclaim. Over the course of the Trump presidency, countless op-eds, journalistic exposés, academic articles, and books have articulated a similar concern, citing the explosion of conspiracy theories and the elevation of some of the most outlandish ones to the halls of power. The same election that evicted Trump from the White House secured victory for two congressional candidates who publicly supportedQAnon, a convoluted conspiracy devoted to interpreting message board missives from “Q,” a mysterious figure and supposed government insider with knowledge of Trump’s plan to vanquish the Devil-worshipping, child-molesting globalists who currently run the world and send them to Guantánamo Bay with the help ofJohn F. Kennedy Jr., who faked his own death in 1999 and has been in hiding ever since. At the end of 2020, NPR and Ipsos published the results of a poll assessing QAnon’s reach. Seventeen percent of respondents said it was “true” that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media,” and 37 percent more said they didn’t know. Without a doubt, it is alarming when millions of people reject basic reality, even the reality of something as banal as a celebrity’s death. Yet attempts to diagnose the problem’s source and identify possible cures too often fall short.The bookA Lot of People Are Saying,from 2019, epitomizes the genre. Authors Nancy Rosenblum and Russell Muirhead describe what they call the “new conspiracism,” or “conspiracy without theory.” In their schema, classic conspiracism’s evidentiary basis (picture dozens of JFK assassination aficionados poring over photographs of the grassy knoll) has been abandoned in favor of pure affect; hypotheses and suppositions gain purchase through repetition, not proof. Digital networks drown internet users in dubious information designed less to persuade than to overwhelm, as social networks circulate and recirculate sensational claims. Those who know how to game algorithms amass enormous followings, and those with the most “engaging” content always win, accuracy be damned.In 2020, millions of jobs evaporated overnight, but hucksters hit pay dirt. The clickbait economy launched the careers of an astonishing number of “conspiracy entrepreneurs,” a handful of whom, like Alex Jones, are national figures while the vast majority carve out a specialized niche, perhaps exposing “crisis actors” (the people who purportedly pretend to be victims of mass shootings as part of a larger plot to undermine the Second Amendment) or tracking “chem trails” (mind-controlling vapors allegedly released by planes). Rosenblum and Muirhead quoteStefanie MacWilliams, a twentysomething woman fromBelleville, Ontario, who gained notoriety for propagating the myth of “Pizzagate,” which held that prominent Democratic political operatives (includingHillary ClintonandJohn Podesta) ran a pedophile ring housed at a popular pizza parlor inWashington, D.C., calledComet Ping Pong, which inspired a man to travel from North Carolina, enter the premises, and fire a military assault rifle, demanding the release of imaginary sex slaves he believed were being held in a nonexistent basement. Despite the fact that someone could have been killed during the commotion, MacWilliams was unremorseful: “I really have no regrets and it’s honestly really grown our audience.”A Lot of People Are Sayingmaintains that while conspiracism has long pervaded U.S. politics, something significant has changed in recent years. “Today, conspiracism is not, as we might expect, the last resort of permanent political losers, but the first resort of winners,” the authors observe, in a reference to Donald Trump’s rule asconspiracist-in-chiefand theRepublican Party’stendency to paint itself as a victim even as it wields political power. For all the authors’ supposed historical acuity, their insistence that conspiracy theories originating from the powerful is anewphenomenon only holds if you selectively interpret and idealize the past. A cursory glance at U.S. history, or a close read of Michael Mark Cohen, shows that the powerful have claimed to be victims since the founding of the nation. The lies peddled by Trump and theGrand Old Partyare just the latest iterations of the truth-destroying, state-building ideologies of yore.Today we use the term Red Scare to indicate an overreaction, but the mania lasted the better part of the twentieth century, peaking twice, first around World War I and then after World War II. During the second surge, theHouse Un-American Activities Committee, or HUAC,devoted incredible energy to pinpointing communist influence in government and industry, an influence that zealots detected inNew Dealsocial programs, strong labor protections and trade union militancy, and the civil rights movement, whichRepresentative John Rankinof Mississippi denounced as “communistic bunk.” Operating in a similar vein, SenatorJoseph McCarthylaunched a crusade in Congress, seeking out subversive elements in Washington and Hollywood. His efforts lost steam only when they were broadcast on national television and public opinion turned against his inquisition (an unforeseen reaction that sparked the first denunciations of the “liberal media”). But of course, the conspiracism didn’t stop with the end of the demented government hearings. Under the fervid anticommunist leadership of J. Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation continued to spy on citizens, including via COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program designed to surveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt left-wing groups. As one official memo put it, the aim was to “enhance the paranoia endemic in [dissident] circles” and convince activists that FBI agents lurked “behind every mailbox.” A letter sent by the program tried to pressureMartin Luther King Jr.to kill himself. The CIA abetted the cause withOperation CHAOS, initiated by PresidentLyndon Johnsonin 1967 and expanded by Richard Nixon, which “infiltrated antiwar groups, black power organizations, and even women’s consciousness raising sessions to determine if foreign communists were secretly directing them.”As Kathryn Olmsted documents in her illuminating bookReal Enemies,U.S. citizens are suspicious of their government for good reason. Government lies have cost livelihoods and lives. In 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with a plan to deceive Americans into supporting a war on Cuba by launching self-inflicted terror attacks on U.S. soil. While that idea was scuttled, U.S. policies of deception and secrecy were par for the course in Vietnam, Cambodia, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, and elsewhere. In its final tally, anticommunism is responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide.As these and many other abuses of power were revealed, the public became increasingly perturbed. After HUAC, McCarthyism, Watergate, COINTELPRO, and the Iran-Contra scandal, anything seemed possible, and many assumed more explosive secrets must lie in store. September 11, 2001, appeared to validate their gravest fears. TheGeorge W. Bushadministration made an unprecedented grab of executive authority to battle a nebulous enemy and cooked up a baseless story about weapons of mass destruction to deceive the public into war with Iraq. Brown University’s Watson Institute estimates that over five hundred thousand people have perished as a result of the war on terror, not counting casualties in Syria. As if deception and carnage weren’t bad enough, a movement of9/11 “Truthers”are convinced something even more diabolical transpired—the destruction of theWorld Trade Centertowers was an “inside job.” There was no limit, some believed, to what the government might do. Bush-era conspiracy theorists, Olmsted notes, were “more interested in making accusations and identifying the government as irredeemably evil than enacting reforms.” The same holds for millions of suspicious minds today.“The new conspiracism drains the sense that democratic government is legitimate without supplying any alternative standards,” Rosenblum and Muirhead write inA Lot of People Are Saying.They’re correct, but we have to understand the cause. For the last century, anticommunism run amok helped repress legitimate and necessary alternatives, leaving nihilistic reaction and unhinged conjecture to fill the void.Eight months into the pandemic, a television news station in Kalamazoo, Michigan, broadcast a telling exchange. The newscaster stood in a desolate suburban parking lot, reporting on the reaction to the state’s new Covid-19 restrictions. The owner of a nearby establishment, a weary-looking older man, walked up and told the host he had something to say. He was resisting the shutdown and wanted to say why.“My government leaders have abandoned me,” he said. “They’ve put me in a position where I have to fight back.” Four trillion dollars of stimulus money was given to special-interest groups and campaign donors, he continued, “enough money to give every family,every family in this country,$20,000 to go home for two months.” If he were given that sort of support, the man said, he gladly would have closed shop and let the virus settle down. “But I’m not going to do it alone.” When asked if he would continue to violate the state order, the man was defiant. “This isn’t a state order; this is a conspiracy, a tyranny … and I’ve got patriots coming out and supporting me.” The eighty-second clip encapsulated the ways government failures fuel conspiratorial thinking. On one level, the man was correct and his indignation justified. When the bailout funds were dispersed in the spring of 2020, a conspiracy of sorts was indeed afoot—bankers and corporate executives made a mad grab for public money with few strings attached, while regular people, who should have been paid to stay home, scraped by on crumbs. But he was wrong to imagine patriotism and a reckless disregard for public health as the solution to a problem caused by plutocracy. After all, the rich can share citizenship status with poor and working people and still dispossess them.Numerous studies show that insecure, vulnerable, and threatened populations are more susceptible to conspiracism. “Conspiratorial ideation” is driven by both ideology and instability. Feelings of powerlessness, research shows, predict such beliefs. InRepublic of Lies,Anna Merlan cites an analysis of letters by readers ofTheNew York TimesandChicago Tribunebetween 1890 and 2010 that found that conspiracy theories fluctuated in response to times of enormous social upheaval, with the first spike around 1900. Research also indicates that conspiracy beliefs are high particularly among members of stigmatized minority groups. But as Merlan rightly points out, these groups have well-founded grounds for mistrust, given the violent history of white supremacy in this country. Not every community’s sense of persecution is equally valid.In a perverse way, many prominent conspiracy theories are a cry for justice and connection, even if they frame the world in a Manichaean binary of good versus evil, shunning a structural analysis along with complexity and contingency—positing a cadre of cartoon villains who possess the incredible ability to mastermind world events, leaving nothing to chance. Nevertheless, such theories are typically populist in form, in that they purport to expose the destructive actions of a power elite against regular, unwitting people (a power elite sadly often imagined in ways shot through with anti-Semitism). QAnon’s slogan, “Where we go one, we go all,” often shortened to#WWG1WGA, evokes the Wobbly motto, “An injury to one is an injury to all,” by way of theThree Musketeers. It’s a mash-up of cultural references, stereotypes, thwarted expectations, and dashed idealism. No doubt, many conspiracists are irredeemable racists and authentic fascists, but there are undoubtedly some who would likely be receptive to other messages if they were as omnipresent and aggressively promoted. We’ll never know how many people would prefer the opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation with a community organizer instead of watching a talking head spout nonsense online, because they never get such a knock on the door and a chance to talk. Far from the country of civic associations described by Alexis de Tocqueville inDemocracy in America,the U.S. today is a land of anomie where, sociologists observe, a growing number of people suffer from an “epidemic of loneliness.”The spread of misinformation and fake news has inspired hand-wringing among liberals, who bemoan the public’s gullibility and lack of knowledge. I confess I’ve wrung my hands, too. But it’s not enough to denounce fake news or bewail the inability of regular readers to verify facts or “trust science” (a telling phrase since “trust” is unthinking, an act of faith rather than critical reflection—it means, in effect, know your place). Of course, some people could use a look in the mirror—many liberals spent the Trump years deeply invested in “Russiagate,” which played into dated, xenophobic Cold War clichés about “the Russians” and exaggerated foreign influence while failing to acknowledge homegrown threats to democracy. After all, it was theElectoral Collegethat handed Trump the presidency, notVladimir Putin. Worse still, liberals came to lionize the very institutions—the FBI and CIA—that have been the primary agents of countersubversive conspiracies, trampling liberties and destroying lives around the world.As Jonathan Swift quipped in 1721, “Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired.” Ideologies are always shaped by emotions and informed by lived experience. The man in Kalamazoo represents millions who are justifiably angry because they have indeed been abandoned, and who are desperately grasping for explanations that make sense of their circumstances. The challenge is reaching them before mendacious narratives do. But given the right wing’s long and effective assault on labor unions, quality free public education, and nonprofit media—the means and channels through which understanding generally spreads—that is increasingly difficult.The bipartisan project of undermining the left in this country has been, quite literally, a fool’s errand. By destroying the social solidarity, economic equality, and class conscious worldview that a robust, organized left helps provide, ruling elites have created a vacuum in which unhinged conspiracies propagate. Far from being a rational system as proponents claim, capitalism ineluctably tends toward the illogical and ludicrous. Plutocrats will embrace and promote paranoia as long it is profitable; manufactured lunacy provides useful cover, distracting the public from unpopular policies (tax cuts, attacks on unions, a decimated safety net), just as obsessively naming enemies (Democrats, the press, communists, socialists, antifa, anarchists, feminists, intellectuals, “woke” students, and so on) deflects responsibility and blame. In the memorable words of Stephen Bannon, conservatives counteract the allegedly liberal media by “flood[ing] the zone with shit.” The goal is not to manufacture consent but to promulgate confusion, and digital capitalism expands the arsenal used to assault our senses. (In 2020, videos endorsing false claims of widespread voter fraud were viewed on YouTube more than 138 million times during the week of the election alone; polls soon showed that one-third of Americans believed that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win.) “Those who persistently blame others for indulging in conspiracies have a strong tendency to engage in plots themselves,” Theodor Adorno smartly observed in 1952, and so it goes today.The world is a complicated place, and we are permeable, interconnected beings subject to infection by ideas and viruses. We are connected across time and space: our beliefs shaped by past events, our bodies impacted by what happens on the other side of the planet, our lungs filled with air exhaled in the next room. Autonomy is an impossibility. Faced with the prospect of this revelation, some recoil, taking solace in revanchist notions of separation, nationalism, and self-reliance laced with magical thinking.To have a chance of bringing people back to reality, or preventing them from losing touch in the first place, we will need to speak to their apprehensions and misgivings. Consider the growing suspicion of vaccines, which correlates with religious affiliation and higher socioeconomic status, making it one of the preferred conspiracy theories of the comparatively privileged. While anti-vaxxers are a serious threat to public health, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Bill Gates using vaccinations to microchip the masses is not one of them. (Bill Gatesblocking researchersfrom waiving intellectual property protections to make Covid vaccines available to people in poor countries is the real concern.) Or take speculation about the source of Covid-19. The fact is, viruses don’t care about the imaginary boundaries human beings construct, whether those are national borders or the species barrier. Like other zoonotic diseases, the coronavirus jumped from one creature (likely a bat or pangolin) to our kind. It did so because industrial patterns of land use and meat production—picture clear-cut forests, crowded factory farms, and so-called wet markets—push human and nonhuman animals into ever-more intimate contact. In other words, while Covid-19 was not concocted in a Chinese lab or caused by 5G wireless towers, it has political dimensions worth unraveling and discussing, particularly if we want to prevent the next deadly pandemic.An ancient habit of the human mind, conspiracism will never be entirely stamped out, but it can be diminished if we deprive it of the instability, inequality, and isolation on which it feeds. “We will not be a less paranoid country until we are a fairer one,” Merlan correctly observes. You can’t fact-check people out of a problem that requires collective action, mass empowerment, and clearheaded strategy to solve. Instead of chastisement, we need a credible vision of better society and a recognition that it will take mass movements to manifest it. That means building the one thing nostalgic right-wingers and neoliberal centrists both hate to see—an organized and mobilized multiracial working class fighting for their shared interests. It will take a conspiracy of epic proportions to counteract this country’s ruinous and unrelenting war on people’s ability to come together for the common good, but that’s the only way we’ll all ever be able to breathe.",1

While the bill still has to proceed through the Senate to become law, the vote is a first step towards ahuge win for LGBTQ+ Americans. Across social media, people are already cheering this bill's progress.TheEquality Act, which was previously introduced in 2019, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill would cover discrimination in employment in housing, employment, and public businesses like restaurants, stores, and services. While it passed the House in 2019, it was not brought for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate at the time. Now, reintroduced in a Democrat-controlled Congress, thebill has passed the house in a 224-206 vote, per CNN, with at least three Republicans crossing party lines to vote in its favor.Notably, this version of the bill follows the Supreme Court's June 2020decision in, in which the Court ruled that a gay man fired from his job had been discriminated against — asserting that sexual orientation and gender identity were covered under sex discrimination. Now, the Equality Act would codify that ruling and its precedent into law, while expanding its applicability.Across social media, people celebrated the vote and expressed their hopes for the future.Now, the bill goes to the Senate, where it already has strong supporters among the Democratic Party, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer haspromised to bring it to a vote. However, its ultimate fate is unclear, as it will have to pass the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster. Conservative opponents havesuggested that it would violate religious libertyby requiring businesses and institutions to provide services to LGBTQ+ people — the Equality Act would explicitly supersede 1993'sReligious Freedom Restoration Act(RFRA), which prohibits the government from ""substantially"" burdening the free exercise of religion. In short, religious beliefs couldn't be used to justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.Still, the bill has a far better chance in 2021 with a Democrat-controlled Senate than under a Republican-controlled Senate back in 2019. With any luck, Twitter will get to celebrate this legislation again soon.Be the first to know what's trending, straight from Elite Daily",1
536,Abortionist Who is a Convicted Sex Offender May Have to Close His Seven Abortion Clinics,27.75,21.0,https://www.lifenews.com/2019/04/16/abortionist-who-is-a-convicted-sex-offender-may-have-to-close-his-seven-abortion-clinics/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,lifenews,22,"Abortionist Vikram Kaji, 82, whose medical license wasvoluntarily surrenderedearlier this year after he was found incompetent to practice medicine, entered into a consent agreement on April 10, 2019, with the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners that requires him to sell seven New Jersey abortion businesses that operate under the American Women’s Services banner, according to the“It is our hope that no buyer will be found for these shoddy abortion shops, and that they will be forced to close. They should have been closed years ago,” said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.  “American Women’s Services is the most dangerous and deceptive abortion chain that is still operating in this country.  Every day they are open they are exploiting women and risking their lives by cutting corners and lying for the sake of profit without regard for their customer’s lives and health.”New Jersey law prohibits those who are not licensed from owning medical practices.The consent order gives Kaji sixty days to sell the abortion businesses to a “licensed physician” and submit copies of the sales contract and any management contracts to the Board for review.The abortion businesses originally were owned by disgraced abortionist Steven Chase Brigham, whose own medical license wasrevokedin November 2014, transferred ownership of his New Jersey abortion clinics to Kaji, who served as his medical director, for no monetary exchange andwithout Kaji being awarethat he was the new owner.Brigham continues to run the abortion businesses behind the scenes in an “administrative” capacity while using an aging and incompetent Kaji as his shill.  Kaji suffered a stroke and impairment in his dominant right hand along with memory difficulties that made it impossible to properly conduct his duties as owner and medical director of seven busy abortion clinics.Operation Rescuefiled a formal complaintwith the New Jersey Attorney General’s office detailing research that showed no record of the ownership “transfer” and evidence of Brigham’s continued operation of the abortion chain.The New Jersey Attorney General’s officedescribed the business transfer as a “sham”and took steps to end Brigham’s participation – steps that were put on hold for four years while Kaji’s competence was under evaluation.If Kaji can sell the second-rate abortion businesses – and that is a big “if” – it is hoped that Brigham will also be cut off from any further profit and control.It is possible that if Kaji cannot sell within 60 days, the state could order the abortion clinics to shut down.  Those include American Women’s Services clinics in the following New Jersey communities:The American Women’s Services has been fraught with controversy and accusations of illegal activity over the years, which has resulted in the loss Brigham’s medical license in six states.In 2010, Brigham was caught operating anillegal bi-state late-term abortion schemesimilar to one that cost him his medical licensein New Yorkin 1994.  He would begin abortions as late as 30 weeks or more at his unlicensed office in Voorhees, New Jersey, where he was legally permitted to conduct abortions up to 14 weeks.To avoid running afoul of New Jersey law, Brigham would induce the women into active labor then caravan them to a secret late-term abortion facility in Elkton, Maryland, where the abortions would be completed.  Brigham, who was never licensed in Maryland, conducted abortions illegally in Elkton.  He shielded his illicit activity by using the license ofanother elderly physician, whose mental and physical abilities were also impaired, as a cover in a similar way that he used Kaji.However, that scheme fell apart after Brigham and his new trainee, Utah abortionistNicola Riley, nearly killed an 18-year old woman during a seriously botched 22-week abortion.  Complaints filed by the Union Hospital in Elkton and the Johns Hopkins surgeon who saved her life resulted in the legal (if not practical) end of Brigham’s medical career.Kaji has had his own set of troubles in the past.  He wasconvictedby the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners in 1993 for having improper sexual contact with three patients. Kaji reportedly had sex with one young girl at his office during business hours and later plied her with drugs. He knew his victim was vulnerable to his advances because she had been a depressed victim of child sex abuse with a history of psychiatric hospitalization.  Kaji was also accused of giving improper breast and rectal exams to two other women.   The NJBME placed Kaji on a 1-year suspension and fined him $5,000 and ordered him to undergo psychological counseling.Brigham continues to operate abortion clinics in Florida, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Maryland, where a woman,Maria Santiago, was killed during a botched abortion in 2013.  These clinics are not expected to be impacted by any action in New Jersey.Pennsylvania permanently banned Brigham from practicing medicine or operating any medical facility in that state in 2010, but that didn’t stop him fromsurreptitiously opening an abortion businessin Philadelphia in 2012.  Once his affiliation was found out and complaints were filed by pro-life groups, including Operation Rescue, it was forced to close in 2013.“Brigham has learned well how to evade the law from his decades of legal woes.  It is likely that he may try to transfer ownership of the clinics to someone close to him that will allow him to continue exploiting women for financial gain with his sloppy and dangerous practices.  Hopefully, the Attorney General’s office has had enough dealings with him that they will see through any attempts to pull off another sham transfer deal,” said Newman. “Closing Brigham and Kaji’s American Women’s Services in New Jersey will be one of the best things the state has ever done to protect women.”",0
537,The countries that will be first in line to get a coronavirus vaccine,-1.67,51.33,https://qz.com/1884905/who-will-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-first/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,qz,25,"If scientists find a successful coronavirus vaccine—which is still “if,” rather than “when”—the companies that own the rights will face the difficult question of who gets the first doses.Researching and producing a vaccine costs billions of dollars, so governments around the world are offering major funding in exchange for the promise of early batches. Inevitably, the richest countries are more likely to get a vaccine fastest.The table below shows ongoing public deals for the first vaccines being developed by different companies, in order of the country or institution that has pre-ordered the greatest number of doses.Some of these deals, including the two within the European Union and the UK’s deal with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, are still in negotiation. Others did not disclose the volume of vaccines to be produced: Israel is working to source vaccines from Moderna and AstraZeneca, for example.While the US and India’s Serum Institute are snapping up the greatest volume of pre-orders, not all deals are made equal. AstraZeneca’s arrangements with Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Serum Institute of India are intended to distribute the vaccine to low-and-middle income countries. Russia’s drugmaker R-Pharmplans to distribute AstraZeneca’s vaccineinternationally, while Brazil licensed the ability to produce it domestically.The biggest dealsdon’t necessarily line upwith the most advanced vaccine trials. Currently, six institutions are conducting phase three trials, the large-scale efficacy studies that are the final hurdle before drug approval. One of these trials doesn’t have particularly promising results, but is in advanced stages because it’s testing an approved tuberculosis vaccine.That leaves five vaccines in late-stage trials. One is created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which is fielding four different deals. Pfizer and Moderna announced the start of theirphase three trialson July 27. And two are created by Chinese companies: Sinopharm and Sinovac.Those two companies are notably underrepresented among existing deals. China’s president President Xi Jinpingtold the World Health Organization (WHO) in Maythat any vaccine developed nationally would be a “global public good.” But while AstraZeneca and Pfizer have made commitments in exchange for funding, the Chinese companies’ arrangements are less clear.Sinovac is offering some vaccines in exchange for conducting trials internationally: The company has a licensing agreement with Brazil, while a Bangladesh health ministry officialtold Reutersthe country would “get priority” for any vaccine successfully developed. Sinopharm hasn’t made such clear-cut public deals.The comparative lack of funding for Chinese companies means they have less means to bulk up production. AstraZeneca has committed to producing2 billion doses, and expects to deliver much of this by early 2021. Pfizer, which is collaborating with German company BioNTech and Chinese company Fosun Pharma, said it expects to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.In comparison, Sinopharm is expanding production to200 million vaccine doses a year, while Sinovac Biotech is building a plant to make 100 million doses a year.Once a successful vaccine is created, there’s some incentive to share: The pandemic won’t die out until it is addressed globally.

They don’t respect democracy or view it as their role to uphold and promote democratic institutions in the United States.There is not going to be any declaration of martial law. Trump isn’t going to overturn the election. Trump is not going to get help from the military to stay in power.The soon to be former president was the face of the fascist threat, but he has converted the Republican Party into an anti-democratic movement for autocracy.Donald Trump lost, but the authoritarian impulsebehind Trumpism still must be defeated for democracy in the United States to be saved.For more discussion about this story join ourRachel Maddow and MSNBC group.Follow and Like PoliticusUSA on Facebook",1
539,California just hit 95% renewable energy. Will other states come along for the ride?,-5.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-04-29/solar-power-water-canals-california-climate-change-boiling-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,latimes,25,"This is the April 29, 2021, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West.Sign up hereto get it in your inbox.Something remarkable happened over the weekend: California hit nearly 95% renewable energy.I’ll say it again: 95% renewables.For all the time we spend talking about how to reach 100% clean power, it sometimes seems like a faraway proposition, whether the timeframe is California’s 2045 target or President Biden’smore aggressive 2035 goal. But on Saturday just before 2:30 p.m., one of the world’s largest economies came within a stone’s throw of getting there.There are several caveats. For one thing, Saturday’s 94.5% figure — a record, as confirmed to me by the California Independent System Operator — was fleeting, lasting just four seconds. It was specific to the state’s main power grid, which covers four-fifths of California but doesn’t include Los Angeles, Sacramento and several other regions. It came at a time of year defined by abundant sunshine and relatively cool weather, meaning it’s easier for renewable power to do the job traditionally done by fossil fuels.And fossil fuels actually were doing part of the job — more than the 94.5% figure might suggest. California was producing enough clean power to supply nearly 95% of its in-state needs, but it was also burning a bunch of natural gas and exporting electricity to its Western neighbors. It’s impossible to say exactly how much of the Golden State’s own supply was coming from renewables.That said, what happened on Saturday is definitely a big deal.“It sends chills down my spine. It’s amazing,” said Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s main power grid. “These types of transitions aren’t always pretty. But we’re getting a lot of renewable generation online, making a real dent in the state’s carbon emissions.”I’ll get to the bit about the transition not always being pretty in a minute. For now, here’s a chart based on data from the grid operator’swebsite, showing how various sources of power supply changed hour by hour on Saturday:That green line at the top is renewables; you can see how it jumps up in the morning and falls in the evening, reflecting sunrise and sunset. The orange line under that is natural gas. The red line at the bottom is out-of-state imports. It sinks into negative territory in the middle of the day because California has so much solar power that it’s selling some to other states.The 94.5% record may have been fleeting, but it wasn’t some isolated spike. Most of Saturday afternoon, the renewables number topped 90%, with solar and wind farms doing the bulk of the work and geothermal, biomass and hydropower facilities making smaller contributions. Add in the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant — which isn’t counted toward California’s renewables mandate — and there was enough climate-friendly power at times Saturday to account for more than 100% of the state’s electricity needs.So California has lots of clean power. The important thing now is making sure the puzzle pieces of the grid fit together on hot summer evenings, like the ones last August when insufficient supplies after sundown led to rolling blackouts.State officials are taking many steps to avoid a repeat of last summer’s emergency, some of which aremore controversial than others. They’re also beginning to focus on the longer term. Mainzer’s grid operator recentlyurgedthe California Public Utilities Commission to order electric companies to add 10,000 megawatts of power by 2026 — about one-eighth of the state’s entire generating capacity! — in part to make sure there’s enough supply on the grid when the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant closes.“That’s not an inconsequential investment,” Mainzer said.No, it’s most definitely not. But while some of theclean energy solutionsCalifornia is almost certain to need will carry a high upfront price tag, others are much less expensive. In fact, some produce immediate savings.Case in point: the Western Energy Imbalance Market.I’ve avoided writing too much about theWestern EIM(acronym alert!) because it gets very wonky, very fast. But it’s absolutely worth knowing about. It’s a unique program that makes it easier for utility companies across the American West to share extra electricity, with a goal of saving money for ratepayers (i.e. you and me) and reducing planet-warming emissions.How does it work? As I explained in a2017 deep dive for the Desert Sun, the program allows out-of-state utilities to participate in California’s real-time electricity market, where they can buy power to fill in last-minute gaps between supply and demand.So if California has more solar power than it can use on a sunny afternoon — agrowing trend each spring— it can send some of that cheap electricity to Arizona, which then might be able to burn less coal. Or if the wind is ripping in Wyoming — home to some of the country’sstrongest, most consistent gusts— California can tap into that clean power rather than firing up a gas plant.A key barrier to this type of cooperation in the past was mistrust: Red states worried about blue states shoving renewable energy down their throats, and blue states worried about red states forcing them to buy dirty energy. And nobody wanted to risk finding themselves short on electricity in a pinch because some out-of-state utility made a higher bid for their power.But in the seven years since California launched the Western EIM, that mistrust has started to fade.There are now14 electric grid operatorsparticipating in the imbalance market, from Arizona Public Service in the Southwest to Idaho Power in the Northwest to Warren Buffett-owned Rocky Mountain Power in the Intermountain West. Several utilities joined this month,includingthe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has long zealously guarded its independence. Several more are preparing to join, as far from California as NorthWestern Energy in Montana and El Paso Electric in Texas.By 2023, the market will cover 83% of electricity demand in the West. Here’s a map of the current and planned participants:The program is growing so fast in part because of the measurable economic benefits. Through the end of 2020, participantscollectively saved nearly $1.2 billion. Mainzer told me another $101 million in savings accrued in the first quarter of this year.“California has seen about $300 million of those benefits, and the state hasn’t had to pay a penny to see that market get up and running,” he said. “It’s just been a smashing success.”At the same time, political obstacles still stand in the way of a fully integrated Western power grid that could do a whole lot more to limit costs, reduce climate pollution and ultimately prevent power outages — “one grid to rule them all,” to borrow a phrase Ifirst saw usedby Utility Dive journalist Herman K. Trabish.Three years of discussion overexpandingthe EIM, for instance, have not yet resulted in an agreement among the participants. A proposal from then-Gov. Jerry Brown that would have transitioned California’s grid operator to a truly regional power authority — again, see my2017 deep dive— was defeated several times in the state Legislature, amid opposition from lawmakers who worried the plan would result in fewer in-state jobs and cede too much power over California’s energy mix to other states.Some of those other states are similarly wary of Mainzer’s Independent System Operator, which is led by appointees of the California governor. The agency’s primary responsibility is serving Californians, even as it runs the EIM for the whole region.Those tensions came to a head last week when the grid operator’s leaders voted toprioritize California’s electricity needsduring crunch times on the grid this summer, to the possible detriment of out-of-state utilities that typically have been able to send energy through California’s power lines without much trouble. Arizona and Nevada’s major utilitieswrotethat the plan was “not equitable or fair.” Mainzer’s former employer, the Portland-based Bonneville Power Administration,wasn’t happy either.“We take our obligations to California dead seriously,” Mainzer said.At the same time, he added, “we definitely are very motivated to help the broader West.” As California should be. The state won’t make much of a difference on climate change unless it can bring the rest of the country and world along for the ride.At the moment, Mainzer is focused on keeping the lights on this summer. He’s also happy to celebrate the 95% renewable energy record, even if only for a moment.“We have to remember the positives of the story as well,” he said.And now, here’s what else is happening around the West:There’s a growing recognition in California’s Central Valley that the farm economy will shrink as droughts worsen and farmers face the consequences of pumping too much groundwater.That’s one takeaway fromthis story by my colleague Louis Sahagún, who wrote about how farmers and farmworkers are affected by increasingly scarce (and often polluted) water supplies, including many Latino families who face the risk of their drinking-water wells running dry. Columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, writes that westernersmust come to termswith what John Wesley Powell told a Los Angeles irrigation conference in 1893: “You are piling up a heritage of conflict and litigation over water rights, for there is not sufficient water to supply the land.”President Biden’s new climate target is more ambitious than California’s.Biden pledged that the United States will slash its planet-warming pollution at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 47% the Golden State is aiming for, as Tony Barbozareports for The Times. (Tony also compiled abrief historyof U.S. climate pledges.) America’s new goal is roughlydouble what President Obama had sought to achieve, per The Times’ Chris Megerian. Biden ended his climate summit last week by making the case that global warming isa challenge but also an economic opportunity, my colleague Anna M. Phillips reports.Lest he be one-upped by Biden, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that California would study phasing out all oil production by 2045.He also said the state willstop issuing new fracking permits by 2024, Phil Willon and Taryn Luna report for The Times. By way of context, fracking accounts for a tiny fraction of oil and gas extraction in California; ending oil production would be a much bigger deal. See alsomy story from last weekon scientists who say the state is falling behind on climate leadership.At this point, it seems like almost a given that California will see another historic fire season.So writes our new wildfire reporter, Alex Wigglesworth, inthis piece previewing what we might facein a few short months. The short version: Nobody knows exactly how bad things will be, but a combination of meager rainfall, depleted snowpack and dry vegetation spells trouble.A stunning DDT dump site off the coast of Los Angeles is much bigger than scientists expected.My colleague Rosanna Xia writes that scientists aboard the research vessel Sally Ridewere so overwhelmed by the images sent up by deep-sea robotsthat it was like “trying to count stars in the Milky Way.” The research mission waspromptedby Rosanna’sincredible reportingon the hidden history of the country’s largest DDT manufacturer dumping its pesticide waste into the Pacific Ocean.California officials are poised to order Nestlé to stop bottling and selling millions of gallons of water from San Bernardino National Forest.The proposed order comes six years after reporter Ian Jamesrevealedthat the company was taking water from the national forest under a permit that was supposed to expire in 1988.Here’s the latest on what happens nextfrom Ian and Janet Wilson at the Desert Sun. (Ian also has a scary piece for the Arizona Republic on thestate of play on the Colorado River, including the fact that Lake Powell could dip low enough in the next few years that it stops being able to generate hydropower.)Water regulators continue to debate a proposed desalination plant in Huntington Beach.The facility faces all the usual tensions: It would generate clean drinking water whileusing lots of energy and harming marine life, as Bettina Boxall reports for The Times. One outstanding question is whether the developer, Poseidon Water, shouldn’t be allowed to sell water until it’s ready to start its environmental mitigation work, which includes wetlands restoration at the nearby Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve.A Texas-based group is pushing county governments in Colorado and other states to pass resolutions opposing Biden’s goal of protecting 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. The hard-right American Stewards of Liberty was founded by the daughter of some of the original Sagebrush Rebels. She argues that the “30 by 30” goal — which was also endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom — is “anti-capitalism,” “anti-individual liberty” and “anti-American,” as Nancy Lofholmreports for the Colorado Sun.President Biden’s climate summit did not yield new commitments from most of the world’s major polluters.One exception was South Korea, which pledged tostop financing new overseas coal plants, as Chris Megerian and Anna M. Phillips report for The Times. Anna also put together ahelpful rundownon how the world’s biggest emitters are doing on their existing climate pledges.Back at home, the White House bolstered its own climate pledge by announcing it would push for a law requiring 80% clean electricity nationwide by 2030.A new analysis from researchers at Energy Innovation and UC Berkeleyconcludes that target is feasible, per Reuters’ Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom. Reuters’ Timothy Gardner also reports that the Biden administration will offermore than $8 billion in loansto support clean energy by expanding and upgrading the power grid.The Biden administration is also proposing to once again allow California to set its own tailpipe pollution rules.This was expected, but it’s still a big deal forgetting America’s largest source of climate pollution under control, Anna M. Phillips reports. L.A. Times columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, explores a new report from the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general finding the Trump administrationdeliberately locked out EPA scientistsas it weakened tailpipe emissions rules.“Too many people drive like demons because they think they won’t get caught. Knowing they might be on camera could help reduce the carnage.”That’s Times columnist Steve Lopezmaking the case for two bills in Sacramentothat would seek to slow down drivers by allowing automated speeding enforcement. You’ll remember myrecent piece about my friend Jim Pagels, who was killed in a car crash after years of advocating for safer streets that work for cyclists and pedestrians, not just drivers.REI says climate change is an existential threat — but it spent Earth Month helping Ford market a gas-guzzling SUV.The outdoor recreation company has made environmental stewardship a core part of its branding, but that didn’t stop it from making ads promoting the Bronco Sport, and alerting its members with the email subject line “Load Up. Gas Up. Get Out,”per my story for The Times. I also learned that REI’s director of sustainability said he was “not aware of the advertisement before its release.”A new United Nations report says reducing methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure is one of the best ways to keep the planet from heating up too quickly.More details herefrom Hiroko Tabuchi at the New York Times. In related news, the U.S. Senatevoted 52-42 to reinstate Obama-era methane restrictions, per my colleagues Sarah D. Wire and Anna M. Phillips.Natural gas utilities are happy to slash methane emissions, but they’ve fought efforts to phase out gas in favor of clean electricity, arguing they can be part of the long-term climate solution.San Diego Gas & Electric justpledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, joining its corporate sibling, Southern California Gas, as Rob Nikolewski reports for the San Diego Union-Tribune. It’s not yet clear how either utility will reach that target. In the meantime, parent company Sempra Energy continues to seek Biden administration approval for anatural gas export terminal in Mexico, as I reported earlier this year.Here in Southern California, a natural gas leak in Downey prompted a small evacuation Thursday after a SoCalGas pipeline was cut by a contractor in a residential area.Read more here, from The Times’ Priscella Vega and me. Further south, L.A. City Council member Joe Buscaino isurging the owner of a liquid butane storage facility in San Pedro to sell the site, my colleague Emily Alpert Reyes reports. Local residents have worried for decades that the storage tanks could explode and start a fire.Let’s end with some pictures.

Brian K. Tolliver, 46, died in Largo, Florida, after testing positive for COVID-19 on July 10, according to an Army Reserve Medical Command press release.“We feel a tremendous loss in our military family with the passing of Master Sgt. Tolliver,” said the command’s ranking officer, Maj. Gen. Jonathan Woodson, in an emailed statement. “COVID-19 has taken a dedicated soldier from our formation, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.”Tolliver, who is from Memphis, Tennessee, was admitted to the Largo Medical Center the day after he tested positive and he remained there until the time of his death, the command’s release stated.As of Thursday morning, there have been a total of 34,584 COVID-19 cases among service members, with 11,915 of those in the Army,accordingto Pentagon data. More than 19,000 service members have recovered from the illness so far. The Defense Department does not break out those numbers to specify whether those troops are active duty or reservists.Tolliver served in the Army for 25 years, more than a decade of which was spent in the reserve component.In his last assignment, Tolliver served as the command paralegal for Army Reserve Medical Command in Pinellas Park, Florida. He is survived by his three children, who reside in Louisville, Kentucky.“Master Sgt. Tolliver was a tremendous mentor, leader, soldier, and one of the finest human beings I have ever met,” said Lt. Col. T. Scott Randall, the deceased soldier’s immediate supervisor. “He will be sorely missed by all.”Four of the military’s five deaths have been soldiers from the Army’s reserve components.ANew Jersey National Guard captaindied of the illness in March at the age of 57. Then in April, a 41-year-oldNavy chief aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Rooseveltdied. A34-year-old Illinois-based Army Reserve soldierdied in May, and a61-year-old Army reservistdied earlier this August.The Army Reserve suspended in-person drill in March and shifted to virtual formations and instruction whenever possible, according to apolicy memo.The Pentagon’s figures show that there have been a total of 75 deaths among DoD personnel, with 47 among civilian employees, seven among dependents, 16 among contractors and the five among uniformed service members.The infection rate in the military has been roughly on par with that of the general U.S. population, but the rates of hospitalization and death are much lower, likely due to the younger demographics within the service branches.Fewer than 2 percent of military cases have required hospitalization, and the death rate is 0.0001 percent, compared to 3 percent nationwide, Military Timesreportedin early August.Kyle Rempfer was an editor and reporter who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents.

541,What Was the Debt-Ceiling Showdown Really All About?,10.67,29.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/what-was-the-debt-ceiling-showdown-really-all-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,thebulwark,17,"The Western liberal tradition to which we belong has as it foundation two things: proportional representation of the will of the people and capitalism.Both are equally as important. One cannot survive without the other. Yes, the Europeans may be a bit more socialist leaning, but democracy has never survived true socialism or communism. And there are no precedents for capitalism flourishing in systems that reject proportional representation.In essence, any vote against capitalism—that is, capitalism at its core, not its regulatory edges—is anti-democratic. And vice versa. Yet, voting against capitalism is what what the entire Republican Senate minority just did.No thing, and no person, has economic value in a vacuum. All value—like all motion—is relative. Value (and thus price) is the relationship of one thing to another.The entire discipline of what we call “finance” is an exercise in making relative valuations. But to start, finance had to settle on a reference point—a “risk free” thing which could be used as a yardstick for everything else, so that everything else can be priced accordingly. While everyone knows there is no such thing as a “risk free” investment in an absolute sense, the mechanism that finance chose made sense: government bonds. In particular, U.S government bonds. And in even more particular, the 10 year Treasury yield.Every mortgage, every auto loan, every wage—everythingis priced relative to the value of the risk-free rate—the U.S. 10 year Treasury yield.The reason why government bonds are considered risk free is because they, by definition, are. A bond is an obligation of a country to pay a holder of that obligation at a future date. That obligation is met through something else owned by the country—meaning currency. It is impossible for a country to default on its own bonds, because it could just create more currency to meet the obligations.Which means that there is only one way to default on sovereign debt—willfully.But the debt!Perhaps one of the most disingenuous (but effective) arguments put forward in modern politics was the case for conservative “fiscal responsibility.”You have to manage your own debt, so why shouldn’t the government?That line makes sense to people. Building on this parochial bedrock, conservatives flirted many times with the idea of the businessman-president until finally nominating Donald Trump, a bankruptcies vitamin hawker who played the role of businessman on TV.Under President Trump the size of governmentgrew to its largest levels since the 1960s. Never mind the fact governments probably shouldn’t be run like a business, or a household because it turns out that there is no constituency for fiscal conservatism. Despite what conservatives have said for 40 years, their revealed preference is clearly for bigger government and more spending.And you know what? As a policy matter, that’s okay.Can debt grow so large it topples the financial order? Sure.But as of 2021, in sum, the United States has a net worth (assets-liabilities) of $132 trillion.The Biden administration’s proposal to take on $3.5 trillion of national debt over 10 years to reduce significantly the greatest risk to our mature civilization—which is wealth inequality—would lower America’s national net worth by around 2.25 percent. That’s it.We would be spending 2.25 percent in order to cut child poverty in half. Would you as an individual donate 2.25 percent of your personal net worth to cut child poverty in half? I bet you would. I bet you would even donate 2.25 percent of your net worth over a 10 year period to cut child poverty in half for just one family. Prices are relative and this price isn’t all that high relative to the good we’d be purchasing.Of course, there could be side effects. The plan might not cut child poverty in half. There could be inflation. There may be prudential reasons not to enact it. But to argue that the size is so onerous is wrong-headed.Back to willful default. The Senate Republicans who now fashion themselves as champions of fiscal responsibility were willing to turn the risk free rate—on whicheveryasset is priced—into a non-risk free rate by refusing to raise the debt ceiling.They were voting for America to default. This isn’t just hypocritical. It is also another attack on democracy. Because if the risk free rate had been made risky, then then financial calamity would have been unspeakable. Because again: Functioning democracy is intertwined with functioning capital markets.During the first and second Trump impeachments, a number of Republicans voted to remove Trump, and so we thought,Hey, as long as we have Mitt Romney and the others, there’s hope.But the problem is that these Republicans aren’t thinking expansively enough about democracy. About what democracy is. About what democracy requires. It’s not just rejecting Donald Trump’s cult of personality. It’s understanding and supporting the policies which make democracy possible. Even when such support runs counter to the party’s daily marching orders.All 50 Republicans in the Senate voted not to raise the debt ceiling and therefore willfully default on America’s debt. That vote was just as antithetical to a functioning democracy as was the votes to decertify the election results on January 6.For democracy and capitalism to survive, they need each other. And we need a better class of Republicans. Even the “good Republicans.”",1

The Pfizer vaccinerequires two dosesof the shot and will come with a COVID-19 vaccination card after your first injection is administered. But is that the same as an immunity passport to return to normal activities? What are the differences?The wallet-sized vaccination cards will come with thecoronavirus vaccinationkits sent out from Operation Warp Speed,according to the US Department of Defense. The cards will be printed in both English and Spanish.So what are coronavirus vaccination cards, and how will they differ from an immunity passport? We answer that and more below.8 coronavirus vaccine myths, debunkedA coronavirus vaccination card is a wallet-sized card that details your personalcoronavirus vaccineinformation. It's designed to be a helpful reminder for each person who receives the first shot to be aware of when they need to return to get the booster shot.For example, one vaccine may require that you come back three weeks later, while the other may require that you return in a month for the booster.An immunity passport (or vaccine passport) isn't an official US document. Some posit it could serve as an official immunity certificate that would show your immune status after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and allow you to return to normal activities such asinternational travel. Avaccine passportcould take the form of a physical card, a mobile app, a QR code or a sticker on a passport.With an immunity certificate, people could be able to return to the workplace and enter restaurants and stores, for example, and participate in less strict physical distancing measures,according to the Lancet.Currently, immunity passports for coronavirus don't exist, as experts need tolearn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provideunder real-life conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Your two vaccine shots will need to come from the same company.A COVID-19 vaccination card won't be the same as an immunity passport. Instead, it'll serve as a reminder to get your second shot of the vaccine. It also details which vaccine you received -- but that's all. It can't be used for any other purpose. Immunity passportshave been used in other countriesfor different diseases, like polio, to give international travelers the OK to travel. The immunity passports would certify that an individual is immune to the coronavirus and can thengive people more freedom to travel and socializein public.When you receive your first shot, the following information will be on the coronavirus vaccination card.Read more:COVID-19 vaccine is flying high and on dry ice to reach youThe COVID-19 vaccine cards will be used to help medical providers keep track of which vaccine was administered to you, so that you receive the correct second dose from the same vaccine manufacturer.For example, if you receive the Pfizer vaccine in the first shot, you'll need to receive the Pfizer vaccine in the second shot. The same goes with the Moderna vaccine, since the two aren't interchangeable,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(PDF). This is because, while the two vaccines use the same technology thatfocuses on the mRNA of the virus, they're developed differently.Even if you've received the vaccine, you'll still need to wear a mask.No. Even after you receive both doses of the coronavirus vaccine, it's stillrecommended by the CDCthat you continue towear a maskwhile in public and social distance. ""Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide,"" the CDC says, before it can make a decision on when to end mask wearing and social distancing.For more information about the coronavirus vaccine,here's what to know about hidden costs, when you'll get it and how many doses you'll need.

543,Afghanistan: Life in Kabul after the Taliban victory,0.0,46.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58232815,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,bbc,25,"The Taliban captured Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Sunday, 20 years after they were ousted from power. So what does it look and feel like the day after its fall?The Taliban are everywhere, at the checkpoints which used to be official police or army barricades.There is not much panic in the city today, as there was yesterday. The Taliban are controlling traffic, they are searching cars, and they are especially searching those vehicles which used to belong to police and the army, all of which they have confiscated.If there are Taliban fighters themselves driving those vehicles now, they are stopped at checkpoints, too. They told us that they checked these vehicles to make sure they were not looters and thieves disguised as Taliban.The scenes at the airport were catastrophic. On the road there were families, children, young, old, all walking along the 2km (1.2 miles) road. People are struggling to flee this country. Most are just waiting, on the green belt in the middle of the road.I'm talking about more than 10,000 people at the airport. At the approach to the main entrance gates, there were Taliban with heavy weapons trying to disperse people by shooting in the air. People who wanted to get in were climbing the walls, the gates, even the barbed wire. Every single person was pushing to get in.We spoke to an eyewitness who was stuck at the airport on Sunday. He had a flight to go to Uzbekistan, but it didn't happen. Officials then abandoned the airport. People had arrived without any tickets or passports - they thought they could get on any plane and be able to fly to anywhere else in the world, the eyewitness said.Thousands of people were stuck inside the airport, without food or water. There were many women and children - and disabled people, too.But if you go into the city centre, life appears to be normal. There is a lot less traffic, most of the shops are closed. But people look much calmer than yesterday - yesterday, everybody was furious. There was a big traffic gridlock.I've only seen a few women on the street - some single women as well, without escort. Some were wearing blue burkas, but I also saw some wearing surgical face masks and headscarves. And the Taliban seemed alright with them.There is no music on the streets at all.

544,"Natural disasters, a pandemic, and unrest. The National Guard remains busy",1.33,49.33,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2020/09/03/natural-disasters-a-pandemic-and-unrest-the-national-guard-remains-busy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,militarytimes,18,"Fresh off the fire lines in San Bernadino, California, Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Thursday that this year’s fire season is shaping up to be one of the worst on record.“1987 was one of the worst fire seasons on record, and currently they’re on pace to exceed that,” said Hokanson, speaking to reporters. “If you go back to the beginning of fire season earlier this year, within the state of California they burned about 1.6 million acres, which is roughly the size of the state of Delaware.”The fires have destroyed more than 3,200 structures, including homes, and there have been eight deaths. More than 12,400 people remained evacuated Thursday.Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, assistant adjutant general of the California National Guard expressed confidence in the ability of guardsmen in his state to provide sustained response to wildfires.New classes of California Guardsmen are constantly being trained to respond to fires. Last month, a news release reported that more than 270 soldiers began training. Beevers said the Guard is presently training another 550 members who will rotate into the mix of current crews to prevent burnout.In addition to the human resources the Guard provides, Beevers expressed that the 16 bucket helicopters, 4 modular airborne firefighting systems-equipped C-130s, and surveying drones have also been an invaluable resource.More than ### National Guardsmen are currently activated for wildland firefighting missions. (Photo Credit: Master Sgt. Joseph Prouse)“These young airmen are being able to provide incident commanders in the field real time data on the unique behavior of a specific fire,” Beevers said. “They can put fire teams in the right place at the right time.”But the 1,300 soldiers and airmen from five different states activated to fight wildfires on the West Coast are only a sliver of the roughly 64,000 National Guardsmen currently serving domestically and overseas.That’s a significant decrease from June, when COVID-19 and civil unrest pushed numbers to a peak of nearly 120,000 members activated.Despite the workload 2020 has handed guardsmen, Hokanson said the force has remained capable and ready.“At the same time, we met every one of our overseas deployment requirements, and it had no impact there at all,” Hokanson said, referencing the high levels of domestic missions.Of the 64,000 currently activated, more than 18,000 are still tasked with COVID-19 relief missions across all 54 states and territories. Federal support for such missions wasextended until 2021at the beginning of last month.“National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to governors as the governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective states and territories,” President Donald Trump’s executive memorandum stated.Another nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen continue to provide relief to communities in Texas and Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Laura. Airmen on the ground have been working to clear roadways of fallen trees and debris, the Louisiana Air National Guard reported.There are a lot of people in need,” said Senior Airman Alejandro Peralta, a structural engineering journeyman, in a news release. “Hopefully, they are comforted and feel supported when they see the Louisiana Air National Guard working in the area.”This year’s hurricane season has a 60 percent chance of above-normal activity, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,and the season won’t end until Nov. 30.As hurricane and fire seasons continue on opposite coasts, civil unrest also rolls on across the country.Most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Eversrequested out-of-state assistancefor protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake and subsequent killing of two demonstrators.Military police companies from Michigan, Alabama, and Arizona responded.Approximately 150 Arizona National Guard soldiers from the 850th Military Police Battalion mobilized to Wisconsin in response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request Aug. 28, 2020. Arizona is one of three states sending personnel to Wisconsin which are expected to arrive later this evening (Tech. Sgt. Michael Matkin/Air National Guard)While a contingent of Arizona National Guard soldiers returned home from Kenosha, Hokanson said more than 1,200 soldiers and airmen continue to assist state and local law enforcement in various states.“2020 in general kind of proved just what a tremendous value the National Guard is for our nation,” said Hokanson.This story contains information from the Associated Press.Harm Venhuizen is an editorial intern at Military Times.

545,"As Construction Continues Amidst Covid-19 in DC Area, Bezos’ WaPo Raises Few Objections",-16.5,30.5,https://fair.org/home/as-construction-continues-amidst-covid-19-in-dc-area-bezos-wapo-raises-few-objections/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-25,fair,25,"“Insane.” That’s what Marc Gunther thought as he looked out of the window of his downtown Bethesda, Maryland, apartment. Below him, cramped construction crews were building a headquarters and adjoining hotel for Marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain. The $600 million project, which has received $60 million in public funding, is scheduled to be completed in 2022, pandemic or not.Recently, two of the site’s approximately 300 workerstested positivefor coronavirus. After shutting down the site for deep cleaning and implementing enhanced safety measures, work was scheduled toresume this week. Gunther called the resumption of work “nuts” in aMediumpost (4/3/20), headlined “Luxury Condos and Corporate Office Buildings Are Not Worth Dying For.”The day before his post, Gunther had a short letter to the editor published in theWashington Post(4/2/20), the dominant news outlet for the “DMV”—DC, Maryland and Virginia. Gunther’s letter appears to be the only mention in thePostof the dangerous situation at the Marriott site.And it’s not just Marriott getting a pass. Despite thePost’s unique ability to bring about DMV-wide change, the paper has mostly kept quiet about the region’s dangerous construction sites, thereby inviting human tragedy.In a rarePoststory (3/28/20) on the dangers posed by today’s construction sites, officials were given ample space to repeatedly claim all is well: “We can continue to operate safely,” said a spokesperson for general contractors, “and we should.”Workers, meanwhile, are less concerned with “the dangers of contracting coronavirus on the job” than simply having a job, said a union official.Besides, there have been no reports of coronavirus on any city project site, DC officials said, effectively claiming the pandemic miraculously leapfrogged over these potential hotspots.“I work on a construction job site with 150 to 200 others in an environment that is impossible to protect from the coronavirus,” wrote Mike Pitzer, a project manager in the DMV who is risking his job by refusing to work amid the pandemic.In aPostop-ed (4/17/20), Pitzer raised safety concerns thePosthas yet to condemn with its powerful editorial page, or even report on:Most of the workers on our job site are employed by contractors, whose crews include carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, electricians, etc., and their helpers. Some of these subcontractor workers will have commuted in vans with seven or eight others.If the DMV doesn’t follow the lead of other states and ban nonessential construction, the pressure to work will continue to run down the chain of command. If subcontractors don’t work, Pitzer explained:Not only would they lose the revenue, but they also would probably damage important relationships with the bigger contractors who hired them. They also could be at risk for monetary penalties if they don’t complete work by the schedule agreed upon in the contract. And their workers risk being fired if they don’t show up.AnotherPoststory (4/12/20) warns about the “catastrophic” impact the pandemic is likely to have in Langley Park, Maryland, a densely populated, largely Latino community outside DC, where many are undocumented and therefore ineligible for federal stimulus checks or unemployment benefits.While thePostbemoans the harm the pandemic will inflict on Langley Park, the paper is loath to call out those who are exacerbating the situation, such as developers, who are placing profits ahead of the community’s health.ThePoststory profiles Marcos, a 55-year-old who returns from his construction site each day knowingthe risk of bringing the novel coronavirus home with him: home to his daughter with disabilities and a feeding tube in her stomach; home to a 7-year-old son with asthma; home to a wife without legal status and a household where the adults lack health insurance in a neighborhood packed with other vulnerable families.Marcos and his family all sleep together in their living room so they can earn extra money renting out their only bedroom, an arrangement that makes limiting the virus’s spread among family members difficult.Despite “stay at home” orders being in effect throughout the DMV, where the virus death toll has nowtopped 1,000, construction continues, thanks to its being deemed “essential.”“When restaurants, coffee shops, retailers, gyms, barbershops and movie theaters have been shuttered,” Gunther asked in hisMediumpost, “what makes construction so special?”When asked about the “essential” designation for construction, local officialspoint to federal guidelinesthat allow for it, or just as often sayno comment.Not that a comment is needed. The writing is on the walls of the high-end buildings sprouting up.“Our ‘essential’ work,” wrote Pitzer, the project manager, “is constructing a new apartment building—not a bridge, not a road, not a hospital, but new, non-subsidized apartments.” Gentrification is the DMV’s growth industry, and not even a pandemic can mess with profit margins and project timetables.And the DMV’s most high-profile timetable belongs toAmazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns theWashington Post.In northern Virginia, just outside DC, construction ofAmazon’s massivesecond headquarters, HQ2,remains on scheduledespite the pandemic.Alsoon scheduleis construction of a new $390 million concourse at Reagan National airport, located just1,800 feetfrom HQ2’s Crystal City outpost. That’s as the crow flies, although in a few years it’ll be walkable, thanks to a$40 million pedestrian bridgethat, once built, will connect Crystal City and HQ2 directly to the airport.The pedestrian bridge is part of$762 millionin public subsidies Virginia is givingAmazon, a trillion-dollar company, for locating HQ2 in the state. (Amazonmay have ended up in northern Virginia regardless of subsidies, in order to be near the Pentagon and gain a leg up on a $10 billion military contract.)Elsewhere in northern Virginia, the construction of vast data centers is being fast-tracked, withAmazon Web Services(AWS) “lead[ing] the way, as it often does,”Washington Business Journal(4/17/20) reported. “There may be as many as a dozenAWSdata centers under construction now or in the near future in Loudoun alone.”Meanwhile, in DC, “A global pandemic and economic crisis is not slowing down” progress on a 323-unit building anchored by anAmazon-owned Whole Foods store (Bisnow,4/15/20).And in Maryland,Amazonis continuing its rapid growth, as it expands into another “massive new warehouse” (Washington Business Journal,4/17/20).In not calling for the shuttering of DMV construction, thePostis aligning itself with the interests of its owner, the richest person alive (whose wealthincreased by $6.8 billionin just the past week).Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, construction also continues. The state’s governor, RepublicanLarry Hogan, is not only pro-development, but is himself a real estate developer—a fact thePostnow tries to hide.“The governor offeredAmazon, our owner’s company,$8.5 billionto locate HQ2 in his state.”Hogan “wasa suburban real estate developer before becoming governor,” thePost(3/19/20) recently reported (emphasis added). That’s like saying President Trumpwasin the hotel business—a statement thePostwould never make, and rightfully so.Like Trump, Hogan has a company that is named after himself, not held in a blind trust, managed by a family member; also like Trump, he’s continuing to make deals while he’s in office, and potentially benefiting from his official actions (Washington Monthly,1/20).When Hogan designatesreal estateandconstruction(like the Marriott headquarters) essential, is this a conflict of interest? ThePostwon’t ask, even as Hogan rakes in a small fortune from his company, around $2.4 million in just his first three years in office.While Hogan may have personal financial reasons for designating construction “essential,” the health consequences of doing so may be catastrophic.If thePosthighlighted this danger, it would pressure the pro-development governor to shut down construction sites. This appears to be what happened in New York.In stories on the danger of construction sites in the Big Apple, several news sites—unlike theWashington Post—prioritized the views of workers over officials. The difference was dramatic.Workers say “social distancing is a social myth,” read a New YorkDaily Newsstory (3/26/20) that included photos of workers “in dangerously close proximity.” The story quoted hardhats onTwitter: “Put a stop to this now,” said one worker.“Just riding the elevator to where you need to work is like an affront to the whole idea of social distancing,” another worker toldThe City(3/23/20). Like many industry whistleblowers, he remained anonymous, fearing possible retaliation from his employer.“I’m essential to the pocketbooks of rich contractors and essential for spreading the virus, but that’s about it,” electrician Kirk Gibbs told theNew York Times(3/25/20). “They should really shut down these projects for two months…. I’d just hate to see more people die and get sick.”“Construction sites, even during normal times, are notoriously dirty,” theTimesreported.Workers often share a single portable toilet, which rarely has soap or hand sanitizer. Running water is not common…. They share tools, and procedures require that they closely watch over one another.In the wake of reports like these, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed himself and banned nonessential construction.If similar reporting is found in theWashington Post, the DMV could follow New York’s lead and save lives.",1

547,A whistleblower speaks out over excavation of Native sites,-3.0,48.33,https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.12/indigenous-affairs-archaeology-a-whistleblower-speaks-out-over-excavation-of-native-sites,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,hcn,16,"In 2009, while excavating prehistoric artifacts, graduate student archaeologists from the University of California-Davis found Indigenous funerary objects and fragments of human bone. But despite what the law requires, according to internal documents obtained by, the archaeologists kept digging at the site. They continued the excavation, and apparently left a local tribe in the dark about their findings for years.The remains were likely relatives of either the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation or Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians, who are based in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The researchers collected at least 72 fragments and much of a human skull. At the time of this article, officials with the Bureau of Land Management — the agency that approved the digs — had not repatriated the remains, despite requests from tribes. “I haven’t even seen the artifacts and human remains yet,” said Southern Sierra Miwuk Tribal Chairman Bill Leonard. Stephanie Bergman, a former archaeologist at the BLM’s Mother Lode Field Office in El Dorado Hills, California, where the digs were authorized, blew the whistle on what she alleges was misconduct by the university and her former employer.The case illuminates the often-fraught relationship between archaeological study and Indigenous rights, and the BLM’s failure to hold violators accountable. Bergman, who now works for the National Park Service, hopes that her experience will shed light on these issues. Unanswered questions abound, and the BLM has failed to confirm even basic facts. But Bergman providedwith a patchwork of internal documents that reveal a bureaucratic process that can leave tribes disenfranchised when they try to protect their ancestors’ still-buried remains, or recover them once they’re unearthed — especially if that tribe is not federally recognized.those UC Davis students were pulling human remains out of burial sites in the first place. The problems began in June 2009 in the central Sierra Nevada foothills. UC Davis anthropology professor Jelmer Eerkens had a BLM permit to dig on federal land in Mariposa County, where his students hoped to find obsidian artifacts from the Indigenous communities who lived here over 3,000 years ago. Three digs revealed shell beads and a shell pendant, along with fragments of cranium, ribs, scapula, clavicle and other remains of six individuals. They halted some portions of the digs “due to the discovery of human remains,” according to a student dissertation that Bergman acquired. The puzzling part is why they continued with the rest, pulling dozens of bone fragments out of the ground, according to internal emails, rather than immediately stopping so the BLM could consult tribes, as is required by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).Seven years later, in 2016, Eerkens notified the BLM that the students had only just realized, upon closer review in a lab, that they had excavated fragmentary human, not animal, bones. Yet the dissertation claims the students knew they had encountered human remains at those sites, at the time of the digs: “Excavation of three of the units had to be halted … due to the discovery of human remains,” the student wrote. “The remaining six units were excavated.” Both Eerkens and the former graduate student declined to speak with.Following Eerkens’ notification, the BLM sent a letter to inform the Tuolumne Me-Wuk, the closest federally recognized tribe in the area, about the remains. The Tuolumne Me-Wuk suggested contacting the Southern Sierra Miwuk: “We realize that they are not Federally Recognized but are probably the (most likely descendants). If you are not allowed by law to consult with them, we wish to initiate consultation on this matter.”But Southern Sierra Miwuk Chairman Leonard didn’t hear about the issue until 2018. “If there’s no federally recognized tribe in the county, (BLM officials) don’t go through the protocols they should because we don’t have that government-to-government relationship,” he told. In 2018, the two tribes asked that the relatives and funerary objects be repatriated. The agency declined to answer why repatriation has not yet happened.Where are the remains and artifacts now? That’s also murky. Since the excavations occurred on BLM land, the agency has legal control. But spokespeople would not answer questions on the topic. According to Chairman Leonard, his most recent information places the remains at UC Davis. Yet an employee with the university’s anthropology museum toldthe remains are not there. Bergman, the former BLM archaeologist, says that Eerkens explained during a meeting in 2018 that he had at least some of them in his personal possession — even though federal law requires storage in a federally approved facility. “I was thinking, ‘Are these things in his garage, and how many does he have?’ ” Bergman recalled.that issues with the university’s field school — and the BLM’s permitting and consultation practices — continued well past 2009. In the summer of 2010, the school planned more fieldwork in Mariposa County. “I know that this type of information is very valuable to research and it will help others to understand our ancestors and their way of life,” wrote Tuolumne Me-Wuk Cultural Director Stanley Cox in a letter to the BLM before the digs began. “But we cannot condone excavating archeological sites just in the name of research so a graduate student can make a name for themselves.” The letter was dated a week past the Archaeological Resources Protection Act deadline to air grievances.The crunched timeline was a pattern, according to Bergman. Both she and her predecessor, now an archaeologist in Wyoming, received last-minute permit proposals from UC Davis that left less than the legally required 30 days for tribal consultation. “I think they were doing this knowing that I/the BLM/ wouldn't have time to scrutinize the application, nor would the tribes,” Bergman later wrote in an internal complaint. “I was too new and too busy to question it all or know the difference.” It’s unclear how the archaeologists responded to the Tuolumne Me-Wuks’ letter, or whether burials were found that summer, but the BLM did authorize a permit.If any field schools took place between 2010 and 2016, records for these projects were missing, as of a 2018 internal BLM investigation.In the summer of 2017, part of a human skull was unearthed in Mariposa County when a wildfire crew bulldozed an area in response to a blaze. The sheriff was notified, as is standard procedure. A deputy called Leonard, who quickly came to the site, and together they found the cranium. “We prayed over it and put it back in the ground,” Leonard told. Two months after Leonard reinterred the remains, the BLM authorized UC Davis to excavate at the same site, according to site numbers on the research proposal and other documents. It’s unclear whether that dig took place or why the agency authorized work at a site known to have human remains.The BLM also apparently approved a “human remains discovery protocol” that year on how to handle inadvertently discovering burials. The protocol, submitted by a UC Davis researcher, provides a window into where the process may be breaking down, stating: “Upon discovery of human remains, excavation in the unit of discovery will cease immediately. … While the protocol for human remains discovery is being undertaken, work will continue at the site in areas away from the unit where the human remains were discovered.” This policy received mixed reviews from several experts in archaeology and cultural resource law — perhaps a reflection of varying interpretations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.One California archaeologist said it seemed like standard procedure — that NAGPRA only requires excavation to urgently stop in the burial’s immediate area, not necessarily at the entire site. Other legal experts were alarmed. Leonard and his two predecessors told me it would be highly unusual to let archaeologists continue digging anywhere near a burial. For her part, Bergman emailed her supervisors about the UC Davis protocol: “(It) gives the field school and the BLM the authority to not comply to NAGPRA.” She sent her concerns to Emily Palus, at the time deputy division chief of cultural resources for the entire BLM. Palus toldover the phone that she did have concerns about the “university’s write-up” and “per protocol, I contacted Tony Overly, the BLM cultural lead in the (California) state office.” The BLM did not answerHCN’s multiple requests to interview Overly.archaeologist in 2018, Bergman had to review requests from developers, researchers and anyone else whose work on BLM land might have archaeological impacts. Within a week of her new job, she noticed unresolved questions regarding the UC Davis field school. Bergman, who was concerned when she heard burials had been excavated in 2009, couldn’t find much documentation of previous field schools. But while searching the office, she discovered something else disconcerting. “Stephanie (Bergman) was … reviewing our very old files on this, dating back to the late 1990s,” then-field manager Bill Haigh wrote in an email to colleagues. “While doing so she discovered a plastic bag filled with what appear to be human remains. In our files. Related to the first (UC Davis) field school.” The bag was labeled with the name of a former field office archeologist from the ’90s and stored with a folder labeled “NA Remains.” Bergman never learned what became of the remains.Bergman began to worry that this was more than just a single mistake by a well-meaning graduate student or overworked BLM manager — that it was an ongoing problem. Weeks before the field school was to start that summer, Bergman convinced her superiors to deny UC Davis any new fieldwork permits. She then complained to the Office of Inspector General about the constellation of issues surrounding the BLM’s archaeological permitting practices — from apparently allowing burial excavations in 2009, to the bag of bones at the office. OIG officials kicked her complaint to the BLM. The land agency completeda basic review of recordsrelated to the complaint, as well as a rigorous law enforcement investigation of its employees’ conduct. One of the investigative reports, whichobtained, said documentation of 2009, 2010 and 2017 digs was missing from the BLM’s files. “There are no field maps, field notes, artifact catalogs, locational data, periodic updates or a final report in the files,” Colorado BLM archaeologist Daniel Haas said in the report. “The permit records do not show that reporting was completed in a timely fashion, if at all.” Haas noted that the principal investigator on the BLM permit, likely the professor in this case, needed to provide more oversight of graduate student fieldwork in the future.The BLM also referred the case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Sacramento. Experts say it can be difficult to convince federal attorneys to take on NAGPRA or ARPA cases. “Crimes of violence, common law crime, people hurting people, those are easy (for federal attorneys) to see as important,” said David Barland-Liles, a National Park Service law enforcement manager and National NAGPRA Office Investigator. “But crimes against resources, particularly resources of a cultural nature … presenting those to the U.S. Attorney’s Office — those are harder sells.” A public information officer with the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento declined to comment on whether they investigated the case. By October 2019, the “BLM Director” referred the case to the California state director for “administrative action,” according to internal emails. It’s not clear whether California BLM did take any internal disciplinary actions.The only repercussions the university archaeologists faced appear to be a letter from the BLM. In 2018, the agency drafted a missive, noting that the school had violated the terms of its Archaeological Resources Protection Act permits, as well as NAGPRA. In June 2020,asked the BLM about the status of the letter, whichHCNobtained. Three weeks later, in July, the agency issued afinalized letterto Eerkens, requiring him to send reports and deposit the ancestral remains and funerary objects at an approved curatorial facility this fall. “The BLM is assessing the adequacy of the University’s performance with regards to the permits,” Martha Maciel, a public information officer at the time, wrote in an email. “The BLM will work to bring it into conformance.”At the time of this article, the agency did not respond to multiple requests to interview James Barnes, who helped shepherd the UC Davis permits in 2009 and 2010, and is now head of California BLM’s tribal relations. Calls to the Tuolumne Me-Wuk have also gone unanswered. Eerkens toldby email that the Tuolumne Me-Wuk are “working with the BLM” regarding the remains and objects excavated in 2009, “and out of respect to the tribe and their ancestors, they asked me not to talk about this further. I apologize.” Eerkens did not mention the Southern Sierra Miwuk, whose territory his graduate students excavated.“It is difficult to fathom archaeologists did not know they were excavating a Native American burial.”, the real problem underlying this tangled mess is that his tribe is not federally recognized. “If we were recognized, the BLM couldn’t dodge us,” he told me. Since 1982, the tribe has actively sought recognition. The U.S. government said in its latest rebuff that the Southern Sierra Miwuk do not constitute a modern “community.” Being unrecognized means the tribe isn’t always protected under federal archaeology laws. It must work alongside a recognized tribe in order to participate in the consultation that the BLM is required to do before archaeological digs.“We have to go to our big brother over in Tuolumne or someone else and say, ‘Hey (the government is) picking on me.’ ” Leonard said. In the case of the Mariposa County excavations, the Tuolumne Me-Wuk Tribe is assisting in the stalled repatriation process. “We’re fortunate to have a tribe there to help us. … Without them we’d have been just bulldozed over in a sense.”Without recognition, Leonard also can’t access various funding sources for administrative staff. That makes consultation nearly impossible. “Even when they say you have the right to participate, yeah, it’s kind of like access to health insurance. You can buy it if you’ve got enough money,” Leonard said. “(The BLM will) pick a tiny spot out of thousands of acres and then say, ‘What are your concerns?’ ” Leonard said with a shrug. That kind of question takes time and resources to answer — two things he has in short supply. This is a problem not just for the tribe, but for the BLM, whose attempts at consultation can fail if the tribal chairman is unable to respond.Over the years, however, Leonard said, working with universities and the federal government on archaeology and repatriation has gotten “a lot better.” While the BLM process is still challenging, he’s optimistic that the issue of the Mariposa County excavations will be resolved. He received a letter from the BLM this summer that said the agency wanted to conduct tribal consultation. Bergman, meanwhile, left the BLM in frustration over how she says her superiors handled these issues. Leonard spoke with the new archaeologist at the Mother Lode Field Office a few months ago and was encouraged by her attitude. “I think we’re going to have different results in the future,” he said. Until Leonard gets his ancestors back, he’ll be banking on promises. “I felt like she was going to make sure that these things didn’t happen in the futureAs long as she was there.”High Country Newsin California.EmailHCNat[email protected]or submit aletter to the editor.",2
548,"Jalen Rose’s ‘Tokenism’ Comments About White Player Are A Problem, But The Double Standard Is The Real Issue",10.67,34.0,https://www.dailywire.com/news/jalen-roses-tokenism-comments-about-white-player-are-a-problem-but-the-double-standard-is-the-real-issue,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,dailywire,25,"Last week on “Jalen & Jacoby,” ESPN host Jalen Roseclaimedthat the reason Kevin Love — a white player — was selected to the roster of the U.S. Olympic basketball team was because of “tokenism.” He then went on to say that he was “disappointed” in the selection committee for being “scared to make an all-black team representing the United States of America.”It may have been a “hot take,” but it wildly missed the mark. The implication was that the only reason Love was selected was because of the color of his skin, and that the selection committee would somehow be uncomfortable with an all-black Olympic team roster.On Sunday, Rose “apologized” for his comments in a 42-minute Instagram video.“If I feel like Kevin Love should make the team or not, I’m entitled to my opinion,” Rosesaid, as reported by Fox News. “You don’t have to like my opinion, you don’t have to like me. There’s a lot of people trying to assassinate my character or whatever, but those people, some of them, have been trying to for like 30 years … that’s how it is when you have the nerve in a lot of peoples’ estimation to be outspoken.”“But you know why I’m apologizing right now? To the game. Because I’m what the game made me,” he continued. “I was raised by the all-time greats and you know what I would never want to do? Disappoint [Rose’s late mother] Jeanie Rose or disappoint the all-time greats that raised me.”That’s not an apology, but that’s really not what we should be focusing on. While I didn’t like what Rose had to say, I’m also against cancel culture, so firing Rose is not a valid option.The real crux of the issue is that Rose is comfortable saying racially charged words on a major show on the largest sports network around.Exactly, Jalen. But while we should all be able to disagree, this simply isn’t the case.If the roles were reversed, with a white person speaking about a black player in the same manner, he or she would be immediately removed — live on-air — and fired. That individual would never work in sports again.And yet — based on the history of ESPN and their handling of similar situations — it’s doubtful that Rose even needed to apologize for his words. In fact, Rose made it clear in his video that no one pressured him to apologize.For example, in 2020, ESPN football analyst Domonique Foxworth went on Bomoni Jones’ podcast and discussed why he rootsagainstBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.I am fully aware that I have biases… And my biases are not based on Josh Allen, it’s based on the people defending Josh Allen. I would be 100% lying if I said when Josh does something dumb, a little part of me doesn’t get happy. It is not because I don’t want Josh to succeed, it’s because the people who are telling me that Josh is the ‘second coming’, and Josh is better than everybody, are people with American flags, and dogs, and skulls and crossbones in their avi’s, and when you go take a dip into their tweet history there’s some really concerning retweets and likes.Foxworth’s offensive comments were called out by Fox Sports’ Clay Travis, yet the backlash didn’t result in any punishment for Foxworth.“Statements like these are fundamentally unfair and unbelievably stupid, and not to mention racist, let’s be honest here,” Travissaid. “If any white ESPN analyst said he roots against Lamar Jackson because of the people who root for Lamar Jackson he would be fired on the spot, and it would be a major national story…”Travis alluded to the hypocrisy of ESPN, allowing some to say whatever thought comes to mind while others constantly face pressure to toe the company line.“We can’t have a marketplace of ideas where some people are allowed to say whatever they want, and other people are not able to say whatever THEY want. If you’re not going to condemn stupidity across the board, regardless of who is being stupid, then you are fundamentally failing in your analysis of any argument…” Travis added.But we no longer live in a world where the rules are applied equally to everyone, regardless of race or creed.What Rose said is undeniably offensive. However, the real issue is that he felt comfortable enough to say it on ESPN in the first place.Joe Morgan is the Sports Reporter for The Daily Wire.

Susan Collins defeated Democratic challenger Sara Gideon in Maine, facing down a brutal reelection battle to win a fifth term in the Senate, where she has served since 1996.READ:Collins bested Gideon, 51% to 42% with 85% of the vote counted, in a race called by The Associated Press on Wednesday afternoon.Notably, the political arena Collins was last reelected into in 2014 was far different than today's, andDonald Trump's tenure proved an uphill battle for Collins from the moment he was sworn into office. Her vote against his nomination of Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, which forced Vice PresidentMike Penceto cast an unprecedented tie-breaking vote to secure her confirmation, perhaps foretold the difficult position she'd find herself in again and again.Being one of the last surviving moderate Republicans in the Senate meant walking a political tightrope, and the votes she cast were often one of the deciding votes on the country's most pressing matters.When Collins cast a vote in support of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court justice in 2019, after a bruising confirmation process in which he was accused of sexual assault, many saw the move as the last straw for a once-moderate who had become just another 'Yes Man' for the Republican Party, or worse yet, the president.The vote tethered her to Trump like none other, and she found it difficult to distance herself enough to reclaim her stature as a moderate, independent thinker – a view challenged again when she cast a deciding vote not to impeach the president.Collins' consequential votes fueled record-breaking donations to Gideon's campaign, which raised more than $70 million when all was said and done, more than double the $27 million Collins raised. The race was the most expensive in Maine's history.[READ:Democracy Demographics: The data behind the votes]Importantly, Collins didn't havecoronavirushanging over her head like so many of her other Republican colleagues in tough reelection bids. Unlike many other states where the pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy and disrupted daily life – and where Republicans are facing difficult contests as a result – Maine has been successful in facing down the virus, in large part by restricting visitors to the state and enforcing other public safety measures.Moreover, Collins is in line to become chairwoman of the powerful Appropriations Committee should Republicans maintain control of the Senate, a point some political prognosticators said might convince enough voters to stick with her, understanding that it could mean additional federal support for the state.Even still, polling in October foretold just how problematic her record had become for Maine voters, and the state's ranked-choice voting process, in which late-October polls forecasted about 6% of voters planned to support the two independent candidates, was thought to tip the scales in Gideon's favor.MORE:Gideon, who is currently the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, ran on a record of pushing legislation to address poverty and the opioid crisis, expand broadband internet access and create a public option for Medicare.Collins' win will help Republicans maintain control of the Senate, though a handful of other close races that could catapult Democrats to the majority haven't yet been called.",2

552,Exclusive — Pence: Biden's ‘Bad Policy’ Could Derail Pandemic Recovery,18.67,25.0,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2021/07/18/exclusive-mike-pence-bidens-bad-policy-threatens-short-circuit-american-recovery/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,breitbart,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat President Joe Biden’s “bad policy,” including his $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package and massive new spending proposals under consideration in Congress, could derail economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Pence’s comments came in a wide-ranging interview Friday evening about the Biden agenda and the upcoming midterm elections at the Family Leadership Summit after he gave remarks to a crowd of about a thousand Christian conservatives in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. While Pence has made a number of speeches since leaving office on January 20 this year, this interview with Breitbart News is his first since he left office.“The extension of, the plus-up on unemployment benefits by the Biden administration has worked a real hardship on small businesses and our recovery,” Pence said. “Look, this economy started to recover in the summer of 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the American people and the rightness of our agenda. With tax cuts, and rolling back regulations, and unleashing American energy, and America First trade deals, we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created 7 million jobs. I believe it also was the foundation on which America has made this historic recovery and in so many ways what the Biden administration has done and continues to do — and adding to that they’re pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largest spending bill in American history — I think what the Biden administration is doing threatens to short-circuit the American recovery we all long to see and that is underway. It is. But I think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets are starting to respond to the big government solutions — higher taxes, more regulation — being planned and coming out of this administration. That’s why we got to fight back and fight back hard.”Pence said he is “incredibly proud” of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for holding House Republicans together “in opposing the radical left agenda of [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.” He pointed specifically to that $1.9 trillion coronavirus spending plan, passed in March along purely partisan lines in both the U.S. House and Senate, that extended the newly-created federal unemployment benefits program that, at the beginning of the pandemic, supplemented similar state benefits. Combined, the federal and state benefits collected together could often pay people more to not work than to actually work — something that has led to small businesses like restaurants and stores across America having trouble hiring employees. The federal government never before offered supplemental unemployment insurance benefits. But, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration — with support on a bipartisan basis in Congress — passed such benefits. The program, meant to be temporary as the government was literally telling people to stay home and not work, was extended as part of the partisan plan Biden pushed at the beginning of his presidency. Pence ripped Biden for turning this into a partisan matter.“Even in the early vote on COVID [Chinese coronavirus] relief, they were able to stand united in opposition to a massive spending bill which really was a betrayal of the whole posture our administration had taken during the pandemic with regard to Congress,” Pence said. “Every bill we passed for COVID in Congress passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. We said we’re going to check politics at the door. Everything we did, everything we did was bipartisan. For President Biden and [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi right out of the gate to abandon the bipartisan precedent we had established in combatting the coronavirus pandemic I thought was a betrayal of everything we’d done to bring the Congress together around a united effort to end the pandemic.”It is not just the economic recovery that Biden is bungling, though, Pence said. When it comes to the vaccine, Pence said Biden should give former President Donald Trump and the previous administration credit for developing the vaccine — and getting the rollout up to speed — as there were a million shots a day being administered by the time Trump and Pence left office. Pence said that he does believe Americans generally see through Biden’s politicization of the pandemic.“I couldn’t be more proud of what the American people accomplished over the last year and a half,” Pence said. “Only in America, in the face of a global pandemic, could we reinvent testing from a standing start and do a billion tests within a matter of months. Only in America could you stand up a supply chain and enlist companies to manufacture medical company [sic] and fly medical equipment from all around the world so that no American was ever denied the healthcare that they need facing this pandemic. And only in America could you have the kind of research companies and the kind of innovation at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] that would permit the development of therapeutics and vaccines within nine months. We when we first sat down, when I first became head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we called all of the heads of all of the major pharmaceutical and research companies in — we were in the Cabinet Room. I remember the President asking them how long it would take to get a vaccine? Vaccines take five to seven years, if you can get one. We all said ‘not good enough — what do you need? What needs to happen?’ And that’s where the idea of clearing the way for FDA review and approval without shortcutting safety measures and initiating the idea for Operation Warp Speed because early on we were hearing that several of these vaccines showed very promising returns in the early Phase One trials. We just made the decision we’ll pay you to go ahead and manufacture millions of doses so that, if it’s approved, we won’t wait another year for you to manufacture. The combination of all of those things is an American accomplishment”“The fact that the Biden-Harris administration, that spent much of the campaign talking down a vaccine developed under the Trump-Pence administration, now has seen its way clear to ignore our administration’s efforts is disappointing but not surprising,” Pence lamented. “The thing is, I think the American people see through it. Everywhere I go—today I had a man come alongside me at a picnic I was at in Western Iowa. It was tough. He told me he lost his wife to COVID. But he wanted to express his appreciation to me. I was very moved. I told him ‘I’ll be praying for you and I’m very sorry for your loss.’ He said ‘I just still wanted to thank you for what you’ve done and what the vaccine has meant for other people.’ I just honestly believe the Biden-Harris administration would do well to give credit where credit is due, first to the American people and second to efforts of a prior administration to demonstrate everything we’ve accomplished putting the health of the American people first in this pandemic is a tribute to the American people and American innovation and only in America could we be at a place where we are today where America is coming back and we’re seeing life returning to normal. I flew out to my daughter’s wedding not long ago and couldn’t barely get through the airport and I just found myself walking through the airport thinking ‘Only in America.’”With the upcoming midterm elections, Pence said that Republicans can turn the tide and slam the door shut on the Biden agenda. To retake the U.S. House majority, Republicans only need to flip a net five seats from Democrat hands into GOP hands and, to retake the Senate majority, the GOP only needs to flip a net one seat.“We’ve seen this movie before. I was in Congress in 2010 with a Democrat president, a Democrat Senate, and a Democrat House,” Pence said. “What we did was we brought Republicans together around a unified conservative agenda and we stood strong against the Pelosi majority and we won 63 seats in the House of Representatives in 2010. We won the Senate a few years later and the White House two years after that. I think we’re going to do it all again in the next three and a half years.”Pence said he is noticing “buyer’s remorse across America” with regard to Democrat control in Washington and the Biden agenda.“I heard about it today when I was in western Iowa,” Pence said. “One of the families I met with spoke of a friend who voted for the Biden-Harris ticket and now admitted she was wrong. People see that what Biden is attempting to do is not advance kind of traditional Democrat policies but is literally trying to transform the country into a European-style welfare state.”Pence then called one Biden administration proposal — the implementation of an international minimum corporate tax rate, whereby other countries and the United States would agree to tax entities at the same levels at least and the U.S. would essentially be handing control over tax rates over to some international community entity — “downright un-American.”“You look at the international minimum corporate tax rate that is being orchestrated and discussed with powers around the country that I think is unconstitutional — the power to tax falls squarely with the government and the power to initiate taxes falls squarely with the United States House of Representatives,” Pence said. “The idea that the Treasury Secretary or the Biden administration could negotiate with President Macron to establish a minimum corporate tax rate that would be imposed on our companies is downright un-American. But I think your point is well taken that what the administration is advancing is agenda that is destined to short-circuit the economy but more than that it’s an attempt to transform America into a fundamentally different place than it’s ever been before.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this past week that he intends to try to force a vote on the so-called “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” — for which there still is no bill text — this coming week in the U.S. Senate. Combined with that, the Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are backing a separate but parallel plan that would spend another $3.5 trillion through reconciliation — which allows them to use a budget gimmick to pass bills out of the Senate with a simple majority. Pence warned his Republican friends in the U.S. Senate against going along with this plan.“With regard to the infrastructure bill, I will just tell you during my years in Congress I always thought it was good to let your yes be yes and let your no be no,” Pence said. “And I’d rather Republicans in the Senate simply made it clear that unless all the Green New Deal stuff is out, they’re not voting for an infrastructure bill. I think there is great risk in a two-bill strategy that could result in us seeing them advance the radical left’s climate change agenda. I would encourage Republicans to think really hard before going along with a first infrastructure bill as it might pave the way for policies that have very little to do with infrastructure but will stifle American prosperity for generations.”Pence also, as he did in his speech here, told Breitbart News about how during the Trump administration the United States became energy independent — and a net exporter of energy — for the first time in 70 years. But, he said, Biden has already undermined that.“America is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” Pence said. “This administration, with its climate change agenda, has set itself against the American people permitting to use the resources of our land in an environmentally responsible way. But what’s incomprehensible to me is that President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline but approved the Russian pipeline to western Europe. Think about that? One of your first acts in office is to kill a natural gas pipeline in the United States of America — one that had been tied up for years, one that we cleared the way on, and one that would add to our energy infrastructure — and then to allow Nordstream 2 to go forward? We have tens of thousands of troops in western Europe ostensibly under the mission of NATO protecting Europe from Russian aggression. The idea that they would now pave the way for European countries to become dependent on Russia for natural gas — it’s incomprehensible to me. What we ought to be doing is seeing our European trading partners building ports to be able to import natural gas from the United States of America. Again, what you’re seeing is I think an administration that’s lapsing back into the bad policy decisions of the past and they were policy decisions that the American people were glad to see our administration overturn to the benefit of an incredible boom economy before the coronavirus pandemic struck.”Pence also ripped the Biden administration — and specifically his successor as vice president, Kamala Harris — for mishandling the border crisis.“The Biden-Harris administration took the most secure border in American history and has turned it into the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime,” Pence said. “Suspending construction on the wall, ending the policies that we put into effect that had ended asylum abuse, I thought it was one of the signature accomplishments of our administration. President Trump tapped me and Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo to sit down in the Roosevelt Room and negotiate out an agreement that anyone applying for asylum in the United States would be required to remain in Mexico. It had been talked about for years and years and in the early years of our administration the Mexicans were only allowing it on a fraction of their border, so President Trump said ‘we’re going to tariff everything coming across the border from Mexico unless you agree to the remain in Mexico policy.’ The secretary of state and I sat down with the Mexican foreign minister and the ambassador and, over the course of several days, we negotiated and secured a remain in Mexico agreement for the entire southern border. That, which essentially ended catch and release on the southern border, sent a message to the northern triangle countries of Central America that the opportunity to game the system was over.”",0

""We opposed this shocking violation of privacy, alongside many victims’ rights advocates.""Uber disclosed the existence of thousands of sexual assaults nationwide in its2019 safety report. Afterward, the CPUC demanded detailed information about cases that occurred in California—including the time and place where assaults happened and names and contact information of witnesses. The CPUC order doesn't specifically ask for the names of victims. However, in many cases the victim would be the only witness, so CPUC was essentially seeking to unmask hundreds of sexual assault victims.Uber objected, noting that most of the victims had not consented to have their identities or stories shared with third parties. Even if the records were kept confidential, Uber argued, a CPUC investigation of these cases could force victims to revisit one of the most traumatic moments in their lives.In a revised order, the CPUC allowed Uber to submit the information under seal to ensure that the data did not become public. But beyond that, the CPUC refused to budge, issuing a second order in January demanding that Uber turn over the data.Victims' rights groups like the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN) rallied to Uber's defense. ""RAINN is exceedingly concerned that the Commission's ruling"" directs Uber to ""share a list of victim names, contact information, and additional incident details with the Commission, without the consent of the victims,"" the group wrote in an August filing with the CPUC.""The vast majority of sexual assault victims choose not to report to police,"" RAINN added. ""Surely, they never envisioned that a state regulatory commission would require disclosure of information that they, themselves, have explicitly decided to not share with the state.""RAINN argued that enforcement of the CPUC's demands would ""nullify each victim's right to decide when, and to whom, to disclose their assault"" and would ""risk re-traumatization of victims.""But the CPUC seemed unmoved by these arguments, whether they came from Uber or from groups like RAINN. In aMonday ruling, the agency held that ""this decision does not require thedisclosure of such information that could potentially traumatize the victims a second time."" Instead, the agency reasoned, the rules ""require only that the information regarding sexual assaults and sexual harassment be submitted to the Commission under seal.""The CPUC concluded that Uber had ""refused, without any legitimate legal or factual grounds, to comply"" with the data request. The agency held that Uber's actions were particularly severe because they had ""harmed the regulatory process.""In setting a fine, the CPUC is supposed to consider whether a party's actions were in the public interest. But in Uber's case, the agency concluded that ""there are no facts to mitigate the degree of Uber's wrongdoing."" So the CPUC slapped Uber with a harsh $59 million penalty.Ironically, after hitting Uber with a massive fine for refusing to name sexual assault victims, the ruling allows Uber to submit its data in anonymized form.""Uber shall work with the Commission's staff to develop a code or numbering system as a substitute for the actual names and other personally identifiable information"" of victims and witnesses to assault cases, the ruling said.Uber seems to be the only taxi or ride-hailing service that has faced these kinds of questions from the CPUC. The company's decision to publish statistics about sexual assault and other crimes against its passengers set a new standard for transparency, but the report seems to have attracted extra scrutiny from California regulators.""These punitive and confusing actions will do nothing to improve public safety and will only create a chilling effect as other companies consider releasing their own reports,"" Uber said in its statement. ""Transparency should be encouraged, not punished.""",2
557,When is it time to cut off a toxic family member?,-2.67,37.33,https://www.mic.com/p/when-is-it-time-to-cut-off-a-toxic-family-member-43101998,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,mic,25,"We are living in divisive times. This is both a cliche and massive understatement. Most people have family members who that they disagree with about politics, social justice, or coronavirus safety, and the pressure cooker of the pandemic has really brought tensions to a boil for a lot of us. As a vocally radical queer person who grew up in a conservative home, I have had some interactions with family that left me feeling so wounded that I wondered if it’s psychologically healthy for me to continue to talk to them. As the holiday season approaches, I’m confident that others have this issue on their minds as well, so I asked experts how to figure out when it’s time tocut a toxic family member of your life.It’s worth noting that any relationship comes with some inherent discomfort. “Some might say that the more closely connected you are with someone, the greater the risk of conflict,” says Sara Stanizai, a California-based psychotherapist who works with queer, transgender, and bicultural communities. However, Stanizai explains, discomfort is different from abuse, and discerning the difference is critical for your own emotional wellbeing. But it may be hard to tell the difference when tempers are high or feelings are hurt.Know that when you argue with a family member, about politics especially, there is a spectrum of how ""healthy"" the discourse is. You can be respectfully heated, but when it borderlines on toxic comments and behavior, it's problem worth addressing. “The hallmark for defining abuse is there is a noticeable, pervasive pattern,” Satnizai says. “This doesn't mean it happens all the time, but it begins to be predictable.” For example, she says, there’s a pattern if you can expect the same type of criticism about multiple areas of your life from someone or if they are continually hyper focusing on one subject and constantly finding many things wrong with it.I, for instance, have a family member who is always talking about “the gays.” One minute it may be, “the gays want to make us all gay,” and five minutes later she might make a comment like, “gay people spread disease.” It’s like she’s always trying to finding away to talk about how terrible gay people are, even though I am one of them. This is not a debate. It's abusive behavior.Another hallmark of abusive relationships is a lack of accountability. If you tell someone that something they said or did hurt you, and they don’t care, that’s a problem that could be another sign of abuse, says Stanizai. And it might be time to assert your needs more directly. She recommends, however, giving someone a chance to apologize and make amends before you assume that they won’t. It's tempting to just ignore the behavior, but that will likely just dig you into a deeper, more painful hole in the long run.When you’re feeling hurt, it can be really hard to speak up for yourself. You may need to set some boundaries between yourself and the person who’s hurt you before you can do that. That’s okay. But eventually, if you want to try to heal the relationship, you are going to have to have a difficult conversation, says Stanizai. If the other person avoids the conversation or taking responsibility for their own words or actions, then it may be time to set new limits.If you aren't making leeway with this person who has a pattern of hurting you, you can choose a level of ""cutting them off."" Discarding them completely is not the only option. There are degrees of separation you can create that may allow you to feel safer. “This can mean limiting time to them only in groups, or only for certain occasions, or for 1-2 hours at a time,” she says. If it feels safe, try to give someone more than one chance to apologize. Being confronted often makes people feel defensive, and continually offering olive branches is a disarming maneuver that can benefit everyone. “When someone feels that you are giving them an honest chance, they are more likely to listen to your side too,” Stanizai adds.Now, if there is no circumstance in which you may feel emotionally safe with someone, explore that, discuss it with a trusted person in your life, and then own it. It might not last forever, but this is your current reality. You do not have to spend time with abusive people. If you find yourself truly activated by someone — meaning that contact with them induces a panic attack or a mental health episode, Stanizai explains — then it may be time to really cut ties. ""It's perfectly fine to skip the family BBQ or keep your distance from someone altogether,” she says.Ultimately, managing a conflicted relationship with a family member is not a black and white problem and there are no black or white solutions. If you decide to stop talking to someone, you can change your mind later if it feels safe for you. The most important thing is that you continue to bolster your own sense of agency.Having a sense of control in your relationships is not about controlling other people, it’s about feeling like you get to have control over yourself. Speaking up for yourself when someone hurts you may feel hard, Stanizai says, but it can help you take control of the narrative.",1

The study notes that American citizens may rank as high as third globally when it comes to coastal plastic pollution. Data suggests that more than half of the plastic collected for recycling in the U.S. has been exported to developing countries that are already struggling to manage plastic waste adequately, effectively masking the U.S.'s brutal contribution to plastic waste. The analysis found that U.S. plastic waste input into its coastal environment was between 0.51 and 1.45 million metric tons.Despite comprising only 4% of the global population, the United States is responsible for 17% of its plastic waste. The study estimated that on average, each American generates as much as 287 pounds of plastic waste per person each year, while the Brits slightly trail at 218 pounds.",1
559,"Chris Wallace, We Were In Kenosha. White Supremacists Didn't Cause Violence",20.8,26.2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/01/dear-chris-wallace-we-were-in-kenosha-and-no-white-supremacists-and-militias-didnt-cause-violence,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-01,thefederalist,25,"If Chris Wallace’s goal during Tuesday night’s debate was to deflect from the months of left-wing violence from Black Lives Matter extremists and Antifa and instead blame it on President Donald Trump and his supporters, he did an excellent job.“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups,” Wallace, the debate moderator, said to Trump. “But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland?”Ignoring for a moment that Trump’s criticism of Joe Biden was absolutely warranted and that Wallace asked Trump to condemn white supremacists but did not ask Biden to condemn Black Lives Matter arsonists and looters, the question itself was specious. The violence in Kenosha was spurred by left-wing extremist groups, not white supremacists. We know — becausewe were there.Kenosha was up in flames, reduced to the same lawlessness that swept Minneapolis, Portland, Atlanta, and now this small Midwest town. Monday night in Kenosha, a day after law enforcement shot Jacob Blake, men and women stood with baseball bats and guns in front of their businesses and homes, trying to defend themselves against the extremist violence of the Black Lives Matter left. Since there weren’t enough police to control the situation, officers focused on defending public buildings, such as the courthouse, while leaving citizens to fend for themselves.A woman, who said she had lived in Kenosha for more than 40 years, broke down in tears, saying her city felt like a “war zone” and she was “terrified.”A woman, who said she has lived in Kenosha for over 40 years, broke down in tears saying that her city felt like a “war zone” and she was “terrified”. She requested that her face not be shown.pic.twitter.com/zi9KLQc2Xz— The Federalist (@FDRLST)August 25, 2020According to locals and reporting, the violence was caused byout-of-state agitators. On Thursday, local and federal law enforcement officials stopped anout-of-state caravanof vehicles filled with fuel cans and illegal fireworks. “The vehicles contained various items, including helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, and suspected controlled substances,” according to police, who arrested nine people for disorderly conduct.The vehicles were reportedly connected to the Seattle-based Riot Kitchen, a group of radical-left protesters. While severalmainstream media accountsportrayed the group as friendly helpers, the stories couldn’t explain why they were loading up so many cans of gas and why the Riot Kitchen crew fled from police.Sam, an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership downtown, lost “every dime” he had, and the 20 people Sam employed have all lost their jobs “for nothing.” Sam said his family had been “in tears” for days after rioters burned his lot two nights in a row, destroying all the cars, and looting his office before burning that as well.Sam is an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership that was destroyed by BLM arsonists. “What did we do to deserve all this?” said Sam.pic.twitter.com/hgDjbIq9pA— The Federalist (@FDRLST)August 29, 2020“I’m a taxpayer,” said Sam, distraught that law enforcement did nothing to protect his business, which was left to the mercy of the mob. “This is not the America I came into. … What did we do to deserve all this?” he asked. “I’m a minority too. I’m a brown person. I have nothing to do with this.”Contrary to what Wallace implied, neither did white supremacists or militia groups. Black Lives Matter rioters were in fact proud to take credit. Sam told The Federalist that more than a week after the Blake shooting, Black Lives Matter rioters came back to his shop in broad daylight to make “music videos” in the wreckage of his business “like they were so proud of it,” taunting him with, “this is what you get.”Desperate pleasfor mercy from the rioters confirmed who was instigating the violence. If business owners were trying to avoid losing everything to white supremacists, they wouldn’t have displayed placards signaling support for BLM and signs reading “minority-owned” in their storefronts — yet that’s exactly what they did.Like many other media figures and Democrats, Wallace seemed to be cherry-picking one instance of violence from a demonstrator linked to the political right, at the expense of accurately covering the rampant lawlessness instigated by leftist extremists.Kyle Rittenhousebecame the face of so-called right-wing violence in Kenosha.Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Hispanic boy who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha, saw the destruction and violence and picked up his AR-15 to patrol the streets. In a video shot around 10 p.m., Rittenhouse explained his purpose, saying, “People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there’s somebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”Later that night, things escalated when three shootings left two people dead and another injured. Police apprehended Rittenhouse, the alleged shooter. Videos capturing the shootings suggest Rittenhouse might have been justified in self-defense.Whether Rittenhouse, an Illinois native, belonged in Kenosha in the first place is debatable, but nothing suggests the boy was motivated by white supremacy or was part of a larger militia group. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League found no evidence he was or is connected to any extremist movements.Yet Democrats and their friends in the corporate media, such as Wallace, have tried to paint Rittenhouse as a “white supremacist” in order todeflect all blamefrom the real agitators, left-wing groups such as BLM and Antifa.Rittenhouse’s guilt has not been confirmed in a court of law, yet Wallace defamed him with gross charges of racism on national television with 29 million people watching.Biden did the same on social media in a wholly inappropriate smear. On Monday, Bidentweeteda video featuring Rittenhouse, with the caption, “There’s no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.”Wednesday it was announced Rittenhouse is pursuing a libel case against Biden and his campaign for the advertisement suggesting he is a white supremacist. Rittenhouse’s attorney, Lin Wood, said he plans to “rip Joe into shreds.”Not only was Wallace’s debate tactic dirty, but it is factually wrong to say the violence and destruction that consumed Kenosha was spawned by “white supremacists,” given that the overwhelming majority of arrests were of left-wing rioters.Trump pointed out that the majority of violence in places like Kenosha is coming from “the left-wing, not from the right-wing.” Democrats’ “right-wing extremists” narrative has become increasingly difficult to defend, with accounts from on-the-ground reporters shattering their talking points. A recent study found that95 percent of riotsin the United States this year have been tied to Black Lives Matter.Taking his cues from Wallace, Biden shouted at Trump to denounce Proud Boys, a right-wing group. The onlyinstance of Proud Boys in Kenosha, however, wasn’t during the nights of violence, but during the day. Two demonstrators sporting Proud Boys paraphernalia engaged in a verbal confrontation with three dozen BLM demonstrators, who were present to protest Trump’s visit.Reporters said the two demonstrators did not appear to be armed and were being followed by the large group of BLM protesters. When the clash appeared volatile, law enforcement encircled the two Proud Boys demonstrators, who “appeared to be frightened,” walked them to nearby squad cars, and removed them from the area. It’s safe to say the duo didn’t “add to the violence,” to use Wallace’s words.Despite the endless accounts this summer of violence instigated by left-wing groups — which have left police officers dead, businesses and homes reduced to ashes, and communities in anarchic disarray — Democrats and the media keep pushing their “white supremacist” talking point.Many voters and residents of these torn cities aren’t buying it. “You’re telling me you’re going to burn down my neighborhood?” Valerie, a 25-year-old black woman and former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee,toldthe Federalist in Kenosha of Black Lives Matter. “No, I don’t want to be a Democrat anymore.”So MSNBC can keep standing in front of burning cities and calling them “mostly peaceful” protests, and Chris Wallace can keep pretending the right is to blame for the violence. But we were in Kenosha. We talked to people on the ground. Voters know who the peaceful protesters are and who the rioters are.",0
560,Dems Have Crazy New Plan to Fund Biden’s Infrastructure Bill: Make Billionaires Pay Their Fair Share,-16.33,35.0,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/democrats-billionaire-tax-plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-22,vanityfair,25,"As you’ve probably heard by now,would like to pass a sweeping infrastructure plan that would make life better for millions of people. Republicans, who’ve made it abundantly clear that they don’t give a crap about improving people’s lives, are obviously against anything that doesn’t start with a “t” and end with an “ax cut,” and will thus fight this thing tooth and nail. But Democrats are also having trouble coming to a consensus re: how to fund the thing, with senators likeKyrsten Sinemaexpressing opposition to a rise in tax rates. So party leadership has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new proposal: making the richest people in the country, the ones who literally shit money, pay their fair share.PerWashington Post:Senior Democrats are preparing a sweeping new tax plan that would aim to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from the fortunes of America’s roughly 700 billionaires, an abrupt shift in the party’s approach to funding a large expansion of the safety net…. Senate Finance Chair(D-Ore.) is drafting the plan, but both senior Biden officials and other senior Democrats are cautiously optimistic Sinema and other centrist lawmakers support the effort, according to interviews with three congressional aides and two administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect sensitive negotiations. “The Billionaires Income Tax is about fairness and showing the American people taxes aren’t mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country,” Wyden said in a statement. “No working person in this country thinks it’s right that billionaires can pay no taxes for years on end, and sometimes never at all.”Currently, wealthy Americans do not have to pay taxes on vast accumulations of wealth because they are only taxed once the asset is sold. Billionaires often borrow against their non-taxed assets, which allows them to spend enormous sums of money while effectively paying very low taxes relative to their income and worth. Under the “Billionaire Income Tax” proposal, a summary of which was obtained bythe federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of their assets such as stocks on an annual basis, regardless of whether they sell those assets. Billionaires would also be able to take deductions for the annual loss in value of those assets. It would also set up a system for taxing assets that are not easily tradable, like real estate. The tax would apply to billionaires and people earning over $100 million in income three years in a row.Which seems pretty reasonable, particularly to people who, for example, didn’t see their net worth double in the past year to $222 billion, as was the case forwho recently took to Twitter totauntJeff Bezosfor only being worth roughly $194 billion, and thus therichest person in the world. (Yes, this happened, and is probably a good argument not just for a tax on billionaires but for bringing back the gulag.)A spokesman for Sinema would not confirm or deny whether she supports the billionaire tax, saying only that she “is committed to ensuring everyday families can get ahead and that we continue creating jobs,” and that “she has told her colleagues and the president that simply raising tax rates will not in any way address the challenge of tax avoidance or improve economic competitiveness.” The White House has reportedly been involved in crafting the details, and Biden has endorsed the concept. Republicans, it’s safe to assume, will be throwing an absolute hissy fit over the whole thing in short order, because if there’s one thing they can’t stand, it’s the ultrarich paying their fair share.hereto subscribe.ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofProcedural arguments will be heard on November 1, but in the meantime, Texas‘s barbaric abortion law, banning the procedure at six weeks, will remain in effect. Per:The Supreme Court on Friday once again refused to immediately block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks. But the justices agreed to fast-track their consideration of appeals from the Justice Department and abortion providers in Texas, scheduling arguments for Nov. 1. Only Justicefiled a dissent. “For the second time, the court is presented with an application to enjoin a statute enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas,” she wrote. “For the second time, the court declines to act immediately to protect these women from grave and irreparable harm.”But she added she welcomed the court’s decision to hear arguments in the two cases, which will apparently be limited to the procedural question of whether the Texas law, S.B. 8, is subject to review in federal court given its novel structure. The court said it would decide this question in the federal government’s appeal: “May the United States bring suit in federal court and obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against the state, state court judges, state court clerks, other state officials or all private parties to prohibit S.B. 8 from being enforced?”While the court rejected a request from Texas officials to use the cases to decide whether to overturnpeople who think what a pregnant person does with their body is their business and their business alone shouldn’t get too excited just yet. In December, the justices will hear arguments in a case concerning a Mississippi law banning abortion at 15 weeks, and it’s entirely possible that the court’s conservatives will use the opportunity to roll back the landmark decision.ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofMatt Gaetz news…According to The Daily Beast, he won’t be representing himself in any courts of lawany time soon:Faced with an onslaught of accusations that he engaged in underage sex trafficking—and bracing for criminal charges—Gaetz allowed his license to practice law in his home state of Florida to lapse this month. On Friday, The Daily Beast revealed that Gaetz had not paid the fees he owes to the Florida Bar, which regulates lawyers there. That mistake prompted the organization to deem him “delinquent” and “not eligible to practice law in Florida.”Rather than assert that letting his license lapse was a simple oversight that he or someone on his staff will soon remedy, Gaetz’s communication director initially claimed it was intentional. “Congressman Gaetz is no longer actively engaged in the practice of law. He is focused on representing his constituents in Congress, not the courtroom,” said(After The Daily Beast’s story published, the outlet reported that Gaetz “rushed to file a signed petition to get reinstated and pay the $265 fee—plus another $200 in late fees,” citing the Florida Bar.) Lawyers who spoke to The Daily Beast said Gaetz’s decision to let his license become delinquent underscores the fact that he’s a clown. “He clearly doesn’t take his law license very seriously when he doesn’t take the time to pay the $265 dues,” saidDaniel Uhlfelder,an attorney who lives in Gaetz’s district. “He’s not a serious lawyer. He’s not a serious congressman. He’s not a serious person.

562,Is There a Future for Fusionism?,12.33,30.67,https://reason.com/2021/02/10/is-there-a-future-for-fusionism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,reason,25,"There's a well-worn tale about modern American conservatism: It says that the movement as we know it came into being during the mid–20th century as a ""fusionist"" coalition of economic libertarians and religious traditionalists. These groups, whose goals and priorities differed from the start, were held together mainly by two things: the sheer charisma offounder William F. Buckley Jr., and the shared enemy of global communism.As long as the Cold War endured, the story goes, each wing was willing to cede some ground to the other. In light of the threat posed by a rampaging Soviet Union—as militantly atheistic as it was militantly anti-capitalist—the differences between the libertarians and the traditionalists did not seem so great. Their interests, at least, were aligned.But the fall of the USSR meant the collapse of the common foe that had sustained the fusionist partnership. It was able to trundle on for a while, powered by a reservoir of goodwill, but it has long been running on fumes. In the last few years, the alliance's inherent tensions have come to a head. It's increasingly common to hear that, whatever value there may have been in cooperation during the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, the era of good conservative feelings is over.For many libertarians, the Trump years revealed their traditionalist allies to be hypocrites and opportunists, all too willing to sell out the ideals of fusionism in service of an aspiring dictator. Conservatives have commenced a not-so-slow descent toward authoritarianism, some in this group suggest; if the philosophy of liberty is to have a future, it must involve building bridges to the left, not the right.A number of traditionalists, meanwhile, have been tripping over each other in their rush to celebrate the end of fusionism. What the 21st century demands, they say, is a different, more ""muscular"" style of politics, practiced by a Republican Party that finally stops worrying and learns to love the state. By passing stronger laws, these ""post-liberal"" conservatives believe they can restore America's lost Judeo-Christian character and save their country from itself.This is quite a change from the Reagan Republicanism of a few decades ago. Back then, most folks on the right insisted that limited government and personal responsibility were the watchwords of conservatism. That consensus has now broken down.From literature to philosophy to religion, it's hard to think of a theme less original than the seductiveness of power. That, after all, is the story of Frodo and the ring; of Lord Acton and ""absolute power corrupts absolutely""; of Satan and the third temptation of Christ. One of history's great recurrent lessons is about the importance of keeping that desire in check, in our hearts and our governments alike. Which is why it's exasperating to watch so many conservatives—self-proclaimed heirs to the axiom that ""example is the school of mankind,"" in Edmund Burke's phrase—succumb in real time to the fantasy thatare the exception to this time-tested rule.As far as the post-liberal conservatives are concerned, libertarianism's preoccupation with protecting liberty has blinded it to the importance of promoting virtue (and a constellation of related values, including faith, family, community, and patriotism). The most moderate version of this argument suggests that libertarians have come to exercise too much influence over the right-of-center policy agenda and proposes a so-called rebalancing toward traditionalist concerns. A more radical version excoriates libertarianism as philosophically bankrupt and calls upon the keepers of the conservative flame to take a sledgehammer to the fusionist coalition once and for all.Hillsdale College's David Azerrad put the latter position starkly in a July 2020 essay for. ""The common enemy that justified an alliance with the free market fundamentalists is long gone,"" he wrote. ""Today, libertarians actively side with our enemies: they promote open borders and empty prisons, and strengthen China's hand through their consumer-focused economic policies. Ours is primarily a conservatism of countries and borders, citizens and families, none of which can take root in the barren libertarian soil of atomized individuals and global markets.""The post-liberal agenda is typified by a desire for more government involvement in people's lives. As' Ross Douthat wrote in 2019, this group seeks ""stronger state interventions in the economy on behalf of socially conservative ends."" Or, as Azerrad put it in his essay, ""the right must be comfortable wielding the levers of state power.""Economically, post-liberalism rejects the doctrine of ""unfettered"" free markets in favor of tariffs, an ""industrial policy"" intended to prop up American manufacturers in the face of competition from overseas, wage subsidies, and the like. On social issues, it supports everything from vice laws to a rollback of no-fault divorce to more robust speech restrictions on public morality grounds to (among a lively cohort of radical Catholics especially) the imposition of a confessional state and perhaps even a Christian monarch.There's little evidence that the post-liberals are speaking for the average Republican, let alone the average American. But the elite wind does seem to be at their backs.Fox News host Tucker Carlson was once an avatar of fusionism who supported Ron Paul for president in both 1988 and 2008 and toldin 2010, ""I despise laws that tell people that they can't do things for their own good."" By January 2019, he was delivering a 15-minute on-air monologue decrying the failures of capitalism. ""Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy?"" Carlson asked. ""Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives,"" he continued, referring specifically to payday lenders. ""OK. But it's also disgusting.""Two months later, the Christian journalpublished a manifesto, signed by 15 conservative intellectuals, inveighing against a ""dead consensus"" that favors ""individual autonomy"" at the expense of ""permanent truths, family stability, communal solidarity, and much else."" Four months after that, the political theorist Yoram Hazony organized an impressively attended conference promoting conservative nationalism. He took the opportunity on behalf of those present to ""declare independence"" from neoliberalism, classical liberalism, and libertarianism.In November 2019, Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) raised more than a few eyebrows when he gave an address at Washington, D.C.'s Catholic University rejecting ""the notion that, left unguided, the market will solve our problems."" He called instead for a system of ""common-good capitalism"" capable of restoring the ""balance between the obligations and rights of the private sector and working Americans.""This, Rubio argued, can be accomplished only through some measure of state direction. ""Promoting the common good will require public policies that drive investments in key industries,"" he said, ""because pure market principles and our national interest are not aligned."" Fortunately for us all, the senior senator from the Sunshine State came equipped with plans for, among other things, ""a national co-operative that guarantees investment"" in the rare-earth mineral sector.Rubio's fervor for a conservatism that has made its peace with a bigger, more powerful central government has been matched and exceeded by some of his colleagues. First-term Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example—until recently the Republican Party's brightest young thing—seems not to have found a meddlesome technology regulation or ""pro-family"" policy he does not like. ""We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past,"" he said in a May 2019 Senate speech. ""We need not just a bigger economy but a better society.""In spring 2020, a new think tank called American Compass came online—""an organization dedicated to helping American conservatism recover from its chronic case of market fundamentalism,"" as founder Oren Cass put it in an announcement published by. Among the group's favored policies are subsidies for American manufacturers, reducing ""toward zero"" the number of visas granted to Chinese college students, and legally requiring corporations to put the common good ahead of profit seeking—perhaps by ordering them to include labor representatives on their boards of directors, thus ""short-circuiting the default assumptions of shareholder primacy by including workers among those to whom management is accountable.""That last suggestion is striking in its similarity to a 2018 bill introduced by progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), which would require U.S. companies ""to consider the interests of all corporate stakeholders,"" including by giving workers the right to fill 40 percent of board seats. Warren has been a public enemy of the political right for nigh on a decade. Yet the conservative media have heaped acclaim on Cass' efforts and held him out as the future of the movement.This sentiment culminated last August in a lengthy essay bycolumnist David Brooks that contained glowing mini-profiles of Hawley and Rubio and that extensively quoted Cass. ""Over the long term,"" Brooks concluded, ""some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the G.O.P.""In 2018, Samuel Hammond, a researcher at the centrist Niskanen Center, persuasively argued that Warren's proposal represented a ""corporate catastrophe"" in the making. Today, he is a contributor to the American Compass blog, where not long ago he urged readers to stand up and insist: ""Conservatives believe in supporting families directly. And if that involves a pinch of redistribution, so be it!""Is there a contradiction there? Hammond doesn't think so. ""I really urge you to separate Warren's specific proposal,"" he says, ""from the broader investigation"" that Cass is leading into how to help the working class. In the end, ""the right will have to take on an orientation that's more skeptical of trade, more skeptical of big business, and more curious about pro-labor, pro-family policies.""The post-liberal conservative movement is a twisted artifact of the now-conventional view of fusionism as a partnership of convenience between two groups that have divergent and even contradictory belief systems: libertarians, who prioritize individual freedom above all else, and traditionalists, who know better.This understanding is subtly—but crucially—mistaken. Fusionism, properly understood, is not a marriage of two groups. It's a marriage of two. A fusionist is someone who sees both liberty (in the classical sense of freedom from aggression, coercion, and fraud) andvirtue (in the Judeo-Christian sense of submission to God's commands) as important. Fusionism is therefore a distinct philosophical orientation unto itself. What's more, it has historically been the dominant orientation on the American right.Conservatives going back at least to the country's founding have believed that virtue and liberty were mutually reinforcing—and that neither could survive long without the other. A free society depends on a virtuous populace. (""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,"" wrote John Adams. ""It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."") But the reverse is also true: Virtue, to be virtuous, must be freely chosen. As the lateliterary editor Frank Meyer, usually identified as the godfather of fusionism, eloquently put it: ""Truth withers when freedom dies, however righteous the authority that kills it; and free individualism uninformed by moral value rots at its core and soon surrenders to tyranny.""Post-liberals tend to see liberty and virtue as fatally at odds. To be a good person necessarily requires accepting some limits on one's choices, after all. Mustn't one of the two fusionist pillars ultimately trump the other?There's no denying that the demands of morality, traditionally understood, pull against a theoretical ideal of freedom from all constraint. Fusionism reconciles this tension by insisting that the state protect people's fundamental rights to be secure in person and property—thus leaving individuals, and the various associations they come together to form, with as much space as possible in which to pursue the higher things. Within the governmental sphere, liberty is indeed the ultimate end. But within the infinitely broader sphere outside of government, it's just the beginning: A life well-lived consists in using one's freedom to do what's right. The clear recognition that these are separate spheres, with separate roles to play for the common good, is the genius of the fusionist project.Today's post-liberal conservatives appear to think they're distinguished by the belief that virtue matters. They behave as if their core disagreement with fusionists is about whether human beings have moral obligations that go beyond leaving others alone to do as they please. This could hardly be more wrong. Anyone who holds to the Judeo-Christian tradition—as fusionists by definition do—accepts that we have manifold duties to one another. The disagreement is about whether it's the state's job tothose moral obligations.For a fusionist, the answer to that question must be no, for pragmatic as well as deeply moral reasons.The weight of evidence through history is that concentrated government power in the best case leads to incompetence and waste, while in the worst case it degenerates quickly into tyranny. Whether your main concern is material enrichment or the protection of human rights, limited government has been shown on the proving grounds of experience to be the best available means to that end.Arguably even more important is the Judeo-Christian doctrine of human beings' equal inherent dignity. As theputs it, ""God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions."" And later: ""Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each other this duty of respect."" That is why state power is such a grave matter, fraught with danger not just to society but to the souls of those who wield it. Only when absolutely necessary—say, to stop one person from initiating violence against another—is it morally justifiable to overrule someone's right to live his life as he chooses.Understanding what fusionism is—and what it is not—is more important than it may seem. An arrangement in which traditionalists and libertarians are merely allies can easily become a game of tug of war in which each side jockeys to ensure that, on balance, its ownpriorities predominate. If one side finds itself too often on the losing end of that jockeying, it might reasonably move to dissolve the alliance altogether.But if fusionism is a discrete philosophical worldview—and a pervasive one at that, with a pedigree that runs through the American founding and with roots in the Hebrew Bible—then post-liberalism looks infinitely more radical. Remember: The new conservatives don't just call for a collective recommitment to the pursuit of virtue in the private sphere; they explicitly insist that power be exercised in the government sphere, with a goal of forcibly reorienting society to the common good.Such a shift amounts to a rejection of one of the two pillars of fusionism—which is to say it's a rejection of fusionism itself. How supremely ironic that the people who flatter themselves defenders of tradition have abandoned the hard-won philosophical inheritance of the American political right.All this leaves unanswered a serious question: If a free society requires a moral populace, what is a committed fusionist in an unvirtuous age to do?Traditionalists have plenty of evidence that we're living in such an age. American religiosity is in decline, with significantly fewer people attending weekly services (even before the coronavirus pandemic) than at any time in the last century. Addiction and suicide are through the roof, likely driven by a sense of alienation. Traditional teachings about sexual morality seem laughably antiquated against the backdrop of modernity. The divorce rate is down, but so is the marriage rate, and hundreds of thousands of abortions are performed each year.Some libertarians are less bothered by these concerns. Many prefer to focus on the ways market-driven technological advances have vastly improved our quality of life. Others go further, arguing that widespread acceptance of a greater range of lifestyle choices make this the best time ever to be alive., this cohort might say,or at least misunderstood—and if you're reading this magazine, you may be inclined to agree. If people are using more drugs (see, for instance, the cover ofthis month's issue) while having fewer children, that's fine and dandy so long as it's their choice.These libertarians are not fusionists, though they can and do happily work with their fusionist brethren when it comes to protecting rights and liberties in the government sphere. At the same time, many libertariansuneasy about secularism and community breakdown. As a churchgoing Roman Catholic, I certainly fall into this category—grieving the scourge of abortion, suffering under a culture that feels overly sexualized and excessively consumerist, and fretting that modern man has grown unwilling to sacrifice on behalf of something bigger than himself. I'm not the most stereotypical libertarian, but even within the liberty movement I'm not alone. And on the wider political right, such fears are omnipresent.Faced with problems like these, the allure of desperate measures is perhaps understandable. One common justification for the post-liberal turn is that culture and institutions, once broken, cannot be expected to repair themselves. External help is needed. The state can provide it, through laws that constrain behavior but also teach the populace to value the correct things: faith and family, community and country.Alas, the lessons of history do not cease to be true just because they're inconvenient. You cannot impose virtue on people by force, and a coercive legal regime is no more likely in practice to instill good values than it is to make the underlying problems worse.For one thing, there's no guarantee that the people actually in power—now or in the future—will agree with you about what the correct values are (or about how much power is required to enforce them). But beyond that, public policiescome with unintended consequences. Even assuming a legal code that perfectly aligns with the true demands of virtue, we can't know in advance what the effects will be. Perhaps citizens will absorb a better sense of right and wrong. Or perhaps, freed from the need to make weighty decisions for themselves, their moral muscles will atrophy, rendering themlesscapable of pursuing the higher things in life.Before you guess which result is more likely, consider the impact that decades of well-intentioned welfare policy have had on poor communities. As the financial incentives for entrepreneurship and family formation evaporated, recipients of aid learned to see themselves as lacking agency. Neighborly ingenuity, manifested through private charitable efforts and mutual aid societies, was crowded out by top-down government ""solutions"" that solve very little. Despite ever-increasing state and federal spending, the official poverty rate has hardly budged, and small towns and rural counties increasingly join impoverished inner cities as economic disaster areas. All of which suggests that our best efforts have failed to address the causes of the problem and may have exacerbated them.The central insight of fusionism is that the common good is best achieved when the state stays focused on protecting rights and liberties, leaving individuals and voluntary associations to do the rest. To be clear, there is nothing easy about that answer.The post-liberal temptation is to believe that government power can be a substitute for the hard labor of institution building and cultural change. It isn't. The solution must begin at home—on the front porch, around the kitchen table, and in the mirror. The law is not a magic wand. There are no magic wands, and there is no shortcut to the good society.",1

564,How to Forecast Outbreaks and Pandemics,-2.67,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-06-29/how-forecast-outbreaks-and-pandemics,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-29,foreignaffairs,17,"In 1900, the deadliest hurricane in U.S. history hit Galveston, Texas. The storm, estimated to have been a Category 4, all but washed the city away. An estimated8,000 people died, and even more lives would likely have been lost if Isaac Cline, the chief of the Texas section of the U.S. Weather Service, had not spent the day before the hurricane’s arrival walking around and urging people to seek higher ground. He did so on little more than a hunch based on the fact that a bad storm had recently passed over Cuba. The science of weather forecasting had yet to emerge; guesswork was the best anyone could do.Over a century later,hurricane forecastsare a central feature of summer and fall for millions of Americans. Such forecasts, along with those predicting winter storms, tornadoes, and floods, have saved an untold number of lives and many billions of dollars. Even fair-weather forecasts play an important role in modern life. Take the airline industry, for example. “Even when you’ve got clear skies, that has an economic benefit,” explained Greg Romano of the National Weather Service, “because then you don’t necessarily need to plan to reroute as much, so you can perhaps take on less fuel; you know that you can have tighter schedules.”With the world moving quickly toward an age of pandemics, the story of how weather forecasting in the United States improved deserves attention. Because when it comes tomodelingthe likely course of contagious outbreaks, the country is in some ways closer to the bad old days of deadly, no-notice hurricanes than to the current era of precision storm tracking and multiday weather forecasts.Today, if a hurricane was barreling down on Florida, no one would suggest that an arbitrary assortment of academics gather data, quickly develop models to predict the storm’s course, anticipate its landfall, tell agencies where to preposition response teams, and craft warnings for the public. That, however, is essentially what the U.S. government has done during the COVID-19 pandemic.Of course, sophisticated disease modeling has contributed a great deal to the response to the pandemic. Early in the outbreak,modelersestimated that the new coronavirus would prove more deadly than influenza. Others concluded that rapid containment of the virus in China was unlikely, based on the unusually high number of infected international travelers. And when the United States was in the throes of the worst outbreak in the world, it was modelers whose work informed the White House task force that coordinated the federal response, including the decision to begin (and later extend) the “Slow the Spread” campaign of social-distancing measures and business closures.Unfortunately, however, the full force of epidemiological expertise in the United States is not being brought to bear. Despite some successes, serious gaps remain in the ability of infectious disease models to inform public health policy. That is because the country has no centralized system for disease forecasting; there exists no epidemiological equivalent of the National Weather Service. That is precisely what the country needs to succeed in the fight against COVID-19 and to avoid future failures and missteps of the sort that has marred the U.S. response to the current pandemic.This is hardly the first time that academics have filled the disease-modeling vacuum. In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, officials in Pennsylvania consulted modelers as they deliberated about whether to shut down schools. During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, modelers helped the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Servicescalculate the riskthat travelers would import cases into the United States, how many hospital beds would be needed domestically, and how many future cases could be expected under varying scenarios.But after those outbreaks ended, the ad hoc and informal ties that had developed between modelers and decision-makers were not institutionalized;no formal systememerged for centralizing expertise within the government. So it should have been no surprise that the few modeling experts who do this work within government agencies were quickly overwhelmed by the enormous number of consequential decisions demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. And once again, academic modelers have stepped in to fill the gap.This is part of a familiar pattern. During contagion crises, modeling becomes a priority. However, asthe sense of urgency fades, attention shifts to other issues and relationships between experts and decision-makers fade. The chief danger is that as the results of modeling shift, those changes won’t get on the radar of policymakers. “The projections provide information at a particular moment but unfortunately will change all the time. It’s important to communicate that uncertainty,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. Shaman’s research has been consulted by the White House task force on COVID-19, but Shaman says that the working relationship has been limited.The CDC’s epidemiology task force hasconvened weekly meetingswith pandemic experts. These meetings are a marked improvement in coordination and information exchange over such efforts in previous outbreaks. However, the connection to key decision-makers, including the White House task force, has not been clear.One result has been aproliferation of modelswithout enough people to make sense of them. “It’s really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, without someone or a group of people evaluating the assumptions and form of each model,” said Shaman. “There are a lot of teams who want to contribute to modeling efforts, but we don’t have a clear game plan for separating and combining the various projections.”To better integrate disease forecasting into decision-making, the CDC and other public health agencies should look to the history of the National Weather Service for inspiration. Americans take for granted the elaborate, highly detailed weather information they can easily access. But such tools developed only after decades of sustained public investment.Numerical weather forecasting emerged in the 1920s in the wake of mathematical advances that helped describe atmospheric physics. Decades later, computers allowed meteorologists to apply more elaborate models. Othernew technologies—aircraft, weather balloons, satellites, and digital communications—made it possible for scientists to add ever more data to the models, creating a virtuous cycle that led to progressive improvements in forecasting over time.National Weather Service employees monitor storm maps and data in Norman, Oklahoma, April 2019William Widmer / The New York Times / ReduxBut technological change is only part of the story; the other part involves organizational change. During the Civil War era, tracking and anticipating weather was a largely academic effort. Later, disparate independent efforts emerged in multiple federal agencies, including the Department of War, the Department of Agriculture, and the Navy. Finally, in the late 1960s, what would eventually become theNational Weather Servicewas established as an integrated office in the Department of Commerce. This unification and centralization was crucial: it allowed for significant investment over time and created a stable point of contact between forecasters and policymakers by giving weather experts a permanent seat at the table.Outbreak modeling and analytics should be centralized in a similar way. Over the last decade or so, public investments in disease forecasting have yielded some progress. Programs funded by theNational Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Homeland Security have advanced modeling capabilities, generated excellent research, and helped to develop a cadre of well-trained experts.These programs, however, are largely focused on developing basic science, as opposed to helping public health officials navigate difficult decisions about outbreak control. And they rarely receive the kind of reliable, sustained funding that has long supported weather forecasting. Generally, funding takes the form ofgrantsto principal investigators that typically last only three to five years and must result in academic publications—the kind of research that is necessary but not sufficient to the task at hand.“Everyone is on grants,” noted Cécile Viboud, a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health. “So if you don’t have a particular dedicated line of funding to work on the [outbreak], then you do it on your own time. You just run those estimates because maybe it can help.”Making matters worse, private-sector innovation and advanced data technologies have hardly made an appearance when it comes to contagion modeling, in part because there is usually not a great deal of market demand, public health agencies are ill-equipped to evaluate new data technologies, and new technologies must pass through a torturous regulatory path before gaining approval.Roni Rosenfeld, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, pointed out another problem. “By far the biggest obstacle is the data,” he lamented. Health data are fragmented across the U.S. health-care systemin silos that cannot talk to one another. And public health agencies are not known for being forward leaning on data technology. This hampers their ability to acquire, process, share, analyze, and communicate data that would inform an outbreak response.“There is no systematic report format for individual locations to provide data in,” said Lauren Gardner, an engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the team that built the university’scoronavirus map, which has become one of the most reliable sources of data on the spread of COVID-19. “Even when data is provided, it may not be in a usable format. Together these issues substantially limit the capabilities of disease models to be able to inform policy in real time.”Unfortunately, the pandemic is laying bare these data challenges. The White House task force announced last month that all 4,700 or so hospitals in the United States would beaskedto send daily emails to the task force with data on their capacities. It’s baffling that in the country that sparked the digital revolution, hospitals must rely on such a rudimentary, unreliable tool in order to transmit vital information.It’s also striking that the most timely and detailed data on new cases of COVID-19, diagnostic testing, and personal protective equipment have been available mostly through websites set up and run by volunteers or journalists. It is wonderful that so many skilled individuals have been motivated to help out in a time of crisis. But the country’s pandemic response cannot rely on volunteers. And although journalism is crucial during an outbreak, responsibility for tracking the spread of contagions can hardly be outsourced to media organizations.The best way to address these vulnerabilities would be the establishment of a National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Analytics (CEFA). The center would handle research and development in outbreak science, develop technology for producing disease forecasts, and provide guidance for preparedness and response to outbreaks. The center’s structure should resemble that of the National Weather Center, located at the University of Oklahoma. The NWC has a unique structure that enablesacademics to work closely with federal employeesand develop a mutual understanding of respective challenges and capabilities. In the same manner, the new center would work with the CDC, nonprofit organizations such as the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, public health departments in all 50 states, and the National Governors Association to improve outbreak science and analytics, decision-making during outbreaks, and the data and technologies needed to support these efforts.During an epidemic outbreak, CEFA scientists could help to forecast how many cases might emerge in a given place during a given period, which interventions would be most effective, and where to direct resources, and would assess progress in the fight against the pathogen.During the COVID-19 pandemic, each jurisdiction has been on its own when it comes to finding modelers to help make those kinds of determinations. Sadly, those jurisdictions without access to world-class modelers or epidemiologists were left out in the cold. CEFA would change that by providing all governors and mayors access to high-level insights.Between outbreaks, CEFA scientists would develop new models and advance the science of forecasting and analyzing outbreaks, just as atmospheric scientistswork constantly to improvethe accuracy of weather models. Initially, the center would focus on improving the predictive analytics needed to produce forecasts of new cases and deaths. It would also work to improve visualizations and communication approaches to make as clear as possible the implications and uncertainties involved in all modeling.To be successful, CEFA scientists would need the ability to directly advise decision-makers on preparedness and response, as forecasters do in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, theScientific Advisory Group for Emergenciesbrings together experts in various fields, including epidemiology and modeling, to advise the government. The United Kingdom has not always managed to successfully bring scientific expertise to bear on emergencies, but the fact that it has a formalized way of bringing experts together puts it in a better position than the United States. Other countries have similar mechanisms. In the Netherlands, for example, theInfectious Diseases Modelling teamat the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment is chaired by Jacco Wallinga, an esteemed modeling expert who also holds a prominent academic position.In addition to working with officials, just as local meteorologists translate the complex weather models into forecasts that are easily understood by the public, CEFA science communicators could bring forecasts and analyses to the public to help individual decision-making. Just as people rely on weather reports to know when to bring an umbrella, CEFA forecasts could make it easier to decide whether to telework during flu season orwhether to wear a face covering. People want to know how to keep themselves and their families safe, and providing information to help them do so would be an enormous advance for public health.To meet its mission, the center would need to be able to identify, adapt, and adopt cutting-edge technology and attract the best data scientists, engineers, and technologists. That would require significant, sustained funding: approximately $1 billion over the next ten years. But it would be money well spent.The COVID-19 pandemic should serve as the epidemiological equivalent of the Galveston hurricane. It is a stark reminder that Americans are vulnerable to the forces of nature. But as with weather forecasting, with sufficient vision and investment, the United States can develop the ability to anticipate and respond to such outbreaks. The country can do better—and it must do better, so that this never happens again.",2

Theads—taken out in,The Washington Post, andThe Wall Street Journalon December 16—claim that Facebook is “standing up to Apple for small businesses,” for whom Apple’s changes will be “devastating.” With its not-so-subtle implication that Apple doesn’t care about lifting up the little guys, the campaign amounts to a mammoth bat-swing at the company, especially in this moment of antitrust inquiry and anti-monopoly reckoning. But while the social media giant is leading us in a seemingly virtuous direction, the reality is quite different.

But they are also plain wrong.is the author ofand directs the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. He was a technology & economic policy adviser in the Obama-Biden White House and later, a privacy & public policy advisor at Facebook.The nuts and bolts of Apple’s new policy, which will apply toiOS 14, are pretty clear: Data tracking is not allowed if the user chooses to disable the option. And that choice must be presented to the user through Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency framework, which, in the user interface, appears as a typical iPhone pop-up query. Apple has further indicated that the kinds of practices that will qualify as tracking include in-app ad display targeted at users with the aid of third-party data, sharing of location data with brokers, sharing of personally identifiable information like email addresses with third-party ad networks for ad-retargeting or lookalike targeting, and use of third-party SDKs that use in-app data for commercial ad-targeting services.This definition of tracking can be considered appropriately broad. It could be broader—Appleoffers some examplesof practices that will still be allowed under the new policy.

Some have suggested that Apple, along with other major tech firms, including Facebook, are instituting (or already have established) such policies in light of the growing regulatory stick in the air on all matters related to user privacy; the European Commission and the state of California, for instance, have each recently pushed new standards that favor their constituents' privacy rights. And we could soon see similar moves at the federal level in the United States, resulting either from the recently-pushed antitrust suits or the possibility of a reformative baseline privacy law.Facebook’s ads claim that small businesses will be impacted—that its many app developers and small business advertisers around the world will suffer in the long run as a result of Apple’s privacy-minded changes. Notably, the newspaper ads mention that 44 percent of “small to medium businesses started or increased their usage of personalized ads on social media during the pandemic” and that the “average small business advertiser stands to see a cut of over 60 percent in their sales for every dollar they spend.”But when one examines thetechnical changes that Facebook announced to its developer communityin order to comply with Apple’s update, the idea that small businesses advertising on its platform stand to lose a lot of revenue begins to look quite shaky. According to the post, Facebook will tweak engagement measurements so that advertisers cannot track more than eight types of “conversion events,” or in-app user actions that it measures to assess the effectiveness of ad-targeting algorithms. There will also be some minor technical changes to the implementations ofValue Optimization, Facebook’s algorithmic tool that maximizes revenues generated from ad targeting by predicting how much a given user will spend in an app,as well as dynamic ads,measurement of performance of ad campaigns, and a subset of Facebook’sdeveloper APIs.These are manageable changes—minor coding fixes—for small businesses who depend on Facebook to reach their customers and know their buying habits. But more to the point, they are changes that hurt Facebook and its affiliated data brokers and ad networks—not the main-street small businesses evoked by Facebook’s newspaper ads.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIt’s true that small businesses generally depend on advertising. In recent years, because of the overwhelming popularity of social media, and Facebook’s monopoly in that space, that’s meant that many small businesses depend on Facebook. But it doesn't have to be that way—small businesses would still find other places to advertise in targeted ways even if Facebook didn't exist, let alone if its targeting and tracking features were fully deprecated. Consider the statistics Facebook presented in its ads. What does the fact that 44 percent of small businesses increased advertising during the pandemic effectively mean? Only that, during the pandemic, more people are stuck at home, and Facebook’s monopoly ad network is seeing more consumption as a result. More businesses are advertising over it because more consumers are on the couch looking at their phones. This figure doesn’t necessarily indicate that small businesses benefit from advertising on Facebook, just that they have no other option.The company also notes that without targeting, sales for small businesses would decrease by 60 percent for every dollar spent on Facebook ads. But that’s a potentially misleading figure that doesn’t speak to the possibility that these businesses will identify alternative places to reach consumers. We already know that withouttargeting based on personalized optimization, advertising on Facebook would be far less effective. Recall that in the Facebook advertising network, ad placement is priced by auction, meaning that with less effectiveness in targeting, the price of advertising on Facebook would correspondingly decrease—which in turn would open up more marketing budget for small businesses to advertise elsewhere. The result? Apple’s policy will take a bite out ofsurveillance capitalism, and will hand that excess profit back to traditional media and advertising businesses that will offer small businesses a greater diversity of opportunities to get the word out about their products and services. A more meaningful number for Facebook to report would be how deprecating ad-targeting options correlates, if at all, to the overall commercial success of small businesses—not their sales rates on Facebook itself. Facebook can research and eventually report the former, but it is well aware that such a study wouldn't yield a useful number for their purposes.Of course, in the short term, these changes will cause some minor headaches in updating advertising campaigns and code. But people will still want to buy local products, patronize mom-and-pop stores, and donate to their neighborhood charities. Meanwhile, Facebook will inevitably adjust its ad-targeting technologies and develop new methods of tracking users in aggregated and anonymized ways across its applications—innovations that will help the ad industry maintain profitability while respecting Apple’s new compliance constraints.And aren’t these changes that the public should want, in any case? Small businesses owners are, at the end of the day, individual citizens and consumers, too. They care about privacy, just like anyone should—and any increase indata privacy, marginal or otherwise, is an economic win for consumers. Local and digital-first small businesses will still be able to compete fairly—and now, their owners will have a little more privacy protection to boot. There are trade-offs inherent to any policy change; it can be argued that even if advertisersexperience a minor hit in ad-targeting in the near future, it is nonetheless good for the whole of society given the gains in individual privacy and autonomy that will also result.Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWhat, then, is Facebook talking about in its full-page ads? Not surprisingly, the hit to its own business—and business model. The practices of ad-targeting and engagement-tracking are precisely what make Facebook so tremendously powerful in the digital ecosystem. We know that the vastly dominant share—over 98 percent—of Facebook’s global revenues, which in 2019 were over $70 billion, comes from advertising. Even a 5 percent hit to that equates to a loss of billions of dollars a year, a cut that Facebook’s financial community—including capitalists, shareholders, and the company’s own executives and staff—does not want to see.As many have now contended, Facebook is a monopoly. The company has a dominant share in various subsectors of the consumer internet that are economically critical in the media ecosystem—including social media and web-based text messaging. In fact, Facebook could arguably be considered amonopoly, in that the company takes advantage of powerful network effects that, absent regulatory intervention, establish it as the dominant market player in perpetuity. Using its monopoly power, Facebook has undertaken a number of steps designed to put a stranglehold over the social media economy: buying up rival firms, copying the practices of smaller players, sucking up intellectual talent including independent academics, collecting personal data at exploitative rates and using it for questionable means, and, along with Google, monopolizing the process of information exchange over advertising networks. An imposition of greater privacy protection—instantiated by Apple in response to new, progressive privacy regulations—might be precisely what helps small businesses gain a greater economic foothold. To be sure, Apple is no angel. But the changes it is implementing next year are a good thing for an American and global public that increasingly cares about digital rights and personal privacy.At the end of the day, small businesses are owned by people like you and me—people who themselves will benefit from improved privacy rights.WIRED Opinionhere, and see our submission guidelineshere.

566,Just How Big a Mess the California Recall Is,-4.67,42.67,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/08/california-recall-election-newsom-ballot-mess.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-19,slate,25,"It’s hard to know where precisely to start. The sun is shining, the fires are raging, and California is stumbling in a daze through a gubernatorial recall election that mightchange morethan anyone wants to admit. You might already know the general outlines of the story: A small but passionate minority of voters, most of them Republican, are pumped to give Gov. Gavin Newsom the boot. They know better than anyone that the success of the scheme depends on keeping the Democratic majority complacent and unalarmed about what yet another “recall election” means. (After all, every governor since 1960 has faced one or more such attempts—what’s the big deal?)And, as you may have heard, the plan so far seems to be working. Surveys of Democrats reveal them to be pretty unconcerned and potentially unmotivated to do much about whatever’s going on: Alate July Berkeley/Times pollfound that Democrats by a whopping 70 percent to 8 percent margin expect Gavin Newsom to defeat the recall. There is dissonance everywhere you look. Newsom, a Democrat, has a 57 percent approval rating! But FiveThirtyEight’spolling averagethis week finds that among those likely to vote in the recall, keeping Newsom is barely leading, with 48.8 percent wanting to vote to keep and 47.6 percent wanting him removed.The good news is that for only the second time in the state’s history, every voter is getting a ballot mailed to their home. The first time that happened was last November. But everything else about this process is confusing, up to and including that ballot.Let me walk you through it. The ballot has two sides and asks voters to answer two questions. On one side voters are asked “Shall GAVIN NEWSOM be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?” This question—the essential one!—is printed so immediately under the instructions that I found it easy to overlook. On the other side, which is much more recognizable as a conventional ballot, voters can choose one of 46 candidates to replace Newsom, or write in a candidate of their own. Forty-six.Because these are two separate questions that don’t pit the current governor directly against his potential replacements, the winner gets decided using a bizarre rule. If Gavin Newsom does not receive a majority of the votes in response to the first question, he loses the governorship. Period. That part is decided. If he loses, the candidate who gets the most votes of those running to replace him will become governor. It’s a mathematically maddening system because of the startlingly undemocratic outcomes it can produce.In an op-ed for the New York Times, Erwin Chemerinsky and Aaron S. Edlin argue that the recall system is unconstitutional, sketching out a perfectly plausible scenario in which, even if nearly 5 million people vote to keep Newsom, he might be replaced by a candidate who receives a mere 1.8 million votes.The 110-year-old law governing recalls requires an unusually low number of signatures in order for a recall to make it to the ballot: Only 12 percent of the number of voters in the previous election. (Michigan, Minnesota, and Colorado require 25 percent.) The California lawwas designed to make it unusuallyfor voters to recall elected leaders; it was one of 22 constitutional amendments Gov. Hiram Johnson managed to get passed in October 1911. He wanted to empower voters to recall leaders compromised or corrupted by larger forces (like the Southern Pacific Railroad). It was not, suffice to say, designed for a hyperpartisan moment.The law has not aroused enough outrage to get it changed because in the only other recall to make it to the ballot—also driven by Republicans against a Democratic governor in 2003—voters delivered Arnold Schwarzenegger more votes than Gray Davis had received in the actual 2002 gubernatorial election. It seemed like Davis had effectively been outvoted by his replacement; the outcome felt small-d democratic even if the process was not. Unless the candidates running against Newsom getmore popular very soon, that’s unlikely to happen again.Newsom’s camp, meanwhile, has not hedged its bets. He successfully kept serious Democratic candidates off the ballot to forestall the possibility of his replacement. His strategy, and that of Democratic party leaders, has been to advise voters who oppose the recall not to answer the second question on the ballot—that is, not to vote for a replacement at all. It’s a game of chicken: By making the vote more straightforward for Newsom supporters, they are (selfishly, some argue) significantly increasing the chance of a Republican governor should the recall prevail.Newsom might also not be in this position at all were it not for a. Last November, Newsom—in violation of his own administration’s guidelines limiting gatherings to “no more than three households”—celebrated a friend’s birthday at the French Laundry in Napa County at which at least 12 people (and more than three households) were present. It angered a lot of people (including Democrats!) and likely galvanized a flailing recall effort. Fans of irony will appreciate that on the very same day, a Schwarzenegger-appointed judge granted the recall effort an extra four months to gather signatures,citing the pandemic. So here we are.No tour of the California recall circus would be complete without at least surveying the oddball crowd of contenders. Though Caitlyn Jenner was the splashiest entrant, she is polling poorly. The front-runner is Larry Elder, a conservative radio host who has defended a minimum wage of zero, claimed the police are more likely to shoot white people than Black ones, defended employers who discriminate against pregnant women, andclaimed in writingthat “women know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events.” In one of his books, he attacked Republican governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift for continuing to lead her state after giving birth to twins. He was nearly left off the ballot because, per a letter sent by the secretary of state, “incomplete redacted and/or unredacted income tax returns were filed.” He sued, claiming that a 2019 law requiring candidates to release five years of tax returns should not apply to him because the law did not apply to recall elections.He won.Kevin Paffrath is polling as the next most popular candidate: a centrist running as a Democrat, he’s a 29-year-old real estate developer and YouTube star. He tried to get listed on the ballot as Kevin “Meet Kevin” Paffrath. He says he’s running as a Democratic option since the party didn’t provide one. “It was mind-blowing to us that they didn’t put at least somebody in, so that way, worst case, they had a hail mary,”he’s said.Lagging behind but still ahead of the others is John Cox, a businessman and millionaire who ran against Newsom in 2018. At Tuesday’s gubernatorial debate (which Elder refused to attend)Cox was served on stagewhile delivering his opening remarks—forfailing to repayconsultants he hired during his 2018 campaign. Former congressman Doug Ose dropped out of the race after having a heart attack, and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a moderate Republican who wanted his ballot designation to be “retired San Diego Mayor” rather than “Businessman/Educator,” does not seem to be gaining traction in the polls. Neither is Angelyne, the Los Angeles icon famous for her billboards and pink Corvette (party preference: none). The hefty voter guide is filled with memorable candidate statements like “Can you dig it?” from Green Party candidate Dan Kapelovitz, “Search Youtube” from Jeremiah “Jeremy” Marciniak, or “Vote For Me The People’s Governor” from Chauncey “Slim” Killens.This feels like clownery and it is. But California is one of many places where clownery masks a crisis, and a lot of Californians still don’t realize this recall election is one. Within the state, there are water shortages and fires to deal with. The delta variant is extending the pandemic and those opposed to masking measures are only doubling down. The recall could have massive national implications too: Should Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 88 years old, be unable to finish her term, the governor of California would appoint her replacement to what is now a 50–50 Senate.*The partisan motivation gap is real: 78 percent of registered Republicans said they were “very interested” in voting in the recall, while only 47 percent of registered Democrats said the same. And while Newsom could theoretically take comfort in that 57 percent approval rating in the CBS News poll, that figure won’t help him unless people vote who don’t seem particularly inclined to. Per the Berkeley/Times poll,among those likeliest to vote: 51 percent disapprove of his performance as governor.This recall is costing taxpayers a quarter of a billion dollars. A little over three weeks out in the Golden State before the election is decided, the stakes are high, the situation dire, and what remedies exist to so peculiar a crisis are confusing enough that a lot of voters are tuning themout.Correction, Aug. 19, 2021: This article originally misspelled Dianne Feinstein’s first name.",1

568,"Violence in the Capitol, Dangers in the Aftermath",-1.33,43.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/violence-in-the-capitol-dangers-in-67f,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,greenwald.substack,16,"after the 9/11 attack, Americans were largely united in emotional horror at what had been done to their country as well as in their willingness to endorse repression and violence in response. As a result, there was little room to raise concerns about the possible excesses or dangers of the American reaction, let alone to dissent from what political leaders were proposing in the name of vengeance and security. The psychological trauma from the carnage and the wreckage at the country’s most cherished symbols swamped rational faculties and thus rendered futile any attempts to urge restraint or caution.Nonetheless, a few tried. Scorn and sometimes worse were universally heaped upon them.On September 14 — while bodies were still buried under burning rubble in downtown Manhattan — Congresswoman Barbara Leecast a lone voteagainst the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). “Some of us must urge the use of restraint,” she said seventy-two hours after the attack, adding: “our country is in a state of mourning” and thus “some of us must say: let’s step back for a moment, let’s pause just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.”For simply urging caution and casting a single “no” vote against war, Lee’s Congressional office was deluged with threats of violence. Armed security was deployed to protect her, largely as a result ofmedia attacks suggestingthat she was anti-American and sympathetic to terrorists. Yet twenty years later — with U.S. troops still fighting in Afghanistan under that same AUMF, with Iraq destroyed, ISIS spawned, and U.S. civil liberties and privacy rights permanently crippled — her solitary admonitions look far more like courage, prescience and wisdom than sedition or a desire to downplay the threat of Al Qaeda.Others also raised similar questions and issued similar warnings. On the left, people like Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky, and on the right people such as Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan — in different ways and at different times — urged U.S. politicians and Americans generally to resist unleashing an orgy of domestic assaults on civil liberties, foreign invasions, and an endless war posture. They warned that such a cycle, once initiated, would be very difficult to control, even more difficult to reverse, and virtually guaranteed to provoke even greater violence.ShareThese few who dissented from the instant consensus were, like Congresswoman Lee, widely vilified. Both Sontag and Chomsky werebrandedanti-American Fifth Columnists, while David Frum,writing in, denounced Buchanan and others questioning the excesses of the War on Terror from the right as “Unpatriotic Conservatives”: no different, proclaimed the neocon, than “Noam Chomsky, Ted Rall, Gore Vidal, Alexander Cockburn, and other anti-Americans of the far Left.”In retrospect, it is hard to deny that those who defied, or at least questioned, the potent 2001 emotional consensus by urging deliberation in lieu of reactionary rage were vindicated by subsequent events: the two-decade expansion of the war in Afghanistan to multiple countries, the enactment of the Patriot Act, the secret implementation of mass surveillance systems, the trillions of dollars of taxpayer wealth transferred to weapons manufacturers, and the paramilitarization of the domestic security state. At the very least, basic rationality requires an acknowledgement that when political passions and rage-driven emotions find their most intense expression, calls for reflection and caution can only be valuable even if ultimately rejected.of the Capitol by a Trump-supporting mob has certainly generated intense political passion and pervasive rage. It is not hard to understand why: the introduction of physical force into political protest is always lamentable, usually dangerous, and, except in the rarest of circumstances that are plainly inapplicable here, unjustifiable. It was foreseeable that an action of this type would result in deaths. The most surprising outcome is that “only” four people died: an unarmed woman, a Trump supporter and Air Force veteran, who was shot in the neck by a law enforcement officer, and three other protesters who died from unspecified “medical emergencies” (one reportedly died due to accidentally tasering himself, inducing a heart attack).The U.S. Capitol remains a potent and cherished symbol even for Americans who are deeply cynical about the ruling class and political system. Its nobility is something continually engrained deep into our collective psyche since childhood, and that meaning endures even when our rational faculties reject it. It is therefore not hard to understand why watching a marauding band of hooligans invade and deface both the House and the Senate, without any identifiable objective other than venting grievances, reflexively engenders a patriotic disgust across the political spectrum.It is unhinged to the point of being obscene to compare yesterday’s incursion to the 9/11 attack or (as Sen. Chuck Schumerdid last night) to Pearl Harbor. By every metric, the magnitude and destructiveness of those two events are in an entirely different universe. But that does not mean there are no applicable lessons to be drawn from those prior attacks.One is that striking at cherished national symbols — the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the Capitol — ensures rage and terror far beyond body counts or other concrete harms. That is one major reason that yesterday’s event received far more attention and commentary, and will likely produce far greater consequences, than much deadlier incidents, such as thestill-motive-unknown2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 59 or the 2016 Orlando shooting that left 49 dead at the Pulse nightclub. Unlike even horrific indiscriminate shooting sprees, an attack on a symbol of national power will be perceived as an attack on the state or even the society itself.There are other, more important historical lessons to draw not only from the 9/11 attack but subsequent terrorism on U.S. soil. One is the importance of resisting the coercive framework that demands everyone choose one of two extremes: that the incident is either (a) insignificant or even justifiable, or (b) is an earth-shattering, radically transformative event that demands radical, transformative state responses.This reductive, binary framework is anti-intellectual and dangerous. One can condemn a particular act while resisting the attempt to inflate the dangers it poses. One can acknowledge the very real existence of a threat while also warning of the harms, often far greater, from proposed solutions. One can reject maximalist, inflammatory rhetoric about an attack (a War of Civilizations, an attempted coup, an insurrection, sedition) without being fairly accused of indifference toward or sympathy for the attackers.Indeed, the primary focus of the first decade of my journalism was the U.S. War on Terror — in particular, the relentless erosions of civil liberties and the endless militarization of American society in the name of waging it. To make the case that those trends should be opposed, I frequently argued that the threat posed by Islamic radicalism to U.S. citizens was being deliberately exaggerated, inflated and melodramatized.I argued that not because I believed the threat was nonexistent or trivial: I lived in New York City on 9/11 and remember to this day the excruciating horror from the smell and smoke emanating throughout Lower Manhattan and the haunting “missing” posters appended by desperate families, unwilling to accept the obvious reality of their loved ones’ deaths, to every lamp post on every street corner. I shared the same disgust and sadness as most other Americans from the Pulse massacre, the subway bombings in London and Madrid, the workplace mass shooting in San Bernardino.My insistence that we look at the other side of the ledger — the costs and dangers not only from such attacks but also the “solutions” implemented in the name of stopping them — did not come from indifference towards those deaths or a naive views of those responsible for them. It was instead driven by my simultaneous recognition of the dangers from rights-eroding, authoritarian reactions imposed by the state, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. One need not engage in denialism or minimization of a threat to rationally resist fear-driven fanaticism — as Barbara Lee so eloquently insisted on September 14, 2001.Human memories are usually short and the dominance of social media has abridged them even further. Many have forgotten that the Clinton administration seized on the 1995 courthouse bombing in Oklahoma City to radically expand law enforcement powers andescalate its demandsfor full-scale backdoor access to all encrypted internet communications. The fear necessary to justify such draconian measures was fueled by incessantmedia hypingof weekend citizen militias in places like Idaho and Montana said to be plotting armed insurrection against the federal government.One of the first major War on Terror attacks on core Constitutional rights which Iwrote aboutwas Newt Gingrich’s2006 speechsuggesting that the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee to fight terrorism should be “modified”.The former House Speaker approvingly citedaarticleby former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy — entitled “Free Speech for Terrorists?” — insisting that some ideas are so dangerous, especially in the era of terrorism and the internet, that the First Amendment must be limited to permit greater censorship powers:With an enemy committed to terrorism, the advocacy of terrorism—the threats, the words—are not mere dogma, or even calls to “action.” They are themselves weapons—weapons of incitement and intimidation, often as effective in achieving their ends as would be firearms and explosives brandished openly. . . .Do we so lack confidence (except in the sacrosanct status of speech itself) that we are unable to say with assurance that some things are truly evil, and that advocating them not only fails to serve any socially desirable purpose but guarantees more evil? Must our historical deference to opinion, however noxious, defer as well to a call to arms against innocents, or a call to destroy a form of representative government thatreligious and political freedom? May we not even ban and criminalize the advocacy of militant Islam and its métier, which is the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians? . . .In America's bumptious, bounteous marketplace, there are no limits on words as the building blocks of ideas, or on ideas as the legitimate instruments of persuasion. Terror has no place in such discourse. It is the function of law to express our society's judgments. Ours should be simple and humane: words that kill are not words we need abide.As a free speech advocate and civil libertarian, I was naturally repelled by this notion that some political ideas could be deemed so dangerous by the state that they can be legally suppressed. In response, Iasked rhetorically in 2006: “Are thereAmerican values at all in which Bush followers and neocons actually believe -- any constitutional principles that are sacrosanct and whose violations they would oppose if undertaken in the name of fighting The Terrorists?” I concluded: “It certainly doesn't appear so.”Beyond raising alarms about civil liberties erosions, I also often insisted that the underlying causes of terrorism aimed at the U.S. should be considered if for no other reason than to understand how to address it without destroying core liberties for Americans.While religious fanaticism may sometimes be the cause, far more often, I argued, such attacks weremotivated by rageover the killing of innocent people, including children, by the U.S. Government’s bombs, drones and tanks in Muslim-majority countries. Right-wing advocatesoften demonizedsuch arguments as pro-terrorist or as “justifying” terrorist attacks, but the left largely supported the inquiry into motivating causes, just as they have long supported the attempts to understand what motivates violent crime, on the ground that misguided actions are often driven by valid or at least widely shared redressible grievances. But the view that we should attempt to identify the core motives of terrorist acts or violent crime, rather than just label them evil and vow to destroy their perpetrators, was largely deemed taboo in mainstream discourse.now as every War on Terror rhetorical tactic to justify civil liberties erosions is now being invoked in the name of combatting Trumpism, including the aggressive exploitation of the emotions triggered by yesterday’s events at the Capitol to accelerate their implementation and demonize dissent over the quickly formed consensus. The same framework used to assault civil liberties in the name of foreign terrorism is now being seamlessly applied — often by those who spent the last two decades objecting to it — to the threat posed by “domestic white supremacist terrorists,” the term preferred by liberal elites, especially after yesterday, for Trump supporters generally. In so many ways, yesterday was the liberals’ 9/11, as even themost sensible commentatorsamong them are resorting to the most unhinged rhetoric available.Within hours of the Capitol being cleared, we heard truly radical proposals from numerous members of Congress. Senators and House members who objected to Electoral College certification, or questioned its legitimacy, should be formally accused of sedition andexpelled from the Houseif not prosecuted, argued Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), with other House members expressing support. Even those unarmed protesters who peacefully entered the Capitol should, many argued, be hunted by the FBI as domestic terrorists.Calls proliferated for the banning of the social media accounts of instigators and protest participants. Journalists and politicians cheered the decision by Facebook and Twitter to temporarily bar the President from using their service, and then cheered again when Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerbergannounced on Tuesdaythat the ban on Trump extended through Biden’s inauguration. Some journalists, such as’s Oliver Darcy,complainedthat Facebook had not gone far enough, that more mass censorship was needed of right-wing voices. The once-radical 2006 Gingrich argument — that some opinions are too dangerous to allow to be expressed because they are pro-terrorist and insurrectionary — is now thriving, close to a consensus.These calls for censorship, online and official, are grounded in the long-discredited, oft-rejected and dangerous view that a person should be held legally accountable not only for their own illegal actions but also for: meaning the actions others take when they hear inflammatory rhetoric. That was the distorted mentality used by the State of Mississippi in the 1970s to try to hold NAACP leaders liable for the violent acts of their followers against boycott violators after hearing rousing pro-boycott speeches from NAACP leaders, only for the Supreme Court in 1982 tounanimously rejectsuch efforts on the ground that ""while the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity,"" adding that even ""advocacy of the use of force or violence does not remove speech from the protection of the first amendment.""The complete reversal in mentality from just a few months ago is dizzying. Those who spent the summer demanding the police be defunded are furious that the police response at the Capitol was insufficiently robust, violent and aggressive. Those who urged the abolition of prisons are demanding Trump supporters be imprisoned for years. Those who, under the banner of “anti-fascism,” demanded the firing of a topeditor for publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) advocating the deployment of the U.S. military to quell riots — a view deemed not just wrong but unspeakable in decent society — are today furious that the National Guard was not deployed at the Capitol to quash pro-Trump supporters. Antifa advocates are working to expose the names of Capitol protesters to empower the FBI to arrest them on terrorism charges. And while Rep. Cori Bush’s proposal to unseat members of Congress for their subversive views went mega-viral, many forget that in 1966, the Georgia State Legislature refused to seat Julian Bondafter he refusedto repudiate his anti-war work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, then considered a domestic terrorist group.Those who argued in the summer that property damage is meaningless oreven nobleare treating smashed windows and looted podiums at the Capitol as treason, as a coup. One need not dismiss the lamentable actions of yesterday to simultaneously reject efforts to apply terms that are plainly inapplicable:. There was zero chance that the few hundred people who breached the Capitol could overthrow the U.S. Government — the most powerful, armed and militarized entity in the world — nor did they try.Perhaps many view it as more upsetting to see august members of Congress hiding in fear of a riot than to watch ordinary small-business owners weep as their multi-generational store burns to the ground. Undoubtedly, national reporters who spend much time in the Capitol and who have long-time friendships with Senators and House members are more horrified, far more so, by violent gangs in the Capitol rotunda than on the streets of Portland or Kenosha. But that does not mean that rational restraint is unnecessary when searching for sober language to accurately describe these events.There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, thousands of people shooting their way into the Capitol after a long-planned, coordinated plot with the goal of seizing permanent power, and, on the other, an impulsive and grievance-driven crowd more or less waltzing into the Capitol as the result of strength in numbers and then leaving a few hours later. That the only person shot was a protester killed by an armed agent of the state by itself makes clear how irresponsible these terms are. There are more adjectives besides “fascist treason” and “harmless protest,” enormous space between those two poles. One should not be forced to choose between the two.It has long been clear that, in the post-Trump era, media outlets looking to keep viewers hooked, and government officials looking to increase their power, will do everything possible to center and inflate the threat posed by right-wing factions. I’ve said this more times than I can count over the last year at least.Like all inflated threats, this one has a kernel of truth. As is true of every faction, there are right-wing activists filled with rage and who are willing to engage in violence. Some of them are dangerous (just as some Muslims in the post-9/11 era, and some Antifa nihilists, were and are genuinely violent and dangerous). But as was true of the Cold War and the War on Terror and so many other crisis-spurred reactions, the other side of the ledger — the draconian state powers clearly being planned and urged and prepared in the name of stopping them — carries its own extremely formidable dangers.Refusing to consider those dangers for fear of standing accused of downplaying the threat is the most common tactic authoritarian advocates of state power use. Less than twenty-four hours after the Capitol breach, one sees this tactic being wielded with great flamboyance and potency, and it is sure to continue long after January 20.",1
569,"Despite waiting for years, some Indian immigrants are now giving up their green card dreams",-8.33,44.0,https://qz.com/india/1871644/indians-on-h-1b-visas-are-giving-up-on-their-green-card-dreams/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,qz,25,"Thirty-eight-year-old Amey first went to America to study at Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. Both he and his wife, who works at one of the world’s top biotech companies, are on the H-1B, a non-immigrant visa allowing foreigners to live and work in the US. One of Amey’s previous employers applied for his green card in 2011. Almost a decade later, a green card still eludes him.“We’ve been waiting patiently for our green card since nine years now and it will likely take another 10-plus years till we get it,” says Amey, who like the other Indians in America whom we spoke to for this story asked that we publish only their first names to avoid drawing attention from US immigration services.Over the last decade, Amey has worked at several technology startups. “I helped them launch award-winning products, hire teams, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding,” he says.A few years ago, he and his wife opened a mom-and-pop store in suburban Philadelphia where they hired around 15 local workers. Today, they live in Los Angeles with their two-year-old son and a five-year-old Goldendoodle.For millions of Indians who went to the US on the H-1B visa in the early 2000s, a green card was a tangible next step to security and freedom. The chances of getting one now, however, look grim. Indians ranging from those working on the frontlines in America’s fight against Covid-19at hospitalsto those employed at tech behemoths likeNetflixandGoogleare among those on the interminable line for green cards.Immigration Voice, a US nonprofit, has been sharing their stories on social media to help drum up support for a group it refers to as “legal high-skilled future Americans.”Of the total 1 million green cards given out every year, just 140,000 are for employment-based applicants. The majority of the rest goes to family-based applicants. And because of the annual 7% country cap on green card allocations in the employment route, Indians face unprecedented backlogs.“The bottom line is that the H-1B system is old and has many flaws, but has become the main vehicle for great foreign-born talent to enter the US either directly or after being employed as students” on OPT visas, says Ran Harnevo, the CEO of Homeis, an online network for expats and foreign-born nationals around the world. “There are super-talented employees that totally rely on this visa for several years with (a) very slim opportunity to evolve to a better visa or a permanent residency.”By the start of 2030, the green card backlog will exceed 2.4 million petitions, virtually ending all legal employment immigration from India and China, the countries with the most employment-based green card petitions, the Cato Institute’s immigration policy analyst David Bierwrote in a March 2020 brief.Getting the H-1B visa—a pre-requisite before an employer can sponsor an employee—is a herculean task in itself.Dhaval, 34, immigrated to the US from India in 2008 to pursue a PhD in computer science. He thought life would be much easier once he completed his doctorate but his name was not drawn in the H-1B lottery for four years. His optional practical training (OPT) period ran out and he had to enroll in a masters program that offered CPT (curricular practical training) to continue working.“In these five years of constant struggle with getting the immigration work visa, even after having the highest possible level of education, I lost valuable time in starting the green card process,” he said. In an upsetting twist of fate, he finally got the visa—but then his company decided to stop sponsoring green cards due to constant immigration rule changes carried out by the Trump administration.H-1B visa-holders typically hesitate to change or quit jobs, since losing H-1B status could get them kicked out of the country. Even if Dhaval switches jobs and gets a new sponsor within the year, the wait for a green card could be longer than 80 years.US president Donald Trump’s hardline anti-immigrant stance has made a historically onerous process all the more challenging. Under his administration, application denials and requests for evidence both have gone up.During a recent vacation, Amey’s visa drew extra scrutiny for reasons not known to him. He spent close to 40 days working remotely from another country until his visa was approved.Dallas resident Anuja, a post-doctoral research fellow in biochemistry, has faced similar issues. “Being on a visa has many problems, especially in my field, which comes under the technology alert list,” she says. “When I travelled to renew my student visa towards the end of [my] PhD in 2013, I had to spend five weeks in India to receive clearance to travel back to the USA.”Dhaval, Amey, and Anuja all give the same reason for wanting a green card: freedom. The freedom to change jobs and fields, to travel, to start companies, to buy properties and put down roots, and more.In spite of waiting it out for years, several green card aspirants have gotten fed up.“President Trump’s visa restrictions are a ‘kiss of death’ for American innovation, and signal to the most vulnerable communities that their immense social contributions simply don’t matter anymore,” said Homeis’ Harnevo. “He has shattered their American dream, and now they have nowhere to turn.”Canada, for one, makesimmigration much easierthan the US, and Indian-born workers in the US are taking note.Dhaval opted for Canada’smerit-based immigration systemin 2019 and got permanent residency status within a year. He plans to make the move in the coming months.According to the Cato Institute, the number of Indians applying for permanent residency in Canada has doubled since 2016. Amey, too, started looking into migrating to Canadian around a year ago, citing “uncertainty, the political rhetoric, and the constant anxiety related to the American legal immigration process.” The family is in the final stages of getting permanent residency in Canada.But not everyone has an easy way out.Anuja, who hails from Mumbai, is still holding out hope for permanent residency in the US because “the kind of research I am involved in doesn’t happen in India,” she says. She is trying to get her green card via the EB1 route, nicknamed theEinstein visasince it’s reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their fields. But the fear of things not working out is palpable.“If we were to lose our jobs today,” she says, “it would mean a flight back to India despite having spent our young years being as productive as possible in researching and mentoring, paying taxes, and being law-abiding citizens…not to mention visa issues in India due to havingUS-citizen kidsif you decide to go back.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2
570,Supreme Court sides with Nestle and Cargill in case alleging child slavery,-0.67,48.33,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-sides-with-u-s-companies-in-case-alleging-wrongdoing-abroad/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,cbsnews,25,"The Supreme Court  sided with food giants Nestle and Cargill on Thursday and threw out a  lawsuit that claimed they knowingly bought cocoa beans from farms in  Africa that used child slave labor.The justices ruled 8-1 that an appeals court  improperly let the lawsuit against the food companies go forward. The  companies had been sued by a group of six adult citizens of Mali who  claimed they were taken from their country as children and forced to  work on cocoa farms in neighboring Ivory Coast.""Although respondents' injuries occurred entirely overseas, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents could sue in federal court  because the defendant corporations allegedly made 'major operational  decisions' in the United States. The Ninth Circuit erred by allowing  this suit to proceed,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a majority  opinion for the court.The case had been twice dismissed at an early stage before being revived by the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. When the case was argued in December,  then-President Donald Trump's administration backed Nestle and Cargill.The  Malian citizens had argued that Minneapolis-based Cargill and the  American arm of Switzerland-based Nestle ""aided and abetted"" their  slavery as children by, among other things, buying cocoa beans from  farms that used child labor. The group sued, seeking to bring a class  action lawsuit on behalf of themselves, as well as who they say are thousands of  other former child slaves.Nestle  and Cargill have maintained throughout the case that they have done  nothing wrong and that they have taken steps to combat child slavery. In  statements following the ruling both Nestle and Cargill repeated that  they remain committed to working to combat child labor in the cocoa  industry.The  case involves a law enacted by the very first Congress in 1789, the  Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreign citizens to sue in U.S. courts for human rights abuses. But Thomas said this case wasn't properly in U.S. courts.""Nearly  all the conduct that they say aided and abetted forced labor —  providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms —  occurred in Ivory Coast. ... But allegations of general corporate  activity — like decisionmaking — cannot alone establish domestic  application of the ATS,"" he wrote.Attorney Paul Hoffman, who argued the case for the Malian citizens at the high court, said in a statement that he was ""disappointed that the Court has delayed our clients' long quest for justice."" But he said it was not the end of the case. He said intends to ask a lower court  to be allowed to amend the group's lawsuit and allege that Cargill and  Nestle ""controlled the system of forced labor from the United States.""The high court in recent years has limited the use of the Alien Tort Statute. In 2018, the court ruled that foreign businesses cannot be sued under the law. In that case, the court rejected an attempt by Israeli victims of attacks in the West Bank and Gaza to use U.S. courts to sue Jordan-based Arab Bank, which they said helped finance the attacks.The case is Nestle USA v. Doe I, 19-416, and Cargill Inc. v. Doe I, 19-453.",2

More importantly, it doesn’t solve any of the problems they’re trying to solve. At the end of the day, what would it solve? Absolutely nothing.“It’s party politics and trying to sound tough to the public, but they can’t answer the important questions.""The former civil servant also said it was unlikely to deter people from coming to the UK to seek asylum: “Whether they think immigrants wont come here because they know they will be put on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, I don’t think that will wash. People will still come. Ultimately, many won’t be returned home.”Tony Gray, a former Border Force employee who left five years ago, said he believed the ideas indicated the “mindset of the government and the home secretary at the moment”.""They’ve made lots of promises and lots of tough statements about sending people back, but it’s very difficult for them to actually achieve that, and they knew that from the start.”Mr Gray added that some of the asylum seekers he saw arriving in Kent during his time with Border Force were “extremely vulnerable” and would not cope well in a far-flung centre: “Many of them have gone through incredibly a lot, from those who have been bombed out of their homes, to those forced out by armed groups.”According toThe Times, Number 10 is considering buying retired ferries and converting the vessels into processing centres to house asylum seekers off the UK coast, and also discussed moving migrants to decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea for processing, but the idea was rejected.TheGuardianreported that the government was considering sending asylum seekers could to detention centres in Papua New Guinea, Moldova, or Morocco, in a version of the Australian “offshore” model.It claimed leaked documents had revealed Downing Street had asked officials to look into the matter, but was met with “pushback” from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.The ideas echo those floated by the Labour government in 2003, which included establishing a “protection zone” in a country such as Russia or Albania, and a potential processing centre in Tanzania, but were quickly concluded to be unfeasible.Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and former senior civil servant of more than 20 years, was chief economist at the Cabinet Office when those ideas were floated.“The motivation for this now is the same as it was then,"" he said. ""The idea that we can somehow convince people that if they get here they’ll be shipped offshore and they’ll be in camps and their claims will probably be denied and they’ll be shipped back home.“And the objections then were the same as what you’ve seen now – which is on the humane side, the legal side and the practical and cost side. It’ll cost a lot, they’ll end up with a lot of legal challenges and many of the people will end up staying here anyway.""He said that in order to resolve the issue of large numbers of people in the asylum system, the government must invest more resources in processing asylum claims “quickly and humanely”, referring to the growing backlog in the waiting times for asylum decisions.Official figures show the number of asylum seekers waiting longer than half a year for their claim to be decided hit a record high this year after surging by 76 per cent in 12 months. Meanwhile, the number of people granted asylum reached its highest level in 16 years, with more than half of claimants granted protection at the initial decision stage, compared with only a third the previous year.Mr Portes added: “What’s the humanity in shipping people more than likely to be genuine asylum seekers off to some offshore processing centre where they may languish for years? This government has done some bizarre things so it’s not impossible. But would it actually achieve very much, probably not.""Immigration barrister Colin Yeo said the proposals were “very unrealistic” and were an attempt to confront a problem that was not really there.“There are huge practical obstacles to it, not just around the cost and logistics but the moral consequences on what happens when you detain people in that way in foreign countries,” he said.“The one idea that does seem potentially doable and is probably lawful is putting people on a ferry. But why would you do that? There aren’t that many of them. If you’re going to detain them, why not have them on-land?“Most of these people are genuine refugees, the numbers reaching the UK are much smaller than other EU countries, and the numbers are actually falling on previous years. The idea that you need extreme measures to deal with a problem that is not really a problem at all seems unreal.”Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, wrote a letter to the home secretary on Thursday saying the proposals seemed to be “both extremely inappropriate” in terms of the UK’s commitments to human rights and to asylum, and an “incredibly impractical and expensive” way of doing so.Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham, said it was “completely right” for the Home Office to look at ways of deterring asylum seekers from coming to the UK, but called for any solution to be “civilised”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, he said: “Talk of oil rigs and Moldova and Papua New Guinea, to me, is somewhat bizarre. You're determined for me to say it is a great idea to put people on islands - I'm not saying that.”The Home Office is completely right to look at other options so there is some sort of deterrent, but not the Australian model where you have poor welfare standards and everything else. We've got to find a civilised version of that.”Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said the timing of the proposals was “remarkable” given that it came a day after the response to the Lessons Learned report was published, in which the Home Secretary spoke of building a better Home Office.“Australia’s offshore processing policies are absolutely not a system to be admired or emulated, they have received international condemnation because of the levels of human cruelty involved,” she added.Kate Allen, Amnesty international UK director, described the proposals as “entirely immoral and inhumane”, adding: “It is a dismal reflection upon Home Office Ministers that this idea to effectively exile people seeking asylum to far-flung and isolated places has been given any consideration at all.“For too long the Home Office has done its worst business behind closed doors, with little consideration of the needs, rights and welfare of women, men and children affected by it.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the government’s speculative plans were “inhumane and morally bankrupt” and “steeped in racism”, adding that they would expose vulnerable people to “horrendous human rights abuse and trauma”The Home Office has been approached for comment.Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesStockWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

572,Capitol Incident a Dress Rehearsal,-7.67,34.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2021/01/08/capitol-incident-a-dress-rehearsal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,consortiumnews,23,"Written on Jan. 7ith the normalization of mass shootings in the United States it is more than understandable that members of Congress feared for their lives when they learned protestors had forced their way into the Capitol in unknown numbers and were roaming around at will.But by the time it was over we knew that: only five weapons were seized by police so most of the intruders were probably unarmed; the only shots fired were by police who killed an unarmed female protestor; video and photos showed the demonstrators taking pictures of chambers and art work like they were tourists; and the occupiers were peacefully led out of the Capitol six hours later.  (Had they been anti-racism protestors one wonders how differently it would haveended.)A dramatic event such as this is an old-time reporter’s dream, to just describe the facts and details as they emerged, painting a picture in words in print or on the radio. With so many mobile phone pictures and video as well as TV cameras everywhere, that journalistic function has been greatly diminished if not extinguished. In its place are preaching, partisan, editorialists masquerading as mainstream journalists.By the time it was over it was clear what had not happened:  it wasn’t a “coup,” it wasn’t an “insurrection,” it had nothing to do withPutin, or China or Iran and it wasn’t like Pearl Harbor, as Sen. Chuck Schumer ridiculously tried to call it.It wasn’t the storming of a “temple of democracy,” interrupting Congress’ “sacred duty,” or “desecrating” the “hallowed halls” of the Capitol. Such quasi-religious rhetoric inflates the self-importance of officials elevating themselves above the people they are supposed to serve.It was not the storming andoccupationof the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru in 1996 or the 1985seizureof the Palace of Justice in Bogota, Colombia.It was in some ways the downtrodden forcing their existence into the faces of an elitist Congress who serve very powerful interests instead.But it was also the delusive manipulation of desperate people by Donald Trump, a master manipulator who for his own interests has somehow convinced millions of Americans that he is their champion whose re-election was stolen from them, even when it is doubtful their lives were much improved over the past four years.What this event did is send a message, which went beyond claims of a stolen election, a message that no one in Congress or the media will openly acknowledge, if they’ve gotten the message at all, namely, that as long as Congress and the rest of the Establishment continue to ignore ordinary Americans’ interests and serve only their own, the anger and the desperation in the land will explode, rendering Wednesday’s events merely a dress rehearsal for what may well turn into a full-blown insurrection.  Congress must understand this before it’s too late.Joe Lauria is editor-in-chief ofand a former UN correspondent forThe Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, and numerous other newspapers.

The new administration also should ensure that all 3- and 4-year-olds have access to quality preschool, Marten said.She also called for reinstating the National Teacher Corps, a 1965 program that trained teachers to work in disadvantaged schools.“Now before anyone discards these ideas as unrealistic given the current economic climate, let me remind you that every one of the San Diego strategies for school reform came out of the 2008 financial crisis,” Marten said during a pre-recorded speech, which wasdelivered onlineand received about 2,200 views.“Hard times breed clarity of purpose. We can create an educational recovery plan that meets the needs of all of our students by focusing on equity.”Marten warned that the pandemic is causing severe learning losses because of school shutdowns. A national recovery plan with funding for schools is needed to reverse those losses, she said.California public schools were spared from state budget cuts this school year, but there is no such guarantee for next year.“We now risk losing the progress we have made if we must contend with State budget cuts in January,” Marten said.Marten also described what the district has done so far during the eight-month long pandemic.Officials said the district has distributed more than 80,000 Chromebooks and 8 million free meals to children.Marten said San Diego is providing more daily, “live” instruction time than other California districts. San Diego Unified schools are providing three hours of live instruction each day during distance learning.Marten and School Board President John Lee Evans said students are suffering losses due to school closures, but they didn’t say how much learning loss is happening among San Diego students. The district has not yet released data about students’ academic progress during this school year.Evans said the plan is still for San Diego Unified to reopen on Jan. 4 for elementary students and on Jan. 25 for middle and high school students. But the reopening could be postponed if San Diego County does not improve its COVID-19 rates quickly enough to get out and stay out of the purple tier.“We all know that our students are suffering. We know that damage is being done by this pandemic,” Evans said. “Every person — the superintendent, the board, and all our staff — are working diligently to make sure our schools can open as soon as possible in the safest possible manner.”",2
574,Swedish Coop supermarkets shut due to US ransomware cyber-attack,0.0,45.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57707530,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-03,bbc,25,"Some 500 Coop supermarket stores in Sweden have been forced to close due to an ongoing ""colossal"" cyber-attack affecting organisations around the world.Coop Sweden says it closed more than half of its 800 stores on Friday after point-of-sale tills and self-service checkouts stopped working.The supermarket was not itself targeted by hackers - but is one of a growing number of organisations affected by an attack on a large software supplier the company uses indirectly.Cyber researchers say about 200 businesses have been hit by this ""colossal"" ransomware attack, which had mainly affected the US.Cyber-security firm Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. The firm believes the Russia-linked REvil ransomware gang was responsible.Kaseya said in a statement on its own website that it was investigating a ""potential attack"".A spokeswoman for Coop Sweden told the BBC: ""We first noticed problems in a small number of stores on Friday evening around 6:30pm so we closed those stores early. t was much bigger and we took the decision not to open most of our stores this morning so that our teams could work out how to fix it.""The whole paying system at our tills and our self-service checkouts stopped working so we need time to reboot the system.""It's understood that Coop doesn't use Kesaya directly on its systems but that one of their software providers does.The case highlights the growing concern in the cyber-security world about so-called supply chain attacks where hackers are able to claim multiple victims by attacking their supplier.The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, a federal body,said in a statementthat it was taking action to address the attack and urging users of the Kesaya software to shut it down.The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said: ""We are aware of a cyber incident involving Kaseya, and we are working to fully understand its impact.""Ransomware is a growing, global cyber threat, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk and follow our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.""The cyber-breach looks to have been timed for maximum disruption as it emerged on Friday afternoon when companies across the US were clocking off for the long Independence Day weekend.Kaseya is urging customers that use its VSA tool to immediately shut down their servers.Kaseya said in its statement that a ""small number"" of companies had been affected, though Huntress Labs said the number was greater than 200.It is not clear what specific companies have been affected, and a Kaseya representative contacted by the BBC declined to give details.Kaseya's website says it has a presence in more than 10 countries and over 10,000 customers.""This is a colossal and devastating supply chain attack,"" Huntress Labs' senior security researcher John Hammond said in an email.At a summit in Geneva last month, US President Joe Biden said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin he had a responsibility to rein in such cyber-attacks.Mr Biden said he gave Mr Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, from energy to water, that should not be subject to hacking.REvil - also known as Sodinokibi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal groups in the world.The gang was blamed by the FBI for a hack in May that paralysed operations at JBS - the world's largest meat supplier.The group sometimes threatens to post stolen documents on its website - known as the ""Happy Blog"" - if victims don't comply with its demands.REvil was also linked to a co-ordinated attack on nearly two dozen local governments in the US state of Texas in 2019.This video can not be playedTechnology explained: what is ransomware?What is ransomware?

577,Census misses create worries of Hispanic undercount,-6.33,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/census-misses-create-worries-of-hispanic-undercount/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,rollcall,23,"Joseph Garcia spent months working to ensure that Hispanic residents of Arizona got counted in last year’s decennial census. After this week’s release of the first set of results, he worries the government still missed thousands of them.Arizona, along with Texas and Florida — other states with large Hispanic populations — fell short of expectations in Monday’s reveal of census data, resulting in smaller gains in congressional seats than projected, or none at all. Historically, the census has missed portions of Hispanic communities, shortchanging them on representation and in millions of dollars in federal programs, said Garcia, executive director of the advocacy group Chicanos por la Causa Action Fund.“I just don’t want everyone to focus on ‘Oh, we didn’t get another congressional seat’; the harm is much deeper than that,” Garcia said. “It’s compounding because it’s going to be year after year after year over the next decade of less funding for all these services, which are really needed by many people.”In addition to apportionment, census results are used to draw legislative maps and help guide more than $1.5 trillion in federal spending every year. However, it’s uncertain at this point how many people the census process may have missed.During Monday’s reveal of the results, Census Bureau officials cautioned the apportionment totals did not include any demographic information. Additionally, they pointed out the population for states such as Texas and Florida came within 1 percent of the projections it previously made.Multiple experts said it could be months before the public gets a better picture of the accuracy of the 2020 census. Detailed redistricting information that will include race and ethnicity data is slated for release over the summer.Even the Census Bureau itself doesn’t know at the moment — much of the accuracy assessment for the count is based on a post-count survey the agency will complete by next year.In 2010, the Census Bureau’s post-enumeration survey indicated the agency may have undercounted the Hispanic population by as much as 1.5 percent nationwide.Tom Wolf, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said assessing potential undercounts is “really a story that is going to be compiled over the next year.”However, he pointed out there are “all sorts of factors that would trend toward decreasing the quality and equity of the count” that could show up in later data releases.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki referred questions about a potential undercount of the Hispanic population to the Census Bureau during a news briefing Tuesday. She noted, though, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration’s effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportionment data and gave the agency extra time to finish the census results.Redistricting expert Kim Brace said Monday’s population results revealed the potential for a significant undercount of the Hispanic population nationwide. It will take more data to know for sure, he said, but if there are undercounts, it will make it harder to draw fair congressional and legislative seats in the coming months.“My gut tells me” that Hispanics who “got turned off by the Trump administration’s actions and the citizenship issue probably did not participate in the census. That doesn’t bode well for redistricting,” Brace said.Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Education Fund, found it “surprising” that states with large Hispanic communities fell short of projections.“Once more details are released, we will be able to better determine to what extent the Latino population was fairly and accurately counted,” Vargas said in a statement.Still, half of the 10 states with the highest Hispanic populations — California, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and New York — beat the Census Bureau’s earlier estimates of their population growth.All five had significant statewide efforts to boost census participation, including a campaign of more than $180 million funded by California, which still lost a congressional seat. Vargas’ statement noted those efforts may have made a difference in beating estimates, however.The other five states with large Hispanic communities — Texas, Nevada, Florida, Arizona and Colorado —  all came in under Census Bureau projections. Arizona had the largest miss in the country, with its population count coming in more than 3 percent below the Census Bureau estimate.Vargas had previously criticized the Trump administration for its failed attempt to include a citizenship question on the census and for attempting to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment process. Before the actual headcount started, his organization released multiple surveys that found more noncitizen and undocumented immigrant respondents saying they would not respond to the census than the general public.As many as three-quarters of respondents in those surveys expressed concerned about what the Trump administration would do with census responses. Those concerns also surfaced in multiple lawsuits over the Trump administration’s actions and amid congressional oversight efforts.Federal law prevents the disclosure of census responses, and Census Bureau advertisements and outreach materials included that fact.However, the pandemic complicated in-person outreach and efforts to convince people to respond on their own by mail or online, Garcia said.He and other advocates had to pivot plans to convince people to respond in person to census door-knockers trying to find residents who failed to respond on their own. That added to the difficulty of convincing people frightened by the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the process, Garcia said.“It was a perfect storm, and I think it should be pointed out that Donald Trump artificially seeded the clouds on that perfect storm,” Garcia said.",2
578,"As Herschel Walker eyes Senate run, a turbulent past emerges",-2.67,43.33,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,apnews,25,"ATLANTA (AP) — At first glance, Herschel Walker has a coveted political profile for a potential Senate candidate in Georgia.He was a football hero at the University of Georgia before his long NFL career. He’s a business owner whose chicken products are distributed across the U.S. And he’s a Black conservative with backing from former President Donald Trump, a longtime friend.But an Associated Press review of hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker’s business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported, sheds new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid. The documents detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior.Walker, now 59, has at times been open about his long struggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder. But it’s unclear how he would discuss these events as a candidate.Walker did not respond to requests for comment. Multiple emails went unanswered, although his executive assistant confirmed they were received. AP also sent emails and left a message with his long-time attorney, who did not respond.The Georgia seat is a top target for Republicans as they try to take control of the U.S. Senate in next year’s midterm elections. Walker’s potential bid is a wildcard. He might easily win the GOP primary with Trump’s help, setting up a general election fight against Democrat Raphael Warnock, who became Georgia’s first Black senator after a special election in January. But Republican leaders in Washington and Georgia are concerned that Walker’s history might haunt his campaign.Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table,” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview. “But as others have mentioned, there’s also a lot of questions out there.”Walker has yet to announce his intentions, but he has been consulting with political advisers in Georgia. A native of tiny Wrightsville, between Atlanta and Savannah, the former Dallas Cowboys star retired after the 1997 season and now resides in Texas. In a video posted to Twitter last month, he revs the engine of a sports car and says, “I’m getting ready, and we can run with the big dogs,” before revealing a Georgia license plate.The Twitter tease intensified buzz about the potential for a celebrity candidate. But it also helped surface details about Walker’s troubled past, many first disclosed by Walker himself in his 2008 book, “Breaking Free.”His account details years of struggles and an eventual diagnosis in 2001. Walker describes himself dealing with as many as a dozen personalities — or “alters” — that he had constructed as a defense against bullying he suffered as a stuttering, overweight child.In an AP interview at the time, Walker emphasized his purpose was to help others with similar disorders. “People say, ‘Herschel is just trying to write something to make money,’” he said. “I say, ‘Guys, why would I write something like this to make money?’”The National Alliance on Mental Illness describes dissociative identity disorder as “alternating between multiple identities,” leaving a person with “gaps in memory of everyday events.” It notes men with the disorder “exhibit more violent behavior rather than amnesia.”In his book, Walker acknowledges violent urges. He writes that he played Russian roulette and recounts sitting at his kitchen table in 1991 pointing a gun, loaded with a single bullet, at his head. “I wasn’t suicidal,” Walker explained, but “just looked at mortality as the ultimate challenge.”The book is framed as a turnaround story. He describes it as cathartic and casts himself as someone on the path to “integration” because of therapy and his Christian faith.A watershed moment, he writes, came in February 2001, when he drove around suburban Dallas, hunting for a man who he said was avoiding his calls after being days late delivering a car Walker had purchased.“The logical side of me knew that what I was thinking of doing to this man — murdering him for messing up my schedule — wasn’t a viable alternative,” Walker wrote. “But another side of me was so angry that all I could think was how satisfying it would feel to step out of the car, pull out the gun, slip off the safety, and squeeze the trigger.”Ultimately, Walker wrote, he had a change of heart after seeing a “SMILE. JESUS LOVES YOU” bumper sticker on the man’s car-hauling truck. He decided to seek professional help.“I’d been running for most of life, from what only I really knew but seldom talked about. It was time to stop running and face some harsh realities,” he wrote.Walker’s threatening behavior continued well after the 2001 revelation, according to court records obtained by AP that have not previously been reported.Four years later, in December 2005, Cindy Grossman, Walker’s ex-wife, secured a protective order against him, alleging violent and controlling behavior.Grossman has said she was long a victim of Walker’s impulses. When his book was released, she told ABC News that at one point during their marriage, her husband pointed a pistol at her head and said, “I’m going to blow your f’ing brains out.” She filed for divorce in 2001, citing “physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.”In seeking protection from a judge in Dallas County, Grossman filed an affidavit from her sister, which described Walker as unwilling to accept that his former wife had begun dating another man.Grossman told the court she got calls during that period from her sister and father, both of whom had been contacted by Walker. He told family members that he would kill her and her new boyfriend, according to Maria Tsettos, Cindy Grossman’s sister.In an affidavit, Tsettos claimed Walker once called looking for his ex-wife while she was out with her boyfriend. Tsettos took the call and said Walker became “very threatening” when told of Grossman’s whereabouts. In Tsettos’ recollection, Walker “stated unequivocally that he was going to shoot my sister Cindy and her boyfriend in the head.”On another occasion, Tsettos said she talked to Walker “at length” after he’d reached out to her online. He “expressed to me that he was frustrated with (Cindy) and that he felt like he had ‘had enough’ and that he wanted to ‘blow their f------ heads off,’” she recalled of the Dec. 9, 2005, exchange.Two days later he called again and told Tsettos that he possessed a gun and planned that day to act on his threats, which he repeated in graphic language, she said.Later that day, Walker confronted his ex-wife outside a mall when she was picking up their son from a party, according to her petition for a protective order.In her account, she said Walker “slowly drove by in his vehicle, pointed his finger at (her) and traced (her) with his finger as he drove.”When officers in Irving, Texas, contacted Walker, he denied that he’d made the threats, according to a police report the AP obtained through a public records request. But the sister’s account was concerning enough to police that they took for “safe keeping” a gun Walker had on the floor of his car, the report states.A judge agreed, finding “good cause” to issue a protective order. He also barred Walker from possessing guns for a period of time.Grossman, her divorce lawyer and Tsettos did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP.Walker’s unpredictable behavior has carried into his chicken business, now known as Renaissance Man Food Services, according to court filings. His book itself was a shock.The primary distributor of his products considered severing their relationship after Walker’s book came out. Kristin Caffey, then a poultry manager for the food distributor Sysco, said the revelations in the book, as well as Walker’s effort to publicize it, created “havoc” for the company.“We weren’t aware that it was coming out, and we were blindsided,” Caffey, who worked directly with Walker, said in a 2019 deposition. “We had all kinds of people calling in about it, and we didn’t have answers to it,” she added, saying, “it was problematic for us being engaged with him at the time.”Ultimately, the company chose to stick with Walker after the negative publicity died down, Caffey said.More recently, Walker has made outsize claims about his business record. In repeated media interviews, Walker claimed his company employed hundreds of people, included a chicken processing division in Arkansas and grossed $70 million to $80 million annually in sales.However, when the company applied for a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan last year, it reported just eight employees. (It received about $182,000 in COVID-19 aid.)In a recent court case, Walker gave far more modest revenue figures, indicating that the company averaged about $1.5 million a year in profit from 2008 to 2017. Meanwhile, Walker’s business associates testified in the same case that he doesn’t own chicken processing plants, as he claims. Instead, they described him as a licensing partner who lends his name to the enterprise — not unlike the kind of deals his friend Donald Trump has used to expand his brand for decades.A wrongful termination lawsuit filed in 2018 by a friend and former manager of Walker’s company created an extensive record of Walker’s leadership. Although a judge ruled against the employee, John Staples, emails, documents and depositions in the case present Walker as a temperamental and unreliable business partner.Walker persistently complained that his business partners were trying to cheat him out of money, the documents say. And they indicate he repeatedly fought with his associates over his focus on branching into frozen waffles, which he believed would be a future moneymaker for the company.In 2017, an executive for the company that supplied chicken to Walker sent a concerned email, inquiring about $7,200 in expenses he said Walker had incorrectly tried to bill the company from his efforts to secure the waffle deal. The executive, now Simmons Foods Chief Operating Officer and President David Jackson, also cited “concerning comments” he’d heard that “raise questions about how the business is being operated.” The email does not detail the comments that raised alarms.Staples did not respond to requests for comment. Jackson’s office did not make him available for comment, and a message left with a spokesperson for Simmons Foods was not returned.In a deposition, Walker dismissed Staples as a “puppy.”“I’m a big dog. I don’t play with puppies,” Walker said.Since then, another business venture tied to Walker could also face trouble.Last month, a Texas bank sued Walker and another business partner over an unpaid $200,000 debt secured to help finance a pizza restaurant. According to court filings, Walker personally guaranteed the loan.Walker has not yet filed his response to the suit.Slodysko reported from Washington; Bleiberg reported from Dallas.",1

584,Democrats Push Further Into GOP Territory With Fundraising Surge,-8.67,45.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/democrats-push-further-into-gop-territory-with-fundraising-surge/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-16,about.bgov,17,"Democrats across the competitive House landscape turned in yet another strong fundraising quarter, bolstering the party’s bid to expand its hold on the chamber.In 44 of the 58 districts the Cook Political Report rates as competitive, Democratic nominees raised more than their Republican opponents from July through September, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed by Thursday’s deadline. That includes historically GOP-leaning districts in southside Virginia, southern Minnesota, Long Island, N.Y., and Alaska, along with the suburbs of Phoenix, Indianapolis, Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta.Rather than hunker down to protect the most vulnerable seats picked up in the 2018 wave, Democrats are seeking to parlay their fundraising advantage and Joe Biden’s lead in the presidential election into a larger and more durable majority.“Right after the November elections in 2018, the word was that Chairwoman Bustos had the toughest job in town,” said Michael Fraioli, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, referring toCheri Bustos(Ill.), head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “That’s all turned around now. Not only are we not going to lose seats as Democrats, but we’re going to pick up some and the question is how many and where.”Of the 58 districts rated competitively, 30 are held by Republicans, 27 by Democrats, and one by a Libertarian. Republicans need a net gain of 17 seats for a majority. The Cook Political Report says a Democratic gain of up to 10 seats is the most likely outcome.Most Republican incumbents in competitive, suburban districts were outraised by their Democratic challengers. Democrats made major gains in suburban districts in 2018, thanks to a combination of voters’ frustration with President Donald Trump and, relatedly, college-educated voters moving away from the Republican Party. It paved the way to a 40-seat net gain.“Were fighting very hard,” said Sarah Chamberlain, president of Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports several suburban Republicans. “We’re hoping to not see a wave in the suburbs, but the more people I talk to — it’s close.”Unlikely opportunities for Democrats to make gains include Virginia’s 5th District, a conservative-leaning area that runs from the North Carolina border to exurbs of Washington, D.C. Cameron Webb (D), a doctor and first-time candidate, raised more than $2.7 million in the quarter compared with $723,000 for Bob Good (R), who ousted Rep.Denver Riggleman(R) at a district convention in June.In Arizona’s 6th District, a well-educated and Republican-friendly area enveloping parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale, physician Hiral Tipirneni (D) raised more than three times what Rep.David Schweikert(R) brought in and ended September with nearly triple what the incumbent had in cash on hand. Schweikert has been hobbled by ethics violations, and the House voted in July to reprimand him.Republicans and Democrats attributed Democrats’ strong fundraising to the party’s online tool, ActBlue, which directs small, online donations to candidates that need it the most. The GOP’s online fundraising system, WinRed, hasn’t been around nearly as long and isn’t as established among donors.“One of the fundraising advantages Democrats have — and it’s one of the few we have — is we’ve really lapped the Republicans on candidate online fundraising,” said John Rowley, a Democratic consultant. “It’s an area where Republicans haven’t caught up.”“It all goes back to ActBlue,” Chamberlain said.Rob Simms, a former executive director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, cautioned that while the numbers are impressive, it’s not necessarily a show of electoral strength.“One thing that often gets lost looking at these numbers is the overwhelming majority of Democrats’ money is coming from outside the district and outside of the state,” Simms said. “You have this energy on the Democratic side fueling the fundraising, but a lot of it is coming from New York, L.A., and San Francisco.”There were some bright spots in third-quarter fundraising for Republicans, who are targeting the more than two dozen Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016.Iowa state Rep. Ashley Hinson (R) reported more in third-quarter receipts and cash on hand than freshman Rep.Abby Finkenauer(D) in a district Trump narrowly won. Iowa’s 1st District, which includes Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, is one of only 11 Democratic districts rated as a Toss-up. South Carolina state Rep. Nancy Mace (R) topped freshman Rep.Joe Cunningham(D) in both categories in a coastal district Trump won decisively, though the Cook Political Report still gives Cunningham the advantage.The jaw-dropping amounts from Democrats in swing districts has allowed the DCCC — the party’s House campaign arm, which itself announced topping $70 million in third-quarter receipts — to invest in offensive opportunities, including nine districts where Trump won by 10 or more points. That includes suburban areas where Democrats made large gains in 2018 and hope to continue to expand in 2020.The DCCC’s independent expenditure arm, which controls where it spends tens of millions of dollars on advertising, booked $648,000 in New York’s 1st District in recent weeks to aid college professor Nancy Goroff’s (D) challenge to Rep.Lee Zeldin(R) on Long Island. It also booked $330,000 in ads in Arkansas’ 2nd District, based in Little Rock, where state Sen. Joyce Elliott (D) is taking on Rep.French Hill(R). The Cook Political report currently gives Republicans the edge in both.Democrats also reserved airtime in several other Republican districts, such as Alaska, where Rep.Don Young— the House dean — has held the state-wide seat since 1973. Rowley said these buys illustrate not only the party’s fundraising advantage and the political environment, but also how well-positioned many of most vulnerable Democratic freshmen are.“It’s freed them up to play real offense,” Rowley said. “If they weren’t within striking distance, they wouldn’t be in those races. It’s not the culture of the Democrats to casually play in Alaska and Arkansas.”To contact the reporters on this story:Emily Wilkinsin Washington atewilkins@bgov.com;Greg Girouxin Washington atggiroux@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Kyle Trygstadatktrygstad@bgov.com;Bennett Rothatbroth@bgov.com",2
585,Pensions for local public safety employees are skyrocketing,5.0,37.67,https://capitolweekly.net/pensions-for-local-public-safety-employees-are-skyrocketing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,capitolweekly.net,15,"Growing public pension deficits have plagued our nation for years, but in the midst of some of the harshest fiscal blows from the pandemic, this problem is something we can no longer ignore. While California champions itself as a leader of positive change in the United States, we also happen to be the leader in skyrocketing pension obligations. And there are no signs of this unsustainable pattern slowing down.In 2018, Transparent California found that the average pension for city or county public safety employees was $108,000 a year. According to CalPERS, that retirement benefit of $108,000 at age 50 is worth $1,673,000 invested in a private single-life annuity, and somewhat higher with survivor benefits (which most safety workers choose). With this exorbitant retirement pay, it’s no wonder that eachCalifornia household is on the hook for $81,634.Although many tax measures for fire funding are successful, voters in some of the most liberal parts of the state have started to push back and vote against them.To add to the enormity of this problem, consider that there are more retired firefighters than active firefighters in this state. Even slashing beneficial community programs is not enough to meet the union promises made to these workers. As a result, many unions have turned to tax increases as a potential solution. Although many tax measures for fire funding are successful, voters in some of the most liberal parts of the state have started to push back and vote against them. In fact, a½ sales tax pushed by the fire unions, despite threats of extended response times, was recently voted down in Sonoma County.In the face of this opposition, union leaders are finding other ways to drum up a steady cashflow, whether it’s through afirst responder feeor taking over ambulance services from private industry veterans.For years, California localities have relied on private emergency ambulance companies to provide quality, efficient emergency services. And to combat inequity in access to ambulance services, the state moved primarily to countywide-run ambulance systems overseen by the County EMS Agency. This mix of public and private collaboration has been conducted successfully for over 50 years, until now.Arecent studyby Reason Foundation identified fire departments in California that have recently been pursuing, and in some regions established, what is called an “Alliance Model,” in which the fire department is given, “the decision-making power of a full EMS agency, but without the oversight of an EMS agency.” This means they are getting all of the responsibility without any accountability—and while the fire departments may reap a short-term windfall from collecting ambulance fees, they are only adding to their long-term pension obligation.The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations.A proposed state law –Assembly Bill 389– would codify the Alliance model and make all of its anti-competitive antics legal. Ultimately, the Alliance model puts the fire department’s interests before the taxpayer or patient. This backwards model came to fruition in Contra Costa County in 2016, and even after rejection from the Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA), the county still moved forward with implementation. Not only does this model result in reduced industry competition, but it also diminishes quality of care and response times for patients.Despite these concerning outcomes, the cities of Chula Vista and Oxnard are now in the process of reviewing possible implementation in their own localities. Models like these are designed to cut corners to benefit the bottom line, not to prioritize the individual relying on emergency services for help. This is also reflected in fire departments that seek to take over ambulance services in what is called an “Ambulance Operator Programs.”Because public agencies must provide the same expensive pension benefits and early retirements to their EMTs as they offer to other workers, in fire department run Ambulance Operator Program, EMT positions have to be filled with inexperienced workers at lower wages.Governments will have a monopoly, residents and their insurance companies will likely pay more for ambulance services, and our communities will be served by less senior EMTs and paramedics. All so that the public employees may continue padding their retirement funds.The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations, and the only solution their unions can seem to come up with is attacking the private ambulance providers who have loyally served Californians for generations. Contracting these services back to the government to clean up their own mess is just wrong. Taxpayers want the best services for the lowest cost, and it’s clear that private ambulance providers are the only option that satisfies that need. Californians deserve better.Editor’s Note:Marcia Fritz is a retired CPA who spent 30 years serving public clients such as state agencies and local municipalities.

586,"The MAGA Riot in Washington Was the Natural Culmination of Donald Trump’s Influence — And, Just Maybe, Its Swan Song",-19.17,34.0,https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-uprising-in-washington-was-the-natural-culmination-of-donald-trumps-influence-and-just-maybe-its-swan-song-1234880114/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,variety,21,"As corrosive and unsettling as the images of lawlessness from the U.S. Capitol have been today, there’s a twist of fate at their core so brutally ironic it can make your head spin. When the MAGA protesters, turning off their incendiary right-wing TV and Internet channels and getting off their couches, set out for Washington to foment what Joe Strummer 44 years ago called a “white riot,” they probably didn’t expect to be competing with the headline “Democrats Retake the U.S. Senate.” Because, of course, few observers werethe game-changing referendum we got from the two Senate races in Georgia.The grand paradox is that you can link that seismic pair of Democratic wins directly toDonald Trump’s 10 weeks of drum-beating over his increasingly destructive fantasy of election fraud. Why? Because his descent into total demagogic loopiness revealed his nature so starkly it turned voters off? No. Because enough Republicans were actually brainwashed intohim. They didn’t bother to show up for a “rigged” election, thereby making Trump a victim of his own success.Since today’s insurrection was all about the issue of election fraud, the Georgia vote lent the events an irony of extraordinary bite. And what it indicated is that the whole “Biden stole the election!” issue, as perilous and scary as it has often seemed, has proved in the end to be the ultimate political orgy of hot air: a great deal of smoke without fire. The far-right uprising in Washington today was framed, in the minds of those who participated in it, as a Boston Tea Party/burning-of-the-Reichstag defining moment. But it felt more like the Last Gasp of Trumpism heard round the world.Which isn’t to deny that it was disturbing as hell: not just a mob scene, not just a protest laced with anarchy, but a messy, furious, middle-class-yob-posing-as-rebel attack on the rule of law. Yet even as the images of the MAGA faithful swarming the steps of the U.S. Capitol, or climbing its walls like a scruffy medieval horde in windbreakers, seared themselves into our national memory play with a shock value that was undeniable, in another way the protest, the riot, the violent tantrum — whatever you want to call it — had a weird “OK, let’s finally do this!” inevitability about it.The right wing in this country has been nattering on about “civil war” ever since that person at a Tea Party rally held up a sign that said “Keep the government’s hands off my Medicare!” Today’s mini high-concept rehearsal for civil war was the natural culmination of what Trump and his enablers have been egging his supporters on to do for some time — from Trump’s shout-out to the Proud Boys in the first presidential debate, when he asked them to “stand back and stand by,” to Rudy Giuliani’s exhortations to “trial by combat” this morning.Yet it wasn’t just Trump’s winking appeals to lawlessness that incited today’s chaotic action. The nature of those who live in an alternate reality is that there’s something essentiallyabout their entire belief system. No,Joe Bidendidn’t steal the election; the truth of his victory has been ratified by every state and dozens of courts. And no, the Democratic Party is not controlled by a cadre of elites who run a child sex-trafficking ring. But if you believe the former (which most Trump supporters do), or if you believe the latter (the central article of faith in QAnon, the online cult that’s now moved to the center of the Trump cult), you’re not living in the real world. And that means that politics has become, for you, a kind of media-fed shadow play, a dance of illusions dressed up as “news.” “Drain the swamp” isn’t a policy; it’s a fairy-tale metaphor posing as policy.When your political beliefs are mired in the world of illusion, there may be a special need to transform those beliefs into something physical and tangible, to prove — to yourself! — that you’re not just another Fox News simulation-game ditto-head but a badass who means what you say. An assault on the Capitol Building is a metaphor that can feel “real” because it looks just like something you saw in a Gerard Butler movie.Is the insurrection we saw today the beginning or the end of something? Those on the right will want to see it as the beginning. They reject the very foundation of the Biden presidency (that thing called voting, otherwise known as democracy), and so today was the day they stood up, climbed the walls, and declared that they stood for something else: power at any cost. But the flip side of power, or at least unseemly displays of it, is impotence. And that, sealed by the amazing Democratic triumph in Georgia, may wind up being the signature quality of the post-presidency of Donald Trump, and all those who’ll now follow him like lemmings off the cliff of his own ego.It’s fashionable to say that Trump will continue to wield extraordinary influence. But I would argue that the last two months, fueled by his pathological obsession with election fraud, have changed the Trump brand. For a long time, Trump supporters could at leastthat he stood for things like standing up to China or shouting down political correctness. But now Trump stands, first and foremost, for the idea that he’s “still really the president,” and that Joe Biden is occupying the office under false pretenses. That’s not just politically outrageous; it’s nuts. And that’s what the armchair anarchists in Washington stood for today: not simply trashing America but going through the looking glass to do it. They’ve left us with a lasting image of what it looks like when political action loses its mind.",1
587,San Diego home price gains stall,0.0,44.67,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-11-18/san-diego-home-price-gains-stall,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,sandiegouniontribune,20,"San Diego County home prices in October did not increase from the previous month for the first time since May.The median home price for all homes — single-family, condos, townhouses — was $650,000, unchangedfrom last month, said CoreLogic data provided by DQNews on Wednesday. The price is still up a substantial 13 percent in a year, but marked a rare slowdown in price appreciation that has defied expectations throughout the pandemic.Many of the circumstances that experts say have driven up prices across the nation are still present: Record low mortgage rates, lack of home inventory and desire to own a home as many people are stuck working outside offices.Mark Goldman, a real estate analyst with C2 Financial Corp., said one month’s worth of data is probably nothing to write home about yet. He said the fundamentals of the housing market haven’t changed and are unlikely to stop the upward pressure on prices.“Most indicators of housing demand continue to remain strong,” he said, “so this one data point, which is something to be aware of and something to watch, is not necessarily a harbinger of the market turning.”Goldman said there are things that could push the home price up in the coming months, such as optimism about the future because of a COVID-19 vaccine or (depending on your political persuasion) a new president. However, he said fear from potential buyers that the economy may take a turn for the worse, or concern the housing market is at its high point, could  lower prices.One factor that didn’t change in October was the lack of homes for sale in San Diego County — which experts point to as the primary reason for rising prices. There were 5,058 homes listed for sale in San Diego County from Sept. 28 to Oct. 25, said theRedfin data center. That is down from 7,651 around the same time last year and 9,312 in 2018.Real estate agent Gary Kent said news of a vaccine, and its potential widespread distribution could mean sellers who are on the fence could put homes on the market and increase inventory. He said he has spoken with potential clients over the past few months who were waiting because of the virus.Kent said increased supply could mean there is less upward pressure on prices, but he — similar to many housing experts — was hesitant to say that prices could actually decrease. But, it might make the process of buying a little easier.“I don’t at all see some massive price drop,” he said, “but people might say, ‘I don’t have to make an offer the first day over list price and maybe I could negotiate a bit.’”Despite the overall median price stalling, the main part of the San Diego market hit a new high. The resale single-family home median hit $730,000 in October, its highest ever and up from $715,000 in September and August.The resale condo price fell $10,000 from its peak in September to $475,000. The newly built home median was $726,000, down from the record $812,500 in October 2018 when there was an increase in luxury, single-family homes for sale.There were 4,292 home sales in October, roughly the same level it has been for four months. It is a stark contrast to April when there 2,327 sales, its lowest in years, and was the result of homes being pulled off the market as the pandemic began.Interest rates have never been lower, but it doesn’t necessarily mean homes are cheaper. In October, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 2.83 percent, saidFreddie Mac, down from 3.69 percent the year before.That means the monthly cost of a median-priced home now would be around $2,430 a month, assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan and including property taxes and home insurance. That is up slightly from roughly $2,390 a month for a median home at last year’s prices and interest rates.However, that scenario would require a roughly $130,000 down payment, compared to $114,600 a year earlier.Across the six-county Southern California region, the median home price was down 0.8 percent. Orange County had the biggest monthly increase, 1.3 percent, to a median of $795,000.It was followed by San Bernardino County up 1 percent for a median of $400,000, and Los Angeles County up 0.7 percent to a median of $715,000. Ventura County was down 1.5 percent for a median of $655,000, and Riverside County was down 0.6 percent for a median of $445,500.",2
588,President Trump Seems to Have a Problem With Yamiche Alcindor. Why Is That?,-15.12,39.62,https://www.vogue.com/article/yamiche-alcindor-donald-trump-feud,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-31,vogue,23,"At Sunday's coronavirus press briefing, held in the Rose Garden of the White House in front of a smattering of reporters and government officials, all practicing social distancing, President Donald Trump made some startling announcements. In addition to backing away from his earlier proclamation that thecountry would be back to normal by Easter, and instead announcing that the country would be under shelter-in-place ordersthrough the end of April, he soberly predicted thatat least 200,000 Americans might die from COVID-19during the current pandemic, adding that the reason that number wasn't higher was because his administration had “done a very good job.”But the most charged moment of the press conference was whenYamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent forand a former reporter forThe New York Times, asked the president why he had recently said that some state governors might not need as much medical equipment as they had requested from the federal government to fight the frighteningly rapid spread of COVID-19. (OnSean Hannity's Fox News Channel show last Thursday, Trump said: ""I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,"" an apparent reference to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's recent claim that the state needed 30,000 ventilators.)Referring to Trump's remarks on that show, Alcindor addressed the president and said, ""You've said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. You said New York might not need 30,000 — """"I did not say that. I didn't say that,"" Trump responded.""You said it on Sean Hannity's Fox News, you said that you might — "" Alcindor said.""Come on, come on,"" said Trump said, cutting her off again. ""You know, why don't you people act — why don't you act in a little more positive — it's always trying to getcha, getcha.""Alcindor tried to ask the question again, but the president continued, ""And you know what, that's why  nobody trusts the media anymore."" He added: ""Look, let me tell you something. Be nice. Don't be threatening.""As Alcindor continue to press the president, he turned toward another reporter and a White House aide came over to Alcindor and snatched the microphone from her hand.It wouldn't be the first time Trumpwould show a flash of anger over Alcindor's questioning.Ata White House press conference in 2018, shortly after the midterm elections, Alcindor asked the president about comments he made at a rally that October, where he labeled himself a nationalist. Alcindor pointed out that some interpreted the comment as embracing white nationalists.Trump, looking annoyed, said, ""I don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question.""On Monday, at another White House coronavirus briefing, the president called on her again, and Alcindor asked why the United States was lagging behind other countries, including South Korea, in providing coronavirus tests for their citizens. He answered, ""We have done more tests than any other country in the world, by far.""Then the president challenged her on the premise of her question. ""I know South Korea better than anybody. It's a very tight — do you know how many people are in Seoul?"" he asked. ""Do you know how big the city of Seoul is?"" Alcindor just kept looking at him, poised to press her question again. ""Thirty-eight million people,"" Trump said, ""That's bigger than anything we have. Thirty-eight million people, all tightly wound together."" (The actualfigure is close to 10 million.)Finally, he stared at her, seemingly exasperated: ""You should be saying congratulations rather than asking a really snarky question.""ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesWith that, he announced the press briefing was over, turned his back on the reporters and quickly strode into the White House.On Sunday night, Alcindortweeted out her response to the interaction with Trump: ""President Trump today at the White House said to me: 'Be nice. Don't be threatening.' I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused.  Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.""What about Alcindor seems to get under Trump's skin so much?April Ryan has a theory.Ryan, like Alcindor, is a longtime Washington reporter whohas verbally tussled with the president at contentious White House news conferences.And Ryan, like Alcindor, is African-American.Ina 2018 essayfor, Ryan wrote about how Trump had frequently attacked her  (""nasty,"" loser""), Alcindor (""racist"") and another African-American reporter, CNN's Abby Phillip (""I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions"") in ways that seemed more deeply personal than his criticism of their white, male colleagues.The Washington Postheadline was: ""I’m a black woman. Trump loves insulting people like me.""Wrote Ryan: ""When Trump denigrates black women, he’s sending the message that he doesn’t see us equally.""With the latest round of exchanges this week, other journalists and prominent figures weighed in, echoing Ryan's sentiment.

""Pathetic when insecure men can’t stomach strong black women.""OnMonday's episode of the podcast""Pod Save America,"" Alcindor declined to speculate whether Trump might be singling her out because of her race. Instead she pivoted, saying that, in the face of this pandemic crisis, ""We don't have time for foolishness; we don't have time for sideshows.""Of course, Alcindor isn't the only reporter Trump has attacked during his three years in office.He's banned CNN's Jim Acostaand said to Peter Alexander, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" when the NBC reporter asked of the coronavirus outbreak: ""What do you say to Americans watching you right now who are scared?""ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesBut as others have pointed out, Trump does seem to have a particular problem with women who challenge him, regardless of race.As Molly Jong-Fast wrote forin November, during the Ukraine hearings of the House Intelligence Committee, Trump took to Twitter to lash out at Marie Yovanovitch,  the former ambassador to Ukraine, in ways that seemed more pointed than his earlier criticisms of previous witnesses, Yovanovitch's fellow diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. (""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" his tweet began, before ending with ""it is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. "")""Why was the president’s response so different to witnesses who were roughly saying the same thing?"" Jong-Fast asked. ""What was the big difference between Kent and Taylor and Yovanovitch? All three are career diplomats, all three are Ivy League graduates, all three have worked in the State Department, all three are experts in Ukraine. But only one of them is a woman. Could that be why the president singled out Yovanovitch? It is almost as if the president is unable to control his rage against women.

Most particularly, he should stop sitting for interviews at all. In yet another Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump continued to beat the drum on his mental acuity and proved once again that he has none.Can't stop watching Trump on the cognitive test:""The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s like you’ll go 'person, woman, man, camera, TV.' So they say could you repeat that? I said, yeah. 'Person, woman, man, camera, TV.' Okay, that's very good.""pic.twitter.com/Ggv42oGliu— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)July 23, 2020Trump told interviewer Marc Siegel in an interview on Fox News that he took a cognitive test at Walter Reed Medical Center in November to prove to voters and the “fake news media” that he is “sharp” and fit to be president. For some reason, however, he would not admit at the time that a cognitive test was included in the visit, saying only that it was a routine annual physical (which does not include a cognitive test), discounting his reasoning because nothing is “proven” to the public when you don’t tell anyone.After a disastrous interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, which aired on Sunday, Trump took much criticism for his rambling answers, his insistence that a basic cognitive test to rule out dementia was “hard,” his utter resistance to fact-checks, and his dismissive attitude toward the coronavirus response that has left more than 140,000 Americans dead.Trump keeps boasting about passing a cognitive test — but it doesn’t mean what he thinks it doeshttps://t.co/nHXJ3Kds2l— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost)July 23, 2020Trump’s approval numbers are at their lowest and, for context, is on track to be the same as George H.W.

In fact, when asked what the NBA stands for, Trump said, “Apparently not the anthem” and then punched Jared Kushner in the round balls.But seriously folks, Trump, who is the president of people with a nice set shot, has a whole lot of thoughts on basketball players kneeling during the national anthem because he knows it excites his base when he says something.Since the NBA restart, the majority of players and coaches have been locking arms and taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem to protestthe over-policing of communities of color.“When I see people kneeling during the playing and disrespecting our flag and national anthem, what I do personally is turn off the game,” Trump said Wednesday morning in a phone interview with,according to TMZ Sports.“I think it’s disgraceful. We work with [the NBA], we worked with them very hard trying to get open. I was pushing for them to get open. Then I see everybody kneeling during the anthem. That’s not acceptable to me. When I see them kneeling during the game, I just turn off the game. I have no interest in the game. Let me tell you this, plenty of other people out there, too.”Trump also claimed, without proof, that NBA ratings are way down because Trump only gets his rating numbers from what white people are watching.According toYardBarker.com, “ratings are up 14 percent from when the season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.”This isn’t the first time that Trump has butted his orange-dusted nose in sports business. Miami Heat forward Meyers Leonard’s president famously called NFL players’ moms “bitches” for kneeling during the national anthem in 2016.Since the season checked ball, only four people — two players (one being Leonard) and two coaches — have stood for the national anthem, YardBarker.com reports.Players have been wearing social justice buzzwords on the backs of their jersey, but as one person noted on Twitter, I haven’t seen one player with the jersey name “Stimulus Check.”",1
592,Montgomery County issues new order to block in-person classes at private schools until October,-3.33,51.33,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-elrich-hogan-schools-20200805-2k6mwqglknf7rhqfxecf2id64e-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,baltimoresun,24,"Montgomery County officials doubled down on their efforts to keep private and religious schools closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, issuing a new order Wednesday to block in-person classes until October.That county has been in a dispute with Gov. Larry Hogan for the last several days over who has the authority to determine whether private schools can bring students back to campus.Montgomery’s health officer, Dr. Travis Gayles,issued an order last weekpreventing any in-person classes through Oct. 1. The Republican governorresponded Monday with his own orderstripping health officers of their ability — which Hogan had extended earlier in the pandemic — to close or modify county rules for school opening, with the goal of negating Montgomery County’s order.Gayles responded Wednesday eveningwith a fresh order to keep the schools closed, citing a different portion of state law that authorizes health officers to act to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.“The purpose behind what we’re doing is to keep kids safe,” Gayles said earlier Wednesday.Gayles said the transmission rate and number of new cases in the county and the region remain too high to safely open schools for in-person classes.Montgomery County has had nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 755 deaths since the virus emerged in Maryland in March. It’s second only to Prince George’s County in number of cases and ranks first in the state for related deaths.Most public school systems in Maryland, including Montgomery County, have chosen to offer online-only classes to start the school year, decisions that were made by local boards of education. Some private schools, however,are planning to offer in-person instruction.Private and parochial schools argue their parents and students want in-person classes and theschools are better able to meet safety recommendations. Non-public schools typically have fewer students than public schools, and some have large campuses and additional facilities that allow students and staff to maintain their distance from each other.The dispute over limiting in-person classes is another example of how studentswill have different access to education during the pandemicdepending on where they live, their family wealth or which school they attend.Montgomery County, with some of the state’s best public and private schools, has become the epicenter of the growing national debate. A group of Montgomery private school parents is challenging Gayles’ order in federal court. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for Aug. 14.County Executive Marc Elrich said Hogan’s action to strip health officers of the authority to proactively shut down schools showed “no logic.”“I was surprised. I don’t think it was appropriate. I don’t think it is supported by data,” said Elrich, a Democrat,  during an online briefing with reporters Wednesday.“It makes no sense to have a policy to, on one hand, say: ‘I’m perfectly fine with the entire public school system of every county that wants to close it to close.’ And then, on the other hand, just saying: ‘I’m OK with private schools opening,'” Elrich said. “There is no logic.”Elrich said children and employees at private schools are just as at risk of contracting and spreading the coronvirus as children and employees at public schools.“I don’t understand the separation of the problem as more serious for one group than another group,” said Elrich, a former public school teacher.Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci responded to Elrich’s comments with a statement: “The governor has made himself clear: private and parochial schools deserve the same opportunity public schools have had to make reopening decisions based on public health guidelines. The county’s blanket closure mandate was overly broad and inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer.”",2

But Afghans argue that the U.S. still has considerable power to influence the Taliban even after most American troops leave the country: through international sanctions.This week, a Washington-based advocacy group called the Afghanistan-U.S. Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council began lobbying Congress and the Biden administration to seek new United Nations sanctions on Taliban figures. Its effort has not been previously reported. Separately, Afghan foreign minister Haneef AtmartoldThe Wall Street Journal that world powers should reinstate U.N. travel restrictions on Taliban leaders.“While the Biden administration is resolved in leaving Afghanistan, it still can lead within international institutions. The Taliban will not respect its calls for peace without a show of force,” the group said in a Friday statement. “Without the U.S. to lead on sanctions, other nations will move to recognize the Taliban in efforts to stem an inevitable refugee crisis. This would be an absolute failing of the U.S. and the international community.”Supporters of stronger sanctions hope they will convince the Taliban to slow its onslaught. When the ultraconservative armed movement previously ruled Afghanistan, it was a pariah. Combined with the toll of a civil war and the Taliban’s repression, that isolation made life miserable for most Afghans. In negotiating with Washington as they seek to regain power, Taliban representatives have repeatedly said they do not want to lose foreign support like the aid and expertise that Afghanistan has come to rely on since the U.S. invasion in 2001.Tougher international restrictions on prominent Taliban members could show that countries will shun a Taliban-dominated government in Afghanistan if it violates rights standards and steamrolls other local players like pro-Western Afghans.Without a global rebuke of the offensive, however,Chinaor other powers like Iran might soon decide to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate leader, killing the prospect of a multinational effort to limit the group’s brutality.U.N. sanctions could affect prominent Taliban members who are based in Qatar, the small Persian Gulf state that hosted the talks leading to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and other Taliban forces in Pakistan.A senior Afghan lawmaker who recently fled a Taliban offensive explained their support for sanctions to HuffPost.“Those who have committed atrocities have to be recognized internationally. They will understand that they will not receive legitimacy if they continue to do atrocities,” said the lawmaker, who requested anonymity for fear of Taliban retribution against family members who are still under the group’s rule. “The U.N., the U.S. and other countries who are involved in Afghanistan should understand that … with keeping quiet about the atrocities that the Taliban are doing, they are inviting the Taliban to do that.”As the Taliban have taken over Afghan cities and districts in recent weeks, they havedetainedand killed relatives of officials in the U.S.-backed Afghan government,forcedwomen to marry their fighters andtargetedjournalists.The lawmaker said that civil servants and activists in their hometown were told by local Taliban representatives to surrender and provide information like their home addresses; the lawmaker advised them not to because those details would make it easier for them to be hunted down. The Taliban is also forcing local families to provide young men as fighters, the parliamentarian added.An international response matters because Afghans are deeply affected by apparent global apathy toward them, the lawmaker said. “We are demoralized, we cannot continue, because we think the world is backing the Taliban instead of the people of Afghanistan.”An official at the U.S. mission to the U.N. said that the Biden administration is open to tightening sanctions.“If the Taliban continues down their current path of violence it will affect the Security Council’s review of the travel ban exemption and the status of designations,” the official told HuffPost via email. The official did not comment on potential new sanctions.Biden aides say the U.S. continues to support the Afghan government and wants the Taliban to halt its assault in favor of talks to establish a power-sharing agreement. But the administration knows the next few weeks could bring a very different outcome. The president sent 3,000 troops to Afghanistan on Thursday to help withdraw many of the staff at the sprawling U.S. embassy in Kabul and he is speeding up efforts to evacuateAfghans who previously worked with American forcesand are now Taliban targets.The Taliban’s takeover of more than two-thirds of Afghanistan ― and the collapse of U.S.-backed government forces in many areas ― has occurred far more quickly than American and Afghan officials expected, suggesting they could soon take their ultimate prize, Kabul.The continued onslaught risks millions of Afghans’ lives and could shatter the society that has developed in the country over the last two decades, as women have come closer than ever to equal rights and foreign assistance has improved issues like humanitarian conditions and press freedoms.The lawmaker who escaped a recent Taliban assault said it was hard to believe how quickly their life seemed to crumble.One month ago, they were telling contacts abroad that instead of seeking safe passage out of the country for progressive Afghans, they should support their attempts to stay in their homes. “Now, after the things I saw, I think we have to find ways to leave instead … It’s better to have someone alive outside the country instead of someone who’s dead inside of the country.”To the parliamentarian, like many Afghans, recent developments echo painful memories of Afghanistan’s civil war of the 1980s.“It’s the same stories that my mom was telling me: We left everything behind, we had only one small bag,” they said. “Now this has happened to me.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

595,What Are Debris Flows and Why Are They Dangerous?,0.0,47.33,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-22-debris-flow-threat-california-rain,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,weather,25,"A​ newer version of this article appearshere.California is bracing for dangerous and potentially deadly landslides in the coming days, as much-needed rain moves in amid historic drought conditions.Terrain left barren by wildfires is most vulnerable to an especially dangerous and fast-moving type of landslide that scientists call ""debris flows."" Known less formally as mudslides, these flows are typically triggered by short, intense rainstorms and can send a wall of water, soil, ash, vegetation, rocks and other debris careening downhill, sweeping away or burying everything in its path.""A debris flow is kind of a flood on steroids,"" Jason Kean, a debris flow expert with the U.S. Geological Survey, told weather.com in an interview. ""It’s all bulked up with rocks, mud, even boulders – and boulders can be the size of cars.""Latest Forecast for Western Storms)The threat of landslides usually increases in the fall as wetter weather typically starts to move across the West Coast. A parade of storms forecast into next week has parts of both California and Oregon on alert for debris flows.The USGS and other agencies work together to assess the debris flow threat in burn scars each year. So far they've completed assessments for about 60 fires in nine western states. The public can read themhere.Among the areas of highest concern in California this year are the Dixie, Monument and Alisal fire burn footprints, Jaime Kostelnik, also a geologist on the assessment team, told weather.com in a recent interview.In Oregon, areas with high risk include parts of the Devils Knob, Jack and Bootleg burn areas.But any burn scar can potentially be at risk, and conditions can change over time depending on the weather and other factors.The cumulative effects of extreme wildfires in recent years make the situation even more hazardous, especially in California. Many of the areas impacted by wildfires have burned more than once in recent years.Besides destroying vegetation that would normally hold soil and debris in place, wildfires change certain characteristics of the soil itself. It becomes less likely to absorb water, which creates conditions ripe for flash flooding and debris flows, according to Kean and Kostelnik.""As (the water) runs off, it picks up all these loose soil particles that no longer have vegetation to hold them in place and then it bulks up into that debris flow that can move really fast and start actually within minutes of intense rainfall,"" said Kean.Debris can rush down a hillside at a rate over 35 mph and then flatten out and spread even farther when it reaches the bottom of a slope.California Faces Third Year of Extreme Drought)At least 20 people were killed when mudslides with walls of debris as tall as 30 feetstruck the Santa Barbara County community of Montecitoin 2018. On average, 25 to 50 people arekilled by landslidesevery year in the United States, according to the USGS.This week, emergency crews worked to prepare areas scarred by the Alisal Fire before the wet weather moved in. That includedinstalling barriersto keep mud and debris from washing over roadways, the Santa Barbara News-Press reported.Storm prep was also underway along the Caldor Fire burn scar in Sacramento, where work included placing fallen trees across bulldozer lines to hold soil in place.“The heavy predicted rains this week has us concerned, but we're going tokeep working as long as we can,” Paul Naman, a service repair supervisor at the site, told KOVR-TV.The elevated risk of debris flows in a burn scar can last up to five years after a fire. Officials in Santa Cruz County, for example, are warning people who live in the area of the 2018 CZU Complex Fire to be on alert for debris flow danger.The threat for California as a whole will increase as the rainy season moves in, usually at its peak from November through February.""California has a distinct wet season that lasts from late fall into early spring, and a dry season with little to no rainfall from late spring to early fall,"" said weather.com meteorologistChris Dolce. ""That extreme variance is related to an area of high pressure that sets up off the West Coast in summer and prevents any significant moisture from reaching the state. Conversely, in winter, that high weakens and shifts farther south, which opens the door for Pacific storms to affect California with heavy rain and mountain snow.""The state is in the clutches of a historic two-year drought. While the rain in the coming days will bring some relief, it remains to be seen how wet this year's winter will be. And experts say it could take years to catch up from the precipitation deficit.Wildfire danger, meanwhile, peaks in the fall because that's when vegetation is completely dried out prior to the arrival of the first significant Pacific storms of the season, Dolce said.Research has linked California's progressively more extreme fire seasons to climate change, and a study published last year by the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies found that the risk of post-wildfire debris flowsis also likely to go up.Experts say people in areas under threat should be alert if any rain develops, and don't wait for an evacuation order to leave if heavy rains develop.""They should take it seriously,"" Kostelnik said.",2

Logan Ave. in Bay View, said he worried that interacting with customers coming from points far and wide could sicken him and his employees. And COVID-19 began hitting closer to home, as well.""With our friends getting sick and our friends getting positives — just the worry you see in your employees' faces every day before you turn on the open sign,"" he said, made him consider the risks of serving drinks in the bar.It reached what Ramirez called a boiling point in a weekly meeting with beer and spirits vendors: the concern that he wouldn't be able to sell what he was buying, the speculation that the city might order a lockdown because of the ballooning cases. “I’m sorry, I just can’t do this right now,"" he recalled saying.So the Mothership made a pre-emptive move: It put itself on lockdown last week, shutting down indoor seating and switching to carryout only, something that several other bars and at least one restaurant have done recently. It's reminiscent of the lockdown ordered by Gov. Tony Evers in March to flatten the curve, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.""I think it’s a good time for somebody to do something,"" Ramirez said. Namely, take a step back and figure out, as an industry, “what we can do to help each other stay alive this winter. It’s going to get bad.""He's turned to online orderingof the Mothership's tiki and classic cocktails, prepared in batches of four drinks or so, and mixed six-packs of beer.Last week,Lucky Joe's in Wauwatosaclosed its dining room and lounge to return to takeout for a while because of the rocketing number of new cases. Co-owner Jarod Packard said his wife is a respiratory therapist at Froedtert Hospital.""Anything I can do to prevent her from getting any busier, is what I’m trying to do,"" he said.He hasn't put an end date on the dining room's closure, instead waiting to see where the COVID-19 numbers go.""I think it’s just a lot safer if we all do our part and close down and stay as safe as possible,"" Packard said, adding, ""Everybody else around me is who I don’t want to affect.""The move to takeout-only comes at a cost, in a year when many restaurants and bars have taken big financial hits because of the pandemic. Lucky Joe's, at 1427 Underwood Ave., also shut down briefly in October, during protests over the decision by the Milwaukee County district attorney not to charge a police officer in the shooting death of Black teenager Alvin Cole in Wauwatosa.""Usually winter is our busier season,"" Packard said.The night before Thanksgiving traditionally is huge for bars, when people travel home for Thanksgiving and gather with friends the night before for a drink. Along with get-togethers leading up to Christmas and celebrations on New Year's Eve, the last quarter of the year is the big moneymaker for the hospitality industry.""It’s a tough decision,"" Packard acknowledged. ""We’re definitely not going to make any money through all this."" But he said he's hopeful Lucky Joe's will be able to hang on by taking phone orders for cocktails kits and menu items including dinners for two while trying to keep people safe.John Revord, owner of Boone & Crockett bar at 818 S. Water St. in the Harbor District, has shifted toThe General Store at the bar, with online orderingof cocktail kits, beer, wine and cold-brew coffee.""It’s not going to make us any money; it’s not going to pay any bills,"" he said. But takeout will provide paychecks to a few employees he's able to keep on staff. ""That’s better than nothing,"" he said.He worries what closings the coming months will bring if Congress doesn't pass relief bills, namely the Restaurants Act and Save Our Stages Act. Although government loans and grants in the early phase of the pandemic were effective, he said, ""there's a need for Round 2.""Bars like his were able to make it through the first lockdown and tougher times of the pandemic thanks to a cushion from the 2019 holiday season, he said.""Everyone had their holiday nest eggs. Unfortunately, nest eggs are a rarity these days,"" Revord said.Boone might have been the first Milwaukee bar to revert to only takeout because of rising COVID-19 cases, on Oct. 30. Snack Boys restaurant on the east side, of which Revord is a co-owner, began its temporary shutdown Nov. 10.""The numbers in Wisconsin are so insane, there was no way we could justify staying open by any sort of metric,"" Revord said. As it was, he considers it lucky that Boone was already closed when he and a couple others there became ill with COVID-19, shortly after he tested negative twice within a week for the coronavirus.But many bars have to stay open because the owners simply can't afford to close to patrons, an ""unfortunate side effect of the lack of aid,"" he said. ""For some folks that does mean life or death, and that’s a really unfortunate position to be put in.""Revord said he was able to close Boone for the winter because of good weather in summer and a greatly expanded patio. The barroom itself was open for perhaps a month for service, in September and October; he estimated no more than a dozen people sat there in all that time. Everyone wanted to be outside, where the risk of catching the coronavirus was lower.""There’s no question what a packed room full of drunk people does to a disease that’s easily transmissible,"" Revord said, adding ""the quicker we get past this, the quicker we can get back to the people we want to see.""",2

600,Gyms remain open despite recent outbreak at Pacific Beach business,-5.0,44.0,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/story/2020-07-30/gyms-remain-open-despite-recent-outbreak-at-pacific-beach-business,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,sandiegouniontribune,20,"Multiple gyms across San Diego County remained open Thursday, despite the outbreak reported this week at one Pacific Beach fitness business, The Gym, that had been operating illegally.The Gym was closed Thursday afternoon, and inside a person could be seen measuring a floor mat. The nutrition shop attached to the gym remained open. The clerk at the shop said the gym was in the process of readying its equipment to move outdoors.Three people or more testing positive for COVID-19 is considered an outbreak. Of the 235 outbreaks so far countywide, five were in gyms, a county spokesman said Thursday. About half of all outbreaks were in congregate care facilities.No gym is allowed to operate indoors under the county health order first issued in March and updated again Thursday, the spokesman said. He could not say which other gyms had reported novel coronavirus cases.Many of the large chains such as Crunch and 24-Hour Fitness are closed, but some of the smaller, independent gyms have defied the county order.Another fitness center called The Gym, with different owners, was filled with clients Thursday morning in Vista, many not wearing masks or maintaining the required 6-foot distance. Co-owner Todd Danner said the management planned to move their equipment outside to the parking lot, and he did not look happy about it.“Some of these (weight) stacks weigh 1,000 pounds,” Danner said. Movers were coming to help carry things, and he needs to buy tents and artificial turf for the asphalt.He feels like his business already complies with the county’s emergency public health order, he said. Still, Vista city officials sent him a list of things that needed be done.Later Thursday, the Vista Sheriff’s Station received a formal complaint about the business, said Lt. Ricardo Lopez, media relations director for the Sheriff’s Department.“Deputies visited the business just before 12:30 p.m. to notify gym staff they were in violation of the public health order,” Lopez said by email. “They were given an updated copy of the current order. A formal crime case is being written and will be submitted to the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office.”Violation of the county health order is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, up to six months in jail, or both, Lopez said. No one answered the phone at The Gym in Vista late Thursday afternoon.The county had issued a total of 144 citations for violating the county health orders through Wednesday, according to the Sheriff’s Department’s website.Boulevard Fitness in City Heights was open and operating Thursday morning in a large open area with open garage-door-sized windows that opened nearly an entire wall of the multi-level building to open air. Fans on the floor and ceiling created a noticeable breeze throughout the space.Some areas, such as an area with treadmills and an exercise room, were closed off because they did not have windows or doors to the outside, said owner Shawn Gilbert. Customers, almost all of whom were wearing face coverings, sanitized their hands and got their temperature taken before being allowed inside. Machines were spaced 6 feet apart – Gilbert said they measured carefully – and there was a covered, open-air area outside the big windows with equipment in it where people who wanted to be all the way outside could work out.The gym was not accepting new members and it had limited use to 50 percent of the facility’s capacity, Gilbert said. He said the gym would be closed on Sunday for professional deep cleaning.Gilbert said police had come by twice about a week ago in response to a noise complaint about the music in the gym. Gilbert said the music didn’t seem particularly loud to him, but he turned it down and police left. He said police did not express any other concerns about the gym’s operations.No county officials or any sort of multi-agency “strike teams” had come to the gym, Gilbert said. He said he had not received any cease or desist letters from the county, nor any public health orders to close, and he felt “1,000 percent” sure the gym’s operations were permissible under public health orders.No classes were underway Thursday ata jiu-jitsu gymin Normal Heights that had opened in defiance of the county’s public health order in May. One employee was inside the building. The main entrance was locked and the lobby was dark. A phone call to the gym reached voicemail and an email was not immediately answered Thursday afternoon.Weights were being lifted at the Metroflex Gym in Oceanside, where owner Lou Uridel was briefly arrested in May for re-opening after a two-month closure in violation of the county health order. He has a court hearing scheduled for September.“Right now, we feel we are in compliance,” Uridel said Thursday afternoon.Mask-wearing, which for a time was optional, is now mandatory, he said. He and his employees emphasize self-care, cleanliness, and distancing, and they encourage their clients to maintain a safe distance.Occupancy of his building is limited to a maximum of 35 people, about 20 percent of its normal capacity, he said. Fans have been added and a rear door opened to keep air moving through the interior. Foot traffic is routed in one door and out another.Police officers frequently stop by to check on his business, Uridel said. He tells them he is complying with the rules and that nothing has changed, and they leave.Uridel, an attorney licensed in California and Illinois, said COVID-19 and its prevention has become a political issue and he appears OK with that. He recently decided to run for Oceanside mayor in November, and a big plank in his campaign is support for small businesses.Located close to Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, almost three-quarters of the clients at Metroflex are active-duty military or veterans. Some said they feel like a family.Don Butts, a trainer who works six days a week at Metroflex, said he feels safe there.“I haven’t gotten sick,” he said. “None of my clients have gotten sick.”Oceanside police spokesman Tom Bussey said Thursday it is the county’s responsibility, not the city’s, to enforce the public health order.Police have often said enforcement of the state and county public health orders is difficult for many reasons.Some people claim that requiring a business to close violates the owner’s rights under the state and federal constitutions. Also, because the health orders are issued by the state and county, city police departments may not have the authority to enforce them.County officials said this week they plan to form enforcement teams with representatives from each city in an attempt to improve compliance.",2
601,Ex-Rep. Ryan Zinke eyes new House seat in Montana,-2.67,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/ex-rep-ryan-zinke-eyes-new-house-seat-in-montana/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,rollcall,23,"| Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkeformed a committeeThursday to raise money to run for a House seat in Montana that will be created based onnew census data released this week.Zinke won two terms representing the state’s current at-large district before leaving to join the Trump administration in 2017.He was the first Montanan to serve in a presidential Cabinet, but heresigned in the face of ethics investigationsafter serving less than two years. In all, the former secretary came under at least 15 different investigations before leaving in January 2019.Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission indicates that the Helena-based campaign committee, Zinke for Congress, is geared toward fundraising for what will become Montana’s 2nd District. Boundaries for that seat will be drawn later this year, after more detailed census data is released.Lorna Kuney, who was listed as the committee treasurer and records custodian on the FEC paperwork, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A Republican strategist involved in House races said it is not too early to lay the groundwork for a campaign, but other candidates are likely waiting to find out more information about where and how competitive the new district will be.Despite Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock spending $49 million last fall on a run for Senate, he and his party’s House candidate were shut out, and Montana voters went for President Donald Trump over Joe Biden, 57 percent to 41 percent.At least one of the two newly drawn seats is expected to be solid GOP territory in 2022. But there’s a possibility the new seat could be competitive, depending on how the boundaries are drawn by an independent commission, appointed mostly by state lawmakers.[]It is also unclear whether Montanans will penalize Zinke for his record at the Interior Department.In October 2018, about two months before Zinke left his post, the department’s inspector general referred an inquiry it had launched into Zinke’s conduct to the Justice Department.That probe centered on a land agreement Zinke reached with an executive of oil field services giant Hallibutron in Whitefish, Mont., his hometown.Also that October, the inspector general found that Zinkebroke federal rulesby allowing family members to travel with him in government vehicles. Zinke also asked if his wife, Lola, could join the department as a volunteer, the IG said in a report.“He denied that his intention in making this request was so that his wife could travel with him in an official capacity, which would have eliminated the requirement to reimburse the Government for her travel,” the report said. “Ultimately, the employees advised him that making her a volunteer could be perceived negatively, and she did not become one.”The inspector general also found that Zinke took a security detail with him on a vacation to Greece and Turkey, costing taxpayers $25,000.In April 2018, the IG cleared Zinke of misconduct in connection with travel arrangements, including on chartered and military planes.A former Navy SEAL, Zinke showed up to his first day of work as secretary on a horse. He pushed policies to relax fossil fuel extraction and supported shrinking the boundaries of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante.Citing an inspector general report, House Democrats said the decision to shrink the size of those monuments was predetermined to benefit fossil fuel and mining interests.Zinke, whom the Senate confirmed by a 68-31 vote in March 2017, frequently used the phrase “energy dominance” to describe his efforts at the department to ease environmental regulations, and he backed a Trump administration move to allow offshore oil-and-gas drilling off every coastal state in the country, including in Florida, despite bipartisan opposition.Trump issued a moratorium in August last year to freeze oil and gas drilling in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.The Interior Department unveiled Zinke’s official portrait in December. It shows him on horseback and is based on a photo taken when he visited Bears Ears in 2017.",2
602,"Doctor, Lawyer, Insurrectionist: The Radicalization of Simone Gold",-14.33,32.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/doctor-lawyer-insurrectionist-the-radicalization-of-simone-gold/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,motherjones,25,"When rioters brokeinto the US Capitol on January 6, chants of “Fuck the police!” “USA!” or “Treason!” echoed in the marble halls. When Dr. Simone Gold got inside the rotunda, she stepped over a velvet rope and announced to anyone who would listen, “I am a Stanford-educated attorney!”Thus she distinguished herself among the motley crew of Proud Boys, MAGA types, and the QAnon shaman who paraded through the Capitol to overturn the 2020 presidential election, an event that left five people dead. Not only is Gold a Stanford-educated lawyer, she’s also a board-certified emergency room physician. Neither qualification prevented the FBI from coming to her Beverly Hills house on January 18 and arresting her. Nor did it make a federal grand jury think twice in early February beforeindicting her on five criminal counts, including entering a restricted building and obstructing an official proceeding.The arrest marked the end of one chapter in her Icarian trajectory into right-wing fame. Before April 2020, Gold had been just another over-achieving Beverly Hills doctor. But with the arrival of the pandemic, she donned her white lab coat to protest lockdowns and promote President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID treatment, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. It seems that’s all it took to find an enthusiastic audience among the MAGA faithful, putting her on a glide path to a certain kind of right-wing stardom. Conservatives who love to bash educated, liberal elites as out of touch quickly embraced Gold and gleefully touted her impressive credentials to support their attacks on public health measures designed to combat the pandemic. She sailed into their well-funded ecosystem, snagging speaking gigs, appearances on cable talk shows, and robust opportunities to fundraise.Simone Gold, with John Strand (left) uses a bullhorn to address protesters in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.Saul Loeb/AFP/GettyWithin days of her first media hit, she had teamed up with tea party groups working with the Trump reelection campaign to demand that governors reopen the economy. Fox News put her on national TV to publicly denounce lockdowns and mask mandates as overblown responses to a disease she insisted wasn’t fatal to most people. In July, her new right-wing friends ushered her tomeetings with members of Congressand Vice President Mike Pence. The sudden fame seems to have propelled her right up the steps and into the Capitol on January 6.Her arrest highlights the role of conservative media in fomenting an insurrection, but Gold’s personal experience also illustrates what experts on extremism have long known: Education is no defense against radicalization. “If you think of who is susceptible of extremist ideology, people tend to think it’s people who don’t have much education,” says Don Haider-Markel, a University of Kansas political science professor who has studied extremism and radicalization. “That’s not the case at all. It tends to be more middle class and upper class. Those who have spent more time educating themselves tend to think they know better than other people.”In fact, much like the tea partiers of the Obama era, the Capitol insurrectionists were by and large an aging, middle-class mob. Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago have dug into thedemographic profiles of hundreds of people chargedwith crimes related to the Capitol incursion. They’ve found that about 30 percent of the arrested rioters are white-collar professionals like Gold. Only about 13 percent were affiliated with traditional far-right militias or extremist groups like the Proud Boys, and only 7 percent were unemployed.Even so, Gold still stands out from that well-heeled crowd, and not just because she’s a woman. (Women make up only about 15 percent of the Capitol defendants.) Of the more than 420 defendants the Chicago researchers studied, she is one of only two lawyers and the only doctor. That’s why it’s hard not to look at Gold’s CV and wonder: How does someone go from medical school to Stanford Law School to an FBI wanted poster?Gold’s resume doesn’tscream budding far-right revolutionary as much as it reflects unusual precocity and ambition. Raised in a wealthy section of Long Island, New York, Gold, 55, likes to say that she trained as a physician at her father’s knee. Reuben Tizes, her father, was a doctor, a medical school professor, and even served as the Orange County, New York, health commissioner in the early 1970s. Her mother, Carol Tizes, was an elementary school teacher.After graduating from the City College of New York at 19, she claims she was the youngest person in her graduating class at the Chicago Medical School in 1989. She obtained a California medical license in 1990 but then enrolled in Stanford Law School, graduating in 1993. “That was my idea of rebellion,” she told areligious broadcasterin August, explaining that her father had wanted all his children to be doctors. (They are.) Her legal prowess didn’t stand out much in Palo Alto, however. I reached out to a host of her Stanford Law classmates, but none of those who responded could recall much about Gold aside from her red hair.Stanford Law School class photoThe intervening decades between law school and her indictment were unconventional only in the ambition of her professional endeavors. In January 1997, she was admitted to the New York bar and then completed a residency in emergency medicine at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. That same year, according to her LinkedIn profile, she served as a congressional fellow in DC and wrote speeches for the late Vermont senator James Jeffords, who famously left the Republican Party to become an Independent in 2001. (Susan Boardman Russ, who served as Jeffords’ chief of staff for 25 years before retiring in 2004, does not remember Gold.)Over the past three decades, Gold has practiced emergency medicine at various hospitals in the LA area, but the lure of Washington seems to have endured. According to her LinkedIn page, in 2009, she worked in DC as an assistant to Michael Oren, then Israel’s ambassador to the US, who credited her in print for stories she helped him research for theandNew Republic. Oren toldMother Jonesthat he had no memory of her working for him, nor did anyone on his staff.In Los Angeles, Gold married businessman Larry Gold and had two children. Active in the Los Angeles Jewish community, she and her husband once provided a glowing testimonial for a local mohel for the bris he performed for their son. A 2003articlefeatured Gold and her then two-year-old son in a story about “Shalom Time” at a local bookstore. She and her husband donated thousands of dollars to their children’s private, conservative Jewish day school in Beverly Hills, where Gold volunteered on the PTA, managing the shabbat swap one year.But by 2010, Gold had filed for divorce. Los Angeles County court records suggest that her relationship with her ex-husband was somewhat contentious. In 2017, a judge ordered them to attend mediation over child custody and visitation issues. (Larry Gold declined to comment for this story other than to say that he was “shocked” to learn about his ex-wife’s participation in the events at the Capitol.)In her October 2020 bookGold writes, “I have always worked with the poor and underserved,” treating ER patients in places like Inglewood, California, which she describes as a “low-income, gang-ridden majority-minority city that provided the setting for the tough 1991 dramaBoyz N the Hood.” She does not, however, include any mention of her services as a pricey “concierge physician,” which she advertised on hernow-defunct personal website: “As a C-Suite Physician, Dr. Gold works the same way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO…all with an eye toward fixing her client’s exact problem.” Gold charged $5,000 for an initial appointment and between $25,000 and $50,000 for ongoing consultations.The concierge medical practice is just one of several business enterprises she attempted to launch over the years—including, a short-lived lifestyle magazine for doctors that launched in 2006 and folded in 2008. (“Confessions of a Hospital Fundraiser,” teased one cover mockup.) In 2017, Gold started a company called Gold Healthcare Solutions that advertises assistance to hospitals facing government audits. Until recently, the company website listed as CEO the venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who’s married to the actress Sela Ward and who ran in the Mississippi Democratic primary for the US Senate in 2018.When I asked Sherman about his role at the company, he replied in an email: “I have ZERO relationship with Dr. Simone Gold’s company. I work in the medical device world and at one time she approached me with an idea she had that I vetted with some of my contacts. I was not able to achieve the kind of interest she wanted so we stopped talking about the project.” His name and photo were subsequently removed from the company website.Lots of peopleflame out in business, get divorced, and don’t end up storming the Capitol. But Haider-Markel says that those who do become radicalized are searching for broader meaning in their lives or a sense of identity. “Oftentimes there is a precipitating event. They lose a partner. They have a financial crisis,” he says. “They develop some grievance around that and connect that to a broader social movement.” If Gold was looking for a mid-life reboot, the heady mix of the pandemic, President Trump, and right-wing media provided the perfect catalyst.The moment that “changed my life completely,” she told a California KGET TV reporter in January, took place in April 2020. She had been treating COVID patients in Los Angeles emergency rooms with President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID cure, hydroxychloroquine, just a few weeks after the president had announced that the FDA would be fast-tracking emergency use authorization for the drug for COVID treatment. Trump called it “a game changer,” despite warnings from the FDA that the anti-malaria drug may cause heart rhythm problems in some people.Gold was enthusiastic about the drug’s treatment possibilities. In her book, she describes how, after extensive research, she had used hydroxychloroquine to cure a woman suffering from mild COVID. “I had expected to get kudos,” she writes. “Instead I was met with hostility.” The hospital medical director challenged her independence and dressed her down for prescribing a drug that wasn’t indicated for outpatients. Gold argued she had science to back her up, and cited the drug’s long safety profile. Unpersuaded, the medical director threatened to fire her if she ever prescribed the drug to an outpatient again.For most of her life, Gold doesn’t seem to have been politically active. She donated $1,000 to the campaign of Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) in 2019, but before that, the only other federal candidate to whom she gave money was a Democrat—California Rep. Raul Ruiz—in 2011. “I have never considered myself a political person. I’ve supported both parties at various times in my life,” she says in her book. “I’d fall in the middle of any partisan test. I don’t believe in the right-left distinction…That’s the trouble with being in the middle of the road. Sometimes you get run over.”But after the hospital threatened to fire her over her prescribing practices, Gold picked a lane. On April 14, shecalled Dennis Prager’s radio show. Prager has been broadcasting in LA since 1982, but he has become an important though underappreciated part of the modern right-wing infrastructure thanks to his online Prager University. Popular with young people and the alt-right, Prager U publishes five-minute tutorials on everything from climate change to economics. The videos are designed to promote “Judeo-Christian values.” (A sampling: “The Dangers of Islam” and “Just Say Merry Christmas.”)Identifying herself as an ER doctor, Gold described her success at treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and voiced dismay that medicine was becoming so politicized that a perfectly safe drug could not be dispensed by doctors without controversy. “The science has taken a backseat to the hatred of the president,” Prager commiserated.A week later, Gold made aseries of Twitter videos, a platform that she had rarely before used, to share her experience “practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.” Standing in her white lab coat in front of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center—a hospital she didn’t work at—Gold panned the camera over the quiet grounds. “It’s really quite empty. The emergency department volume is down,” she says. “The patient census is down.”Gold wasn’t entirely wrong about the hospital census but her causality was off. Hospitals all over the country, including in California at that time, were relatively empty because elective surgeries were canceled and fear of the virus kept people out of the ER. Doctors and nurses would soon be laid off. In her book she describes how her own hospital hours were cut by 30 percent. She doesn’t say how much this may have hurt her bottom line, but in June, her medical practice received more than $150,000 in federalbailoutloans, suggesting the lockdowns caused a personal budget deficit large enough to turn many a doctor into an activist.Subscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite podcast app.None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown and some people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital andmade a videoclaiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videospawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did.Even in such a climate, Gold’s white coat stood out, and she managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompassesa trio of nonprofit groupsfunded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriots super-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020.Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so much so that she would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even though she’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic, she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lockdowns and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committee secretary of the Council for National Policy, a secretive but powerful religious-right organization that wasworking with the Trump reelection campaignto find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings.Gold was just the sort of surrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her and said, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and we started emailing and talking, and as things have developed and she watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin laterexplained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a letter she’d written to Trump, calling the lockdowns a “mass casualty event,” which she’d been urging other doctors to sign. More than 400 had.With lightning speed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference callwith conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry andBreitbart News, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who had signed Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a woman she’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip and shoulder while trying to color her own hair because she couldn’t go to a salon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Gold said.The call sent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately with some of the major stars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on her show to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingraham said sympathetically, conflating some cherished conservative points of fury.“Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored?”It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W. Kruglanski is a co-author of the bookThe Three Pillars of Radicalization. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feel significant, a narrative to follow, and a network that supports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’s splash into right-wing media, he says, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This is sort of an overnight stardom. She has the narrative, and she now has the network that supports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors” summit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-day summit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on the steps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” and spent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claims suggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, no surprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes that some gynecological problems are caused by having sex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,” she said. “Nobody needs to get sick.”President Trump and his son Don Jr. retweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down for spreading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day.Simone Gold’s summer media splash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager.Gold has claimed that the California hospital she worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, and says she hasn’t practiced medicine since. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that, she appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show, one of the most watched prime-time cable news shows, with more than 3 million regular viewers.On the show, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold’s hospital had fired her. “Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored?” he asked.Gold agreed and then seized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxychloroquine to Carlson’s millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I don’t know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country is supposed to work, and physicians should be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you’re not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that’s scary.”In a sign of how far down the far-right rabbit hole she’d already gone by then, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people had said since the video aired, she had retained attorney and conspiracy theorist L. Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want to say that’s defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election.By early fall,it was clear that Gold’s original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The virus spiked across the country and researchers declared hydroxychloroquine useless for treating COVID. Even Trump didn’t take it when he got sick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Gold seems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which hasn’t had her on the air since July. She had turned America’s Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website, spokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right fever swamp.For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or public speeches with QAnon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, B-list talk show luminaries, and a few politicians, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop the steal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radio showhosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federal standoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea haswritten a manifestocalling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they didn’t submit to Biblical law.The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lockdowns and were vaccine skeptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, the second-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since then, Gold has made at leastsix different appearanceson the network founded by televangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off.In mid-August, when she headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made a surprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold’s behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you’re gonna make a stand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It’s going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar’s televangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for being so generous,” and talked about the small donations from viewers she’d received. “It really adds up,” she said gratefully. “It gave me some breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”“I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you’re gonna make a stand. It’s going to take money to do that.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold’s anti-vaccine advocacy, which she pivoted to as hydroxychloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival eventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracle service,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-right siteInfoWarsand has called the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religious services in violation of a stay at home order. Gold took the stage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-long speech, where she decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. She said it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, which she dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,” she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’re signing up to be in a pharmacovigilance tracking system.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able to separate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lockdowns and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on the subject in public other than to suggest that“Orange Man bad”and not science drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy.Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as polls showed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop the steal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degree suggests she is smart enough to know a big lie when she sees one, but “stop the steal” was where the action was, not to mention the speaking gigs and fundraising ops she now relied on for her livelihood since her medical career cratered. Once she started down the MAGA path, there was no turning back.When Trump supporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Court steps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” to seize power by scaring people with a disease that she said causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, theDaily Stormer, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person was stabbed.That didn’t stop Gold from coming back to DC to speak with many of the same people at the January 5 “stop the steal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter” shirt, Gold said to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is the same reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We are sick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski isn’t surprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had been stolen. “In many cases the radical groups first shower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your good standing in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold was scheduled to speak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But the speeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them.She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model who serves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lockdowns over the summer and now lives with Gold. On the steps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best to stop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist the siren call of an interview with theWashington Post. In aJanuary 12 story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainly speak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,” she said, explaining dubiously that she thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internet sleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used incourt filingsto describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold were standing.” Videos and still photos also show the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told thePostthat she worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted.Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of her standing in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted poster seeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L. Lin Wood wasfacing disbarment effortsin Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold.So why did she do it?It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let’s start with her own reflections on what happened, which were surprisingly uncomplicated: “When you’re crossing the street and the light turns green, you go,” she said in aninterview with KGET. Shaking her head somewhat ruefully, she added that she came up with the “genius” idea to give the speech she had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,” she stammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.”“Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it.”Several months before her arrest, she foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, or should, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one’s career and personal life,” she wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we have seen. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in this situation?’ It’s this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.”It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one who seems to be having a midlife crisis in plain sight. And yet, Haider-Markel says that while most people don’t react to personal existential crisis by storming the Capitol, it might not be that surprising that Gold did. Many people who’ve spent a long time investing in their own education and status tend to socialize with others—like, say, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills private school—who have the same or similar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made them special, all those degrees and awards they worked so hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission. Where will their prestigious resume still stand out?Simone Gold poses as a hostage for avideoshe made framing her as victim of government persecution. With co-defendant John Strand (left) and former professional boxer and current Nevada cannabis lawyer Joey Gilbert, a member of the “legal eagle dream team” at Gold’s America’s Frontline Doctors.Few paths to fame are as reliable as switching sides. Conservatives claiming to represent “we the people” love to dump on professional expertise and fancy pedigrees in latte liberals—just listen to Fox’s Tucker Carlson repeatedlymock MSNBC host Joy Reidfor having gone to Harvard. But when someone with fancy degrees and professional credentials abandons their over-educated tribe and converts, the right-wing superstructure will shower them with love—and money.Others in right-wing politics share similar credentials as Gold’s—think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But as senators, Cruz and Hawley are still very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected.Experts say that far-right radicalism of the sort on display on January 6 and elsewhere over the past year has strong parallels not in Cruz’s “defund the IRS” agenda but in Islamic radicalism, which studies have shown is full of doctors, engineers, and other professionals, even in the United States. In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats studied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters,two-thirds of the defendantshad a college education.Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead and scores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, and spent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these theories,” Kruglanski told me.When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he was smart enough to stay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.”Gold’s initial regretabout her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance as she returned to the lecture circuit, where she has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on free speech. On their podcast recently, she told sympathetic Newsmax hostsDiamond and Silkthat she looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities for spreading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America’s Frontline Doctors.Evangelical groups have continued to shower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccine schtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, where she spoke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in theconference lineup, where Gold’s fellow speakers explored such topics as whether “When God created the earth in six, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God’s template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?”The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helped set the stage for the siege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There, she took the stage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop the steal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L. Lin Wood.In her speech, Gold announced that her America’s Frontline Doctors was setting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered when she introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can beseen in videosnot far from the QAnon shaman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside, she went back to a nearby stage where sheimplored peopleto “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.”Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America’s Frontline Doctors website featured a popup box that said, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need your support. This fight is not just for them, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights. The legal pressures mounting against Dr. Gold require your urgent and generous donations to withstand such aggressive assaults from the ruthless enemies of free speech.”As of May 5, she’draked in $392,000.Top image credit: Mother Jones illustration; Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia; GettySubscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite podcast app.None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown and some people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital andmade a videoclaiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videospawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did.Even in such a climate, Gold’s white coat stood out, and she managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompassesa trio of nonprofit groupsfunded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriots super-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020.Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so much so that she would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even though she’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic, she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lockdowns and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committee secretary of the Council for National Policy, a secretive but powerful religious-right organization that wasworking with the Trump reelection campaignto find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings.Gold was just the sort of surrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her and said, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and we started emailing and talking, and as things have developed and she watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin laterexplained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a letter she’d written to Trump, calling the lockdowns a “mass casualty event,” which she’d been urging other doctors to sign. More than 400 had.With lightning speed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference callwith conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry and, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who had signed Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a woman she’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip and shoulder while trying to color her own hair because she couldn’t go to a salon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Gold said.The call sent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately with some of the major stars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on her show to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingraham said sympathetically, conflating some cherished conservative points of fury.It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W. Kruglanski is a co-author of the book. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feel significant, a narrative to follow, and a network that supports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’s splash into right-wing media, he says, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This is sort of an overnight stardom. She has the narrative, and she now has the network that supports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors” summit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-day summit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on the steps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” and spent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claims suggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, no surprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes that some gynecological problems are caused by having sex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,” she said. “Nobody needs to get sick.”President Trump and his son Don Jr. retweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down for spreading misinformation.

Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We are sick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski isn’t surprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had been stolen. “In many cases the radical groups first shower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your good standing in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold was scheduled to speak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But the speeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them.She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model who serves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lockdowns over the summer and now lives with Gold. On the steps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best to stop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist the siren call of an interview with the. In aJanuary 12 story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainly speak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,” she said, explaining dubiously that she thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internet sleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used incourt filingsto describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold were standing.” Videos and still photos also show the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told thethat she worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted.Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of her standing in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted poster seeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L. Lin Wood wasfacing disbarment effortsin Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold.So why did she do it?It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let’s start with her own reflections on what happened, which were surprisingly uncomplicated: “When you’re crossing the street and the light turns green, you go,” she said in aninterview with KGET. Shaking her head somewhat ruefully, she added that she came up with the “genius” idea to give the speech she had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,” she stammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.”Several months before her arrest, she foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, or should, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one’s career and personal life,” she wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we have seen. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in this situation?’ It’s this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.”It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one who seems to be having a midlife crisis in plain sight. And yet, Haider-Markel says that while most people don’t react to personal existential crisis by storming the Capitol, it might not be that surprising that Gold did. Many people who’ve spent a long time investing in their own education and status tend to socialize with others—like, say, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills private school—who have the same or similar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made them special, all those degrees and awards they worked so hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission. Where will their prestigious resume still stand out?Simone Gold poses as a hostage for avideoshe made framing her as victim of government persecution. With co-defendant John Strand (left) and former professional boxer and current Nevada cannabis lawyer Joey Gilbert, a member of the “legal eagle dream team” at Gold’s America’s Frontline Doctors.Few paths to fame are as reliable as switching sides. Conservatives claiming to represent “we the people” love to dump on professional expertise and fancy pedigrees in latte liberals—just listen to Fox’s Tucker Carlson repeatedlymock MSNBC host Joy Reidfor having gone to Harvard. But when someone with fancy degrees and professional credentials abandons their over-educated tribe and converts, the right-wing superstructure will shower them with love—and money.Others in right-wing politics share similar credentials as Gold’s—think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But as senators, Cruz and Hawley are still very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected.Experts say that far-right radicalism of the sort on display on January 6 and elsewhere over the past year has strong parallels not in Cruz’s “defund the IRS” agenda but in Islamic radicalism, which studies have shown is full of doctors, engineers, and other professionals, even in the United States. In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats studied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters,two-thirds of the defendantshad a college education.Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead and scores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, and spent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these theories,” Kruglanski told me.When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he was smart enough to stay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.”Gold’s initial regretabout her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance as she returned to the lecture circuit, where she has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on free speech. On their podcast recently, she told sympathetic Newsmax hostsDiamond and Silkthat she looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities for spreading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America’s Frontline Doctors.Evangelical groups have continued to shower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccine schtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, where she spoke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in theconference lineup, where Gold’s fellow speakers explored such topics as whether “When God created the earth in six, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God’s template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?”The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helped set the stage for the siege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There, she took the stage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop the steal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L. Lin Wood.In her speech, Gold announced that her America’s Frontline Doctors was setting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered when she introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can beseen in videosnot far from the QAnon shaman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside, she went back to a nearby stage where sheimplored peopleto “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.”Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America’s Frontline Doctors website featured a popup box that said, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need your support. This fight is not just for them, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights.

604,How To Stop Cops From Killing People Suffering From Mental Illness,-7.33,45.33,https://newsone.com/4009086/how-to-stop-cops-from-killing-people-suffering-from-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsone-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-05,newsone,15,"When Joe Prude called the police on his brother, he wasasking for help:,who suffered from mental health problems, had run almost naked out of his Rochester, New York, house into the snow. When officers arrived, new video footage shows, the March 23 encounter quickly turned violent, and Prude died from asphyxiation under a hood officers had put over his head.Two years prior, in 2018,Shukri Ali Saidof Georgia also wound up dead after leaving her house during a mental health crisis on April 23, 2018. Police, called in to help, found Said standing at an intersection holding a knife. Officers shot her five times in the neck and chest, killing her.That same month, in New York, officers answered a 911 call about a black man waving something that looked like a gun. In fact, it was a pipe. But whenSaheed Vassell, a 34-year-old father with mental illness who was well known in his Brooklyn community, pointed it at police, they shot him dead.Prude, Vassell and Said are among the hundreds of people with intellectual disabilities ormental illnessesin the United Stateskilled by policeevery year. According toThe Washington Post, 197 of the 999 people shot by police last year had a mental illness.Police are almost always the first responders in cases of mental health crises in the United States, as they are in criminal and medical emergencies.But the police – who aretrainedto give orders and useforcewhen they feel endangered – are generally ill-equipped to handle people with mental health challenges.As adisability and ethics scholarwho focuses on criminal justice, I know this country has long failed to justly and humanely care for people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities.For most of American history, people with mental health disabilities were locked away in hospital-like institutions, many of them state-run. Starting in the 1950s, the physical and sexual abuse common in these facilities, as well asother inhumane practices, spurred a decades-long effort to close them down and return residents to the community.This process, calleddeinstitutionalization, was meant to replace institutions with localmental health centersthat would provide community-based mental health treatment and assistance for those recently released from institutions.However, in 1981Ronald Reagancut most funding for these centers. And sinceother existing community services– like schools, housing and health services – were not adapted to meet the needs of these new community members, many were left jobless, homeless and unable to get a good education.Today, the 15% ofAmericanswiththesedisabilitiesstill have very little support.Some people are fortunate enough to live with their families or in one of the United States’ roughly500 private residential facilities– places that can cost up toUS$60,000 a year. Others end uphomeless, in poorly run facilities or even in jails.But everyone with these disabilities is at high risk of interacting with police. Too often, theseinteractions go poorly.In hopes of identifying practices that prevent avoidable deaths, I’ve been interviewing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities about their experiences with the criminal justice system. Under the terms of the academic ethics boards overseeing my research, the names of all my interview subjects are protected.One reason police encounters can go wrong, I’ve learned, is that people with intellectual disabilities often struggle to comprehend spoken instructions – particularly in a high-stress situation.“People who don’t have [an intellectual disability] don’t have a hard time understanding what the police are asking them to do,” one man told me. “It’s different for me.”Being overwhelmed can cause people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities toshut down. If this behavior is interpreted asobstinate, it can lead to arrest, detention or police aggression.People with these disabilities are also oftendisbelieved by the police. A woman I interviewed – who communicated slowly due to her disabilities – said she called 911 on her boyfriend for hitting her. But the police believed the boyfriend’s story that she was the violent one and arrested her instead.“When they find out that you’re not capable of understanding what’s going on, it’s a free-for-all,” another interview subject told me.People with intellectual disabilities may struggle in court, too. When one interviewee didn’t understand a judge’s question, he told me, he was sentenced to three months in county jail for disorderly conduct.Judges and lawyers “need to listen to people that’s on disability,” said the woman arrested after calling 911 on her abusive partner, urging patience.Recognizing that they struggle to handle people in mental crisis, many U.S. cities are making efforts to improve outcomes.New York Citytrains some officers incrisis interventionand recently mandated that a social worker must accompany officers to such cases.Denver is looking to adoptamobile crisis intervention programstarted in Oregon that ensures medics and crisis workers, not police, respond to mental health calls.These andsimilar efforts nationwideare a step in the right direction. But my research indicates they may not go far enough.Police frequently encounter people with psychiatric disabilities when someone calls 911 about a person acting unusually in public. If police perceive that person as potentially violent, thesituation can quickly escalate.That’s howAnthony Hill, a black veteran found wandering around his Atlanta apartment complex naked, died in 2015. Hill, who had gone off his medication, ran toward Officer Robert Olsen, who shot him. Olsen was sentenced to12 years in prisonon Nov. 1, 2019, for aggravated assault and violating his oath of office.Nor do laws targeting police violence address the factors that lead people with mental health disabilities to need emergency assistance in the first place.Despite growingrecognitionof thestigma around mental illness, people with mental health disabilities are often stillfeared, pitiedandassociated withviolencein TV and movies. This social stigma can lead to societal rejection and isolation. And the difficulties people with mental health challenges face findingadequate housing, health care and employmentall increase their risk ofinvolvement with the criminal justice system.One lesson from the history of American mental health care is that reforming just one problematic aspect of the systemdoesn’t work. To serve this population’s needs, other institutions – from education to housing – must also be made more flexible, responsive and accessible.Just as shuttering institutions 60 years ago solved little, simplytargeting police responseswon’t suffice now, either.",2

Saying how you really feel and then apologizing because you’ve been called out is not an apology, it’s a get-right. Meaning, you’re trying to get right so you don’t lose your job or endorsements or public standing after spouting your true feelings.See,ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith’s apologyfor his xenophobic comments about Japanese Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani. Smith’s apology had nothing to do with own feelings and everything to do with getting right with his employer.So with that I say, fuck Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz, who fixed his dumbass fingers to tweet that Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in the history of the sport, is a “national embarrassment,” after she withdrew from the team final  and the individual all-around competition earlier this week to focus on her mental health.Biles lives in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston, and it remains unclear whether we’ve seen the last of the most accomplished gymnast in the sport at the Tokyo Games.In a now-deleted tweet, Reitz, who would probably get winded running a city-block, “quote-tweeted video from Kerri Strug’s 1996 Olympic performance on an injured ankle” then said, “Contrast this with our selfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles,”CBS Newsreports.Late Wednesday afternoon, Reitz tweeted to say he owed Biles “an apology. A big one”:It is exhausting dealing with the criticism of Black women who have elected to take care of themselves over everything. Show me one time where America ever gave a shit about Black womenwho still aren’t paid properlyand who arethree to four times more likely to die during pregnancythan their white counterparts. Why would a Black woman ever risk her mental health for a country that hasn’t figured out whythey are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancerand aremore at risk than white men to die from COVID-19?If Black women don’t look out for themselves and their own mental health who is going to? Surely not doctors.Doctors don’t even listen to them, and when they do, they don’t believe that Black women are suffering as badly as they say they are.Simone Biles is the face of a sportthat allowed her and her teammates to be sexually assaulted. Let that sink in.So fuck all of these Facebook warriors, elected officials and armchair quarterbacks who couldn’t carry Biles’ medals on a good day without needing to take a water break. And fuck America, too. You should be ashamed of yourself for wanting to ride the coattails of a Black woman when it’s patriotic, but can’t support her when she’s not performing for you.

When Trump granted a commutation toCraig Cesal, by contrast, he freed a man who had already served 17 years of what was originally a life sentence for repairing trucks that were used to transport marijuana.As those examples reflect, Trump's acts of clemency mixed favors to cronies with relief for genuinely deserving federal prisoners hit with grossly disproportionate penalties. Thecontroversyover his choices highlightslongstanding problemswith a clemency system that is a woefully inadequate remedy for the injustices routinely inflicted by rigid and draconian federal sentences.Trump'sfinal batchof 70 commutations broughthis totalto 94, which included dozens of nonviolent drug offenders, 18 of whom had received life sentences. He shortened more sentences than all but one of his eight most recent predecessors.The one exception is Barack Obama, whogranteda record 1,715 commutations, nearly all in his second term and the vast majority during his last year in office. Even Obama, however,approvedjust 5 percent of petitions for commutations, five times Trump's rate (which was in turn 10 times George W. Bush's rate) but still pretty slim odds for people languishing behind bars, often because of conduct that violated no one's rights.On Trump's last day in office,complainedthat he had ""largely bypassed a rigorous Justice Department process for vetting and approving"" pardons and commutations. Yet that process, as theTimesnotedtwo days later, ""has left thousands of petitions waiting for review with a small team of lawyers unable to keep up.""Margaret Colgate Love, who served as the Justice Department's pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997,saysshe was ""continually frustrated by the hostility of the prosecutors to whom I reported, who evidently feared that pardon would undo their hard work."" Those prosecutors ""were unreceptive to suggestions that pardon could tell good news about their work by showcasing rehabilitation and redemption.""As a result, Love says, ""the Justice Department sent few favorable pardon recommendations to the White House."" While some of the system's critics think the White House should cut the Justice Department out of the process (as Trump effectively did) to avoid this conflict of interest, Love argues that a better approach would be for Congress to let judges or executive agencies perform some of the clemency system's functions.People often seek pardons, for example, to recover their Second Amendment rights, something that Love suggests could be accomplished ""by application to an administrative agency or a court."" She notes that the FIRST STEP Act, a 2018 law that Trump supported, authorized judges to reduce prisoners' sentences for ""extraordinary and compelling reasons,"" a reform that could be expanded to cover many of the people who are now desperately hoping for commutations.President Joe Biden haspromisedthat he will ""broadly use his clemency power for certain non-violent and drug crimes."" He should do that throughout his administration, instead of waiting until he is nearly out of office.Biden also favors abolishing the mandatory minimum sentences that hechampionedfor decades as a senator. Such reforms, especially if they are retroactive, would have a much bigger impact than liberal use of clemency: During the first year after the FIRST STEP Act took effect, its relatively modest changes resulted inshorter sentencesfor more than 7,000 people.That amounts to less than 5 percent offederal prisoners, nearly half of whom are serving time fordrug offenses.

There are people “at the top,” who rule, and there are people “at the bottom” who have to clean up those people’s shit. The people at the top always come up with some reason why they deserve to be at the top. Their powers were bestowed by a divinity. They have the correct blood. They worked the hardest. They are Great Innovators whose wisdom and creativity is the source of all wealth. They are Atlas carrying the whole world on their backs, and if they disappeared, society would fall apart.All of these justifications, needless to say, are myths. They are exactly what yousay if you were a person in charge who didn’t want to feel any guilt. And nobody wants to feel like a bad person, even the assholes giving the orders, so they need to come up with some picture of reality in which they are right for reasons beyond their might. As Max Weber put it,rightto his good fortune. He wants to be convinced he ‘deserves’ it and above all that he deserves it in comparison with others… Good fortune thus wants to be legitimate fortune.”There are a million stories you can tell to legitimize your status, using everything from cranial science to graphs showing a strong statistical correlation between “you having all the power” and some imaginary measure of social well-being (e.g. “GDP”). The explanations don’t have to be very convincing, because one of the nice things about being in charge is that few people in your circle will dare to call you out when you are talking rubbish. Some people will be afraid to get on your bad side, while others will be looking to flatter you into dispensing favor. But hardly anyone is going to rudely pop the sycophancy bubble by pointing out that your rationalizations for having more than everybody else are blatantly fallacious.For instance, King James, of Bible fame, anonymously published a book in 1598 called thewhich laid out what seemed to him like a sound argument for the Divine Right of Kings. He argued that “the state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth” because kings are “God’s lieutenants upon earth and sit upon God’s throne,” and thus, while “a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the Law; yet is he not bound thereto but of his good will.” The relationship of the king to the people was, James thought, like that of the head to the body, and he  pointed out that while sometimes we cut off a limb here and there if it gets gangrenous and unruly, few diseases lead us to cut off our heads:The phrase “motivated reasoning” comes to mind when considering James’ treatise arguing in favor of his own absolute power and exemption from the law. The British people were evidently not persuaded, as James’ successor Charles I was indeed treated as an infirmity curable by the removal of the head.But the king was not the only one with a fixed position in the hierarchy. A Great Chain of Being ordered all matter, living and nonliving, from top to bottom. God, of course, was the Supreme Being. Next came angels, but all angels were not created equal, and there was a hierarchy of sub-angels; St. Thomas Aquinasdivides theminto 9 “choirs”: “angels, archangels, virtues, powers, principalities, dominations, ophanim [alias thrones], cherubim, and seraphim.” After the angelic choirs came the humans, where kings stood highest, followed by princes, nobles, etc., with peasants taking their place at the bottom. The other animals followed us, and had their own rankings of greatest to least, with immobile do-nothing creatures like oysters at the bottom. (There were sub-categories within sub-categories, with worm-eating birds the superior of seed-eating birds, possibly due to winning a worm-eating bet.) Plants and vegetables followed animals, in a descending order from oak trees to moss. Lowest of all were the minerals, which had their own ranking from gemstones down to soil, dust, and sand.All of this may sound rather risible, but before we laugh, we should reflect on just how much of this mindset we have retained into the present day. Animals are still considered lesser beings, most of whom can simply be slaughtered at will, without any moral calculus whatsoever. Factory farming, despite the scale of suffering it inflicts, does not trouble most people’s consciences enough tospend much timethinking about it. And the hierarchical orderings of human societies are still so accepted as to seem like natural law. 44 countries are still outright monarchies, but even the Chief Executive of the supposedly democratic United States is endowed with such huge power that most of our political discourse seems to  revolve around a single person’s conduct.Workplacesare often strict hierarchies, the justice and propriety of which cannot be questioned by those at the bottom, even though the justifications for the difference in power betweenJeff Bezosand Amazon fulfillment center workers are little more persuasive that appeals to the Great Chain of Being.Anarchist thinkers have always put “hierarchy” at the center of their diagnosis of what’s wrong with everything, because so much of what is unjust about every society does seem to boil down to this one simple fact: there are some people who give the orders, and some people who have to take the orders, and the people who give the orders are generally cruel, stupid, and/or greedy. Sometimes they got their position by birth, but even when they got it by “merit,” the main “merit” that usually distinguishes them is that they were more willing to trample on everybody else. Noam Chomsky describes the core of anarchist thinking as being based around a “presumption of illegitimacy” toward hierarchies, a principle that says if a hierarchy is based on tradition rather than reason, it needs to be gotten rid of:Peter Kropotkin, too, put hierarchy at the center of his analysis, saying that anarchism meant “refusing hierarchical organization” and authority, while embracing cooperative social customs:Hierarchy is common to bad governments, bad workplaces, bad relationships, and bad schools. When we look at societies throughout history and feel disturbed, the reason is usually something to do with hierarchy: some people were priests doing human sacrifices, while other people had tothe sacrifices. In our own country, some people have been slaves, others masters. Some people have been prisoners, others cops. Some are “non-citizens,” without basic rights, others are “citizens” who are Legitimate People. (Yes, the distinction between the citizens and noncitizens should be thought of as a formal caste system, whereby some people are more entitled to rights than others. It is only because we are used to it that we don’t comprehend how appalling it is to divide society into a hierarchy of “non-people” and “people” based solely on where they happened to be born.)Wherever you find distinctive ranked orders of social status, and some people with vastly more power and liberty than others, you find a situation that should be revolting to anyone who cares about universal justice. (That is, revolting to the sort of person who wantsto be served by our social arrangements, rather than having categories of “winners” and “losers.”) A truly just world has to be a democratic and egalitarian one, where hierarchies are minimized.But is there a casehierarchy? According to a new book from the Princeton University Press (which previously brought you such elitist classics asAgainst Democracy), there is indeed.Just Hierarchyby Daniel A. Bell and Wang Pei argues that while explicit racial and gender hierarchies may be bad, some hierarchies are Actually Good and worth preserving. Bell and Pei believe that hierarchy as a concept has been unfairly maligned, and they seek to show that there are circumstances in which it is not only morally unobjectionable, but “can and should govern different spheres of our social lives… including our relations with loved ones.”Bell and Wang list five kinds of hierarchies they seek to defend: hierarchies within intimate social circles, hierarchies amongst citizens, hierarchies of nations, hierarchies amongst animals, and hierarchies between human beings and robots. (We’ll note the curious absence of workplace hierarchies from this list: beyond a brief discussion of the relationship between employers and their nannies and housekeepers, the book does not discuss this topic at all, even though the workplace, for many people, is where petty tyranny is most keenly experienced.)Each subset of hierarchies is defended with different arguments. Hierarchies amongst “intimate persons”—that is, in relationships between partners, between parents and children, and between employers and domestics—are viewed as morally acceptable by Bell and Wang so long as there is some changing of roles over time. This would suggest something quite radical in the case of domestic workers—namely that the rich would have to take care of their nannies’ children sometimes—but Bell and Wang wriggle out of this by saying that this reciprocity “may be asking too much of the employer.” Instead, the only actual “changing of roles over time” they envision is generational: perhaps the housekeepers’ children will be rich and the rich people’s children will end up housekeepers. (Extremely unlikely, but a good way for the rich to reassure themselves that the hierarchy is fair.) Their ultimate conclusion is that it’s fine to have a full-time housekeeper—who, notably, doesn’t get to keep their children in the same house with your children—so long as you pay them well.Bell and Wang have a difficult time explaining why hierarchies within households are actuallycompared to the alternative of rough social equality.In the sphere of “intimate persons,” the justification for “hierarchy between partners” seems to boil down, laughably, to “it’s cool to periodically switch who’s on top during sex” (which sure, fine, maybe that’s the kind of entry-level sex advice that people who read political science textbooks desperately need to hear), while the justification for the hierarchy between parents and children is based on the observation that elderly people are more appreciated in societies where elders are owed deference within the family structure. The authors seem unable to grapple with the fact that “hierarchy,” fundamentally, is about the right to command obedience from others by simple virtue of one’s social role. That family members should appreciate each other, listen to each other, and divide difficult tasks fairly amongst themselves is an obvious good, but why these characteristics should be optimally actuated by “hierarchy”—by investing certain people with some specific right of command, even a temporary one, over their loved ones—is not really explained. At best, hierarchy seems like a very roundabout manner of promoting warm familial feeling, and, at worst, a great way to keep people guiltily obligated to family members who donotrespect them.Meanwhile, although their examination of “hierarchy amongst citizens” emanates (by the admission of the authors, who are both professors at universities in China) from a specifically Chinese context—drawing on the “Confucian” principles of imperial Chinese bureaucracy and modern Chinese administration—it’s nonetheless pretty much indistinguishable from the arguments in favor of meritocracy that are made by centrist commentators in the United States. The authors argue explicitly against democracy and in favor of governance by unelected experts. (Bell has written a separate book calleddefending the enlightened despotism of the Communist Party as superior to liberal democracy.) Too much democracy leads to populism, which is bad (cf. Donald Trump), hierarchical meritocracies are better because—once you get past pesky little problems like “nepotism” and “corruption”—they elevate people with talent and expertise, who are temperamentally suited for public life.Bell and Wang concede that this framework does exclude most human beings from formal political participation in decisions that affect them. But since the decisions that will be made on their behalf will be good ones, because wise rulers naturally know what they are doing, this will not matter. The authors suggest that people’s resulting sense of disenfranchisement can be combated through a) grassroots efforts to influence policymakers through suasion, and b) encouraging people to feel fulfilled by “non-political” things, such as pictures of cute dogs exchanged on social media. (We shit you not, this was the actual example they used. There is even a photograph of a cute dog reprinted in the book, as an example of the sort of thing we can look at to distract ourselves from our political powerlessness.) Here, as opposed to Bell and Wang’s flimsy justifications for hierarchy in the home, it’s a little bit more obvious why the idea of hierarchy amongst citizens is at least, in a patronizing sort of way. Whowouldn’twant to sit around looking at pictures of animals all day while a group of highly virtuous public servants ingeniously and invisibly disposes of all boring policy matters?The only problem, of course, is that it is ludicrous: these Virtuous Policy Fairies do not exist in reality, and so what is in fact being proposed is not even a hierarchy between “good bureaucrats” and “indulged masses,” but fundamentally unchecked power in the hands of the sort of people who excel at standardized tests and subtle self-promotion.Hierarchy amongst nations—the third of the supposedly justified hierarchies—evidently involves major world powers politely paying “lip-service” to the sovereignty of smaller nations, while gradually drawing those smaller nations into their direct sphere of influence and control through the use of diplomacy and social ritual. This, Bell and Wang argue, is morally justified so long as there is some meaningful reciprocity and fellow-feeling in the relationship between the stronger and weaker nations. There’s of course a strong element of “might makes right” here—big, powerful countries may justly rule because they are big and powerful. The recurring pattern we begin to see, in these justifications of hierarchy, is that the “morality” of these hierarchies relies heavily on the notion that the person or decision-making entity in the higher hierarchical position will not be incompetent, thoughtless, or sociopathic, but suggests no actual mechanisms for ensuring that this is the case. Like King James, they say that these hierarchical arrangements will be good for the least well-off, but also like King James the argument is less based on appeals to evidence than appeals to tradition and religious text (in his case, Biblical authority, in Bell and Wang’s case, frequently Confucian ethics).The sections of the book on animals and robots are significantly weirder, which is saying something for a book that has already used sex positions as a philosophical justification for social dominance. The animals chapter aims to show that animals and humans are not moral equals and that there is a hierarchy of concern for different animals:It is not clear with whom Bell and Wang are arguing here, since few people (even among radical animal rights advocates) see killing a mosquito as equivalent to killing a human being, and distinguishing between animals on the basis of their capacity to suffer is broadly uncontroversial (though the deprioritization of “ugly” animals is obviously more questionable). Bell and Wang present a multi-page anecdote about the time Bell adopted a cat that ended up jumping out of a 22nd story window, after which he subsequently replaced the dead cat with another, which had diabetes, as part of an argument that people are morally permitted to regulate their pets’ activities so long as they treat them well—which is, again, a fairly widely-held position. But there’s a reason Bell and Wang include this strange chapter: by offering rigorous argumentation for a widely-accepted kind of “hierarchy,” they want readers to think that a general principle of hierarchy is justified. In other words, if we can show that people accept the “humans over animals” part of the Great Chain of Being, it will be easier to get them to accept the “humans over other humans” part.The robots chapter, similarly, argues for a hierarchy most people would agree with: that of humans over machines. Bell and Wang make the case that artificial intelligence should be made to serve human ends, rather than human beings being made to serve artificial intelligence. Then things take a turn: they suggest that the Chinese government alone is correct in its understanding of the purposes of artificial intelligence, that it is building a post-scarcity kind of communism in which robots will do all the labor. By contrast, Silicon Valley capitalists are reckless in their development of new technology: “the libertarian culture of Silicon Valley militates against any serious attempt to curb research that threatens to develop… malevolent AI.” The final sentence of the book (it has no formal “conclusion”) is: “If we are unlucky, the last war involving humans will be a clash between the Chinese Communist Party and Google’s unfriendly creation, and for the sake of humanity we need to pray for the victory of the CCP.”Thus, the bookdoes not necessarily offer the best material for inquiring into the question of when hierarchies are just, for there are parts that make one suspect it is mainly intended as an elaborate apologia for the Chinese Communist Party, published, again, by the Princeton University Press. (Possibly, we should have abandoned our review of this book once we realized how bizarre it was, but by that point we simply couldn’t tear ourselves away.) Many of the hierarchies the book defends are China-specific, and the writing can be digressive and the examples off-the-wall. Most of the evidence provided is laughably unsound. For instance, the authors note that in a study, “an abstract diagram representing hierarchy was memorized more quickly than a diagram representing equality, and the faster processing led the participants to prefer the hierarchy diagram.” This might be a compelling case for the aesthetic superiority of pyramids over lines, but it has very little to do with justice, ostensibly the subject of the book. Bell and Wang also say that “the populist backlashes against elites empower strongmen such as Donald Trump” thus showing that “the effort to combat all forms of hierarchy will not only fail; it may lead to something worse from a moral point of view.” But surely if the backlash is against “elites,” what we have is an argumentagainsthierarchy; without a division into elite/non-elite, there is no grounds for a populist backlash to begin with. If people are resentful of “elites” who are above them and control them, then a more egalitarian society would help reduce resentments.If we’re evaluating the main question, though, which is “have these five hierarchies been justified?” the answers would seem to be: 1) hierarchy between intimates—no, not at all, because sex positions don’t legitimize the giving of commands to family and domestics; 2) hierarchy between citizens—also no, seems like a recipe for an unjust dictatorship; 3) hierarchy between nations—no, seems like proof by assertion; 4) hierarchy between humans and animals—sure, bugs are not people; 5) hierarchy between humans and robots—sure, but not so sure we can sign onto VICTORY TO THE GREAT CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY as a valid ultimate conclusion.So howwe evaluate what the legitimate and illegitimate hierarchies are? It seems easy to say that there should be no “intimate hierarchies”: friends, partners, and family members should meet each other on equal footing, and should give and expect mutual respect as individuals. Trying to treat other people well is a dynamic struggle, and one always littered with daily failures. Hierarchical relationships and pre-assigned roles within households are not a realistic shortcut for avoiding these inevitable difficulties. That’s not to say that people don’t fall into patterns or roles in their close relationships, but this seems like something that people should figure out one-on-one with their loved ones, according to their needs and temperaments. (To the extent that “respectfully figuring out relationship roles on a case-by-case basis” is what Wang and Bell mean by “intimate hierarchy,” this doesn’t really seem like a hierarchy at all, in the way the term’s conventionally understood.) As leftists, we can also say with some confidence that global hierarchies in which wealthier states exercise authority over poorer client states are normatively bad, although it’s much less clear how to stop that from happening (short of a revolution for disarmament and global labor reform, of course).But when thinking about smaller political units—workplaces, neighborhoods, municipalities, states and provinces, perhaps countries—the question of whether hierarchies are “good” or “bad” does start to feel more muddled. Certainly, there should be a high burden to justify the existence of hierarchies, which inherently involve one person having power over another, or over many others; certainly, bland appeals to tradition are not sufficient justification. But even if you are an absolute egalitarian, practically speaking, there’s a lot of shit going on in the world at any given time, and it simply isn’t possible to hold referenda on absolutely.The idea of a hierarchical system that elevates the most talented and trustworthy people to decision-making positions is one that many people find deeply attractive, and in the United States, we’ve often conceived of electoral democracy as the best way to achieve this end. In the U.S. conception of political “meritocracy,” the general theory is to elect political leaders with the right “vision” or “values,” whom we then trust to surround themselves with people of appropriate “expertise.” Of course, as we all know, this frequently goes horribly wrong: the pool of candidates that voters choose amongst, and the pool of experts from which those candidates then choose their advisors, staff, and other appointees, are both shaped by a whole host of factors that have nothing to do with goodness or talent, and a lot more to do with things like wealth, ambition, and luck. Elections produce better results on average than pure nepotism because they contain some limited element of randomness—the system undergoes a shake-up at fixed periods during which new people, potentially, can enter. But in this country, elections still haven’t managed to produce governments on the national or state level that resemble the composition of the general population in any way: lawmakers and executives are mostly rich (as well as mostly white, and mostly male), and their choice of expert staff reflects their own interests and biases. In this way, our governing hierarchies are static in form and also frequently static in content.Some people, admittedly, think that this is a feature, not a bug: the “steady hand at the wheel.” But if climate change, vast economic inequality, mass incarceration, and a precarious, unfranchised immigrant population sound like a bad status quo, then these stable hierarchies in which power is always concentrated in the hands of the sameof person, over and over, are clearly harmful. One way around this problem is to dismantle the hierarchy itself as much as possible, and create processes for participatory decision-making that involve the people affected by a given problem. However, there’s always a problem of scale: as the number of people affected by a single policy or decision becomes larger, direct participation becomes more and more unwieldy. In that case, to the extent we think that some decisions do need to be made at such a scale, it may be hard to get around havingsomehierarchy of decision-makers.Staffing these arguably necessary hierarchies through non-electoral “meritocracies,” as Bell and Wang suggest, means reposing a naïve level of trust in the goodness of unaccountable bureaucrats; but we also concede that elections (of nominal decision-makers, who then choose bureaucrats that are accountable only to them) tend to not produce brilliant results, either. A third option, which we submit to be the least of these three evils, is to make the appointment of decision-makers as random as possible, with a strictly fixed term limit. We’ve previously written about “sortition”—random selection by lot—from the general population as being the best conceivable way to create a demographically representative senate, one that’s slightly less susceptible to monied interests than previous elected senates. In the same way, sortition could be used to fill a variety of decision-making positions.But one reason hierarchy is so enduringly appealing is that the creation of effective non-hierarchical institutions is incredibly difficult, and even institutions that start off being egalitarian have a tendency to turn hierarchical over time (the sociological concept of the “iron law of oligarchy” is that an oligarchy always emerges no matter how much you try to do to prevent an oligarchy emerging). Occupy Wall Street, which operated on an anti-hierarchical structure, was in many ways phenomenally successful in the face of extraordinary state challenges and repression, but also struggled with the difficulty of trying to organize without leadership. Many of the internal disputes that have riven the left, like the conflict between Marxists and anarchists, have involved arguments over the legitimacy of hierarchy, and whether it is possible or desirable to pursue the socialist project without it.Yet while hierarchy is an enduring feature of societies, and it is not yet possible to envision a perfectly non-hierarchical world, a fair starting point is to treat social hierarchies as presumptively illegitimate. If we now recognize that King James was full of shit when he claimed a divine right to be exempt from the law, we should suspect that there are plenty of justifications for hierarchy in our own time that might fall apart under scrutiny. Bell and Wang’s weird-ass book shows how empty many of the justifications for hierarchy are; they often come down to “the boss is the boss because he’s the boss, do you think you could do a better job than the boss?” Hierarchical social orders are asserted to be superior without any examination of what the non-hierarchical alternative would look like, or much evidence (beyond anecdotes and a generalized terror of “the mob”) that such an alternative would be less functional. The hypothesis we should work under is that hierarchies tend to be great for people endowed with the power to give the commands, and less great for those whose job is to obey. The elimination of hierarchy would tend to improve the lot of the vast majority of us, but especially the millions of human “minerals” at the bottom of our present-day Great Chain of Being.",0

611,Why Black American professionals in the U.S. are moving abroad and staying there,0.0,48.0,https://fortune.com/2020/08/10/black-african-americans-leaving-us-moving-abroad-professionals-race-opportunity-careers/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-10,fortune,25,"and Najoh Tita-Reid, then an executive at pharmaceutical giantMerck, was in the midst of the interview process for a job that would send her on her first international assignment. During a break in the conversation, “a white gentleman pulled me aside,” she says, and told her that all of the white men up for the role were “selling that they’d conquered the moon”—while she was focused on explaining what she saw as the weak spots in her résumé. If Tita-Reid wanted the position, he said, she would need to turn everything she had into an asset.So she went back into the interview and laid out her biggest selling point: She was the best person for the job because she was a Black woman in the United States. She was used to being the only person in the room who looked like her. The “cultural competency” the hiring managers were looking for was not a skill she’d had to learn for work; it was something she’d had to master to just get by in her everyday life. “I can get the nuances of every culture because this is what you have to do as an African-American,” she told them. “You have to shape-shift to survive.” She sold it, she says, “and it was all true.”Tita-Reid got the promotion, running Western Europe for the company out of London. Seven years later, she’s still living and working abroad—now in Switzerland, where she holds a global marketing job for Logitech. And, at least for now, she has no plans to return to the U.S.Like many of corporate America’s ladder climbers, Tita-Reid first went after an international role with the goal of enhancing her career. But in the years since she made that first move to London, she’s become part of a cohort of Black American expats who have chosen to stay abroad because they’ve found that the professional benefits of working overseas are far more profound than the usual résumé-building check mark. Working in Europe, Tita-Reid says, has been like wearing an oxygen mask. It’s allowed her to breathe—to lead and perform without feeling the crushing weight of America’s dysfunctional racial dynamics at every moment.I’d never been an American first andBlack. It’s a refreshing change.With her friends, Tita-Reid calls it the “James and Josephine effect”—a hat tip to James Baldwin and Josephine Baker, Black Americans who fled the racial persecution of the U.S. during the first half of the 20th century and ended up with thriving careers in Europe. “It’s not a new phenomenon at all,” she says. “I feel like part of that legacy.”The decision to work and live abroad has been brought into sharp relief for many Black American expats this spring and summer as they watch a national movement take hold back home in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. There’s a sense of guilt at not being on the front lines, mixed with affirmation of why they did not want to return.Working abroad, these executives say they left behind the fatigue that many described as routine forBlack people in corporate America: the exhaustion brought about by being asked tosolve your company’s diversity issues; living by the unwritten rules that dictate how you present yourself at work; having toprove every daythat you deserve to be in your role. Once abroad, with the weight of their companies behind them, many Black expatriates said they felt instantly valued and treated with a level of respect and deference from their colleagues they had not known in the U.S.The benefits extend far beyond the office. The prevailing message in more than a dozen interviews with Black Americans who are working or have worked overseas: Their international experience was the first time race was not the primary frame of reference through which they were viewed. “You’re an American, you’re not African-American,” says Shaundra Clay, who lived in Europe for eight years as a health care executive. “You are not made to feel like you are carrying the burden of anything. You are carrying the power of something.” She said it was a level of privilege she had never experienced before in her life. In the U.S., Nancy Armand, an executive at HSBC Bank USA, was always conscious of her gender and race, she says. In the U.K., she was always conscious of her nationality first. “I’d never been an American first and then Black,” Armand says. “It’s a refreshing change.”And yet these jobs can be isolating. Rarely does Tita-Reid see another Black woman at her level. “On a day-to-day basis,” she says, “I am alone.” That’s in part because the expat universe is running 20 to 30 years behind the larger corporate world in terms of diversity and inclusion, says Adrian Anderson, a partner in KPMG’s global mobility services. He has both personal and professional experience here: For more than 25 years, Anderson has worked in the industry, which helps multinational organizations manage their workforces’ foreign assignments; he has also lived abroad as a Black American executive. Most of these coveted international roles come through word-of-mouth networks, which have historically boxed out Black employees. Or they are reserved for developing those expected to move into the executive suite—a space that has also long passed over Black talent. Anderson says most global organizations prefer that executives have international experience in order to move into top-level roles, making the lack of access to the expat world a systemic barrier that has kept Black employees from reaching the top echelons of corporate America.Black executives who pack their bags and leave the U.S. behind are quick to point out that they are by no means moving to any sort of utopia. “I’m very clear that wherever I go, I’m perceived as a Black man,” says Warren Reid, Tita-Reid’s husband and founder and CEO of Nemnet Minority Recruitment, a diversity recruitment and consulting firm that works with educational institutions. “Unfortunately, in the overwhelming majority of the globe, I don’t have a positive brand image. I’m mindful and not naive about that.” Despite such awareness, Reid and others interviewed for this story said they had not realized how heavily the stress of being Black in America weighed on them until they left. Even when they faced bias abroad, they never feared for their lives or their children’s the way they did in the U.S. Says Ini Archibong, a designer and business owner originally from California who now lives in Switzerland: “The brand of racism in America is unique.”Black executives are used to having to tell peoplethey’re the boss. Otherwise, says Tita-Reid: “When you walk into a room in the U.S. and you are five levels above your sales rep who’s a white man, they look at him and shake his hand and give you the bag.” But soon after transferring to the U.K., she had a meeting with a client who immediately identified her as the person in charge. “You’re a Black American female, and you’re here, so you have to be the best,” she recalls him saying. It was the first time anyone had labeled her the “best” at anything, she says. “I almost cried.” Reid distills the dynamic this way: In the U.S., he says, the question is always, How did you get in the room, and who let you in? In the U.K., the assumption is that if you’ve made it into the room you deserve to be there.But working in Europe means adjusting to more subtle forms of racial prejudice—which often intersect with a strong vein of classism, say many Black execs who have done tours abroad. Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, a 22-year vet of Moody’s, transferred to the U.K. in 2015 to run relationship management for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for the ratings agency. The day she met her new U.K. team, she recalls being repeatedly introduced as an alumna of Howard University and a board member of its business school, followed by a recitation of Howard’s famous alumni. It stuck her as odd, she says, until she realized it was a way of establishing the bona fides of the historically Black university—and by extension, proving her “pedigree” as fellow member of the upper class.Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back.In 2017, Tita-Reid joined a health food company as global CMO, and the family moved to Switzerland. In her new home, nationalism was the dominant force, she says. Swiss people support Swiss people first, she says: “If you don’t happen to be of that culture, it has nothing to do with you.” She recalls a conversation with a German businessman, who felt that there was bias against his nationality throughout the country. To Tita-Reid, it was a relief that everyone was considered an outsider. “We’re all equal-opportunity excluded,” she says. “To me, that’s amazing. It’s the first time I’ve ever been equally excluded.” She explained to the businessman that unlike when he returned to Germany and felt accepted, when she went back to the U.S., she still felt like an outsider. “The negativity of being an American in Europe is not as bad as being a Black American in America,” she says.Three years ago, Tita-Reid had a chance at a job that would take her back to the U.S., but she turned it down. It wasn’t just a career decision but one for her family. “The stress that I felt in the U.S. and concern for my husband and son was gone,” she says. “It was more of a weight than I had ever realized.”I spoke to Reid overZoom, where he sat outside their Zurich home on a sunny day with birds chirping in the background. He told me about the family’s first night in London when they were living in temporary housing. He was going back and forth between the hotel and the flat late at night when he saw two police officers walking toward him. “I remember in that moment, I went through my mental checklist of no sudden moves, communicate, make sure you’re seen.” The police officers walked past him with nothing more than a good night. “That blew my mind,” he said.After we talked, Reid sent me a follow-up email, quoting James Baldwin: “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost, almost all of the time.” Living abroad, Reid was free of that rage, he said: “It does not consume or preoccupy me in the way that it did and does when I return home.”the narrative of the Black American expat who thrives abroad holds true—until you want to get hired by a European company. If you have the wealth of America behind you, “you are welcomed with open arms,” he says. “When you ask for a job, things change.”Léger made the move abroad 15 years ago. His then-wife is Swedish and wanted to live closer to her family, and Léger had always been intrigued by the idea of an international career. In 2004, he left journalism behind to get a graduate degree in international relations at Harvard, and the following year ended up in Geneva with the World Economic Forum as a partnership and communications manager. (Léger worked atfrom 1999 to 2002, but we never overlapped.)Over a decade, Léger says he tried repeatedly to secure a full-time role with the UN, or as a corporate communications executive with a multinational company. Léger, who is Haitian-American and speaks both English and French, says at the UN he was repeatedly passed over; the jobs ended up going to Brits who were not perfectly bilingual—a supposed prerequisite for those roles. In the corporate world, interviews abounded, but he says the leads would turn cold once he showed up in person. One would-be employer went as far as explicitly citing his race as an issue, he says, telling him, “Our investors will have a problem with a Black spokesperson.” Eventually Léger started following the European practice of putting his photo on his résumé to spare himself the grief. Once he did, even the interviews dried up.Léger attributes part of his struggle to a lack of formal or informal support structures. The number oftop Black executives in the U.S. is woeful, but in Europe Léger found the situation to be far worse. “There are no senior Black executives anywhere,” he says, “so there’s no network of us to look out for each other.” Several Black men, including Léger, told me it was often assumed that they were visitors, because otherwise how could they be eating in this fancy restaurant in this nice part of town?Now, with his oldest child thinking about attending college in the U.S., Léger was back in New York, living in Midtown Manhattan. When we spoke in June, he was regularly encountering the Black Lives Matter protests in the city and feeling nervous every time he saw a police car. “I did not miss that,” he says. But he was still glad to be home. “I like my odds of finding a stable full-time job in media,” he says, “of getting the job that eluded me in Europe, even in the middle of a pandemic and the ongoing fight for racial justice here.”of transferring abroad is the struggle that comes with moving back. All of a sudden, executives’ worlds felt much smaller, their jobs narrower. Clay returned to the U.S. in 2016 after eight years in Europe. She described the experience as akin to going back to your hometown after decades away, and having your successes celebrated but no one fully understanding how much you have grown and changed.But for Black Americans, repatriation also came with unique baggage. Clay said the racism she had always seen and experienced in the U.S. now emerged with a different sense of clarity. “The longer you’re away, the more stinging and shocking it becomes,” she said. “All the burdens become your burdens again, and they feel heavier because you’ve lost the muscle of carrying them.” She and others I spoke to said they now had less tolerance for the racism they regularly experienced.Those who have remained abroad have faced their own new personal struggles this spring and summer, describing feelings of deep conflict in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and protests that have followed. Reid says by being abroad he’s meeting his primary obligation to provide a safe and affirming environment for his family; his children have not had to wrestle with some of the issues he did as a Black kid growing up in the U.S. “That’s been the good side,” he says. “The other side is there is a movement that’s going on, and I’m removed from it. There’s a little guilt that goes along with it: How could I bring to bear my education, resources, and network to move the movement forward?”Archibong, the American designer based in Switzerland, says it’s difficult not to be in the U.S. right now. But while Switzerland has its own problems, he says, it’s not enough to make him want to go back. The power of escaping that constant existential fear described by so many of the Black American executives I spoke to is too strong. “Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back,” he says. Not being constantly concerned with his physical safety has allowed him to “clear up space” in his head and be more creative in his work. A few years into his move to Europe, Archibong stopped wearing the collared shirts he’d long worn every day—even if it meant being overdressed for the occasion. The formal look had started as an aesthetic choice, he says, but at some point he realized it had become a kind of armor. In the U.S., he’d felt safer when he was dressed up, he says, and the dressier clothes had helped him command the same professional respect that other, non-Black designers got even when casually attired. In Switzerland, he no longer feels the need; now he pulls out the suit and tie only when he’s in the mood.Tita-Reid struggled to articulate what it’s been like watching the current movement in the U.S. from afar. She, like her husband, says she feels somewhat guilty that she’s an ocean away. It has been both sad and validating to see all of the concerns that had kept her from wanting to return bubble up to the surface. It’s also made her acutely aware of all the good things she had left behind. “You do give up something, which is having your culture, your people, your friends and family,” Tita-Reid says. “It’s at a cost.”Experts say Black executives have less access to global assignments, contributing to the systemic bias that Black professionals face in corporate America.Some employers are now focusing on ensuring that international assignments don’t exclude women and people of color, but it’s still a long way from being a top priority for most.This shift could have an outsize impact on Black executives, who are already less likely to land foreign assignments because of the informal way they are doled out.August/September 2020 issueofFortunewith the headline “America’s Black brain drain.”'s CFO Daily newsletter is the must-read analysis every finance professional needs to get ahead.Sign up today.",2
612,"Reflecting the Authoritarian Climate, Washington Will Remain Militarized Until At Least March",14.33,35.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/reflecting-the-authoritarian-climate,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,greenwald.substack,16,"beginning the week leading up to Joe Biden’s inauguration, when 20,000 National Guard troops weredeployed onto the streetsof the nation’s capital. The original justification was that this show of massive force was necessary to secure the inauguration in light of the January 6 riot at the Capitol.But with the inauguration over and done, those troops remain and are not going anywhere any time soon. Working with federal law enforcement agencies, the National Guard Bureau announced on Monday that between 5,000 and 7,000 troopswill remainin Washington untilmid-March.The rationale for this extraordinary, sustained domestic military presence has shifted several times, typically from anonymous U.S. law enforcement officials. The original justification — the need to secure the inaugural festivities — is obviously no longer operative.So the new claim became that the impeachment trial of former President Trump that will take place in the Senate in February necessitated military reinforcements. On Sunday,quoted“four people familiar with the matter” to claim that “Trump’s upcoming Senate impeachment trial poses a security concern that federal law enforcement officials told lawmakers last week requires as many as 5,000 National Guard troops to remain in Washington through mid-March.”The next day,,citing“a U.S. official,” said the ongoing troop deployment was needed due to “ominous chatter about killing legislators or attacking them outside of the U.S. Capitol.” But the anonymous official acknowledged that “the threats that law enforcement agents are tracking vary in specificity and credibility.” Even National Guard troopscomplainedthat they “have so far been given no official justifications, threat reports or any explanation for the extended mission — nor have they seen any violence thus far.”what an extreme state of affairs it is to have amilitary presence in American streets. Prior deployments havebeen rare, and usually were approved for a limited period and/or in order to quell a very specific, ongoing uprising — to ensure the peaceful segregation of public schools in the South, to respond to the unrest in Detroit and Chicago in the 1960s, or to quell the 1991 Los Angeles riots that erupted after the Rodney King trial.Deploying National Guard or military troops for domestic law enforcement purposes is so dangerous that laws in place from the country’s founding strictly limit its use. It is meant only as a last resort, when concrete, specific threats are so overwhelming that they cannot be quelled by regular law enforcement absent military reinforcements. Deploying active military troops is an even graver step than putting National Guard soldiers on the streets, but they both present dangers. As Trump’s Defense Secretarysaid in responseto calls from some over the summer to deploy troops in response to the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests: “The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.""Are we even remotely at such an extreme state where ordinary law enforcement is insufficient? The January 6 riot at the Capitol would have been easily repelled with just a couple hundred more police officers. The U.S. is the most militarized country in the world, and has the most para-militarized police force on the planet. Earlier today, the Acting Chief of the Capitol Policeacknowledgedthat they had advanced knowledge of what was planned but failed to take necessary steps to police it.Future violent acts in the name of right-wing extremism, as well as other causes, is highly likely if not inevitable. But the idea that the country faces some sort of existential armed insurrection that onlycan suppress is laughable on its face.Recall that, on January 11, citing “an internal FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News,”claimedthat “starting this week and running through at least Inauguration Day, armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols and at the U.S. Capitol.” The news outlet added in highly dramatic and alarming tones:The FBI has also received information in recent days on a group calling for “storming” state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event PresidentDonald Trumpis removed from office prior to Inauguration Day. The group is also planning to “storm” government offices in every state the day President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump.None of that happened. There wasvirtually no unrestor violence during inauguration week —except forsome anti-Biden protests held by leftist and anarchist protesters that resulted in a few smashed windows at the Oregon Democratic Party and some vandalism at a Starbucks in Seattle. “Trump supporters threatened state Capitols but failed to show on Inauguration Day,” was the headlinechoseto try to justify this gap between media claims and reality.ShareThis threat seems wildly overblown by the combination of media outlets looking for ratings, law enforcement agencies searching for power, and Democratic Party operatives eager to exploit the climate of fear for a new War on Terror.But now is not a moment when there is much space for questioning anything, especially not measures ostensibly undertaken in the name of combatting white-supremacist right-wing extremism — just as no questioning of supposed security measures was tolerated in the wake of the 9/11 attack. And so the scenes of soldiers on the streets of the nation’s capital, there in the thousands and for an indefinite period of time, is provoking little to no concern.all the more remarkable is that a mere seven months ago, a major controversy erupted whenpublishedan op-edby Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) which, at its core, advocated the deployment of military troops to quell the social unrest, protests and riots that erupted over the summer after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. To justify the deployment of National Guard and active duty military forces, Cotton emphasized how many people, including police officers, had been seriously maimed or even killed as part of that unrest:Outnumbered police officers, encumbered by feckless politicians, bore the brunt of the violence. In New York State, rioters ran over officers with cars on at least three occasions. In Las Vegas, an officer is in “grave” condition after beingshot in the headby a rioter. In St. Louis, four police officerswere shotas they attempted to disperse a mob throwing bricks and dumping gasoline; in a separate incident, a 77-year-old retired police captain wasshot to deathas he tried to stop looters from ransacking a pawnshop. This is “somebody’s granddaddy,” a bystander screamed at the scene.(Cotton’s claim that police officers “bore the brunt of the violence” was questionable, givenhow many protesterswere also killed or maimed, but it is true that numerous police officers were attacked, including fatally).Cotton acknowledged that the central cause of the protests was a just one, noting they were provoked by “the wrongful death of George Floyd.” He also strongly affirmed the right of people to peacefully protest in support of that cause, accusing those justifying the violence of “a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters,” adding: “A majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants.”But he insisted that, absent military reinforcements, innocent people, principally ones in poor communities, will suffer. “These rioters, if not subdued, not only will destroy the livelihoods of law-abiding citizens but will also take more innocent lives,” Cotton wrote, adding: “Many poor communities thatstill bear scarsfrom past upheavals will be set back still further.”The backlash to the publication of this op-ed was immediate, intense, and, at least in my memory, unprecedented. Very few people were interested in engaging the merits of Cotton’s call for a deployment of troops in order to prove the argument was misguided.Their view was not that Cotton’s plea for soldiers in the streets was misguided, but that advocacy for it was so obscene, so extremist, so dangerous and repugnant, that the mere publication of the op-ed by The Paper of Record was an act of grave immorality.“I’ll probably get in trouble for this, but to not say something would be immoral. As a black woman, as a journalist, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this,” pronounced the paper’s Nikole Hannah-Jones in a now-deleted tweet. Thewriter Taffy Brodesser-Aknerposteda multi-tweet denunciation that compared Cotton to an anti-Semite who “says, ‘The Jew is a pig,’"" argued that “hatred dressed up as opinion is not something I have to withstand,” and concluded with this flourish: “I love working at the Times and most days of the week I'm very proud to be part of its mission. But tonight, I understand the people who treat me like I work at a tobacco company.”Formereditor andHuffington Posteditor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen announced, also in a now-deleted tweet: “I spent some of the happiest and most productive years of my life working for the New York Times. So it is with love and sadness that I say: running this puts Black@nytimesstaff – and many, many others – in danger.” That publication of the Cotton op-ed “puts Black New York Times staffin danger” became a mantra recited bymore journaliststhan one can list.Two editors — including the paper’s Editorial Page editorJames Benettand a young assistant editorAdam Rubenstein— were forced out of their jobs, in the middle of a pandemic, for the crimeof endorsing Cotton’s argument but merely airing it. Media reports attributed their departure to a “staff revolt.” The paper itself appended a major editor’s note: “We have concluded that the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.” In addition to alleged flaws in the editorial process, the paper also said “the tone of the essay in places is needlessly harsh and falls short of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.”There is a meaningful difference between deploying National Guard troops and active duty soldiers on American streets. But both measures are extraordinary, create a climate of militarization, have a history of resulting in excessive force against citizens engaged in peaceful protest and constitutionally protected dissent, and present threats and dangers to civil liberties far beyond ordinary use of law enforcement.Why was the idea of troops in American streets so grotesque and offensive in June, 2020 but so normalized now? Why were these troops likely to indiscriminately arrest and murder black reporters and other journalists over the summer but are now trusted to protect them? And what does it say about the current climate, and the serious dangers it poses, that the public is being trained so easily to acquiesce to extreme measures in the name of domestic security?We are witnessing the media and their public treat what ought to be regarded with great suspicion as not only normal but desirable, all through the manipulation of fears and inflation of threats. That does not bode well for those who seek to impede theimminent attemptto begin a new domestic War on Terror.",1

Tongues are wagging about the new arrival.Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun SentinelA man walks past Oceanview Adult Toys & More on Fort Lauderdale Beach on Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2020.A touch of decadence arrived on Fort Lauderale’s Las Olas Boulevard in the form of a controversial sex shop in a hard-to-miss spot just a block from the beach.But its day in the sun didn’t last long.Ocean View Boutique, with its wall-to-wall racks of sex toys, opened on Monday.Just four days later, the store got an urgent visit from code officers Thursday saying it had to close.Fort Lauderdale ended up yanking the store’s business license because it sits too close to the city’s new oceanfront park at Las Olas and A1A, in violation of a local ordinance.“This is not kosher for that site — an adult toy store has to be at least 500 feet from a park,” Vice Mayor Steve Glassman said Thursday afternoon.The store owner did not mention what kind of retail he planned to sell when he filled out his business license application, Glassman said. City officials got their first clue when the complaints started rolling in.Owner Percy Siriwardana, of Cutler Bay in Miami-Dade County, declined to comment when a South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter called the store Thursday morning.News of an adult toy store opening so close to an oceanfront landmark corner had critics in a tizzy, wondering how in the world such a thing could happen.Nearby residents were worried they’d end up being stuck with their new neighbor.Jo Ann Medalie, a 60-year resident of the beach, was over the moon when she heard the place had been shut down.“Oh my God, that makes my day,” she said with glee. “I was worried it might be a lost cause. That did get people wound up, didn’t it? People were just up in arms.”The store hadblacked-out windowsso passers-by couldn’t see the merchandise. A sign warned visitors they had to be at least 18 years old to enter.Not a good fitJohn Burns, president of the Venetian Condo Association, ventured inside the other day, curious to see exactly what was being sold.“When you walk in, it’s got toys and playthings that, quite frankly, I don’t know what to do with,” he said. “They have racks and walls of adult toys. It’s kind of shocking to see in the middle of our beach. It doesn’t set the right tone. The garish lights at nighttime make it look a strip joint in Times Square. It just looks out of place.”Bob Casullo has a birds-eye view of the place from his condo across the street. He caught wind of the new store after seeing a neighbor ranting about it on Facebook.“I don’t think that’s the right place for an adult toy store,” said Casullo, who lives at the Venetian near A1A and Las Olas. “What are you going to do, buy a dildo on your way to the beach? The women in our building are outraged.”Fort Lauderdale has spent yearsluring high-end developmentin an attempt to bring grace, elegance and class to a beach once known for dive bars, wet T-shirt contests andraucous Spring Breaks.“They’re taking retail in the wrong direction,” Mayor Dean Trantalis said during a meeting this week at City Hall. “That’s not what we’re looking for.”Glassman said he had no idea a sex shop was even on the horizon for that corner.“I found out about it when someone texted me a photo the other day,” he said earlier this week. “At first blush, it does not seem to fit into the vision we have for that corridor. It’s not the best fit.”Adult toys and moreNeighbors got their first notice change was coming to 2941 East Las Olas Blvd. when a mammoth sign was hung last weekend blasting the news: “Adult toys and more.”Ina Lee, owner of Travelhost Magazine of Greater Fort Lauderdale, summed up her reaction in two simple words: “Oh no.”Medalie had a one-word description for the store:Schlocky.“That was the last thing I expected to see on the beach,” she said. “We’re trying to make this a major destination. When I saw the sign on that store, I thought ‘Oh my goodness. This is quite offensive.’ And where there’s one [adult sex shop], more tend to crop up.”Resident Abby Laughlin wondered how a sex shop could operate right across the street from Fort Lauderdale’s new oceanfront “family-friendly” park. The park, Las Olas Oceanside Park at 3000 E. Las Olas Blvd., opened last year across from Fort Lauderdale’s storied Elbo Room bar.New face, new image?Laughlin joked that the sex shop represents the new face of Fort Lauderdale beach.“Really? Is this the best we can do at our ‘world-class’ beach?” she asked. “Oy! It’s an embarrassment for Fort Lauderdale beach.”Glassman, whose district encompasses the beach, says he’d already gotten complaints from residents. So had Commissioner Ben Sorensen.Both mentioned the sex shop drama this week during a City Hall meeting, prompting Trantalis to recall his fight against another adult toy store coming to town — and losing.“I remember the debate we had when Hustler wanted to take over the Peaches record store,” Trantalis said.That was in 2004, when the commission then in office embraced theHustler projectin a 3-2 vote.Sixteen years later, the Hustler shop is still in operation at 1500 East Sunrise Blvd., just blocks from the Galleria mall.Casullo says he has nothing against sex shops, but was relieved to learn his would-be neighbor got the heave-ho.“I don’t begrudge them their business,” he said. “I just didn’t think that was the right place to put it. Where should it go? Next door to the mayor’s house.”Susannah Bryan can be reached atsbryan@sunsentinel.comor on Twitter @Susannah_Bryan",1
614,Biden Pledged to Close For-Profit ICE Detention Centers. Will He Follow Through?,-16.67,38.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/biden-pledged-to-close-for-profit-ice-detention-centers-will-he-follow-through/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,motherjones,25,"A GEO Group guard at a Tacoma, Washington, immigration detention center in 2019.Ted S. Warren/APIn 2019, Wilfred requested protection from political persecution at a California border crossing because he saw the United States as a beacon of hope. Instead, Wilfred, an African asylum seeker who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect associates in his home country from retaliation, wound up at a Mississippi immigration detention center with practices that he compared tothe slave trade. Prison officials told detainees to walk with their hands behind their back, avoid eye contact with their jailers, and speak only when spoken to.After Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent Wilfred to Louisiana, where he used his training as a lawyer to help fellow detainees fight their cases. In what he says was retaliation for his lawyering, ICE moved him to the Allen Parish jail, another Louisiana detention center that he called “hell itself.” Upon arriving, he recalled an assistant warden, who was white, telling him, “I hear you’re the trouble maker. If you try to create trouble for me here, I’ll shoot you.”Wilfred’s experience—the indefinite detention, the trauma it caused, and the money prison companies made in the process—encapsulates the detention system President Joe Biden has taken over. The Trump administration took the already large detention network operated by ICE and pushed it to record size by openingmore than 40new detention centers. But during the pandemic, detention levels fell to the lowest in decades, largely due to a Trump administration policy of summarily expelling people at the border. It means thatBiden has taken office with roughly 15,000 people in detention, down from an all-time high of more than 55,000 in the summer of 2019 and about41,000in November 2016.On Tuesday, Biden issued an executive order that directed the Justice Department to phase out its use of private prisons, but the order does not apply to ICE. The Biden administration is considering issuing a similar order to cover immigration detention, but has no immediate plans to do so and some immigrant advocates doubt it ever will,reported.Silky Shah, the executive director of Detention Watch Network, said in a statement that her organization was encouraged by Tuesday’s executive order. But, Shah added, the “Biden administration must now address the private prison industry’s toxic relationship with the Department of Homeland Security,” which oversees ICE.To understand the potential significance of Biden’s campaign pledge, it helps to understand the categories that comprise the civil detention network for immigrants: ICE-owned detention centers operated by for-profit companies, local jails run by prison companies, detention centers owned and operated by prison companies, and locally run jails that have government contracts. Unlike the Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons, ICE has no detention centers that it owns and operates.Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who led the Department of Homeland Security’s civil rights and civil liberties division during the Obama administration, hopes that Biden will count all detention centers operated by prison companies as for-profit, regardless of whether they’re owned by ICE or local jurisdictions. That would commit his administration to eliminating most of ICE’s detention capacity. As of January 2020, Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, says ICE was holding 81 percent of all detainees at facilities owned or operated by for-profit companies. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what it considers to be for-profit detention centers.)Should this policy be enacted, the result would be that essentially the only ICE detention centers that would remain would be local jails—whichtend to be as bad as or worse than the for-profit detention centers. (The Allen Parish jail that Wilfred called “hell itself” is one of them.) Like private prisons, they’re cash cows. But instead of funneling money to shareholders, they prop up cash-strapped towns and sheriffs’ offices that ICE often pays around $60 per day per detainee. Schlanger knows the problems with local jails but says the main priority right now is to reduce the number of immigrants in detention. Pressuring Biden to stop using for-profit detention centers makes sense as a strategy because he’s already committed to it.Should for-profit detention be eliminated, the question could quickly become where to hold the people who remain detained. Other than abolishing detention altogether, which the Biden administration has shown no intention of doing, the options would be to keep using local jails or come up with a new form of detention that isn’t for-profit. That could meanrepurposing community colleges or halfway houses to hold immigrants, according to a former ICE official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. People at those facilities wouldn’t be free, but they wouldn’t be in jails built to hold a criminal population.Many immigrant advocates, who often favor eliminating ICE detention entirely, would oppose this kind of shift. As Schlanger put it, “I don’t think the advocacy community is very interested right now in taking one huge system of detention and substituting another system of detention.”Sarah Gardiner, the policy director at Freedom for Immigrants, framed Biden’s campaign promise to end for-profit detention as a “critical first step” toward her group’s ultimate goal of detention abolition.Adding to the challenges for the Biden administration is that the number of immigrants in detention mostly plummeted in 2020 because the Trump administration largely sealed off the border during the pandemic. The order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ostensibly to combat the coronavirus, causes border crossers to be summarily removed from the country before they even have a chance to enter ICE custody or to request asylum.The Biden administration has signaled that initially it will keep the CDC order in place to avoid a sudden increase in the number of people arriving at the border, but will presumably end the draconian policy at some point. Once it does, people will start entering ICE custody instead of being immediately expelled, and the numbers of people in detention could quickly balloon unless the agency releases more people on bond or parole than they did under Trump.John Sandweg, who led ICE under Obama, disagrees with advocates who favor getting rid of immigration detention. But he supports ICE taking a more risk-based and individualized approach under which only people deemed a threat to public safety or a flight risk remain detained. “I think we would find that ICE’s detention needs are probably in the 12,000 range,” he says, “and nowhere near the 30 to 35,000 range.”The Biden administration doesn’t have to wait to take this approach. Cho points out that ICE can quickly review the status of everyone in custody with the presumption that people should be released, thereby flippingthe current approach under which the burden is on people in detention to show that they should be released. Beyond that, Cho says ICE could eliminate use of the cash bonds that can be prohibitively expensive. Adopting those changes would help many of the people who remain detained today in facilities where social distancing is impossible and COVID-19 outbreaks have been rampant. (As of Sunday, more than9,000people in ICE custody had tested positive for COVID-19 and 593 were being monitored for active infections.)There are already some signs the Biden administration is moving towards letting out more people. It started a100-day pauseon some deportations, and David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security Secretary, has directed ICE to provide a process for an individualized review for people who have deportation orders that are more than 90-days old. As part of that process, ICE will look at whether detainees can be released, or have their cases stayed, or reopened. But the status of that process was upended on Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the deportation pause.In May, Wilfred sued for his release, and in a rare move, a judge assigned him a federal public defender. In October, the judge granted his legal team’s request to depose a senior ICE official and the warden of the Allen Parish jail. Two weeks later, ICE released him after 14 months in detention. The case became moot, and the ICE official avoided having to testify under oath.Karim Golding, who came to the United States from Jamaica at 9 years old, has not had the same good fortune as Wilfred. After being arrested as a 21-year-old for selling cocaine and two handguns, he served 10 years in prison. When he was released in 2016, ICE took him into custody.He’s now at the Etowah County jail, anotoriousAlabama jail that ICE uses for the long-term detention of people like Golding who are willing to fight their deportation for years. On March 20, as news of the pandemic spread, Golding and another detainee protested to demand that people transferred to the jail be quarantined first. He put a noose fashioned out of bed sheets around his neck and tied the other end to the second-floor railing of his unit, theInterceptreported. The threat of suicide forced officials at the jail to talk with the detainees about doing more to protect them from COVID-19, but it ultimately wasn’t enough to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.In July, Golding started feeling ill and tested positive for COVID-19. In what appeared to be retaliation for demanding better conditions before testing positive, GoldingtoldtheIntercepthe spent nearly two month in solitary confinement. It was summer in Alabama, and the cell he spent 23 hours a day in lacked air conditioning. After we spoke in December, another outbreak was reported at Etowah, this one affecting six detainees as of Sunday.Like nearly everyone I’ve interviewed who has experienced both federal prison and ICE detention, Golding told me that the conditions in prison had been far better. Despite everything he’d been though, Golding said hefavored keeping some immigration detention for people the government could show are dangerous. He thought that approach would leave ICE with something like two or three detention centers.To Wilfred, itseemed reasonable that people who come to the country seeking asylum would be detained for a few months while they establish that they have a significant chance of being persecuted in their home countries and the US government verifies their identity.The difference, however, is that during that time, he believes people should be held in more humane conditions. He asked why people in civil detention, which is supposed to be non-punitive, are marched around in orange jumpsuits or taken to medical appointments in shackles. “That was my worst experience: the chains,” he says, recalling being shackled, “I felt like the slavery life was reliving itself in us.”Golding hoped that people on the outside would not stop fighting for detained immigrants once Trump was out of office.He compared Trump to 9/11, explaining that the former president had united normally disparate factions. “But we have a tendency of getting complacent after these tragedies, and he was that tragedy,” he said. “You don’t want to be like, ‘Biden is the solution.’ We want to hold him accountable.”",1
615,Arizonans set record for expanded jobless benefit claims as program's expiration looms,-3.0,48.0,https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2020/07/22/arizonans-set-record-expanded-jobless-benefit-claims-program-nears-deadline/5476629002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,azcentral,24,"Arizonans filed a record-high number of claims for expanded federal unemployment benefits leading up to what could be the final week of the program in its current form.Arizonans filed 249,000 initial claims over the week ending July 18 under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which pays a $600 weekly supplement in addition to what jobless individuals receive from the state.Those figures, provided by the state Department of Economic Security, were up from more than 230,000 PUA claims in Arizona during the week ending July 11 and represent the highest total so far.The federal program began earlier this year to ease financial pressures for workers suffering layoffs or reduced hours from COVID-19 and economy-shutting measures to contain the pandemic. It expires July 25.In addition, Arizonans filed 24,973 initial claims in the latest week for state benefits that max out at $240 a week. Claims for these lower benefits have been fairly steady for the past couple of months. Arizona benefits aren't affected by the federal expiration date.The question remains if Congress will act to expand the federal jobless supplement, along with deciding whether to authorize another round of stimulus checks or additional assistance to businesses, state and local governments, or other entities.Some form of extended federal jobless aid is considered likely, but an agreement hasn't been reached yet on how much will be paid in benefits, and to whom.""Even in a highly polarized environment, it is likely that a bill will be passed as neither political party will want to be blamed for sinking a bill containing much-needed relief,"" wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds in a commentary.The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed the HEROES Act earlier this year. That legislation would maintain the current $600 weekly payments.Republican leaders in Congress have proposed reducing the amount so as not to disincentivize certain people from returning to work.Negotiations continue in Washington. David Wells, research director at the Grand Canyon Institute in Phoenix, said he expects the ultimate package might amount to a compromise benefit somewhere around $400 a week.Another unknown revolves around when the legislation might be passed and implemented. That might not happen until well into August, which could put financial pressure on millions of jobless people even if benefits are paid retroactively.""People still have bills to pay,"" Wells said.The Grand Canyon Institute released a report Wednesday urging Arizona to update its own unemployment insurance program. At a maximum of $240, weekly benefits here are the second-lowest in the nation, exceeding only the $235 weekly payments available by Mississippi.Thereportby the a self-described centrist think tank claims that Arizona's meager jobless payments have cost the state between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in lost economic activity since April. In most states, unemployment insurance programs are designed to replace about one-half of lost wages for typical workers, Wells said. But in Arizona, the benefits replace only about one-quarter of lost wages.Also, Arizona provides little flexibility for people when their job income is reduced, the report continued. In other words, Arizona doesn't offer much in the way of an ""earnings allowance"" — the amount of money people can make before jobless benefits are reduced. This is relevant for those who return to work part time, the institute noted.This combination of a low benefit cap and a low earnings allowance leads to a complete benefit disqualification for between 50,000 and 110,000 Arizonans each week, which wouldn't be the case if they lived in most other states, the report said. Roughly 90% of this assistance, if provided, would have been paid by the federal government.The institute called on Gov. Dougr Ducey and state legislators to update Arizona’s unemployment insurance system, calling it ""one of the worst in the nation.""The Department of Economic Security said initial claims under both the federal and state programs amounted to nearly 274,000 for the week ending July 18, a record-high total.Continuing (as opposed to initial) claims under both programs in Arizona came to 3.03 million, another record, for the week ending July 18, with the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program accounting for 2.79 million of those.The department cautions that there might be duplication in the counts between the state and federal programs, possibly because of people filing claims multiple times out of confusion, frustration or for other reasons.That new claims for Arizona jobless benefits have mostly leveled out in recent weeks might indicate Arizona's tourism sector hasn't been hit as hard as those of many other states, said David Shideler, chief research officer at Heartland Forward, which tracks economic activity in middle America.In part, he said, this might be because many tourists come to Arizona mainly to see the Grand Canyon and other outdoor attractions, for which social distancing isn't as much of a concern compared with, for example, museums, theme parks and other more urban attractions.",2
616,Jobs report shows fewer hires as recovery loses momentum,0.0,48.33,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/jobs-report-september-2020.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&par=sharebar,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnbc/,2020-10-02,cnbc,25,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by a lower than expected 661,000 in September and the unemployment rate was 7.9%, the Labor Department said Friday in the final jobs report before the November election.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a payrolls gain of 800,000 and the unemployment rate to fall to 8.2% from 8.4% in August. The payrolls miss was due largely to a drop in government hiring as at-home schooling continued and Census jobs fell.""The issue is momentum, and I think we're losing it,"" said Drew Matus, chief market strategist for MetLife Investment Management. ""When you go through a significant disruption to the labor market, it takes time to fix itself. That's without regard to whether there's a virus.""The decline in the unemployment rate came along with a 0.3 percentage point drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.4%, representing a decline of nearly 700,000. However, a separate, more encompassing measure that counts discouraged workers and those working part-time for economic reasons also saw a notable decline, falling from 14.2% to 12.8%.The unemployment decline for Blacks was even sharper than the headline rate, falling from 13% to 12.1%. The Asian rate declined from 10.7% to 8.9%.Leisure and hospitality led job gains with 318,000 while retail added 142,000 and health care and social assistance increased by 108,000.As expected, government was the biggest drag on the month, losing 216,000 due to a drop in local and state government education as many schools maintained at-home instruction due to the virus. A reduction in Census workers also pulled 34,000 from the total.In other sectors, health care and social assistance gained 108,000, professional and business services contributed 89,000 and the transportation and warehousing sector was up 74,000. Manufacturing grew by 66,000, financial activities added 37,000 and the other services category rose by 36,000.Markets reacted little to the report, with stocks still heading for a lower open following news that President Donald Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19.Despite the deceleration in job creation, there were some positive signs as the economy continues its pandemic-era recovery.Those reporting being on temporary layoff fell by 1.5 million to 4.6 million. Workers holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell by 1.3 million to 6.3 million, and the totals for longer-term layoffs also decreased considerably.The temporary layoff total peaked at 18.1 million as payrolls fell by 22 million in March and April.However, permanent job losses increased by 345,000 to 3.8 million, in total a 2.5 million increase since February, the month before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic.""Permanent jobs losses rose by more than 300,000. That's not a good thing. The labor force participation rate declined, which pulled the overall unemployment rate down. That's not a good sign, either,"" said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab. ""We're looking at state and local government layoffs, we're looking at a higher level of permanent job losses and more people leaving the workforce. None of that is good for the long run.""The report comes amid a raft of mostly positive economic signals, including strong signs from the housing market and retail spending, as well as worries that rising coronavirus cases could threaten the recovery.While millions more remain unemployed, September's activity means that about 12 million jobs have been recovered since the mid-March economic shutdown that saw about 22 million layoffs.Previous months' job totals were revised higher. July moved up 27,000 to 1.76 million while August's already strong total went up by 118,000 to 1.49 million.Average hourly earnings were little changed over the month but still about 4.6% higher than a year ago. However, hourly comparisons are difficult in the current environment considering the virus impact and the continued tendency of higher-wage workers returning to their jobs before those on the lower end.",2
617,"Former Mayor Announces Run For California Governor, Says Newsom ‘Failed Us’",0.0,45.33,https://www.laweekly.com/former-mayor-announces-run-for-california-governor-says-newsom-failed-us/,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,laweekly,25,"Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer launched a campaign for governor of California, Tuesday, amid a recall effort of Gov. Gavin Newsom.Faulconer served as mayor from 2006 to 2014 and officially launched his campaign to run in either the 2022 race for governor, or sooner if a recall election takes place.“He’s failed us, year after year,” Faulconer said in his firstcampaign video. “I’m running to make a difference, not to make promises.”While past petitions to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom have failed, there is a current petition that has gained 1.3 million of the 1.8 million of the necessary signatures, according to the “Recall Gavin” campaign.The recall campaign’s senior adviser Randy Economy told L.A. Weekly back in December that he believed enough signatures would be garnered by the end of January and while that did not happen, the campaign has until March 17 to reach the necessary threshold.While leaders in the state, including L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, praised Newsom for aggressive action early on in the pandemic, of late, small businesses and Republican voices such as Faulconer have been vocal about their displeasure with the governor’s orders to shut down.Those voices grew louder after Newsom was photographed dining at the French Laundry restaurant in Yountville on Nov. 6, 2020. The dinner appeared to be indoors, although the restaurant said it was their outdoor area, and Newsom was seen packed in tightly with several others and no visible masks worn by the patrons.Newsom later apologized for the dinner, saying he felt “uncomfortable” and should have left the moment he noticed there were so many people in attendance.“To him there’s rules for everybody else and then there’s rules for him,” Economy said about the governor’s November dinner. “It’s the arrogance of power and he doesn’t care for the average person in California. He cares about living in his own political bubble.”On Tuesday, a survey conducted by theUniversity of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studiessaid that among the 10,000 registered voters who were polled, 48% approved of Gov. Newsom’s performance, while 46% disapproved.About 69% of those polled were displeased with Newsom’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is up from 51% in a September poll.A countering poll was released by thePublic Policy Institute of California, Tuesday,and the results were more favorable toward Newsom, showing that 54% of adult Californians were satisfied with satisfied with his performance as governor.“A majority approve of the job that Gavin Newsom is doing as governor, while opinions about him remain deeply divided between Democratic and Republican voters,” Mark Baldassare, PPIC president and CEO said in a media release. “More than four in ten say that COVID is the most important issue for the governor and legislature in 2021, and a majority of Californians approve of the governor’s handling of COVID. About one in three give the state excellent or good grades for the vaccine distribution.”Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

618,Running for New York City Mayor — How Much Chaos Can We Expect Between Now and June?,-7.67,43.67,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/02/04/running-for-new-york-city-mayor-how-much-chaos-can-we-expect-between-now-and-june-22/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,villagevoice,17,", you could walk up to Gracie Mansion and touch your fingers to the cool brick of the walls surrounding the grounds.Those days, like so much before the coronavirus, are long gone. The Upper East Side mansion, erected in 1799, sits behind NYPD barricades. The metallic gates are everywhere, cutting off the walking paths that used to invite visitors to the home of the mayor of New York City. Gracie resembles, a year into the pandemic, a fortress under siege.On June 22, when the virus may well be less pervasive, Democrats in New York will choose their nominee for mayor. In our heavily Democratic city, this primary victory will be tantamount to election. And given the ease with which incumbents glide to a second term — the oft-maligned Bill de Blasio won his 2017 primary with nearly 75 percent of the vote and easily swatted away a Republican by 38 points — this election will effectively determine who gets to govern the largest city in America for the nextyears. (The last one-term mayor, David Dinkins, left office in 1993.)There may be no more important election — in this city, at least — in modern history. Not since the city nearly went bankrupt in 1975 has it been so close to the brink. COVID-19 has killed more than 27,000 of our fellow citizens. The restaurant, tourism, and hospitality industries are decimated. The true unemployment rate, some experts estimate, could exceed 20 percent. The murder rate is up all over America, and here in New York it hassoared 41 percent over 2019. This past summer, protests against police brutality shook the city during some of the tensest days and nights in memory, drawing savage crackdowns from an NYPD that de Blasio — a left-leaning Democrat — has repeatedly failed to reform and discipline.The Gracie Mansion barricades went up around the time of those hot, violent nights, as de Blasio, known for his stubborn workouts at the Park Slope Y and his refusal to show up anywhere on time, seemed to retreat from his city. While the gangly mayor has real, lasting accomplishments — he created a universal prekindergarten program and helped pass laws increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid sick leave — he has been mocked and derided for his quixotic national ambitions and for failing, along with Governor Andrew Cuomo, to contain the spread of COVID-19.The city, laid so low, may be even more immediately beleaguered than it was in the 1970s, when a fiscal crisis triggered mass layoffs and enormous cuts to social services. “Here the challenge is much greater,” says City Comptroller Scott Stringer, one of the front-running candidates. “We have no tourists, no arts and culture, no restaurant or dining to speak of. This is unprecedented territory.”Candidates crisscross neighborhoods as large as small cities, courting varied racial, ethnic, and interest groups that can diverge wildly in their needs and wants. There is a Hasidic vote, a Chinese vote, an Afro-Caribbean vote, and an MSNBC liberal vote. There are dozens of labor unions, civic organizations, churches, block associations, and Democratic clubs that all want to feel that the mayor will represent them, and often, them alone, even though the primary has drawn close to 1 million voters in the past.“Running for mayor involves having an understanding of these different communities, having some people who have some ties in these communities and understanding issues that matter to them—and that does create some whiplash for candidates,” says Lis Smith, a prominent Democratic operative who worked on de Blasio’s 2013 campaign. “One day you’re talking to a group that’s very progressive, very liberal, and the next day you’re talking to a group of voters that are more fiscally conservative, socially conservative. There are a fair amount of anti-abortion Democrats.”The pandemic, of course, has upended all of this. The last time there was an open mayoral race, candidates had months to glad-hand at parades, block parties, and Sunday services, slowly building name recognition as voters spotted them on street corners and subway platforms. Once an unknown, de Blasio himself had to cajole commuters at the subway, hunching his six-six frame to give his elevator pitch to the people rushing by.These days, the candidates are locked into Zoom forums. Andrew Yang, one of the top contenders, hustled across the city in January, staging walking tours and riding the subway with reporters in tow.On February 2, he announced thathe had tested positivefor COVID-19. His diagnosis may well convince the other contenders to avoid crowd contact, at least for now. “The last time I had a flu no one gave a shit,” Yang joked.Pandemic campaigning, generally, has meant increased phone banks, more glossy campaign mailers, and additional digital and TV ads to replace door-to-door canvassing. For candidates without built-in followings, this is cutting down on opportunities to meet voters and demonstrate momentum, either with a big rally, a strong showing at a parade, oreven a staged arrest, cameras flashing.“I’m still a believer, as far as citywide races, that regular cable TV is important,” says Jerry Skurnik, a longtime Democratic consultant. “That’s why de Blasio won eight years ago. It seems to me that TV is even more important this year. I’m sitting home right now — the TV is on.”More than 30 candidates, remarkably, have registered to run with the city’s Campaign Finance Board, though there are only five or six Democrats who have a viable chance of seizing the nomination and breezing to victory in the fall. Much of this has to do with money: A competitive mayoral race costs millions of dollars, and only a handful of Democrats will be able to raise and spend that kind of cash.Two of the candidates, Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, have been enmeshed in the city’s political machinery for decades, taking the most traditional route to power.Stringer, who has been the city’s comptroller since 2014, is a Manhattanite with a base on the white, liberal Upper West Side. He is the undisputed endorsement king — three members of Congress, including the newly elected Bronx firebrand Jamaal Bowman, are backing Stringer’s candidacy, along with a deep roster of state lawmakers. Stringer has been courting the city’s resurgent left, criticizing power elites like the real estate industry and proposing an ambitious plan to phase out all fossil fuel infrastructure citywide. Once a more risk-averse, clubhouse politician, Stringer is hoping he can woo progressives in the primary, recreating a version of the playbook that got de Blasio to Gracie Mansion in the first place.Adams, unlike Stringer, does not chest-thump over progressive credentials. A former state senator, police captain,and Republican, Adams proudly fundraises from the real estate developers loathed on the left. A power broker in Brooklyn’s Black neighborhoods, Adams has been a muscular voice on police reform, pitching an idea to let community groups select police commanders. He said hewould publicizethe names of police officers being monitored for bad behavior. (Adams did not return multiple requests for comment.)Stringer, who has promised to “manage the hell” out of the city,has bankedclose to $6 million for the race so far; Adams has about $6.6 million. Both of them are expected to be prolific fundraisers in the months to come.In 2001, a little-known, charisma-challenged billionaire named Michael Bloomberg defied the Democratic establishment, winning the mayoralty in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Bloomberg triumphed on the Republican line, all but impossible in today’s city, unless you can spend $100 million, which is out of reach for all of the current candidates.In 2013, horrifying entrenched Democrats while delighting every newspaper in town, Anthony Weiner plunged into the Democratic primary, fresh off the first of many sexting scandals. Before his implosion, he was a polling leader, drawing huge crowds in the streets. At the same time, Eliot Spitzer, the former governor felled in a prostitution scandal, was running for city comptroller, whipping up a singular frenzy around a municipal contest.In 2021, there are no black swan candidates like Weiner and Spitzer, but there is a famous outsider: Yang, the entrepreneur who gained widespread recognition running for president on a platform to give $1,000 to every American every month, forever. Mayoral candidate Yang cannot propose anything so ambitious — his current cash-transfer proposal is micro-targeted to very poor households, and would cost $1 billion annually out of an $88 billion budget — and he has mixed worthy progressive goals, such as a public bank for New York City, with the more curious,including a casino on Governors Islandthat would be forbidden under a federal deed restriction.“I’m running for mayor for one reason and one reason only: I believe I can help New York City recover from this crisis faster than others,” Yang says. He is chasing the progressive vote, like Stringer, but he is also hoping to cross over everywhere, knitting together moderates and exciting the city’s burgeoning Asian communities. Before testing positive, he took to street-level campaigning with particular gusto, and is easily recognized when he ventures out.“There’s like a real need in New York to have someone who people have a sense of pulling for them,” Yang continues, pitching his candidacy, “and one of the things happening in New York City right now — the nature of the race is a lot of noise — to me, as long as New Yorkers are happy to see me, I’m pumped to fight for them.”The bubbly Yang is, more than any other candidate, resented by the rival campaigns, who treat him with a mixture of derision and fear. His top consultant, Bradley Tusk, advised Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign andgrew rich advising Uber, drawing ire from the left.Maya Wiley, a former counsel for the de Blasio administration and a civil rights lawyer who rose to greater fame as an MSNBC analyst, is seeking to become New York’s first female mayor. (Wiley declined an interview request.)And the city’s Wall Street titansspecifically recruitedRay McGuire, a Citigroup executive, to run for mayor; he has raised nearly $5 million frombusiness heavyweightsin a short amount of time, vaulting himself into the top tier.“I don’t owe anybody anything,” McGuire says, boasting of his status as a first-time candidate. “Zero. I’m unbought.” Celebrities such as Spike Lee and Samuel L. Jackson are in McGuire’s corner. As a Black business executive, he has spoken openly about racial justice and coalition building between the city’s millionaire class and leftists who seek to check their power.Some on the left are hoping Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, can catch fire. Though the Democratic Socialists of America, an emerging power center in New York politics, are not formally backing any candidate, members of the organization have been drawn to Morales, who has called for slashing the NYPD budget in half and redirecting the funds to social services.“I kind of reject the idea that we can’t talk about decreasing this sort of system that criminalizes poverty for Black and brown people because people are going to be unsafe. Black and brown folks are already unsafe,” Morales says. “We need to be morally committed to people’s needs to live in dignity.”And there is no shortage of technocrats: de Blasio’s former Sanitation commissioner and interim NYCHA chair, Kathryn Garcia, and ex-HUD secretary and federal OMB commissioner Shaun Donovan are hoping to vault into the first tier. Each boasts of governmental experience that outstrips the rest of the field. “I am absolutely the most qualified,” Garcia argues. “I think I am the only person in the race who really understands what this job is. This is a day-to-day, deliver for the people job.”Donovan, who was also a housing commissioner under Michael Bloomberg,drew attentionwhen he proposed giving every city child a $1,000 “equity” bond that could grow to $50,000 by the time of their high school graduation. “With all due respect to the other candidates, no one else has ever run a four trillion dollar budget,” he says, referring to his tenure at the federal level. “No one else has sat side by side with Dr. Fauci in the Oval Office or Situation Room.”In the old days, candidates clawed for slivers of the electorate. If no one won 40 percent of the vote, there was a citywide runoff between the top two candidates. These were vicious, if low turnout, affairs.Ranked-choice allows votersto rank their top five candidates. Getting second- and third-place votes matter. The runoff is no more. No one quite knows how this will impact one candidate or another, although everyone has a theory about why they are the most well suited for the new era. It’s already produced coalitions: Stringer and Morales shared a co-endorser, a state senator from the Bronx, and some Democrats are speculating that Stringer wants to elevate Morales to undercut other progressive rivals, including Wiley. Adams, meanwhile, hasaggressively opposed the systementirely, on the premise that the voter education hasn’t been there to make it happen effectively.The race, like the city, is in flux. There is no candidate with a clear claim to the nomination. There is no single woman or man with the best argument, either — not with multiple technocrats, a citywide elected official, an unorthodox figure of national renown, a well-regarded civil rights attorney, and many others seeking the prize of governing one of the world’s great cities.Come 2022, inordinately challenging decisions will have to be made. New York will be emerging, slowly, from pandemic hell. At some point, the new mayor will have to lower the barricades — metaphorically and literally — and enter the streets where the city, ravaged by plague, longs for compelling leadership.“We have to get it right this time,” says Stringer. “We have to have a reset.” ❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from theeditorial department, which does not accept paid links.Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

619,Lockdowns Come from a Place of Privilege,13.33,29.67,https://thelibertyloft.com/lockdowns-come-from-a-place-of-privilege/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,thelibertyloft,15,"Charlotte, NC — The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns are making lifequite difficultfor a lot of people, and some of the hardest hit are the poor and marginalized. There are immigrants who have been laid off from their jobs and single mothers who can’t access childcare. There are elderly people who can’t get the support they need and people with mental illnesses who arestrugglingwith the lack of routine.One of the biggest challenges for people on the margins is that, all too often, they are invisible to society at large. Issues likepoverty, addiction, mental illness and domestic abuse don’t often make the news, so it’s easy to forget that these hardships are an ever-present reality for millions of people.Champions of the lockdowns tend to be especially oblivious to these hardships, and their preoccupation with case numbers and COVID deaths has caused them to blithely dismiss people’s concerns. Some have evencastigatedprotesters for raising their concerns, brushing them off with the callous retort, “it’s not all about you.”Another way people have trivialized these hardships is with the phrase “just stay home.” To many, that slogan may seem innocuous. But, for those living on the margin, that word “just” cuts like a knife. The fact is that for a myriad of reasons, many of them simply can’t afford to stay home, and talking as if they can only underscores the extent of our shortsightedness.In many cases, the myopia displayed by the most vocal proponents of the lockdowns likely stems from the fact that they themselves have not been impacted nearly as much as those who are underprivileged. Politicians like to say “we’re all in this together,” but in reality, there isn’t really much “we” about it. Instead, there are two, starkly different lockdowns playing out.The first kind of lockdown is the one experienced by the “lockdown elite.” More akin to a romanticized inconvenience, this kind of lockdown is characterized by working remotely, chatting on Zoom calls and ordering Uber Eats.The second kind of lockdown is the one experienced by the lower class. For many, it means being unemployed or underemployed, and potentially putting themselves at a higher risk of infection. These lockdowns are also leading tohigher suicide ratesanddamaging an entire generation of kidswhose psychological well-being depends on rich social interactions.But even that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Drug overdoses have alsospikeddue to the enforced isolation, as well asdomestic violence rates. The dramatic rise in unemployment has also led to asurgein the number of Americans who can’t afford food. And on top of all that, senior citizens in particular have facedunimaginable suffering.In contrasting these two experiences, the privilege of the lockdown advocates becomes apparent. The “lockdown elite” are shielded from the trials of the marginalized, so it’s no surprise that they downplay the severity of the problems or deny that they even exist.The natural consequence of this circumstance is as obvious as it is uncomfortable. We need to “check our privilege.” Now to be sure, that phrase has been abused a lot, but the kernel of truth in it is that being protected from adversity can make us oblivious to the impacts of the policies we endorse. So “checking our privilege” in this case is about humbly recognizing the limits of our knowledge.We need to be particularly wary of arrogantly thinking that we can impose a sweeping, one-size-fits-all approach that will be generally beneficial. Aside from being paternalistic, the problem with this mindset is that it disregards the diverse range of individual experiences, needs, and risks that people are facing.A good example of this mindset can be seen in the mainstream discourse, which has revolved around questions such as “what should schools do” or “what should churches do.” For many of us it can be tempting to pick sides on these topics. But rather than weigh in on these debates, I think we would be better to insist that these are the wrong questions. Decisions about how to manage risk shouldn’t be top-down and universal. They need to be made independently by each local institution.Of course, it’s reassuring to imagine that the government is looking out for us and that their experts will make good decisions, but it’s important that we resist the allure ofcentral planning. Bureaucrats, scientists and journalists will all pretend to have the answers, but the truth is that they don’t. What’s more, we can do an awful lot of harm when we impose our “solutions” on people whose contexts we don’t understand.In light of this, truly “checking our privilege” means rejecting the top-down solutions that stem from our ignorance and hubris. Rather than assuming we know what’s best for others, we need to embrace a multifaceted, localized approach that empowers individuals to make their own choices.Invariably, many will object that ending the lockdowns in the name of economic expediency is rather imprudent, but this objection is missing the bigger picture. Ending the lockdowns isn’t about ignoring the very real risks we’re facing. Rather, it’s about taking responsibility for our own well-being and allowing others to take responsibility for theirs. Even more, it’s about recognizing that people’s livelihoods are not “non-essential”, and that our privilege often blinds us to the repercussions of our actions.Because here’s what you need to understand about the marginalized people bemoaning these lockdowns. They’re not greedy. They’re desperate. And you would be too if you were in their shoes.Patrick Carroll has a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Waterloo and is a Eugene S.

620,"Bob Iger As Ambassador To China? Hollywood Names Are Floating For Joe Biden Picks, But Rumors May Clash With Reality",-1.67,38.67,https://deadline.com/2020/12/bob-iger-chinese-ambassador-rumors-jeffery-katzenberg-joe-biden-disney-1234658940/,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,deadline,21,"With a newly elected Democratic president, this is the season of speculation, where names are being floated as potential ambassador picks. And this time around, Disney’s executive chairmanBob Igeris getting attention as a prospect for one of the highest profile foreign posts, China.But while there is a lot of talk of Iger and others (including Comcast’s David L. Cohen and former MPA chairman Chris Dodd), it’s still just that: talk.Not only is it premature, but the polarization in the Senate could make things dicey for any nominee, much less one who comes from the ranks of Hollywood, a favorite punching bag of the right.Joe Biden‘s team is said to be concentrating right now on its top-level cabinet picks. Team Biden has been sending out word that the speculation is premature and that nominations won’t be considered until after January 20. Last week, Sean Savett, who has been working on the transition team for Biden, reacted to a rumor that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had been offered an ambassadorship to The Bahamas and declined.Related StoriesPoliticsJoe Biden To Get Covid-19 Vaccine On Monday; Kamala Harris Will Receive Shot After ChristmasNewsJoe Biden Lands In L.A. For Campaign Visit; POTUS Easily Wins South Carolina Primary -- Update“This is not true. No decisions on ambassadorships outside of UN have been made,” Savett wrote.Iger isn’t the only deep-pocket Tinseltown name being tossed into the embassy speculation mix. As happened several times during the Obama era, longtime donor and presidential confidantJeffrey Katzenberghas also been rumored of late to be up for a plum overseas posting. However, a source with knowledge of the former Quibi boss’ situation bluntly says that such talk is bogus at best.This isn’t to say an ambassadorship for a Hollywood figure would not be so out of the ordinary. After Barack Obama’s presidential victory, he tapped Charles Rivkin, then CEO of WildBrain Media, and Nicole Avant, a music industry executive and producer, to be ambassadors to France and The Bahamas, respectively. Rivkin is now the chairman of the Motion Picture Association, and Avant is a producer.Four years later, Obama selected Colleen Bell, a television producer, as ambassador to Hungary, and HBO executive James Costos as ambassador to Spain.But this time around, the confirmation process could very well be a hurdle, particularly given the attacks Republicans have been prone to make on showbiz. Things will be smoother if Democrats win control of the Senate in the January 5 runoffs, and either way, much depends on timing and the nature of anti-Biden intransigence. But for politicians on the left and the right, the Walt Disney Co. has been a sure-fire way to draw attention.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has attacked Disney and other studios for “kowtowing” to China, and he was among a group of lawmakers in both parties who signed a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek in Septemberexpressing concerns over the credits ofbecause they included a note of thanks to Chinese authorities who have been cited for human rights abuses. An executive for the companylater said that the moviewas almost entirely shot in New Zealand, but some locations were used in China and that it was standard practice to acknowledge local governments in the credits.On the other side of the partisan divide is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who has chided Disney for the pay of its theme park workers compared with that of top executives, including Iger. The company recently said that it would lay off 32,000 workers, mostly in its theme parks, which face severe restrictions on attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic. One senior Hollywood executive with strong DC ties said that Iger would hit turbulence. “Hell no. There is no way that Iger would pass a confirmation hearing,” given the scrutiny facing the next posting in Beijing.Meanwhile, Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast, has been mentioned as a potential ambassador to the UK. In a recent interview with theformer Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendellsaid that he talked to Cohenabout a high-profile ambassador post or that of commerce secretary. Cohen, who was once Rendell’s chief of staff, held Biden’s first major fundraiser. Comcast has called the speculation premature. Dodd’s namehas long been floated as a potential ambassador to Ireland.He recentlydeclined commenton those prospects.None of this is to say that these ambassador picks would not be qualified, even very well qualified — particularly when compared to some other nominees of the past. Iger, for instance, has a raft of experience interacting and negotiating with senior leadership in China, particularly when it came to building the massive Shanghai Disneyland, and he himself considered running for president this year. There are also less high-profile postings, outside of world hotspots, that wouldn’t be such a flashpoint.While ambassador posts come with a certain level of glamour and cachet, there are downsides. Whoever is an ambassador will be stepping into a role assisted by career diplomats with far greater knowledge of the bureaucracy of the mission, and they may be subject to the scrutiny of the State Department, including inspector general audits. There is also the matter of pay — there are healthy benefits, but salaries run around $150,000 per year, a fraction of what top executives are accustomed to getting.Money isn’t an issue for many of those who are tapped for ambassadorships, typically from the ranks of campaign bundlers and top donors. The postings are intriguing enough for many in show business to make a career turn, even with the scrutiny. The likes of Shirley Temple Black and John Gavin have served as ambassadors, and others who have held posts describe it as an experience of a lifetime, even with the drawbacks.Yet more often than not, speculation as to who will get these posts doesn’t pan out. Back in 2012, Anna Wintour was floated as an Obama pick as ambassador to the UK or France. She got neither posting.Chances are that the coming weeks will see even more industry names floated as potential ambassador picks, but there is still a ways to go before the choices become reality.",1
621,Ron DeSantis leans into mask-mandate fights as Covid cases soar in Florida,-15.67,34.33,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/20/politics/ron-desantis-masks-florida-schools-covid-19/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,cnn,24,"As the number of new coronavirus cases in his state soars, Florida Gov.Ron DeSantisis betting that an aggressive campaign againstmandatory mask-wearingin schools will harden the Republican base ahead of his expected re-election bid next year – and make him a GOP star nationwide as the party’s 2024 presidential primary comes into view.The gamble appears to be paying off – for now. DeSantis is a Fox News darling and relishes the intensifying backlash from Democrats, especially President Joe Biden, who has criticized the governor and other Republican state executives for rejecting recommendations from public health experts and officials.But national attention does not always translate into political gain at home and could potentially seed new complications for DeSantis by the time Floridians go to the polls next year to cast their verdict on his first term. For now, the Delta variant’s surge in Florida is a wild card for the governor, who has refused to ramp up mitigation efforts even as the pandemic threatens the state’s tourism industry and – with schools opening – the safety of young students, their families, educators and other staff inside the buildings.The fates of elected officials in both parties during midterm elections are typically tied to the popularity of the sitting president. If Biden – and, more specifically, Biden’s brand of moderation that has been so popular in the suburbs – is on the up come November 2022, DeSantis could be in for a trickier campaign than most anticipate. If not, cutting a divisive figure could put the governor on a glide path to a relatively narrow, but comfortable re-election.That logic appears to be influencing DeSantis as he spreads his message across the country, whether on cable or at events like one in Utah in late July, where he ridiculed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over their new mask guidance – “Did you not get the CDC’s memo?,” he asked the mostly unmasked crowd to laughter. “I don’t see you complying” – and pledged to take a hardline against other measures.“It is very important that we say, unequivocally, no to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,” DeSantis told the conservative gathering.Florida Board of Education orders Broward, Alachua counties to allow mask opt-out in 48 hours or start losing fundingDeSantis is keen to play to friendly crowds and he appears mindful of where he picks his highest profile fights. His recent mask clashes have mostly centered in counties and school districts where, politically, he has the least to lose – Democratic strongholds that rejected him during his run for governor in 2018.Hillsborough and Miami-Dade, Florida’s largest county, both voted overwhelmingly for Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum nearly three years ago, when DeSantis won his first term by a little more than 32,000 votes, or less than one-half of 1 percentage point.School districts in those counties have taken steps in defiance of the governor. Hillsborough County Public Schools responded to a spike in Covid-19 infections and exposures by putting in place a 30-day mask mandate, and the school board in Miami-Dade voted to require face coverings in classrooms, setting up another round of conflict with DeSantis and top state officials who have threatened to sanction dissenters.DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw argued that rather than the governor being keen to pick fights in areas where he might have already lacked political support, DeSantis is simply carrying outthe lawhe signed in late June, which effectively banned schools from implementing mask mandates without parental opt outs – and that partisan politics might be influencing the school boards’ positions.“Due to the lack of empirical data to support forced masking of children, which isn’t even recommended at all in many European countries, it is hard to understand why these school boards would willingly violate the law,” Pushaw said in an email. “They argue it’s for the health of children, but they can’t provide data to support that assertion. Therefore it does appear to be political on their part.”Public health experts, including at the CDC, strongly encourage mask-wearing as a useful tool against the spread of Covid-19.“Community mask wearing substantially reduces transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2 ways. First, masks prevent infected persons from exposing others to SARS-CoV-2 by blocking exhalation of virus-containing droplets into the air,” according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Second, masks protect uninfected wearers. Masks form a barrier to large respiratory droplets that could land on exposed mucous membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth.”Hillsborough and Miami-Dade squared up with DeSantis on the same day Biden, in a speech from the White House, revealed that he had directed his Education Department to use its power to potentially overrule state executives preventing local jurisdictions from making their own masking rules. Biden did not mention DeSantis by name, but he called out “some politicians” for “trying to turn public safety measures – that is, children wearing masks in school – into political disputes for their own political gain.”“We are not going to sit by as governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children,” Biden said, suggesting that that the administration could pursue legal action.Hours later, in a conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity, DeSantis mocked the President and again previewed his 2022 – and, potentially, 2024 – campaign messages.“He is obsessed with having the government force kindergarteners to wear masks all day in school,” DeSantis said. “In Florida, we believe that that’s the parents’ decision. Joe Biden thinks the federal government should come and overrule the parents and force these young kids to wear these masks.”A day earlier, the Florida State Board of Education voted to recommend investigations into school officials in Alachua and Broward counties, which have acted in defiance of the governor’s ban on mandates. DeSantis lost Alachua, which voted to extend its mask mandate for 8 weeks on Tuesday, by more than 2 points in 2018. And in Broward, Gillum more than doubled DeSantis’ vote total, winning the county by a 68%-31% margin.Democratic candidates and Democratic-aligned groups are ringing alarm bells over the situation in Florida and pinning the bulk of the blame for the state’s dire circumstances – with more than 20,000 new Covid-19 cases being reported daily – on refusals by the governor and GOP lawmakers to allow proven mitigation measures even as cases climb among children.According to statistics from the Florida Department of Health, there were 16,764 new cases among those under 12 years old (a cohort not yet eligible to be vaccinated) from August 6-12. That represented a positivity rate of 22.1%, slightly higher than the state average. Floridians ages 12 to 19 years old accounted for nearly 15,000 new cases that week. Their positivity rate also exceeded the state number, at 24.3% to 19.3% overall.Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor running to win back his old job, responded to the state board’s decision, describing the standoff as a clash between courageous local officials, some of whom have been threatened with firings, and a power-hungry DeSantis.“He is overstepping the boundaries of his office to enforce his deadly political agenda on our lives, leaving our school boards and superintendents to bravely do what’s right and stand up against him,” Crist said in a statement. “Governor DeSantis lacks the compassion and common sense to get us out of this pandemic. I continue to stand with teachers, parents, and school boards doing what’s right for our students. We need a leader, not a dictator.”Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat in Florida and another potential DeSantis challenger next year, has also sharpened her attacks on the governor as she touts a federal lawsuit arguing, in part, that bans on mask mandates are in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.“These unconstitutional threats from DeSantis and (Florida Education Commissioner Richard) Corcoran aren’t about individual rights or freedom,” Fried said on Wednesday. “They’re about pandering to the most extreme voices in order to score political points at the expense of your kids, your family.”But even as the Delta-powered Covid-19 surge shows few signs of abating as the school year swings into gear, DeSantis is, much in the vein of former President Donald Trump, only becoming more strident – and undermining of real-world data and science that proves the utility of masks.“Politicians want to force you to cover your face as a way for them to cover their own asses,” he said on Wednesday. “That’s just the truth. They want to be able to say they are taking this on and they’re doing this, even though it’s not proven to be effective they want to continue to do it.”",1
622,Donors pledge $1bn in aid for Afghanistan as UN warns of crisis,-0.67,46.0,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/13/u-n-seeks-600-million-in-afghanistans-most-perilous-hour,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-13,aljazeera,25,"Donors have pledged more than $1bn to help Afghanistan, where poverty and hunger have spiralled since the Taliban took power and foreign aid has dried up, raising the spectre of a mass humanitarian crisis.Afghanistan, which has already suffered through four decades of wars and instability, is facing a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday in his opening remarks to the high-level ministerial conference on Afghanistan.Speaking to the media after the conference in Geneva, Guterres said the UN could not yet determine how much money had been pledged in response to its direct appeal for $606m and how much was promised to support other efforts or neighbouring countries.Al Jazeera’s Diplomatic Editor James Bays, reporting from Geneva, said that while the UN chief was “very pleased” with the response of the international community, he had warned the prospect of an economic collapse was a “serious possibility”.Guterres said many Afghans could run out of food by the end of this month, while the World Food Programme (WFP) said 14 million people are on the brink of starvation.The Taliban was previously in power in Afghanistan from 1996 to the US-led invasion of 2001, which ended their hardline government based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law that proscribed almost all public activity for women and girls.It swept back to power last month as the US-led NATO troops withdrew, with little to no resistance from the Western-backed government’s forces.But the Taliban is facing a major challenge as it has not been officially recognised by the international community, and Western countries and international financial organisations suspended aid to Afghanistan, depriving it of billions of dollars needed to finance vital food imports.Guterres remarked to journalists on the sidelines that it would be “impossible” to provide humanitarian assistance inside Afghanistan without engaging with the Taliban.“I do believe it is very important to engage with the Taliban at the present moment for all aspects that concern the international community,” he said.Speaking to Al Jazeera in Geneva, UN humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffiths said the UN wanted to make sure the money went directly to humanitarians on the ground who are delivering services to the Afghan people, calling the situation “very dire”.Neighbours China and Pakistan have already offered help.Beijing last week promised$31m worth of food and health suppliesand, on Friday, said it would send a first batch of three million coronavirus vaccines.Pakistan sent supplies such as cooking oil and medicine to authorities in Kabul and called for the unfreezing of Afghanistan’s assets.“Past mistakes must not be repeated. The Afghan people must not be abandoned,” said Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, whose country would most likely bear the brunt of any exodus of refugees.“Sustained engagement with Afghanistan in meeting its humanitarian needs is essential.”Both China and Russia said the main burden of helping Afghanistan out of crisis should lie with Western countries.“The US and its allies have a greater obligation to extend economic, humanitarian and livelihood assistance,” said Chen Xu, China’s UN ambassador in Geneva.The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the conference Washington was providing nearly $64m in new humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.“Let us commit today to meeting this urgent appeal for financial support, commit to standing by humanitarian workers as they do their all-important work, and to stepping up humanitarian action in Afghanistan so we can save the lives of Afghans in need,” she said.Meanwhile, France said it will contribute 100 million euros ($118 million) to the UN’s flash appeal.“Half of the (Afghan) population is now at risk, including more than four million women and around 10 million children. It is our responsibility to be at their side in this new ordeal,”  Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a high-level ministerial meeting in Geneva on Monday.Even before the Taliban’s seizure of Kabul last month, about half the Afghan population – or 18 million people – were dependent on aid. That figure looks set to increase due to drought and shortages of cash and food, UN officials and aid groups have warned.About a third of the $606m being sought would be used by the WFP, which found that 93 percent of the 1,600 Afghans it surveyed in August and September did not have sufficient food, mostly because they could not get access to cash to pay for it.“It’s now a race against time and the snow to deliver life-saving assistance to the Afghan people who need it most,” said WFP Deputy Regional Director Anthea Webb.“We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid food stocks running out.”The World Health Organization, another UN agency that is part of the appeal, is seeking to shore up hundreds of health facilities at risk of closure after donors backed out.Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kabul, said the situation at health clinics in the country was “completely shocking”.“We visited a few days ago a rural clinic just outside of Kabul that had a number of women who were expecting to give birth any day. They didn’t even have rubber gloves. There were no antibiotics, no antiseptics,” he said.“There were people coming in with colds and sore throats and the nurses and doctors could not even give them simple painkillers.”",2

Trump did not want a war, the chairman believed, but he kept pushing for a missile strike in response to various provocations against U.S. interests in the region. Milley, by statute the senior military adviser to the President, was worried that Trump might set in motion a full-scale conflict that was not justified. Trump had a circle of Iran hawks around him and was close with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was also urging the Administration to act against Iran after it was clear that Trump had lost the election. “If you do this, you’re gonna have a fucking war,” Milley would say.The report went on to say the outgoing president convened his advisers in the Oval Office on January 3 to discuss recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran’s nuclear activities.At that point both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump “it was not possible to do anything militarily at that point,” the report said. “Their attitude was that it was ‘too late to hit them.’“After Milley walked through the potential costs and consequences, Trump agreed. And that was that: after months of anxiety and uncertainty, the Iran fight was over.”",1
624,"Pfizer, Modena COVID vaccines and 5G wireless targeted by Russian disinformation, study finds",-1.67,46.0,https://fortune.com/2021/07/23/russian-disinformation-campaigns-are-trying-to-sow-distrust-of-covid-vaccines-study-finds/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,fortune,25,"Russian propagandists and Internet trolls are increasingly targeting companies with disinformation campaigns that are intended to damage their corporate reputations and stir public animosity.That’s according to newresearchpublished Friday by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit that studies the spread of misinformation and deception on social media likeFacebookandTwitter. The report’s findings are important because they highlight “a trend that disinformation is now being used as a means of economic warfare,” said NCRI lead intelligence analyst Alex Goldenberg.Traditionally, disinformation campaigns have been used “in the context of political warfare,” said Goldenberg. For instance, organizations with ties to the Russian government distributed fake news on social media before the 2016U.S. presidential election. Some of it centered onrace and politicsas a way to divide the nation.The NCRI report said that some of the same groups that spread political misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, including Russia’sInternet Research Agencyand the Global Research website, have been spreading and amplifying articles intended to “create distrust of U.S. 5G technology.” Some articles repeat conspiracy theories that5G wireless technology causes health problemsand that it is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.“This proliferation of 5G conspiracy theories, many of which are now intertwined with COVID-19 conspiracy theories, now threaten U.S. 5G infrastructure, associated companies, and their personnel,” the report said. “Last year, the Department of Homeland Security put the U.S. telecom industry on alert about related potential cell tower attacks and risks to telecommunications workers.”Some of the biggest producers of anti-5G conspiracy theories include Russian disinformation sourceslike the Russian state controlled television network RT. Alternative health and wellness sites like Natural News and Children’s Health Defense are also peddling anti-5G propaganda, the NCRI researchers said.Additionally, the report discovered that Russian troll outlets arespreading conspiracy theorieson social media that are intended to sow doubt about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines fromPfizerand Moderna. The goal is to promote the Russian Sputnik V vaccine at the expense of other COVID-19 vaccines, especially in African countries. Even if the propaganda campaign fails to convince U.S. citizens to consider taking the Sputnik V vaccine, the spread of the basic idea that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are ineffective and perhaps dangerous is valuable to the Russian troll outfits, Goldenberg said.For the report, the researchers analyzed 4 million articles since January 2020 that mentioned U.S. pharmaceutical companies like Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer and discovered that known-disinformation sources produced over half-a-million of those articles. The researchers also analyzed over 8 million Twitter posts and noticed a huge uptick of tweets containing the name Pfizer and words associated with conspiracy theories like “plandemic,” “big pharma,” and “scandemic” over the past year and a half. Sometimes, up to 100 of these malicious tweets were posted in a single minute, with surges occurring during the recent U.S. presidential election and when the phase 3 clinical trials of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine were revealed.Retailer H&M was also subject to a recent disinformation campaign that the researchers said may be linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The disinformation campaign involved the spread of articles and videos of various Chinese citizens criticizing H&M after the retailer expressed concern aboutreports of forced labor inChina’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Starbuckswas the victim of a disinformation campaign in 2018 that involved Internet pranksters creating a fake coupon that people of color could use to receive free coffee after an incident involving the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. The NCRI research said that the fake Starbucks coupon scandal ballooned to the point where political commenters were referencing the incident as it if it were real, “reaching millions of viewers and promoting outrage on Twitter.”As for future potential corporate propaganda campaigns, Goldenberg suspects that if scientists determine that people need a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine as protection from the emerging virus variants, it’s likely that disinformation sources will flood the Internet with anti-booster shot propaganda.NCRI CEO Adam Sohn believes that more corporate disinformation campaigns will continue as state and non-state actors have a solid playbook to spread misinformation across social media. He recommends that corporate marketers must have “an all-seeing eye for their brand on social media to get a sense of where the misinformation trends are in their industry.”“It might be Company A tomorrow, but it could be you the next day,” Sohn said.Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential business stories straight to your inbox each morning.",2

626,The Significance of the Derek Chauvin Verdict,-9.33,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-significance-of-the-derek-chauvin-verdict,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,newyorker,25,"At the Hennepin County Government Center on Tuesday afternoon, Judge Peter Cahill opened a yellow envelope and read out the verdict against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who, last May, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds, killing Floyd and igniting a nationwide uprising against police abuse and systemic racism. Chauvin wore a pale-blue face mask. His eyes darted from side to side. The verdict was guilty on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. And, within just a few minutes, it was over. Chauvin, now a convicted murderer, was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. Cahill thanked the jury for its “heavy-duty service.” Bail was revoked. The sentence will be handed down in eight weeks.Outside, on a broad lawn, several hundred people had congregated to wait for the news. There were Black Lives Matter activists, reporters, and many people who rushed to the area after getting alerts on their phones that the judge would soon read out the will of the jury. And, when they heard the first of the three guilty verdicts, the reaction was loud and unambiguous.“It was an explosive cheer,” Jelani Cobb told me, by telephone, from the courthouse.Cobb, a staff writer at, a historian, and the Ira A. Lipman professor of journalism at Columbia University, has been in Minneapolis covering the trial for the magazine. And he has been covering issues of race and criminal justice for many years, from Newark to Atlanta and beyond. We spoke at length on Tuesday; our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.I’m in front of the courthouse, on the lawn, at the same spot where, last week, Ben Crump, the lawyer for the Floyd family, had a rally and press conference. When the news came that there was a verdict coming, the crowd here went from fifty to several hundred in no time. Before the verdict was announced, there was a lot of anxiety. There was a sizable military contingent on the scene, too, in case of a verdict that caused an . . .reaction. People were nervous. People were jumpy. People were watching on their phones. Someone from Black Lives Matter had a bullhorn, and when the first ‘guilty’ was called out the crowd reacted. Real ebullience. Lots of raised fists in the air. And now there are loads of cars jamming the intersection here, people hitting their horns, a huge traffic jam.Honestly, I am surprised that they came back guilty on all three counts. But it turns out that the prosecution pitched a shutout. From experience and from learning about the unpredictable dynamics of these situations, you might have expected some sort of split verdict, kind of splitting the difference, but to get all three guilty verdicts was, at least to me, unanticipated.How am I feeling? It’s hard to describe. It’s important to remember that nothing that happened today changes the fact that we were witness to a man losing his life in the most excruciating way, while constantly saying he couldn’t breathe and begging for intercession from his dead mother. Some things you will never get out of your mind. Rather than say of the verdict that this is the best-case scenario, I’d prefer to say that it’s the least worst-case scenario.I was not shocked, no. I was disgusted and horrified. But you had to know, if you have been observing these things for long enough, that such things are always possible. That’s been one of the most essential things about this whole case—that we are now, all of us, Black and white, on the same page. Or should be. It’s that rare moment when we see through the same lens. We see what the terms are. We see what the issues of criminal justice in this country really are. This clarifies the terms of the discussion.Right. Because, on the one hand, you have the catharsis of a triple-guilty verdict. But at the same time, in theof the trial, we had the police shooting of a young man, Daunte Wright, just down the road, in Brooklyn Center.There are lots of questions. First, what kind of police department are they going to have? There are people here in town who are still organizing around abolishing the force as it exists and creating an alternative structure for public safety. Also, I’d anticipate increased attention to the other trials coming up, in August, of the three other officers who were present when George Floyd was killed.It’s been incredibly tense. A lot of establishments and buildings in town were boarded up. There was real fear. They were worried that a lesser verdict or an acquittal would set off a wave of demonstrations and violence. Talking with people in various communities, I found that there were a lot of people who expressed the idea that, at best, Derek Chauvin might be convicted of the least of the charges. And nearly everyone here, across all kinds of lines of age and race and class, predicted chaos if he was acquitted outright. Younger African-Americans, in particular, didn’t rule out the possibility of an acquittal.The prosecutors did a few things that were interesting. The first notes that you heard from them were the emotional notes. They went through how deeply the community near where George Floyd was killed was traumatized. Not only the people who knew him but others, too, like the 911 dispatcher. Then came the real meat of the case. You got a parade of experts—medical people, especially—knocking down the defense’s contentions, one after another. The prosecution’s closing argument was especially revealing. The argument was calibrated to any jurors who might have had any qualms about sending a police officer to prison for many years. The theme was, subtly, “Remember, it’s not the system that’s on trial—it’s this one guy.” In a way, this was a pro-cop strategy for the prosecution, and it was carefully designed to assuage any uneasiness a juror might have.[Many] reporters were not in the courtroom. So, like you, we never saw the jury and its reactions. And we saw Derek Chauvin only infrequently. He remained an enigma throughout. Here was this person at the center of a national tempest, and yet we couldn’t really tell what his thoughts or reactions were. Was he contrite? The one time we got to hear from him was when he said he wouldn’t testify, and there he seemed almost cavalier. And people noticed that. But, in general, it was hard to see how he was processing all this. He remained as shrouded in mystery as he was in the nine minutes-plus that he was kneeling on George Floyd’s neck.The defense? I’d make a baseball analogy: a pitcher who throws a lot of everything—knuckleballs, screwballs, curves—and hopes that something,, works. So, for instance, they brought out their carbon-monoxide defense, saying that George Floyd was affected by the exhaust from the squad car. It reminded me of the Twinkie defense in the killing of Harvey Milk, in 1978, in San Francisco. Remember that? The defense threw out everything they could, playing the game of raising any kind of doubt they could—the drug-overdose theory, the heart-attack theory—and it was all knocked down. In the end, the defense lawyers had the unenviable task of getting a jury past a video that the whole world had seen.If Derek Chauvin had not been convicted, it would have said to the world that there is absolute impunity for police. Most Black people already think that. Recently, we saw another instance that made the systemic nature of things plain. In Chicago, not only did the police shoot Laquan McDonald in the back—the entire system in that city was implicated because the video of that killing was buried. And, in North Charleston, we saw on video a police officer shoot Walter Scott in the back, and then we learned that he had dropped a Taser near his body, to imply that Scott had run off with the Taser. Even that initially ended in a mistrial. And that all took place in the context of the massacre when a white supremacist killed nine Black people in a church in downtown Charleston.There is this question about the extent to which the system is culpable. With Derek Chauvin, you couldn’t get around the systemic implications of what had happened. The fact is that George Floyd’s life was extinguished, and no one intervened. Chauvin had been on the force for well over a decade. The trial, the whole affair, started to add up to its larger implications. The trial strategy tried to limit things to a conversation about one man going rogue, that Chauvin did what no good cop would have done. Ultimately, that’s not true. It’s not just one cop. Everyone here in Minneapolis, all the people I’ve talked to, say the same thing: we all know how much work needs to be done on the greater issue, on the issue of systemic racism.",1

Journalist Abigail Shrier wrote on Twitter last month: 'On day 1, Biden unilaterally eviscerates women's sports.' The hashtag #BidenErasedWomen began trending.But LGBT activists say the order was simply Biden's attempt at moving towards a more inclusive society - just as he pledged to do in his inaugural address.Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union, said: 'By stating the administration’s intention to follow Supreme Court precedent and federal law, at core all the newly-elected president did was lay out what the law is and agree, unlike his predecessor, to follow it.'On Monday, Psaki also appeared to mock another Fox reporter who asked where Biden's green jobs are after 1,000 people were put out of work with president's decision to cancel Keystone XL pipeline.The president signed the order, titled Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, just hours after assuming office.

Since 2016, he quickly reinstated the global gag rule and appointed two conservative justices to the Supreme Court. But when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg—a bastion of reproductive rights—died just a month before the November 2020 election, it felt like the last nail in the coffin of. With a decisive conservative majority now in the Supreme Court, the future of abortion and other reproductive health services appears unclear. If you’re wondering how activists survived in a world beforeRoeor about the many barriers to care still facing communities of color today, here are the books you must read.For fifty years,has been the introductory book for reproductive health care. What was once focused solely on women’s health issues like pregnancy and menopause has expanded over the years to address issues like poverty, race, and gender identity and their impact on reproductive health care, making it stand the test of time.Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community, edited by Laura Erickson-Schroth:Inspired by the classicOur Bodies, Ourselves,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesis the reader’s comprehensive guide for caring for their body. Just asOur Bodies, Ourselvescovered reproductive health issues like menstruation and pap smears,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesgets into topics like medical and surgical transition, parenthood, and mental health. Written entirely by transgender or genderqueer authors, each essay is a helpful guide for understanding trans health.Before there was legal abortion, there was the battle for contraception itself and the ability to prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. Eig’s book is ahighly detailed, highly informativeaccount of the social and financial stumbling blocks that the creators of the first birth-control pill faced in trying to get their product developed. It also doesn’t shy away from the problematic aspects of the story in regards to medical consent or the controversial histories of the figures involved in the groundbreaking achievement.When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine, and Law in the United States, by Leslie Reagan:Roe v. Wadewasn’t the beginning of abortion—it was just the beginning of legal abortion. Reagan’s book details the nearly 100 years leading up to theRoedecision and how abortion went from illegal but mostly ignored to targeted by medical professionals and driven underground, only to eventually resurface and gain legal acceptance.The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, by Laura Kaplan:While abortion was illegal, some women took matters into their own hands.The Story of Janeis a slightly fictionalized account of the women in Chicago who learned to perform abortions themselves and became a safe haven for illegal but safe procedures.The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v. Wade, by Ann Fessler:Of course, not everyone who got pregnant pre-Roewas able to access an abortion…or even wanted one. But for many of those—often teens—who did give birth, they did it in secrecy and their children were stolen from them and given to “better” families to raise. Fessler’s interviews with those who lost their babies during what became known as the Baby Scoop Era is a heartbreaking reminder of why adoption must be entered into willingly and uncoerced.In Wicklund’s memoir, she explains what motivated her to become a provider: her own experience obtaining an abortion. In a candid, first-person account, Wicklund tells her own history, starting with an abortion in her family’s past and continuing through the constant harassment and fear of being an abortion provider in the ’80s and ’90s., by Carole Joffe:What was it like to offer clandestine abortions before they were legal? How did doctors decide to add abortion as a service once it became legal? What professional and societal pressures were put on them once they chose to openly offer care? Joffe, a sociologist, talks to a number of early providers who tell their stories in their own words.Fetus Fanatics: When Government Collaborates With Anti-Choice Zealots, by Peggy Bowman:In 1991, Operation Rescue brought hundreds of “pro-life” activists to Wichita, Kansas, and shut down the abortion clinics for weeks in what was known as the Summer of Mercy. Bowman, a pro-choice activist working for Dr. George Tiller, was at the center of the action and tells about how the local government turned a blind eye, allowing the siege on the city’s clinic to continue unabated, which she believes led to the escalating hostility that eventually resulted in abortion providers nationwide becoming direct targets of violence.There are an endless number of first-person anti-abortion accounts, but none have had the detail or quality of writing thatoffers. Miller, an anti-abortion activist and photographer, tells the story of how she joined up with some of the most notorious anti-abortion activists of the ’80s and how their secret trips to recover the remains of aborted fetuses from Chicago clinics eventually became the foundation for many of the graphic images seen on posters and placards today. Quite possibly the best look inside the mind and motivations of an opponent of abortion.Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation, by Charles Camosy:Despite Camosy’s best intentions, few who support reproductive justice will see his very strict exceptions for when abortion should be legal and how it should be performed in those rare cases to be any sort of workable “compromise.” But what Camosy does offer in his book is a seldom seen and very earnest advocacy for reforms like paid pregnancy leave, more health care, universal pre-K, and childcare support plus even more penalties for domestic violence or refusing to provide child support—reforms both sides of the aisle should be able to get behind.Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War, by James Risen and Judy Thomas:Starting with the legalization of abortion and the early days of the Rescue movement—those activists best known for barricading clinic doors in the ’80s and early ’90s—the book follows the struggle to keep clinics open until the introduction of the FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act. The two reporters detail the lives of some of the most passionate and persistent anti-abortion advocates, including the power struggles within their own movement. Likely the most accessible book on the birth of the “pro-life” movement.While abortion rights and access to birth control have been under continuous assault since the 2010 election, the dismantling of these rights began even earlier. Feldt, the former president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, documents the beginning of the onslaught, which escalated during the Bush administration, in her now-16-year-old but still relevant book., by Christina Page:According to Page, the religious right doesn’t just want to overturnRoe—they want to end access to contraception too and make sex a thing only married people do and only when they want to have children. She explains the many-pronged ways they are trying to undermine your sex life, from pharmacist refusals of birth-control prescriptions to abstinence-only sex ed in school, and then champions the somehow controversial idea that sex for enjoyment alone is actually a good thing.Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights, by Katha Pollitt:Can people win back their reproductive rights when they are ashamed to even talk about abortion? That’s the premise behindPollitt’s bookas she urges everyone to delve into the abortion wars to better understand that abortion is not shameful.Shout Your Abortion, edited by Amelia Bonow and Emily Nokes:When Congress tried to defund Planned Parenthood in 2015, Bonow disclosed her own abortion experience and started a movement with the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion. SYA quickly spread across the country, with people sharing their abortion stories through art, music, comedy, and fashion. This 2018 book documents those projects with essays and photography that reject the notion that abortion is supposed to be shameful and instead celebrate the right to choose.Nelson’s book brings to the forefront the women of color vocally advocating for legal abortion rights—often in opposition to those in their own community. It’s a must-read for those who want to learn how the battle for abortion rights evolved into reproductive justice.There is perhaps no more important book when it comes to tracing the history of reproductive oppression faced by Black women in the United States. From slavery to coerced sterilization to welfare caps, Roberts lays out centuries of assault on Black women and families with regard to when and if they are allowed to control their own reproductive lives.Taking Children: A History of American Terror, by Laura Briggs:Reproductive justice has always been about much more than the right to choose—it’s also about the right to safely parent the children you choose to have. InTaking Children, Briggs dives into the sweeping 400-year history of the United States separating Black, Native, and Latinx children from their parents—from slavery to the Native American boarding school system. Although family separations at the border have sparked outrage in recent years, Briggs’s book shows that the practice is nothing new.Reproductive Justice: The Politics of Health Care for Native American Women, by Barbara Gurr:You may have heard that the Hyde Amendment prevents federal dollars from funding abortions, meaning that folks on Medicaid cannot use their insurance for abortion care. But did you know that the same rule applies to other federal programs, including the Indian Health Service? InReproductive Justice, Gurr examines access to reproductive health care on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota—from abortion access to care after sexual assault and prenatal appointments.Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women’s Reproduction in America, by Jeanne Flavin:Flavin explains in detail how women are targeted and punished through the court system while pregnant or raising children, especially when they don’t conform to society’s standard idea of what constitutes being an ideal mother.Policing the National Body: Race, Gender, and Criminalization in the United States, by Jael Silliman and Anannya Bhattacharjee:There is no reproductive freedom without actual freedom, and for poor communities and communities of color, incarceration is a daily threat.Policing the National Bodyfocuses on how reproductive rights are limited in a society ready to punish those who are undocumented, poor, or of color and speaks directly to the populations often underrepresented in the mainstream reproductive rights movement.Just like the Hyde Amendment prevents any federal dollars from funding abortions in the U.S., the “global gag rule” prohibits any health care organization abroad from even mentioning abortion if it receives U.S. funding. The rule has been reinstated under every Republican administration since Ronald Reagan, and in 2017, Donald Trump went even further by expanding the policy. In her book, Rodgers argues that the global gag rule doesn’t actually reduce abortions but instead cuts funding for vital contraceptive, prenatal, and childcare programs.Solinger’s book explores abortion, assisted reproductive technologies, “personhood,” and other reproductive issues in simple, straightforward language that anyone—academic or layperson—can digest. With its brief summaries and documentation of how each particular reproductive issue has evolved over time due to political changes and pressure, you can think of it as a Reproductive Rights 101 textbook.Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation, by David A. Grimes, MD:Written by a doctor, this book is a bit drier and more medical than many others on the list but also involves far more scientifically accurate and fact-based information about abortion’s impact on those who undergo them and on society on the whole. In addition to telling of his own time as an abortion provider, Dr. Grimes patiently explains away the myths that anti-abortion activists have inserted into the debate, such as abortion causing breast cancer or the likelihood of injury during a procedure.",1
633,Private schools are the real college admissions scandal.,-6.33,41.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/private-schools-competitive-college-advantage-problems.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,slate,25,"The Supreme Court kicked the can down the road today on the case of Students for Fair Admissions’ case against Harvard University, with an invitation to the solicitor general to write a brief expressing the view of the United States. The invitation is a delay, but the case will be considered again. SFFA attempts to argue that the nation’s most famous college discriminates against Asian Americans in the admissions process, and even thoughit’s lost twice in court, it’s expected that this current court, packed with conservative justices, would rule in favor of the astroturf organization dedicated to killing affirmative action should it decide to hear the case.SSFA’s leader, Ed Blum, has been trying for decades toeliminate affirmative actionin college admissions. After he failed with Abigail Fisher’s suit against the University of Texas (that one argued Fisher had been discriminated against for being white but failed to provide compelling evidence), Blum started courting Asian American students who were rejected by Ivy League institutions. It is unclear how many he found, since not one student testified on SFFA’s behalf during the trial, but the organization’s legal strategy relied on statistical arguments to claim that Harvard’s admissions policies gave advantages to legacies, donors, athletes, and underrepresented minorities, which hurt Asian American applicants. In trying to claim an equivalence between providing unfair advantages to the already advantaged (legacies, donors, athletes) and taking race and racism into account during the admissions process, SFFA has cannily yoked its attack on race-conscious admissions to a critique of actually illegitimate advantages given to the white and wealthy.But there’s a clear tell in this strategy that reveals SFFA does not really care about unearned advantages: It said nothing about graduating from a private high school.Graduating from private high school is a far larger advantage at many top ranked colleges than playing sports or being a legacy or even having a connection to a donor are. (Viewed a certain way, a private school is almost a more reliable income source for an elite college than a donor.) While 10 percent of students admitted toHarvard’s Class of 2018were recruited athletes and 12 percent were legacies,almost 40 percent of the class went to a private school. If we really wanted to get rid of the most glaring case of bias at prestigious private universities, we would target private high school students.Legacy, donor, and athletic preferences should be stripped out of college admissions too, but when it comes to tipping the scales away from fairness and equity, private schools outweigh everything else. Only 7 percent of high school students attended private high schools in the United States in 2019,according to Census Bureau data, but at many of the most selective colleges in the nation private school grads make up a third to half of freshman classes.This is the real scandal in college admissions: Wealthy families pay for their children to attend high schools that receive preferential treatment in the admissions process athighly rejective colleges.Defenders of private high schools’ overrepresentation at many highly ranked universities might claim the students have reaped the benefit of a more rigorous education in order to earn their spot. When you control for wealth, however, private school’s academic and social-emotional benefits arebasically wiped out. Historically, students from the nation’s elite boarding schools “perform[ed] worse in the classroom [at Harvard] than other students over the entire 1924-1990 period” but went on to make more money than their peers by taking advantage of the connections they made in groups like final clubs, which largely exclude anyone who is not wealthy or white.St. Grottlesexstudents and their peers at old nondenominational private schools might be a little less white and little less wealthy than they were a century ago, but have no doubt: These schools still do not look like America. This year’s graduating class of public high school students is the firstprojected to be majority-nonwhite, but almost70 percentof private school students are white. That’s a product, in part, of along historyof white people pulling their children out of public schools after desegregation, and private schools continuing to make an outsize contribution to school segregation in the United States.Most independent schools do provide some financial aid, but it often goes to a small share of students. At Marlborough, an independent school in Los Angeles where the cost of attendance is about $45,000, only 20 percent of families receive financial aid, and almost half of those who do still make more than $200,000 per year. About 6 percent of all the school’s students come from families making less than $100,000,even though almost two-thirds of American households make less than that. Some independent schools enroll a number of low-income students on scholarship, and these “privileged poor,” to use Anthony Jack’s term,account for half the low-income students at some highly selective universities, further evidence of the advantage granted to these schools in the admissions process.Private high schools can cost as much as$70,000per year. For those prices, students get not onlysingle-digit student-to-teacher ratios,teachers with Ph.D.s,better sports facilities than those at many colleges, andart museums, but also college counselors who work with a fraction of the number of students public school counselors work with. At Horace Mann, in the Bronx,180 seniors are served by eight college counselors. Fewer than 2 miles away,12 guidance counselors work with 750 seniors at Bronx Science. Both high schools are full of very talented students, but onlyone of them pays its director of college counseling $350,000 per year.That salary is an index of just how much emphasis the parents who pay for independent schools place on getting their kids into certain universities, which may be why the median salary for a college counselor at independent schools is $94,000 but the median salary for a teacher is $60,000, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Many independent school counselors started in college admissions, often at highly selective colleges;one of the newest members of this rank was a dean of admissions at an Ivy League university just last fall. These high schools are paying not just for experts who know the rules of the game; they are paying for experts who know the referees. It’s a cozy world, where private school counselors meet up with admissions officers at small invitation-only annual meetings, likethe Fitzwilliam Conferenceheld in the woods of New Hampshire every May for three days, including a six-hour block for “golf, hiking, antiquing.” And then there’s the annual Clambake Institute, where private school counselors and admissions officers get together every summer atSt. George’s Schooljust outside Newport, Rhode Island—the perfect setting for cementing and perpetuating the special bond between rich high schools, rich students, and rich universities.That special bond is cashed in through one of the least-well-known rituals of college admissions:the counselor call. It’s a decades-old tradition, in which school counselors and admissions officers review a list of students who have applied to a college, and counselors get a chance to make a case for their students.Swarthmore College put an end to the practice this past year after it discovered that more than 90 percent of their requests for counselor calls came from private high schools. This spring, USC began telling counselors requesting a call that any conversation would be informational, and asked counselors to “refrain from advocating for candidates.”But simply attending certain high schools can provide enough of an advantage that no advocacy is needed.Harvard’s dean of admissions said as much under oath in 2018during the SFFA trial: “[Sometimes] we take somebody … lower in the class … and we’ve got some other very attractive people at the upper end of the class. Sometimes you can make an argument to take them both because they’re both terrific.” The dean continued, “It’s also a very good message to that school that you may be trying to develop that you’re looking for all kinds of different people.”In other words, someone thought that a good way for Harvard to defend itself against charges that it unfairly advantaged underrepresented minorities was to say, no, no, don’t worry, the unfair advantage goes to overrepresented wealthy students. The wordgives away the game. Any head of admissions knows that he needs to build a reliable pipeline of customers from certain institutions. As Harvard’s dean testified, “We’re trying to create relationships with schools. … We’re trying to create 100-year relationships with them.”Even as it feels counter to the endeavor of competitive admissions based on merit, it’s perfectly logical for colleges and private high schools to pursue cozy relationships. To quote Willie Sutton, that’s where the money is. A full-paying student at an Ivy League school is worth well more than a quarter-million dollars in revenue over four years, plus future donations. Some schools will send five or six students a year, which adds up to a million-plus in revenue, year over year for ideally a century or more, apparently. In return, the high schools gain a level of access that lets them charge more thanwhat many Americans make per year.To be fair, superselective universities also cultivate these relationships with organizations likeQuestbridgeand some public school counselors to create a pipeline for high-achieving, low-income students, but the numbers suggest there’s a lot more pipe being laid on the Upper East Side of Manhattan than in the South Bronx or rural New York.There islittle point in criticizingany of the individuals involved in this corrupt relationship between private schools and highly selective colleges. The parents who send their kids to independent schools and the counselors and teachers working in them are, in my experience, conscientious and caring individuals keenly aware of their students’ privilege and their own, and many of them work hard to increase equity and diversity at their school and in college admissions. Some of themran into oppositionthis past year, as a few white parents bristled at schools’ efforts to introduce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the wake of the anti-racist protests last summer as well asa string of affecting social media campaigns where Black students revealed the racism they routinely faced at school. If we are going to have an aristocracy, I guess it’s better to have a woke one. But wouldn’t it be better to have no aristocracy at all?Short of eliminating private schools, we cannot eliminate the advantage families purchase by enrolling their children in them. We might, however, reduce some of that advantage by doing four things.First, all universities should end counselor calls.Second, universities should be required to report annually what type of high schools their first-time students attended, disaggregated by race. More than half of the top 75 institutions in the U.S. News & World Report rankings do not publish this information, suggesting they either do not think the overrepresentation of private high school students matters or that they want to keep that fact out of sight. I’m not sure which is worse.Third, universities should stop asking school counselors for letters of recommendation. How can a counselor responsible for 200 seniors possibly write each one a letter as effectively as one with only 30 students can?Fourth, admissions offices should redact the name of the school during the admissions process and stop assigning applications by region, as most highly selective colleges do. Context is essential for admissions officers to consider applicants’ merits rather than their accomplishments. A file could still contain relevant information about a high school, such as the number of students on free lunch programs, or its student-to-counselor ratio. Going school-blind would not erase context, but it would hide the brand names.Highly selective colleges might not be ready to break their hundred-year relationships with private high schools. But they could certainly become less toxic for everyoneelse.",1

The project is meant to produce a family of uncrewed aerial systems that can move into contested spaces and conduct aerial missions that might be too dangerous for human pilots to perform.The Air Force announced contract awards Dec. 7 for the three companies that will produce prototypes for the air vehicle portion of Skyborg and compete in a series of experiments in the hopes of winning a production contract.Three companies are under contract for a two-year period of performance:• Boeing, which received $25.7 million;• General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which received $14.3 million;• Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., which received $37.8 million.Military officials expect the first prototypes to be delivered no later than May 2021 for initial flight tests. The prototypes will then proceed into flight experiments beginning in July 2021 that will test each drones’ ability to team with manned aircraft, the service stated in a news release.“This award is a major step forward for our game-changing Skyborg capability — this award supporting our operational experimentation is truly where concepts become realities,” said Brig. Gen. Dale White, head of the Air Force’s program executive office for fighters and advanced aircraft, which manages the program alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory.One key differentiator between Skyborg and past combat drone programs is the development of artificial intelligence that will allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and potentially learn from prior training missions.Over the past several months, the program has focused on developing the technologies necessary for the “Autonomous Core System,” the hardware and software that will enable the Skyborg drone to operate semi-independently from a human operator, who will be able to issue commands but will not have to physically fly the system. The system is being designed by Leidos, using input from the Air Force and other Skyborg vendors.After prototypes are delivered, the Air Force will outfit them with that autonomy module. The three prototype manufacturers must also prove their aircraft is capable of incorporating payloads and mission systems being supplied by the other 10 companies on contract to potentially supply capabilities for the Skyborg program.In July and September, the Air Force awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract worth up to $400 million toestablish a pool of 13 vendorsthat would compete to offer Skyborg hardware and software — everything from the drones themselves, to sensors, weapons and algorithms.Those companies include: AeroVironment Inc., Autonodyne LLC, BAE System Controls Inc., Blue Force Technologies Inc., Fregata Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Northrop Grumman, Sierra Technical Services, and Wichita State University, as well as the three companies tapped to build air vehicle prototypes.“There will be competition throughout the entire period of performance of these awards. The effort will consist of multiple phases, meant to continue evaluation of the performance of the vendors,” the service stated.Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

The NO BAN Act Coalition, a broad alliance of 81 national and local civil rights, faith, and community groups fighting for anti-discrimination legislation that isnow includedin Biden's U.S. Citizenship Act, issued astatementbidding ""goodbye to the Muslim and African ban.""The statement continued:Almost four years ago, one of President [Donald] Trump's first acts in office was to ban Muslims from the United States. Three years later, he expanded the ban to include several African countries. Today, it's fitting that one of Biden's first acts is to rescind the Muslim and African Ban. This is a momentous occasion for the millions of Americans who were separated by the ban and those who stood up against this injustice at airports nationwide.Thank you, President Biden for staying true to your promise to repeal this bigoted policy immediately. The Muslim and African Ban was never about national security, it was always rooted in bigotry and called into question what values America stands for. However, just ending the ban through an executive order won't stop this from happening again. That's why we applaud the historic inclusion of the NO BAN Act in the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021.Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations-San Francisco Bay Area,toldthat Biden's order would ""correct the course"" of the lives disrupted by Trump.""Tens of thousands of impacted individuals will now have the chance to be with their families during cherished and challenging times,"" said Billoo. ""While we know our work is far from over, today we celebrate the heroic efforts undertaken by so many over the last several years in our effort to repeal the Muslim and African bans.""Some of the most poignant reaction to the end of the ban came from people directly affected by it. Ramez Alghazzouli, a Syrian immigrant who had been separated from his wife for a year due to the policy, toldit felt like a boulder had been removed from his chest. But he also said the travel prohibition irreparably damaged his family.""The ban itself will be reversed but no one can reverse our feelings and emotions and the time we lost while being separated from each other,"" said Alghazzouli. ""It'll still be part of our life and history. The Muslim ban is the nuke that we survived but we are still suffering from its collateral damage.""There was no shortage of suggestions on what Biden could do help heal the harm caused by travel ban, from ending Trump-era ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims and others entering the U.S., to increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country, to ending U.S. wars that havekilledat least hundreds of thousands of Muslim men, women, and children since 2001.",1
