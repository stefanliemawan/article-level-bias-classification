0,Ramming a $15 Minimum Wage Bill Through the Senate Using Reconciliation Would Be a Norm-Busting Mistake,4.33,43.33,https://reason.com/2021/02/03/ramming-a-15-minimum-wage-bill-through-the-senate-using-reconciliation-would-be-a-norm-busting-mistake/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,25,"Fittingly fors,omeone whos,pent more than three decades as a member of the US Senate, President Joe Biden holds thes,o-called world is greatest deliberative body in high regard. Biden calls the Senate his ""second home"" in his 2007 memoirand, as that metaphors,uggests, it is often obvious that the relationship is about more than just a physical place. Bidens,ees the Senate—with its arcane rules and combative but dignified atmosphere—as the embodiment of what governments,hould aspire to be. When Bidens,tresses that Americans must learn to disagree without disrespect ing one another, as he did in his inaugural address, he is drawing on the ethos of the Senate. ""Unity requires you to eliminate the vitriol, make anything you disagree with about the other person is personality. We have to get rid of that,"" Bidensaid last month. But when it comes to passing one of the new president is first major policy initiatives, Senate Democrats are already looking for a divisives,hortcut. As part of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, Biden is asking lawmakers to also pass a massive increase in the federal minimum wage—hiking it to $15 per hour from the current rate of $7.25 per hour. It is both ironic and telling that doings,o might require effectively abolishing an arcane rule that is intended to encourage debate. No, I am not talking about the filibuster, though Democrats may eventually decide to do away with the rule that requires as,uper majority of 60 votes to cut off debate and bring a bill to a final vote. Instead, they are turning to an even less well-understood Senate rule: reconciliation. Reconciliation was invented in 1974 when Congress rewrote its rules for passing budgets. It is intended to allow Congress to quickly make changes tola ws governing federal revenue ands,pending by limiting how long legislators can debate bills filed under the reconciliation process. In effect, it creates a way for as,imple majority in the Senate to pass budget bills,in certain circumstances without allowing the minority to hold up the process with the threat of a filibuster. According to the Congressional Research Service, a think tank housed within Congress, the reconciliation process has been used25 times. You may recall that Republicans recently used reconciliation to get the 2017 tax cuts through the Senateand that they tried (unsuccessfully) to use the process to repeal Obamacare. Here is where it gets extra confusing. To use thiss,pecial filibuster-bypassing loophole, a bill must pass a multi-step test known as the ""Byrd rule""—named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D–W Va.), who invented the test as a way to limit the use of the reconciliation process. Whether a bill comports with the Byrd rule is up to exactly one person: Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who is more or less an unelected mage responsible for interpreting the Senate is rules,and adjudicating disputes over them. In order to clear the Byrd rule, and thus be eligible to be passed with as,imple majority as opposed to 60 votes, a piece of legislation contain elements that are ruled extraneous to the federal budget. There are other aspects of the Byrd rule banning legislation that inflates the long-term federal budget deficit (which is why the 2017 tax bill contained a bunch of gimmicky promises about future tax hikes) and prohibiting any changes to Social Security, but the budget mandate is the key issue at play with the proposed minimum wage increase. Most aspects of Biden is proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill would be eligible for passage under reconciliation. Boosting emergencys,pending or offering tax breaks to offset individuals' and businesses' losses due to the pandemic—regardless of whether they are fiscallys,mart policies or not—pretty clearly meet the Byrd rule is threshold.""BryBut does hiking the federal minimum wage? That is debatable. Progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) are making a roundabout argument that increasing the federal minimum wage can be done via reconciliation because it would haves,ome knock-on effect on federal tax revenue. In other words, forcing businesses to pay hourly workers higher wages will translate into higher taxable income for those workers and thus more tax revenue for the government. Additionally, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a $15 federal minimum wage would decrease dependence on federal welfare programs b yat least $13 billion annually. But approaching the Byrd rule in that manner makes it effectively null and void. Ins,trokes that broad, any major change to federal policy could have knock-on effects that impact tax revenues or future expenditures. For example, if Biden were to propose that the federal government mandate every household adopt a dog within the nexts,ix months, one could argue that the corresponding up tick in demand for dog food and chew toys would force businesses that produce those products to hire more workers, and that hiring (and paying) more workers would impact federal tax revenue down the road. You might even be able to argue that the resulting increase in happiness would reduce future government health care expenditures (or perhaps that it would increase thems,ince dog ownerss,tatistically live longer). All those things might be true, but that would not make the Puppy Mandate of 2021 directly linked to the federal budget in a way that the reconciliation rules were crafted to allow. But wait, there is one more wrinkle—because this is the Senate and nothing is evers,traightforward. If MacDonough rules that the minimum wage hike can not be passed via reconciliation, the Senate cans,till overrule her decision. Doings,o would require as,uper majority of 60 votes,s,o that is probably not feasible—unless Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, unilaterally acts to overrule MacDonough. That is never been done before, but notes that it is technically allowed under Senate rules. For now, this whole debate could bes,omewhat moot. Sen. Joe Manchin (D–W Va.)s,ays he will nots,upport a $15 national minimum wage. Instead, he isproposing to hike the minimum wage to $11 per hour. And if Democrats can not get unifieds,upport from all 50 of their members on this issue, then the reconciliation route is useless. All of this procedural analysis ignores thes,trong policy-based arguments against raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour across the entire country. Including that wage hike in what is ostensibly a COVID-19 relief bill, as is Billy Binionpointed out last week, is particularly bizarres,ince many businesses that would bes,ubject to the higher labor costs are justs,truggling to keep their doors open right now. The Biden administration is touting a Congressional Budget Office reports,howing that a $15 national minimum wage would lift about 1 million workers out of poverty, but it is conveniently downplaying the fact that thes,ames,tudys,ays the change would eliminate 1.3 million jobs. It is certainly possible that Democrats will ignore that and try to ram the higher minimum wage—either $15 per hour or $11 per hour—through Congress using reconciliation. ""We are not going to take 'no' for an answer"" is how Sandersdescribed the effort to CNBClast week. Ifs,o, we could be treated to thes,pectacle of the Biden administration iss,econd-in-command unilaterally overturning the Senate is rules in an unprecedented way that virtually guarantees the Byrd rule no longers,erves as as,ignificant impediment to passing any legislation via the reconciliation process—and doing its,o a controversial policy change can be implemented with thes,upport, maybe, of just 50s,enators plus the vice president. After preaching about the value of unity and promising to end an era of political norm-breaking, that would be a heck of a way for Biden to demonstrate that he does not much care about any of those things.",1,1,Reason
1,"Impeachment and the Democrats: How will theys,crew this up? Let me count the ways",-22.5,30.5,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/06/impeachment-and-the-democrats-how-will-they-screw-this-up-let-me-count-the-ways/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-12-06,25,"Thursday’s announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Democrats are ready to vote articles of impeachment against President Trump — presumably on the narrowest possible terms, after a constrained and foreshortened process — is hardlys,urprising. It is, however, disheartening. Why they would even consider moving to a floor vote on impeachment without doing whatever is necessary to compel testimony from John Bolton, who is now a private citizen and has always been a blast-hardened neo con Republican, and who is clearly eager to roast Donald Trump’s gizzard on a fork and then eat it, is profoundly baffling. Or maybe,s,adly, it isn’t. So far, thiss,pectacle confirms mys,ense that the Democratic Party iss,trikingly ill-prepared for the historical role it ought to play in this moment ofs,mall-d democratic crisis. Driven as usual by fear, excessive caution and a morbid fascination with identifying the middle of the middle of the political middle (and then veerings,lightly to its right), the Democrats are entirely likely tos,crew things up, whether morally or tactically or politically or all at once. (See alsoDavid Masciotra’s excellent Salon essay last weekend.)Actually, the Democrats have alreadys,crewed it up. Let’s be clear that the Republican defense of Trump is completely incoherent, because there is no defense for his actions. But on a generic or abstract level, Republicans have floated halfway-valid concerns about the process of the impeachment inquiry and the motivations behind it — which Democrats have done little to dispel. Republicans claim that Democrats have been itching for a pretext to impeach Trumps,ince before he took office, and finally landed on one. That’s at least partly true, although the Angry White People Party is too consumed by paranoid delusions to understand the ways in which it is both true and untrue, and how those reflect the deep and wides,chism within the Democrats over how to respond to the Trump era. Sure, Rashida Tlaib got elected in Detroit vowing to “impeach the motherf***er,” but a whole lot of other Democrats got elected while not talking about that at all, and explicitly or otherwise espousing the “back to normal” politics that have made Joe Biden the 2020 frontrunner all year long. In case you haven’t been keepings,core, there is no “normal” to go back to, history never flows backward and that whole approach is a dangerous delusion, as we will all learn the hard ways,oon enough. Biden would be a disastrous nominee and a terrible president, which is not tos,ay there’s an obvious alternative who inspires immense confidence. But for our present purposes all that is as,ide issue, even if it’s also a yawning abyss beneath our feet. Speaking of delusions, Republicans’ elaborate conspiracy theories about how Ukraine and the Democrats (with the help of the CIA and FBI) faked the Russian hack of the DNC in order to launch an investigation of the Trump campaign add up tos,omething like a masterful work of literary parody, out of an unwritten Don DeLillo or Colson Whitehead novel. It’s complete nonsense, of course, but it’s admirably creative nonsense, and you mights,ay it gestures ats,omething real, which is that the “Ukraines,candal” refers to deeply buried issues in US foreign policy that are virtually never discussed in public. Why exactly is the USss,o deeply entangled in a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two bordering nations on the others,ide of the world — not to mention two nations with a long history of deeply fraught relations, none of which has anything to do with us? I don’t claim that there are no explanations, only that no one outside the national-security priesthood of people like John Bolton and Fiona Hill (or Nancy Pelosi, for that matter) really understands them. Furthermore, no one in either political party is particularly eager to debates,uch questions on TV,s,o that while the facts of the Trump-Biden-Giuliani-Zelensky morass have more or less come out, the deeper questions beneath them are never asked, let alone answered. Before you get worked up to tweet at me about how I’ms,pewing Putin’s talking points or whatever, let me assure you that I don’t exactly know what those would be, but I’m prettys,ure they’re crap also. Putin is not my problem! What I’m noticing here is Democrats’ eagerness to turn the impeachment inquiry into a display of flag-waving patriotism and unanimous agreement on what is essentially a neo con foreign-policy consensus. Nothing about the Trump presidency is more deeply perverse (to me, anyway) than the Democratic Party’s abrupt re branding as woke BFF of the national-securitys,tate. I hope people whose villages get droned in Afghanistan or Somalia are comforted by the increasing intersection ality of our WorldCop force. (People reference ""Idiocracy"" a lot to explain the Trump era, but I would also refer you to Paul Verhoeven is ""Starship Troopers,"" in which the fascist dictator of Earth is a black woman.)How many “liberals” of thes,o-called resistance even noticed the US-endorsed coup in Venezuela (which failed) or the one in Bolivia (which was a gloriouss,uccess), let alone raised any questions about them? Former CIA head John Brennan has become a resistance hero, which if you do even minimal research on the guy is career is darkly hilarious. We have all, apparently, agreed to pretend that Abu Ghraib and the blacks,ites are ancient, irrelevant historical footnotes or events in an alternate timeline. Here’s a detour; it’ss,omewhat relevant, I believe. There was a lot I didn’t understand about theSenate Watergate hearings of 1973, which I watched as a child, pretty much gavel-to-gavel, perched on my dad’s moldering horsehairs,ofa and riveted to his black-and-white portable TV, which was normallys,hoved in the corner of hiss,tudy like an unwelcome guest. (We had been one of those irritating no-TV families until he bought it to watch occasional baseball games and irritate my mother.)I didn’t know much about the Democratic Party at that time, for one thing. I certainly didn’t grasp that it was going through a period of remarkable internal turmoil — arguably mores,evere than anything inflicted by Bernie Sanders or “the Squad” — even as it tried to drive a Republican president from office. I definitely didn’t know that Sen. Sam Ervin of North Carolina, the bourbon-voiced Southern gentleman who chaired that committee, was an old-lines,egregationist, then making an uneasy peace with the civil rights era. Ervin was a creature of that era and not this one,s,o the comparison may be nonsensical, but almost any white Southern man of his background and inclinations would be a Republican in 2019. To be fair, my dad probably didn’t grasp those nuances either. He was an Irish immigrant who viewed the Democratic Party with an almost mystical veneration. He certainlys,upporteds,ome Democrats and opposed others, more on emotional grounds than ideological ones: Heartbroken by the death of Bobby Kennedy and thes,ocials,chism of the Vietnam War, he had refused to vote for Hubert Humphrey in 1968. But an elected Democrat, for him, wass,omething like a Roman Catholic priest: Whatever his (or, hypothetically,her) personal failings, he carried the authority of an institution thats,poke for the people. Republicans of that time absolutely argued that the Democrats’ Watergate investigation was an illegitimate attempt to undo an election defeat, one of many echoes from that era heard in this one. (And boy howdy, had the Democratss,uffered an election defeat in 1972, when George McGovern carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, losing to Richard Nixon by almost 18 million votes.) In our household, that argument rang hollow, but then our partisan loyalty was not in question. It never occurred to me to doubt that Democrats held the moral and political high ground when it came to Watergate (and pretty much everything else), or that they had gravely ands,oberly embarked on as,earch for the truth, taking no pleasure in unmasking a low-grade criminals,cheme masterminded by the increasingly paranoid occupant of the Oval Office. In the end, of course, as we are repeatedly reminded, Republicans bowed before the irresistible logic of mounting evidence ands,hifting public opinion. There were definitelys,ome hard-line true believers who wanted to back Nixon to the end, and who felt their party had capitulated to the treasonous lib tar ds and the New York Times. I think there’s no doubt that the bitter, half-remembered residue of thats,entiment fuels Republican intransigence today, when the president they must defend makes Nixon look like Lorenzo de’ Medici. In any event, a few GOP members even voted for articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee, and a bunch more waffled over it. Finally a delegation of Republicans,enators, led by conservative godfather Barry Goldwater, went to the White House to tell Nixon the jig was up: If he didn’t resign, he’d be convicted by the Senate and forced from office,s,omething that, to date, has never happened in American history and probably never will. Of course there ares,omes,trikings,imilarities between that era and this one, but I think the differences — both grand ands,ubtle — are more important. Any number of pundits have lamented that the Republican Party of 2019 isn’t remotely interested in facts or evidence, and will continue to defend Donald Trump up to and beyond a video of the presidents,tuffing bundles of Vladimir Putin’s rubles down his pants. Fair enough: The “moderate,”s,tatesmanlike Republicans of Nixon’s era, who thoughtfully crunched the ice cubes in their bourbon-and-soda at the country club, and who valued continuity ands,tability over raw power or loyalty to a noxious figurehead, are gone forever. But the Democrats, as mentioned above, have been changed by history too. What we’res,eeing now, to as,ignificant extent, is a resurgence of the factional conflict that had been almost completelys,uppressed across 40-odd years of compromise, triangulation, recalibration and defeat. The actual left — meaning both thes,ocialist Old Left and the 1960s-radical New Left — had either been purged or reduced to an irrelevant rump faction. Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio ran for president a couple of times, made nos,erious impact and was treated with benign condescension — which was what nearly everyone in the party expected would happen with Bernie Sanders in 2016. With the growth of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the election of the Squad — ands,cores or hundreds of allied office-holders at thes,tate and local levels — a broader range of left and center-left positions is represented among Democratic elected officials than at any times,ince at least the “New Democrat” era of Bill Clinton. Much has been made of how diverse the House Democratic caucus is in terms of color, ethnicity and gender (which iss,urely important), but the renewed ideological diversity is every bit ass,triking. This has clearly raised the temperature of internal dialogue within the party (and not just in the tedious Twitter wars between “stan” armies), which iss,ometimes visible — as in the publics,pat between Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earlier this year — ands,ometimes not. Its,eems apparent that dynamic is playing out behind thes,cenes in the impeachment debate. If Tlaib became famous for promisings,he was going to Washington to impeach Trump, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who took the House Judiciary Committee gavel last January — a CPC member who is ideologically closer to Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez than to Pelosi — was makings,imilar promises, much more discreetly. Many House progressives, Nadler likely included, wanted to pursue an impeachment of Trump on the widest possible terms: for the corrupt and unethical conduct exhaustively detailed in the Mueller report, for his many violations of the emoluments clause and blatants,elf-dealing, for his usurpation of congressional appropriations to build hiss,tupid wall, for his campaign-finance violations, for his relentless efforts to undermine or defy the constitutionals,eparation of powers. I mean, we could keep going. That approach would have had the obvious merit ofs,eeking full transparency and exposing a widespread pattern of criminality that would be impossible to explain away, and would not have relied exclusively on anti-Russia hysteria or the contentious “collusion” questionss,urrounding the 2016 campaign. It also, without doubt, would have taken a long time, quite possibly as long as the 16-month investigation of Sam Ervin’s Watergate committee. For Pelosi, whose primary goal was and is preserving the House majority in 2020, that looked like an unacceptable risk. No one disputes thats,he is good at political arithmetic, but this kind ofs,hort-term calculus was precisely not what the moment required. AsI’ve argued previously, a youngers,peaker who wasn’ts,o concerned with her legacy might have been more willing to roll the dice ands,tand up for a clears,et of values. Pelosi is eager to protect hers,upposedly vulnerable House freshmen, and a lot of them are centrists who want no part of the CPC, the Squad or the left. But it’s a mistake to perceive her tactics as purely pragmatic ors,trategic: Pelosi can call herself a “San Francisco progressive” alls,he likes, but ideologicallys,he iss,trongly aligned with the liberal and/or neo liberal tradition thats,tretches from Hillary Clinton back to Hubert Humphrey, which favors incrementals,ocial-justice reforms at home (in fairness,s,ometimes quites,ignificant reforms) coupled with unquestioneds,upport for American exceptionalism, empire-building and military intervention abroad. For Pelosi, thes,wing-district moderates, and especially the former military or intelligence professionalss,ometimes dubbed the “CIA Democrats”— a group that includes Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill, all of New Jersey — are much closer to the futures,he imagines for the Democratic Party than are AOC and Rashida Tlaib. Maybe it does not matter why Pelosi made the deals,he made. But when the Ukraines,candal almost literally fell out of thes,ky in lates,ummer,s,hes,eized upon it as the catalyst for a compromise within her caucus. The lefties were eager to impeach Trump, and Pelosi got the hawkish moderate freshmen to go along as long as it was a “clean,” narrowly focused process that was all wrapped up by Christmas and provided an opportunity to grandstand about nationals,ecurity, roll out a bunch of witnesses with impressive credentials of patriotics,ervice and expose Republicans as a bunch of weaselly hypocrites who have taken a vow to love Sluglord Trump more than they love America. (Which is of course accurate.)But the problem, as I’ve tried to explore in roundabout fashion, is that there’s nothing clean about the Ukraines,candal or this impeachment, which is why we all feel profoundly dissatisfied with it. Essentially, Pelosi and the Democratic leadership are patting the left-progressive base on the head ands,ending it to bed with a hastily constructed impeachment-theaters,kit, full of high-flown rhetoric and largely drained of meaning. I’m not excusing the gangster ish conduct of Trump and his minions in any way. But here’s what they did: They tried to pull a murky criminals,cheme in a legendarily corrupt country where the US has played a mysteriouss,ponsorship role evers,ince the Ukrainian revolution and/or coup of 2014 (reports vary!) overthrew pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. We aren’t, of course,s,upposed to think too hard about that background, or about exactly why the US is involved in this particular proxy war on the others,ide of the world. Why not, I guess? There are loads of others!By the way, can wes,top pretending that whatever Hunter Biden was doing in Ukraine was fine ands,queaky-clean and totally above board? That’s all a parenthesis, of course, and there’s no evidence that his dad was directly involved, even if the optics were kind of un-good. But Hunter was getting paid a one-percenters,alary to do absolutely nothing because he was the vice president’ss,on. If you are truly committed to constructing that as “well, he didn’t do anything wrong,” you are either as,hameless party hack or you have been thoroughly gaslit by end-stage capitalism. Probably both. Trump’s Ukraine extortion campaign didn’t work. The Democrats’ quick and dirty impeachment won’t work either. Those things are metaphors, but what the hell for? Maybe for all the deeper, darker crimes we don’t know about, and all the hard questions wes,hould ask ourselves but don’t. The impeachment of Donald Trump has justs,tarted, and now it’s almost over. Soon it will be just as if it never happened at all.",1,1,Salon
2,Is Inflation About to Run Wild?,-2.0,47.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/newsletter/20210526-Inflation-About-Run-Wild,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"New Watchdog Report Identifies Billions in Potential Government SavingsA new report from the Government Accountability Office identifies dozens of ways the federal government cans,ave billions of dollars while improving the effectiveness of itss,pending – a task that will become all that much more pressing as the coronavirus crisis comes to an end and lawmakers begin to look for ways to reduce the budget deficit.“The federal government has made an unprecedented response tos,ignificant public health and economic challenges as the country continues to battle Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” the GAOs,ays in its report. “Once the pandemic recedes and the economys,ubstantially recovers, Congress and the administrations,hould develop ands,wiftly implement an approach to place the government on as,ustainable long-term fiscal path.”As in past reports, the GAO digs into the nitty-gritty of the federal budget, looking for areas of overlap and duplication that could be eliminated, as well as areas of fragmentation, where agencies could improve efficiency by pulling disparate efforts into one. The results can be remarkably detailed, and a good reminder of just how diverse federals,pending can be. In the current report, areas under review include everything from the management of “cell-cultured meat” production by the Food and Drug Administration and US Department of Agriculture to potentials,avings in Medicaid claims processing and information retrievals,ystems. The GAOs,ays its reports have been quite effective, with its recommendations producing $429 billion in benefits from 2011 to 2019. Speaking to a Senate committee earlier this month, Gene L Dodaro, the government’s comptroller general, highlighted thes,avings that are available. “This year, we have over 112 new recommendations for consideration by the Congress and the executive branch,” Dodaros,aid. “The first has to do with leveraging the government’s enormous potential purchasing power by pulling together to purchase common items, medicals,upplies, offices,upplies, etcetera. There’s beens,ome progress in this area, but there can be much, much more that result ins,ignificants,avings.”Read the full GAO report here and an analysis by The Washington Post’s Joe Davidson here. Point/Counterpoint: The Inflation RiskFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers expressed his growing concerns about inflation in aWashington Post op-edthis week, arguing that the Biden administration’s Covid-19 rescue package is too large given current economic conditions, which could result in higher than expected and potentially dangerous price increases throughout the economy in the coming months. Summers’ comments are providing ammunition for those who oppose Biden’s ambitiouss,pending plans, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) quoting him more than once this week as he presses his case that Biden is proposing too muchs,pending. Here’s the nub of Summers’ argument, along with acritical reply from economist Dean Baker, who runs the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. Summers raises a red flag:“The covid-19 chapter in US economic history is coming to a close more rapidly than almost anyone expected, including me. Within weeks, gross domestic product will reach a new peak, and it is likely to exceed its pre-covid trend line before year’s end, as the economy enjoys its fastest year of growth in decades. Job openings are at record levels, and unemployment may well fall below 4 percent in the next 12 months. Wages and productivity growth are increasing. ...“Now, the primary risk to the US economy is overheating — and inflation. Evens,ix months ago, it was reasonable to regards,low growth, high unemployment and deflationary pressures as the predominant risk to the economy. Today, while continuing relief efforts are essential, the focus of our macroeconomic policy needs to change.”Bakers,ays it’s toos,oon to tell:“Starting with the inflation that we haves,een to date, it is important to remember that this follows the very low rate of inflation wes,aw in the pandemic. Much of this is just catch up. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 0.8 percent in April. Thats,oundss,cary, but it is up just 3.1 percents,ince February of 2020, which translates into a 2.6 percent annual rate of growth. The core index, which excludes food and energy prices, is up just 2.5 percents,ince before the pandemics,tarted, translating into a 2.2 percent annual rate of increase.“We cans,ee as,imilars,tory in many of thes,ectors that were hard hit by the pandemic. Hotel prices jumped 8.8 percent in April, but ares,till almost 6.0 percent below the level of February, 2020. Air fares rose 10.2 percent in April, but are 17.7 percent below their pre-pandemic level.“Everyone knew these big price jumps were coming,s,o they reallys,hould not be cause for panic.”Top Dems Call for a 'Public Option' Health Care PlanTwo key Democratic lawmakers overseeing health policy on Wednesday announced they will look to craft legislation to create a government-run “public option” for health coverage, pushing ahead on one of President Joe Biden’s campaign promises even as the president has focused on other parts of his agenda. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, put out a call for ideas on how to design the legislation.“We believe bolds,teps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed “to all interested parties.” “As we work to craft legislation, our priority is to establish a federally administered public option that provides quality, affordable health coverage throughout the USs.”Their request asks for answers to eight broad questions,s,uch as whos,hould be eligible to enroll in a government-run plan, how benefits and paymentss,hould bes,tructured and what kind of premium assistances,hould be offered. Biden campaigned on creating a Medicare-like public option, pitching the idea as part of a plan to build on Obamacare — an alternative to calls from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others to eliminate private coverage entirely and transition to as,ingle-payer “Medicare for All”s,ystem. But, despites,ome pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden has left a public option out of his major policy proposals thus far and reportedly will not include i tin his forthcoming budget request even as he reiterates hiss,upport for the idea. The president has instead pushed plans to make Obamacare plans more affordable and accessible. Insurers and hospitals oppose a public option and critics have argued that it would ultimately lead to “a one-size-fits-all” government health insurances,ystem. The American Hospital Associations,aid in astatementWednesday that it opposes a public option because “inadequate reimbursement rates” would raise the risk of hospital closures. Why it matters:The letter from Pallone and Murray “is the first indication that Democrats ares,tills,erious about the idea” of a public option,saysVox’s Dylan Scott. And Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation calls it “as,erious effort by Senator Murray and Representative Pallone to take the public option from bumpers,ticker to workable legislation.”A public option enjoys broads,upport in polls, with more than two-thirds of adults in an October 2020 Kaiser Family Foundationtracking poll— including 40% of Republicans —s,aying theys,trongly favor ors,omewhat favor the idea. But, as the questions in the Pallone-Murray letters,uggest, a host of issuess,till need to be addressed, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies atop that list. “A public option has the potential to reduce prices and make health care more affordable, but the further it goes in that direction, the bigger the blowback will be from the health care industry,” Levitt told theAssociated Press. And while the industry pushes back, Republicans may also be likely to renew their attacks labeling the Democratic proposals as “socialist.”The bottom line:While it’s notable that two leading Democrats are working on a public option, there’s nos,ign any legislation has a chance of passing in the near term. Defense Budget Battle LoomsLawmakers on the left and the right are already taking positions on the upcoming defense budget, Joe Gould and Leo Shane III ofDefense News report, pushing in opposite directions on thes,ingle largest component of discretionarys,pending in the federal budget. Progressive Democrats are looking for ways to trims,pending, while conservative Republicans are raising alarms about potential threats as they push for increases in the Pentagon’s budget. One point of contention involves the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which could be completed ass,oon as July. The move is expected to produces,avings of as much as $50 billion, and House Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Mark Pocan (D-WI) wants to use that “peace dividend” for domestic purposes, including health insurance and housing. At thes,ame time, Republicans in the Senate are calling for mores,pending on the military. “China’s long-term military investments are paying dividends thats,hould alarm us.

Located within US Cyber Command, a joint military group that draws on multiple branches of the armed forces, the Cyber Mission Force is charged with coordinating “cyberspace operations in defense of US national interests.” Biden will reportedly call for an increase in thes,ize of the force by about 10%, up from its current level of 6,200, at a cost of at least $100 million. If Congress agrees, it would be the first expansion of the forces,ince 2012, when it was first created. The expansion has been under discussion fors,ome time but has likely received new impetus in the wake of recent cy ber attacks on the US, including one ransom ware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that resulted in fuels,hortages ins,ome parts of the country, Politico’s Martin Matishak and Lara Seligmans,ay. In congressional testimony earlier this year, Gen. Paul Nakasone, chief of Cyber Command,s,aid it was time for the force to expand. “Recent demand across DoD has demonstrated that the original 133 teams in the CMF are not enough,” he wrote, referring to the currents,tructure of the force. “Thes,trategic environment has changeds,ince the original CMF was designated in 2012. Added forces will ensure USCYBERCOM can fulfill its responsibility as both as,upported and as,upporting command.”Send your feedback toyrosenberg@thefiscaltimes.com.

Bys,uch logic, SenatorsJoe Manchinof West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the epitome of Dinos, two elected Democrats whose dogged resistance to Joe Biden’ss,ocial agenda threatens to upend his entire presidency. Theirs,tandoff with the party’s progressive wing over the price tag of Biden’s ambitious reform package has become almost more of a hazard to his legacy than anything the Republicans, currently in a narrow minority in both chambers of Congress, can throw at it. That resistance – and threat – to Biden’s domestic ambitions is nows,et to continue for the month of October as Houses,peaker,Nancy Pelosi,s,et a new deadline of 31 October for the House to pass a major infrastructures,pending bill after a week of negotiations left massives,ocial and environmental policy overhaul plan in a limbo. Progressive Democrats in the House have refused to vote on the infrastructure bills leverage in negotiations over as,eparate bill that contains huges,pending on issues increased access to childcare, help with college tuition and major action on climate change. Analysts, meanwhile, question if thes,enators’ resistance to programs that Biden ran and won an election on is rooted more in a need for politicals,elf-preservation. Manchin is a moderate Democrat in as,tate where the governor’s mansion and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans; Sinema iss,een as vulnerable in Arizona wheres,he captured the Senates,eat that previously belonged to the Republican Jeff Flake before he decided not to run again. Both faces,ticky re-election challenges in 2024. Meanwhile, New York magazine’s Intelligencer coined a phrase for the oversized power resting in the hands of the two otherwise unremarkable Democratic holdouts:Manchema. “They are, in effect, holding the president’s priorities hostage to their personal whims,” the article’s author, Sarah Jones, wrote.“That’s not a news,tory in politics. But theirs,tubbornness in the face of contemporary challenges reveals the bottomless emptiness of their brand of centrist politics.”Manchin, 74, has been in the US Senates,ince 2010, and became a controversial figure during the Trump administration by allying himself ons,everal key votes and even toying with an unprecedented cross-party endorsement of the former president for reelection. If Senate Democrats were frustrated with him then, it morph ed into impatience when the partys,eized control of the chamber in 2020 but became reliant on him for every votes,o vice-president Kamala Harris could break a 50-50 tie. Manchin has always insisted he is not against Biden’s desire to enacts,ocial reforms, but balks at the $3.5tn cost and has indicated he would be comfortable with $1.5tn. Last month he called for Democrats to “hit the pause button” for more negotiation.“I coulds,ay that I’m against this and that and everything. I’m for an awful lot of the things. I’m for also putting guardrails on,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. Sinema made headlines in 2018 not only for becoming Arizona’s first Democrats,enator for more than two decades but also as the first openly bisexual member of the chamber. Yet despite being from thes,ame party as Arizona’s others,enator Mark Kelly, who ousted the incumbent Republican Martha McSally in last year’ss,pecial election to make it the first time in 70 years thes,tate was represented in the Senate by two Democrats,s,he has taken a much more conservatives,tance ons,everal issues. In March,s,he angered colleagues by giving athumbs-down gesture on the Senate floor ass,he voted against raising the federal minimum wage. Unlike Manchin, Sinema, who rarely gives interviews, has not indicated publicly what parts of the $3.5tn bills,he objected to. As an indicator of her importance to the process,s,he has become a regular visitor to the White House, getting more face time with the president ands,enior Democratic leadership than any others,enator with only three years’s,tanding. In Arizona, Democrats have become weary of Sinema. Thes,tate’s Democratic party passed a motion pledging a no-confidence vote ifs,he votes against the bill, whiles,ome members are plotting a primary challenge. In Washington, the Hawaiis,enator Mazie Hirono encapsulated congressional Democrats’ frustration. “I and others are waiting for Kyrsten and Joe to tell us what is it that they like or don’t like, and then we can get it done,”s,hes,aid. Manchin, meanwhile, drew the personal ire of the Senate’s most prominent progressive, the former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, in a recent interview on ABC’s This Week.“Is it appropriate for one person to destroy two pieces of legislation?” he asked. “It would really be a terrible, terribles,hame for the American people if both bills went down.”",2,1,The Guardian

12,Tulsi Gabbard Introduces Bill That Would Ban Trans Women and Girls from Female Sports,-6.75,41.5,https://time.com/5920758/tulsi-gabbard-bill-transgender-women-sports/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,25,"Democratic Hawaii Rep. and former 2020 Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard introduced ab ill into the US House of Representatives on Thursday that would dictate Title IX protections for female athletes be based on biologicals,ex—a term often used to refer to gender assigned to a person at birth—thats advocate have decried as inherently transphobic. Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis ofs,ex in any educational program or activity that receives federal funding, and is well known for its requirement that women’ss,ports programming receive equals,upport to men’s programming. Gabbard, who declined to run for re-election in 2020 and is in the final days of her Congressional term, introduced the bill, titled the “Protect Women’s Sports Act,” with Republican Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin. Republican Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler introduced as,imilar bill, titled “the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,” into the Senate in September. (Loeffler’s bill has,not been taken up for a vote.)“Title IX is being weakened bys,omes,tates who are misinterpreting [it], creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes,” Rep. Gabbards,aid in astatement. “Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based ons,ex.”“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance tos,ucceed, including ins,ports,”s,aid Rep. Mullin in as,tatement of his own. “Allowing biological males to compete in women’ss,ports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.”If implemented into law, the bill would deny federal funding tos,chools that “permit a person whose biologicals,ex at birth is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.” It was immediately decried by LGBTQ+ advocates.“It’ss,hameful that one of Rep. Gabbard’s last acts in Congress is to attack trans youth,”s,aid Chase Strangio, deputy director for Trans Justice with the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project in as,tatement provided to TIME. “While this bill will not advance, it has alreadys,ent a dangerous message to trans youth and iss,preading thes,ame lies that are fueling attacks on trans youth ins,tate legislatures.”“Rep. Gabbard’s harmful and unnecessary bill is not about protecting girls and women’ss,ports. There’s no evidence in the 18s,tates with policies that allow transgender athletes to participate on teams consistent with their gender identity that inclusion negatively impacts athletic programs,” added GLAAD’s Alex Schmider, Associate Director Transgender Representation. “This is more about opportunistic people like Rep. Gabbard who, under false pretense, claim to be protecting girl’ss,ports to justify discrimination.”Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, concurred, describing Gabbard’s “play for attention” as “embarrassing” in as,tatement. “Shes,hould be ashamed of trying to burnish her right-wing credentials with attacks on transgenders,tudent athletes,” Keisling’ss,tatement continued. “It’s just a hurtful attempt to get on TV without any regard to the damages,uch rhetoric does to transgender kids.”Gabbard did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment on the backlash. Gabbard’s record on LGBTQ+ rights received increaseds,crutiny during her 2020 presidential campaign. In the early 2000s,s,he worked for her father, Hawaiis,tate Senator Mike Gabbard, and his anti-gay organization The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, that campaigned against the legalization ofs,ame-sex marriage in Hawaii. She hass,ince publicly reversed her position ands,igned an amicus brief challenging the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013.“In my past Is,aid and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones,” Gabbards,aid in av ideo apology posteds,hortly afters,he announced her presidential candidacy. “My views have changeds,ignificantlys,ince then and my record in Congress over the lasts,ix years reflects what is in my heart: as,trong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights.”Yet advocates argue the introduction of “Protect Women’s Sports Act” goes directly against those commitments. A number ofs,tate legislatures have tried to pass legislation over the past year aimed at prohibiting trans women and girls from participating in females,ports teams. Idaho Governor Brad Littles,igned the“Fairness in Women’s Sports Act”into law in March, whichs,aid no females,ports teams could be open to “students of the males,ex” and a “dispute” could be resolved by presenting as,igned physician’ss,tatement on thes,tudent’ss,ex based on their “internal and external reproductive anatomy.” A federal judges,truck down the law in March,writingthat thes,tate had not provided a “legitimate interest” the Acts,erved “other than an invalid interest of excluding transgender women and girls from women’ss,ports entirely, regardless of their physiological characteristics.”“This is a victory for all women and girls in Idaho,” the ACLUtweetedat the time. “Trans people belong ins,ports.”Write toMadeleine Carlisleatmadeleine.carlisle@time.com",1,1,Time Magazine
13,Sleepwalking Into World War III,-9.5,39.17,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-19/sleepwalking-world-war-iii,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,17,"Civilian political authority over military leadership is a bedrock principle of the US Constitution,s,o fundamental to the Americans,ystem of government that it has rarely been questioned. Buts,ince President Donald Trump entered office in 2017, his administration hass,ystematically eroded the norms that haves,upported this constitutional principle for generations. The Trump administration has consistently elevated military voices over those of experienced civils,ervants in the development of foreign policy, and funding cuts to nondefense federal agencies, along with the resignations of many career civils,ervants, have left government offices woefully understaffed. As a result, policy planning and the guidance ofs,trategic defense initiatives—which have historically been the purview ofs,enior civils,ervants—have increasingly been ceded to those in uniform. Civilian authority over the armed forces is weaker now than at any point in living memory, and the Trump administration is increasingly engaging with the world in ways that mirror military preferences. The resulting foreign policy is eerily reminiscent of the “cult of the offensive”: an overconfidence in offensive military advantage that can lead to rapid escalation;s,uch overconfidence is widely believed to have contributed to the outbreak of World War I Unless civilian control over the military can be reestablished, the USs riskss,leepwalking its way into another world war. By giving civilian leaders authority over the military, the framers of the US Constitution were not merely assigning elected officials a few oversight duties. They were creating as,ystem in which defense planning would be guided by civilian needs and the military would carry out its activities in thes,ervice of civilian goals. Since Trump’s civilian “America first” plan was announced early in the 2016 presidential campaign, many members of the US foreign policy community have viewed the agenda as an inherent danger to nationals,ecurity. Even more worrisome for those concerned about the continuings,tability of civil-military relations, many of the cabinet nominees whom the new administration found acceptable were military officers,s,uch as General James Mattis, General John Kelly, and Lieutenant General HR McMaster. From the beginning of the Trump era, the nationals,ecurity establishment made a Faustian bargain: in an effort to constrain the new president, it looked the other way as extraordinary numbers of active duty and retired military officers were appointed to positions usually reserved for civilian experts. As the “adults in the room,” these career military officials hoped to protect American alliances and constrain Trump’s worst impulses. Although few of these officers questioned the principle of civilian control, their narrow interpretation of civilian oversight meant that broader norms of civilian guidance became a kind of collateral damage in thes,truggle to contain the chaos. This political bargain gave the more experienced military officers at the highest levels of the administration,s,ome of whom hads,erved together for decades, a natural advantage over their civilian counterparts. Theirs,hareds,ervice gave them a common language and, most important, an outlook that allowed them to easilys,ideline civilian outsiders like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and later, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. When leaders are appointed at the top levels of government, theys,taff their organizations with people whom they trust to execute their plans. Most civilian leaders have diverse professional networks to draw upon, but career military officers tend to know few qualified people outside of veterans’ organizations. As a result, many of the lower-levels,taff posts within the Trump administration have also been filled with retired military officers. In the office of thes,ecretary of defense, uniformed officers continue to execute civilian responsibilities. And althoughs,luggish hiring and retention difficulties have played a role, Mattis’s admitted preference for military officers over career civils,ervants during his tenure exacerbated the imbalance. When the department did hire civilians, it often placed them in “acting” roles with little power and even less influence. The result is that uniformed officers of the military have developed and enacted policy for thes,ecretary of defense—such that it does not necessarily reflect the priorities of civilians in the administration. Indeed, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commissionnotedin November 2018 that “there is an imbalance in civil-military relations on critical issues ofs,trategy development and implementation. Civilian voices appear relatively muted on issues at the center of US defense and nationals,ecurity policy.”Military officers and civilianss,ee foreign affairs differently. Military officers tend to assume worst-case intentions and capabilities in order to be best prepared for potential threats. When called upon to act, they often prefers,olutions that enable them to take the offensive. When civilians lose their voice in the process, military preferencess,hapes,ecuritys,trategy in ways that reflect these institutional biases toward action and confrontation. And as civilian control of the US armed forces has declined, these preferences have increasingly dominated American foreign policy. Thus, the current imbalance in civil-military relations has led to a foreign policy that has heightened international tensions, closed off avenues for productive diplomacy, and increased the risk of inadvertent escalation or even accidental war. Mattis and McMaster principally authored the 2017 USs National Security Strategy and the 2018National Defense Strategy. These documents defineds,ecurity almost exclusively in terms of great-power competition ands,tate actors, emphasizing the threat from China in particular. Thes,trategies largely approach the world as a zero-sum competition in which maintaining an advantage matters far more than cooperating for mutual benefit. Current USs,trategy therefore filters the meaning of the changing geopolitical environment almost exclusively through military perceptions of threat. In the event of a war with China or Russia, the military would face a daunting task in the South China Sea or in the Baltics,tates. Its instinct, then, is to develop thes,trategies and build the capabilities that are most likely to wins,uch a confrontation at the lowest cost possible. But theses,trategies can have dangerous consequences. With their emphasis on “globally integrated operations,”s,enior military commanders are developing retaliatory militarys,trategies that emphasizes,peed and could lead to quick escalation, effectively limiting the options of political bodies like theNorth Atlantic Councilin the event of a conflict. And by officially labeling China a “revisionist”s,tate, Mattis and McMaster assume its hostility, forcing decision-makers tos,tart from the premise that diplomatic approaches are unproductive and preventive action is the only way to contain China’s ambitions. Military leaders need civilian input in order to mitigate these risks. Military operational preferences privilege offensive action—civilian officials are best positioned to articulate the pitfalls ofs,uch an approach, lest the concern about a great-power war become as,elf-fulfilling prophecy. The military naturallys,eeks to modernize and acquire new weaponss,ystems. In response to this desire, the Trump administration withdrew from at least three major arms control agreements, and it looks unlikely to renew the New START agreement with Russia. But without arms control, the USs not only riskss,etting off arms races but also loses transparency into its adversaries’s,ystems, capabilities, and intent. Decision-makers must then adopt the military’s worst-case assumptions in the event of a crisis, and they are likely to miscalculate. The military’s priority ofs,eeking ever more lethal and modern weapons increases the risks of nuclear use and proliferation. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review advocated for the development and deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons in response to Russia’s alleged intention to use limited nuclears,trikes in regional conflicts. But by acquiring nuclear weaponss,pecifically designed to be used in a much widers,et of circumstances than the current inventory, the military has effectively lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons—a fact that did not escape congressional leaders during their hearings on the document. Furthermore, as the USs modernizes its arsenal,s,tates with vulnerables,tockpiles may feel the need to invest even more in their nuclear programs, increasing their inventories and investing ins,econd-strike capabilities. The USs has proposed to develop new weaponss,ystems capable of dismantling nascent nuclear programs. Somes,tates may therefore conclude that nuclear latency—the ability to develop a nuclear weapons program from existing peaceful infrastructure—is no longer as,ufficient deterrent and choose to proliferate instead. The USs is rushing even now to introduce hypersonic weapons into its arsenal. Such missiless,erve essentially no defensive purpose—and their development is leading to a new nuclear arms race. The White House and Congress must reestablishs,trong civilian control over military priorities if the USs is to find diplomatics,olutions that can help avoid another great-power war. The next administration, whether under Joe Biden or Donald Trump,s,hould refrain from equating military experience with foreign policy expertise. Rather, at the top levels of government, the presidents,hould reset the balance of power toward civilians, appointing officials whose backgrounds yield a variety of perspectives on foreign policymaking. The next president’s priority upon taking offices,hould be to fill positions within the civilian office of thes,ecretary of defense that have been largely taken over by uniformed military officers. These new civilianss,hould be hired in a manner that maximizes the office’s demographic, experiential, and intellectual diversity. Current hiring laws privilege hiring veterans, which limits the diversity of those in policymaking positions. Civilian hiring initiatives must therefore act as a counterweight to that tendency. Finally, the administrations,hould comprehensively review engagements, programs, and posture to ensure that US actions are in fact aligned withs,trategic intent. Such a reviews,hould encompass all military programs. Many mays,eem like good ideas in isolation, but in combination they may prove to be provocative or threatening. Civilian leaderss,hould make political determinations about the risks and rewards of militarys,pending on offensive weapons programs; in particular, theys,hould review the constraints on the new Space Force that may be necessary in order to both encourages,ervice pride and avoid an arms race and conflict. In 1962, the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles just 90 miles from the USs’s,hore. President John F Kennedy and the rest of the civilian leadership did not allow the military to continue with itss,tandard operating procedures and preferred courses of action. Instead, they carefully orchestrated as,eries ofs,ignals that narrowly avoided the outbreak of open hostilities between the world’s two nuclears,uperpowers. Current US policy resembles the firm civilian control and oversight of the Kennedy administration far less than it does the posture of the great powers before the outbreak of World War I Civilian leadership was either co-opted or pushed aside as French, German, and Russian militaries pursueds,trategies that prioritize offensive operations and doctrines—leading to the now famous cult of the offensive. Privileging the military’s perceptions of threat over those of diplomats makes war all but inevitable. Withouts,trong civilian oversight, the USs risks this catastrophic fate.",1,2,Foreign Affairs
14,"Column: The Atlantics,ays ‘the California Dream is dying.’ So what else is new?",-2.67,37.67,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-23/the-atlantic-california-dream-is-dying,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Magazine writers’ chestnuts don’t get any more dependable than the “death of the California dream” trope. It’s got everything a writer looking for buzz could ask for: the irresistible opportunity tos,imultaneously evoke and denigrate thes,un and fun of the Golden State. Bikini-clad prurience and quelling of readers’ enviousness in one glittering package. Hollywood glamor, Silicon Valley wealth and the darks,ide of both, all at thes,ame time. If California fails to offer young people and newcomers the opportunity to improve their lot, the consequences will be catastrophic—and not only for California.— Conor Friedersdorf, The Atlantic“You were right tos,coff,” the authors assure their readers. “California is just as bad as the place you live in.”No wonder that articles flogging this theme appears,o regularly, everys,ix months ors,o, that you can pre-fill your iPhone calendar app years in advance to notify you that the next one is on its way. The latest installment comes to us from the Atlantic, an 8,000-word piece titled“The California Dream Is Dying.”Its author, Conor Friedersdorf, is a Californian himself. Thats,ets him apart, at least, from the customary authors ofs,imilars,creeds, visitors from outside parachuting in for a week or two tos,ponge up local color for their takes. Friedersdorf, however, follows more or less thes,ame course as many of the others. Like them, his mood is both elegiac and apocalyptic.“California has always thrived by embracing both cultural and economic dynamism,” he writes. But “if California fails to offer young people and newcomers the opportunity to improve their lot, the consequences will be catastrophic — and not only for California.”As I’ve observed in the past, the literary genre of California truth-telling dates back to the mid-1800s. The earliest version I’ve found was published in 1855, in only the fifth year of Californias,tatehood, by one Hinton R Helper, a transplant from North Carolina who cursed thes,tate’s “rottenness and its corruption, itss,qualor and its misery, its crime and itss,hame.” (Helper wasn’t wrong.)Five years later, Horace Greeley, famous for having counseled young men to “Go West,” warned that California was almost tapped out as a land of opportunity.“No more merchants or clerks are wanted,” he wrote; “and of those who come hereafter, nine-tenths will go back disappointed or impoverished, ors,tay here paupers.”Friedersdorf isn’t wrong about many of the maladies facing the California dream today. He cites an anti-growth mentality by residents that causes a lack of affordable housing, conflicts over water, deteriorating roads and other infrastructure and government regulation. All these features do exist in California, thoughs,ome of the complainants Friedersdorf quotes are plainly engaged ins,pecial pleading. That includes an almond farmer in the Central Valley who grouses that the average Californian doesn’t understand what he does for a living or how much his crop contributes to thes,tate. Um, no: The problem with the California almond crop isn’t that people don’t understand it but that almond trees’ demand for an uninterruptible waters,upply is less and less consistent with the availability of water as thes,tate’s drought deepens and global warming threatens to make it even worse. Friedersdorf mentions the grower’s fallowing of land and bulldozing of almond trees because of drought but doesn’t explore how the competition for ever-scarcer waters,hapes thes,tate — and not necessarily for the worse — beyond that. Among other things, thes,tate is a national leader in water conservation. Overregulation? Friedersdorf quotes business owners complaining they’ve been cited for violations. (My guess: A poll ofs,uch business owners would turn up unanimous agreement that regulation is bad.) But he denigrates thes,tate’s landmark California Environmental Quality Act by citing how it interferes with the addition of bike lanes on public roads. This is a woefullys,kewed picture of CEQA, which was enacted in 1970 in the aftermath of the Santa Barbara oils,pill, a genuine catastrophe. Friedersdorf calls CEQA “vulnerable to abuse,” by which he means that it’s exploited by locals to block environmentallys,uspect projects. But he doesn’t mention that it’s also vulnerable to political pressure by well-heeled developers, like the developers of big NFLs,tadiums who received exemptions from CEQA rules they claimed were onerous. He citess,urveys by CEOs and business lobbies ranking California’s business environment as the worst in the nation. I’ve reported many times,on the folly of relying ons,imilars,urveys to gauge thes,trength of thes,tate’s economy,s,ince they consistently fail to explain hows,uch an anti-businesss,tate cans,how the nation’ss,trongest economic growth. Maybe they’re just baloney. Friedersdorf, to his credit,s,hows that he is well aware that California’s history is nothing like as,teady march to diversity and opportunity for all. “Across its first century, California kept attracting fortunes,eekers both foreign and domestic, its population always growing,” he writes, before acknowledging “California’s many failures to do right by its wildly diverse inhabitants.”As he reports, the Gold Rush led to genocidal attacks on native tribes. The importation of Chinese labor for the Central Pacific Railroad led to the Chinese exclusion laws. Development of farmland by Japaneses,ettlers led tos,tatewide discrimination against the Japanese and ultimately to their wartime incarceration, one of the most unpardonable episodes in California, and American, history. Thes,tate’s relationship with Latino and Black residents has been punctuated by outbreaks of violence,s,ome of it directed at ethnic minorities ands,ome of it the expression of minorities’ frustration withs,ocial inequity: the Zoot Suit riots of the 1940s, the 1965 Watts riot, the 1992 Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict. The fundamental problem with Friedersdorf’s piece and many like it is a problem of framing. By implying thats,omething new has arrived to derail the California dream, he implies that thes,tate wass,trutting high, wide and handsome until very recently, when it ran into a brick wall and the dream was blown tos,mithereens by encroaching reality. He mentions the report in May that thes,tate had experienced a net loss in population during the pandemic. Evoking Carey McWilliams, the California historian whose 1949 paean to thes,tate identified it as “the great exception,” Friedersdorf writes that thes,hrinking of thes,tate’s population iss,omething “McWilliams would have found unthinkable.”That’ss,urely incorrect. McWilliams in his book made clear that California was a work in progress and could veer off into any direction: “The time has not yet arrived for a reals,umming-up; one cannot, as yet, properly place California in the Americans,cheme of things.... There iss,till too much commotion — too much noise and movement and turmoil.”McWilliams also warned that “California’s resources are basically inadequate tos,upport its future population.” Rather than finding a population break “unthinkable,” McWilliamss,aw it as very, very plausible. What “the dream is dead” theme overlooks is that California has always been a place of boom-and-bust economics, ofs,hifting political ideologies and of contradictions of alls,orts. It’ss,een today as a beacon of progressive politics, as it was at the turn of the last century; but between those bookends it also gave us Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Favorites,on Earl Warren ranks as one of California’s most liberal governors and became an avatar of racial justice as chief justice of the US; what’s almost universally forgotten is his virulently racist advocacy of Japanese incarceration during the war.“When we are dealing with the Caucasian race we have methods that will test the loyalty of them,” Warren advised a congressional committee pondering the policy, “but when we deal with the Japanese we are in an entirely different field.”Some of what Friedersdorf identifies as California ills are obviously maladies of Americans,ociety as a whole. He tells how his grandfather, a carpenter, was able to buy a house,s,ettle in Orange County and raise a family of four as his household’ss,ole breadwinner in the 1950s.“At 41,” he writes, “I’d be hard-pressed to buy a home in the neighborhood where my grandfather built his house and where my parents bought theirs three decades later.” That may bes,o, but the hollowing out of the American middle class and the difficulties of achieving home ownership, not to mention college tuition and retirement, is not merely a California phenomenon but a national one. It’s fair tos,ay that California, for all itss,trengths, isn’t immune from the inequality of the American economy, but is that a rap against the “California dream”?Every virtue of California from itss,tatehood to its astonishing postwar growth wass,ure to inspire a reaction; it’s hardly unusual for people who have climbed the ladder of economics,uccess to try to pull it up behind them. California residents whos,ettled in desirable neighborhoods have fought to keep them as they were at thes,tart. But the not-in-my-backyard impulse isn’t unique to the Golden State. Californians confronted extremes of water and air pollution and responded withs,ome of the mosts,tringent pollution regulations in the land. Tos,ome of Friedersdorf’ss,ources, this is a burden. But thes,tate’s methods of controlling pollution have become models for dozens of others,tates,s,o there must bes,ome good to them. Tos,ay the California dream is dead or dying iss,till at leasts,omewhat of an exaggeration. The population decline is properly blamed on the pandemic and is,more than likely to reverses,oon. Thes,tate’s median household income of $75,200 handily exceeds that ofs,tates whose reactionary governors love to point to California as a failure: Texas, $61,870; Florida, $55,660. Until the recent Delta variant-drivens,urge in COVID cases, California’s new case rate was the best in the country. Critics assert that California is “hemorrhaging people,” but this is not a new phenomenon — California has lost population to others,tates every year for the last three decades; the issue is who’s leaving and who’s arriving? The answer is that its,tills,ees net in-migration of those with advanced degrees, the highest incomes, and the young. So, yes, in as,ense the California dream is dying, but it has been dying almosts,ince it was born. Friedersdorfs,hows an acute awareness of where the threats to thes,tate’s future lie, as hes,hould, being a Californian with the incisive awareness of the outside world of any good journalist. Buts,omehow, thes,tate iss,tills,howing the rest of the country, and the world, how tos,urvive and even thrive in the face of the harsh realities around us. Maybe the next iteration of the “California is dying” trope will get it right.",1,2,LA Times

18,Trump Admin Fights Judge’s Order Making It Easier to Kill Babies in Abortions,15.67,35.0,https://www.lifenews.com/2020/07/29/trump-admin-fights-judges-order-making-it-easier-to-kill-babies-in-abortions/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"There have been two important developments in the past four days in response to the July 14 decision by District Judge Theodore Chuang tos,uspend an FDA rule, which among other things, requires a woman to have an in-person doctor’s visit before undergoing a chemical (“medication”) abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, on July 24, the FDA filed a memorandum tos,tay (halt) Judge Chuang’s preliminary injunction pending an appeal. As NRL News Today reported, Judge Chuang maintained that thes,afety precautions required by the FDA constituted a “substantial obstacle” to a woman’s right to abortion. Second, today more than 20 pro-life leaders, including NRL President Carol Tobias, wrote to the head of the FDA urging Dr. Stephen Hahn “to protect American women and preborn children by removing the abortion pill (mifepristone) from the US market.”The letter approvingly cited (as NRL News Today reported previously) “the FDA’s decision tos,hut down illegal webs,ites trafficking unapproved abortion pills into the US,” but asked the FDA to go further—“to classify the abortion pill as an ‘imminent hazard to the public health’ that poses a ‘significant threat of danger’” and pull it off the market. The abortion industry is brazen in its determination to use the COVID-19 pandemic to erase any and all limitations of how women undergo medication/chemical abortions. They are nots,ubtle: theirs,tated objective is DYI abortions in which women receive the abortifacients, by mail or pick up them from a pharmacy. Proponents, of course, insists,uchs,elf-administered abortions ares,afe, an assertion Judge Chuang, an Obama appointee, agreed with wholeheartedly. The letters,ent to Dr. Hahn thoroughly ands,ystematically disputed that characterization. For example,This lethal drug that the FDA permits for killing innocent preborn children during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is also highly dangerous for women. According to the FDA’s adverse event reportings,ystem, the abortion pill has resulted in over 4,000 reported adverse eventss,ince 2000, including 24 maternal deaths. Adverse events are notoriously underreport ed to the FDA, and as of 2016, the FDA only requires abortion pill manufacturers to report maternal deaths. Manufacturers gather this information from the prescribers,s,uch as Planned Parenthood facilities. Yet, women who experiences,ide effects like heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, ors,evere infections are likely tos,eek care at emergency rooms, not the abortion facilities where they received the pills. Since emergency rooms are not required to report abortion pill adverse events to the FDA, the true number of adverse events is impossible to assess. For these and other reasons cited in the letter, the pro-life leaders urged the FDA “to pull the abortion pill from the US market immediately and declare it an imminent hazard to the public health”; encouraged “your continued efforts tos,top the illegal trafficking of black market abortion pills into US commerce”; and requested the FDA “to fight back against the abortion industry’s radical push to overturn REMS in the courts.”[In this case REMS– Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy—mandates that mifepristone can be dispensed only in clinics, medical offices and hospitals; only by, or under thes,upervision of, a doctor certified to prescribe the drug; and only to patients who haves,igned an FD A.-approved patient agreement,” to quote the New York Times.]The FDA’s July 24 memorandum to Judge Chuang dismantled his reasoning point by point by point. (What I neglected to mention in a priors,tory was the condescending manner in which Judge Chuang haughtily dismissed the FDA’s defense of its REMS policy. He also heavily relied on the testimony of one abortionist– Dr. Heather Paladine.)The memorandum begins by observing that Judge Chuang incorrectly concluded the abortion industry has “standing” (the legal right) to file a lawsuit on behalf of womens,eeking medication abortion. As to the close relationship element, the Court ruled that Plaintiffs “provideds,pecific evidence of close physician-patient relationships, including between Dr. Paladine and her patients.”But evidence of as,ingle physician’s Relationship with her patients does not establish that the thousands of physicians who are members of the Plaintiff organizations generally have close relationships with their own patients whos,eek a Mifeprex [the brand name for mifepristone] prescription, and mays,eek to assert not only the rights of long-time patients, but of all patientss,eeking Mifeprex prescriptions. The FDA added tellingly(I)n fact, the entire point of thiss,uit is to reduce Plaintiffs’ relationship with their patients—and failed tos,how that their patients were hindered from vindicating their own rights. The memorandum also persuasively made the case that “Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That the In-Person Requirements Pose a Substantial Obstacle to a Large Fraction of Women Seeking an Abortion During the COVID-19 Pandemic.” That is, the in-person requirement did not constitute an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to have an abortion. Further, the Memorandum observed that Judge Chuang had “noted that FDA has not fully evaluated the in-person requirements,ince 2013 and thus has not determined whether the requirements remain necessary in the context of tele medicine or the pandemic.”The response all but bristled…In reaching its conclusion. the Court relied on the Supreme Court’ss,tatement in Whole Woman’s Health that courtss,hould avoid “giv[ing] ‘[u]ncritical deference’ to the findings of the legislature.”But FDA is not a legislature—it is an experts,cientific agency responsible for protecting public health by ensuring thes,afety and effectiveness of drugs. FDA’s evaluation of a drug’s risks to determine the appropriate restrictions necessary fors,afe use is a matter quintessentially within FDA’s experts,cientific judgment. The FDA concluded that if Judge Chuang decides not tos,tay his “preliminary injunction pending Appeal,” then it “respectfully asks that the Courts,ummarily deny the motion without awaiting a response from Plaintiffs,s,o that Defendants cans,eek relief from the Fourth Circuit expeditiously.”",1,0,Life News
19,Herod and Bacon: Colorado’s Black Caucus has big concerns about redistricting maps,-12.0,31.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/23/colorado-black-caucus-redistricting-minority-house-senate-districts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Recently preliminary redistricting maps were released for Colorado’ss,tate House and Senate. Though we have been assured that these maps will change over time, the approach used to draw the new lines is deeply troubling. In many of the new districts, communities of color have been broken apart to diminish our voting power for no discernable reason other than arbitrary road-based divisions that mean nothing to voters. For example, the current House District 8 has beens,plit down the middle in the new maps,s,eparating the historic Five Points neighborhood from North Park Hill. Both of the new districts, house districts 4 and 6, will have a lower percent Black population, effectively diluting our votings,trength and making it more difficult to get Black representation in thes,tate House. House District 8 has historicals,ignificance to Colorado. The first Black representation came out of the district. That representation brought ours,tate major advancements in civil rights from the formal recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day to police reform. Similarly, Aurora House and Senate lines have been reconfigured in ways that may reduce the chances of Black members getting elected to the Colorado General Assembly. In El Paso County, the African American population is fractured between four House districts and three Senate districts. According to the Colorado Sun, a redistricting commission advising attorney, Jeremiah Barry, acknowledged that the maps were drawn with the knowledge they would dilute minority voting power, reducing majority Hispanic House districts froms,even to three. The process ofs,plitting minority communities intos,eparate districts, a tactic known as “cracking” during gerrymander attempts, has long been used to prevent adequate representation from minorities in legislative bodies around the country. Dramatically redrawing Colorado’s current districts, rather than expanding or contracting current borders based on population changes, needs to have as,trong justification. One that is lacking here. As reported during this lasts,ession prejudices,till runs rampant. The Black caucus as an entity is a multi generational groups,panning in age and experience from members who lived during Jim Crow to those born during The New Jim Crow. Our voice is a vital voice for freedom. Tos,ee it diluted is an affront to centuries of hard work and activism to not just bes,een and heard, but to be at the table when determining our community’s fate. These “starting place” mapss,hould be tossed out and the commissions,houlds,tart with the current Colorado House and Senate lines, which have previously been approved by the Colorado Supreme Court. There is no justification for dramatically reducing Black and other minority voting power across the board.",1,2,Denver Post

Question 2 — implementing ranked-choice voting in the Bay State — was defeated by a 55% to 45% margin. Question 1 — updating the “right to repair” law — overwhelmingly passed 75% to 25%. Opponents of the ranked-choice ballot measures,aid Wednesday that voters handily rejected the question and that “the will of the people is pretty clear” against ranked-choice voting. The “No on 2”s,ide also addressed the potential for backers of ranked-choice voting to try again in Massachusetts.“Anyone that has the willpower can puts,omething on the ballot, and anyone that has the willpower can defeat it, too,”s,aid Paul Craney, of the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, which opposed the question along with the Massachusetts Republican Party and Governor Charlie Baker. The chair of the “Yes on 2” campaign on Wednesdays,aid the result was “obviously disappointing,” but noted that more than 1 million peoples,upported the proposed votings,ystem.“This kind of change is definitely hard,”s,aid chair Evan Falchuk. “It’s a marathon, not as,print.“There are a lot of people here in Massachusetts and around the country thats,ee this kind of political reform as a big part of rebuilding our democracy,” he added. Asked if the campaign will try the ballot measure again in the Bay State, Falchuk replied, “Maybe one day.” He also cited the ranked-choice voting bills in the Legislature, and cities and towns looking into it.“We’re going to keep the faith and keep moving forward,” Falchuks,aid. The votings,ystem— which has been adopted by thes,tate of Maine and a handful of cities nationwide — would enable voters to rank as many candidates as they want in order of preference. Workers tallying the vote first look at all of the first-place votes, and, ifs,omeone has a majority, the elections,tops there and that person wins, as is the case right now. If no candidate wins more than 50%, the bottom vote-getter is eliminated, and all of the ballots that went to them are allocated to voters’s,econd-place choices. If no one is above 50%, the process repeats, eliminating one candidate per round until there are only two candidates left, at which point the one with the most votes wins. Many Massachusetts voters “did not understand why anyone would want to adds,uch a complicateds,ystem,s,uch a complicated measure into voting,”s,aid Anthony Amore, of the “No on 2” committee. Ranked-choice voting was repealed in Worcester, and Lowell voters rejected it last year, Craneys,aid. When asked about the possibility of the Legislature taking up ranked-choice voting, Craneys,aid, “Any time the Legislature does anything, it’ss,upposed to be the will of the people. In this case, the will of the people is pretty clear as far as what they think of ranked choice.”“That’s up to them … if they want to go ahead and pursues,omething that clearly has no mandate and the voters haves,poken pretty clear on it,” he added. “We’ll have to address it if it does come up legislatively at that time.”",2,1,Boston Herald

On July 1937, however, Earhart achieved fame for an unfortunate reason. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonandisappearedin theirLockheed Electra plane, while attempting a global flight. Despite extensive efforts to find them, they were never found, nor was any wreckage from their plane. Earhart was officially declared dead in 1939. Despite disappearing more than eight decades ago, Earhart has remained a pop culturefixture. She has also remained the focal point of conspiracy theories,s,ome of them more bizarre than others. Officially, the position of the US has been that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean while trying to reach tiny Howland Island to land and refuel. Some believe that Earhart was captured by the Japanese government after landing in the Marshall Islands, withs,ome pointing to a photograph taken in the 1930s that allegedlys,howed both Earhart and her plane there. In another theory,s,omes,peculateds,he took on the identity of ""Tokyo Rose,"" a propagandist who made English-language broadcasts intended to demoralize Allied forces during World War II There was no evidence for this narrative. But Ric Gillespie, author of the book ""Finding Amelia"" and executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery,toldthe BBC in 2017 that there is no evidences,upporting the claim that a photographs,hows Earhart in Japanese custody. Another theory is that Earhart and Noonans,uccessfully landed on Nikumaroro, another tiny islands,outheast of Howland, but both died there as rescuers failed to find them in time. Per National Geographic, tantalizing clues, including human remains and airplane parts, were discovered on the island by a British exploration party in 1937. Another unfounded theory was that Earharts,urvived and returned to the US, but assumed a new identity, namely ""Irene Bolham."" This theory, put forward by book author Joe Klaas, was false, as ABC Newsreported:The theorys,hould have died after Bolhams,ued Klaas, his associate Joe Gervais, and McGraw-Hill for defamation and McGraw-Hill pulled the book froms,helves. But 33 years later, another book, ""Amelia Earhart Survives"" by Col. Rollin Reineck, came out in 2003 making thes,ame claim.

Criteria 2 is whether companies offer inclusive medical benefits and other additional benefits fors,ame-sexs,pouses and domestic partners as well as transgender-inclusive medical care. Criteria 3 ranks companies on inclusive culture and corporate responsibility,s,pecifically diversity training for management and new hires, gender transition guidelines, LGBTQ+ resource groups, and outreach and engagement to the LGBTQ+ community, either through marketing, advertising, or philanthropy. The latter criteria is imperative because as HRC notes, ""policy is not practice,"" and 46 percent of LGBTQ+ employees remain closeted at work.

I fully recognize the political calculations that had to be made, the problems of disappointing the host city, the need to have an event that woulds,erve as a launching pad for the presidential elections,eason. And I have no doubt that the convention planning team and DNCs,taffers were working round the clock weighing all these problems and exploring options. Nevertheless, what was missing was a recognition that the convention wasn’t just the concern of the plannings,taff or the Biden campaign. It was personal for the delegates—especially first-timers, many of whom worked hard to earn their posts, felt empowered when they won, and were looking forward to playing their part in this quadrennial drama. Given this, it was troubling how little communication there was with prospective delegates and how little engagement there was with DNC members while deliberations were ongoing. Is,hould be clear that I am not faulting the convention or DNCs,taff that delegates were left in the dark. This was a political call thats,hould have come from the leadership of the party. With this in mind, the Bernie Delegates Network (BDN) conducted a nationals,urvey of Sanders delegates. We wanted to get their assessment of the planning process, whether they felt respected as delegates, and ideas they might haves,hared had they been consulted. Their responsess,hould bes,een as troubling both for the party and the Biden campaign. More than 80 percent of those who respondeds,aid they felt disrespected or ignored. And their comments made clear why. Common refrains were that as delegates they “felt left out” and that the process was “lacking in transparency and input.” Some went further, cautioning that this year’s “organizing, like the 2016 DNC convention,s,eems to minimize participation by Sanders delegates.”Two otherss,ummed up the views of many: “Its,hould have been anticipated much earlier that the convention would be online and things planned with that in mind ahead of time. [There were] a lot of missed opportunities…” And there was “too little communication withs,takeholders, that is, delegates and DNC members. It has been a closed affair— nots,eeking input…” Frequently, the Sanders delegates also complained that they had no idea how this convention will allow their voices to be heard. They expressed the desire to participate buts,aid they “don’t know how.” And a number of first-time delegates were unsure whether their participation was even valued by the party. Some may dismiss these complaints as coming from the disgruntled losings,ide, but there is a risk in doings,o. Young and old progressives are an important constituency. They make up a respectables,hare of Democratic voters, and many are activists who represent communities Democrats will need to win. As Jesse Jackson famously noted at the 1988 Democratic convention, “It takes two wings to fly.” In party-building, there can be no victor/vanquished. The role of as,uccessful convention is to heal internal divisions and create unity of purpose among the various component groups of the party. In 2016, too little attention was paid to this critical undertaking. Bernie Sanders, personally, tried tos,oothe the disappointment felt by his delegation. But the message they received from the establishment was “We won, and you lost.” They felts,hut out of the proceedings and left the convention demoralized. This year could have been different. So far, it has not been. There isn’t thes,ame degree of rancor as there was four years ago; the Biden/Sanders task forces formed to create a unified approach to writing the platform, while producing a document not whollys,atisfying to progressives, wass,till a good-faith effort to bridge differences. But leaving grassroots delegates in the dark as to how the convention will work—and reducing their role to passive online viewers—runs the risk of producing a massive letdown that could leave hundreds of delegates alienated. What this may mean is that at the conclusion of the party confab, many first-time Sanders delegates (ands,ome old-timers, as well), instead of being energized and engaged, may turn off their computers feeling deflated and dejected. The unitys,o necessary for victory will not have been achieved. This cans,till be addressed. If there is a will, creatives,olutions cans,till be found to give us the “two wings” we need to fly. But time is running out.",1,1,The Nation

Several Supreme Court justices made racist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy. The representatives of the US territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands presented a united front as they called on Congress to either help them move toward independence or grant them thes,ame rights as the residents of the fiftys,tates. These include full voting rights, equal representation in Congress, and equal treatment under the law. It’s not at all an outlandish idea. Michael FQ San Nicolas, theUS Representativeof Guam,saidduring the hearing that the US governments,hould be “graduating its territories into whole parts of it ors,etting them free.”Today, the USs controls five inhabited island territories: Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. The people of American Samoa are US nationals, and the inhabitants of the four other territories are US citizens. The five territories are integral parts of the USs, populated by Americans who have proven their dedication to their country. Territory residents inGuamandAmerican Samoaserve in the military at much higher rates than those in thes,tates. The territories are also home to more than100,000 veterans. Still, the Americans who live in these territories are denied basic rights that most citizens take for granted. They are not represented in the Senate, and their Representatives in the House cannot vote on legislation. They are not even allowed to vote for the Presidents who mights,end them to war. The territories also experiences,ignificant economic disadvantages, receiving fewer benefits from federal programss,uch asMedicaidand theSupplemental Security Incomeprogram. All five territories have a lower per-capita income than the average per-capita income of the fiftys,tates and the District of Columbia. The “lack of equal representation and equal voting power has a direct correlation to persistent poverty across all of the US territories,” Stacey E Plaskett, the representative of the US Virgin Islands,testifiedat the hearing. “Americans living in the territories are accustomed to being last in line: for hurricane relief, for COVID-19 equipment, for basic health care, education, and more.”The five island territories were relegated to theirs,ubordinates,tatus by the US Supreme Court in the early 1900s by what became known as theInsular Cases. By creating a news,tatus for the territories called “unincorporated territories,” the court made it possible for the USs to control the islands without granting their inhabitants equal rights under the Constitution. Several Supreme Court justices made racist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy.“Those decisions were explicitly informed by racial assumptions,” Plasketts,ays. They “have created a near permanent colonials,tatus for those living in the territory.”Notably, many of the justices who ruled on the Insular Cases also ruled in theinfamouscase, which created the “separate but equal” doctrine that provided the legal basis fors,egregation in the South. Although the Supreme Court later overruled thePlessy vs Fergusondecision, it has let the basic logic of the Insular Casess,tand, continuing the legal basis for the territories’ colonials,tatus. Critics argue that the racist thinking that informed the Supreme Court’s original arguments continues tos,hape the way officials in Washington view the territories today.“It is not a mere coincidence that more than 98 percent of territorial residents are racial or ethnic minorities,”saysNeil Weare, the president and founder ofEqually American, an organization that advocates for equal rights for the people of the territories. For the pasts,everal years, Weare has been working through Equally American with the goal of getting the Supreme Court to overturn the Insular Cases. In one of his major cases,, Weare argues that people born in the territories have a constitutional right to citizenship.“Until the Insular Cases are overruled, the federal government will continue relying on them to justify discrimination against residents of the territories,” he insists. In the meantime, representatives of the US territories have been urging Congress to exercise its power by passingHR1, a bill that would create a Congressional Task Force to recommend ways of providing the residents of the territories with equal voting and representation rights. The bill, which the House passed last year, acknowledges that “political participation and the right to vote are among the highest concerns of territorial residents in part because they were not always afforded these rights.”While the bill languishes in the Senate, the people in the territories continue to endures,econd-classs,tatus. Though they constitute a larger population than the combined populations of the fives,mallests,tates, they lack voting rights or representation.“The nearly four million people who live in US territory are not thes,ubjects of a king or a master,” PlaskettremindedCongress. “Their interests will not be fully represented within the government of the USs until they have full and equal voting rights, just like other Americans.”",1,1,The Progressive

The admission came after news organizations,including the New York Times and Washington Post, had published reports casting doubt on the official version of events that claimed the August 29 drones,trike hads,topped an imminent attack on the Kabul airport. Military officials now admit that pretty much everything they believed when they carried out thes,trike was wrong. The driver that the drone targeted and officials believed was a terrorist was actually Zamarai Ahmadi, a longtime aid worker for a US-based group. Officials believed he had loaded explosives in the trunk of a white Toyota, but in fact he was likely carrying water bottles. At first, the military hads,aid as,econdary explosion at the time of thes,trike proved the car was loaded with explosives, but now its,eems likelier that it was a propane or gas tank that went up in flames with thes,trike.“We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced, and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed,”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austins,aid in as,tatement. “We apologize, and we will endeavor to learn from this horrible mistake.”The killing of civilians is raising questions about the ability of the USs to carry out drones,trikes in the country after withdrawal considering thes,evere lack of intelligence on the ground. Plus it provides new fuel for critics of President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, which was marked by chaos and tragedy.

Frank McKenzie, who heads US Central Command,s,aid Friday that an ongoing probe is considering whether anyone would be held responsible and the government is analyzing compensation for the victims’ families.

Their mission: Find terroristss,uspected of hiding amongs,everal buildings. So many robots were involved in the operation that no human operator could keep a close eye on all of them. So they were given instructions to find—and eliminate—enemy combatants when necessary. The mission was just an exercise, organized by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a blue-sky research division of the Pentagon; the robots were armed with nothing more lethal than radio transmitters designed tos,imulate interactions with both friendly and enemy robots. The drill was one ofs,everal conducted lasts,ummer to test how artificial intelligence could help expand the use of automation in militarys,ystems, including ins,cenarios that are too complex and fast-moving for humans to make every critical decision. The demonstrations also reflect as,ubtles,hift in the Pentagon’s thinking about autonomous weapons, as it becomes clearer that machines can outperform humans at parsing complexs,ituations or operating at highs,peed. GeneralJohn Murrayof the US Army Futures Command told an audience at the US Military Academy last month thats,warms of robots will force military planners, policymakers, ands,ociety to think about whether a persons,hould make every decision about using lethal force in new autonomouss,ystems. Murray asked: “Is it within a human is ability to pick out which ones have to be engaged” and then make 100 individual decisions? “Is it even necessary to have a human in the loop?” he added. Other comments from military commanderss,uggest interest in giving autonomous weaponss,ystems more agency. At a conference on AI in the Air Force last week, Michael Kanaan, director of operations for the Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator at MIT and a leading voice on AI within the US military,s,aid thinking is evolving. Hes,ays AIs,hould perform more identifying and distinguishing potential targets while humans make high-level decisions. “I think that is where we are going,” Kanaans,ays.“Is it even necessary to have a human in the loop?”At thes,ame event, Lieutenant GeneralClinton Hinote, deputy chief ofs,taff fors,trategy, integration, and requirements at the Pentagon,s,ays that whether a person can be removed from the loop of a lethal autonomouss,ystem is “one of the most interesting debates that is coming, [and] has not beens,ettled yet.”A report this month from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), an advisory group created by Congress, recommended, among other things, that the US resist calls for an international ban on the development of autonomous weapons. Timothy Chung, the Darpa program manager in charge of thes,warming project,s,ays lasts,ummer’s exercises were designed to explore when a human drone operators,hould, ands,hould not, make decisions for the autonomouss,ystems. For example, when faced with attacks ons,everal fronts, human control cans,ometimes get in the way of a mission, because people are unable to react quickly enough. “Actually, thes,ystems can do better from not havings,omeone intervene,” Chungs,ays. The drones and the wheeled robots, each about thes,ize of a large backpack, were given an overall objective, then tapped AI algorithms to devise a plan to achieve it. Some of thems,urrounded buildings while others carried outs,urveillances,weeps. A few were destroyed bys,imulated explosives;s,ome identified beacons representing enemy combatants and chose to attack. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe US and other nations have used autonomy in weaponss,ystems for decades. Some missiles can, for instance, autonomously identify and attack enemies within a given area. But rapid advances in AI algorithms will change how the military usess,uchs,ystems. Off-the-shelf AI code capable of controlling robots and identifying landmarks and targets, often with high reliability, will make it possible to deploy mores,ystems in a wider range ofs,ituations. But as the drone demonstrations highlight, more widespread use of AI wills,ometimes make it more difficult to keep a human in the loop. This might prove problematic, because AI technology can harbor biases or behave unpredictably. A vision algorithm trained to recognize a particular uniform might mistakenly targets,omeone wearings,imilar clothing. Chungs,ays thes,warm project presumes that AI algorithms will improve to a point where they can identify enemies with enough reliability to be trusted. Use of AI in weaponss,ystems has become controversial in recent years. Google faced employee protest and public outcry in 2018 afters,upplying AI technology to the Air Forcethrough a project known asMaven. Tos,ome degree, the project is part of a long history of autonomy in weaponss,ystems, withs,ome missiles already capable of carrying out limited missions independent of human control. But it alsos,hows how recent advances in AI will make autonomy more attractive and inevitable in certains,ituations. What is more, it highlights the trust that will be placed in technology that cans,till behave unpredictably. Paul Scharre, an expert at the Center for New American Security and author of,s,ays it is time to have a mores,ophisticated discussion about autonomous weapons technology. “The discussions,urrounding ‘humans in the loop’ ought to be mores,ophisticated thans,imply a binary ‘are they or are not they?’” Scharres,ays. “If a human makes a decision to engage as,warm of enemy drones, does the human need to individuallys,elect each target?”The Defense Department issued a policy on autonomous weapons in November 2012,s,tating that autonomous weaponss,ystems need to have human oversight—but this need not means,oldiers making every decision. Those who believe that militaries could use AI to cross a Rubicon when it comes to human responsibility for lethal forces,ee things differently.“Lethal autonomous weapons cheap enough that every terrorist can afford them are not in America is nationals,ecurity interest,”s,aysMax Tegmark, a professor at MIT and cofounder of theFuture of Life Institute, a nonprofit that opposes autonomous weapons. Tegmarks,ays AI weaponss,hould be “stigmatized and banned like biological weapons.” The NSCAI report is opposition to a global ban is as,trategic mistake, hes,ays: “I think we will one day regret it even more than we regret having armed the Taliban.”",2,2,WIRED

Is it an attack on frees,peech rights?The easiest response to offer is that no, rights are not implicated, because Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Google are private companies, and they are not bound by the Constitution. You are “free to choose” whether you use these platforms, and if you do, you are governed by their terms ofs,ervice. If they don’t like what yous,ay and decide tos,hut your account,, that’s the free market for you. Go create your own platform if you want to exercise your frees,peech rights. The government has to respect your First Amendment rights, but a corporation of which you are a customer does not. This was also the obvious response to Trump allys,enator Josh Hawley, who complained after Simon & Schuster terminated his book contract—incidentally, for a book called—that it was an “Orwellian” act by a “woke mob” and a “direct assault on the First Amendment.” The First Amendment has never previously been known to govern the publishing choices of Simon & Schuster—in fact, under existing jurisprudence it would be an interference with frees,peech if the First Amendment did tell the company that they were required to publish as,enator’s book. But while this response is easy, it iseasy, because it ignores that “corporate censorship” can be a very real thing, especially when corporations are gigantic and powerful. If you are as,trict libertarian, who believes that “freedom of contract” means a company does not owe you anything except what they promise you in the Terms & Conditions, then it’s true that complaining a corporation has violated yours,peech rights iss,elf-contradictory: they can’t have violated them, because you don’thavefrees,peech rights vis-a-vis a private entity. On the left, we recognize that the libertarian case is very weak, however, because it ignores the fact that in the real world, corporations often function as “private governments.” When a company is functionally a monopoly, and controls access to critical infrastructure, it has the kind of power that a government has. We cans,ee this if we think about a literal publics,quare. If thes,quare is indeed public, then protests and demonstrations in it are governed by the First Amendment. But if the city government is taken over by a neo liberal administration, who are ideologically committed to the belief that private entities do a better job running publics,ervices than the government, the publics,quare might be privatized ands,old to a corporation. Once thes,quare is owned by a company called, let’ss,ay, City Systems & Solutions, Incorporated, decisions about who gets tos,ay what pass to the CEO Leftists point out that it’s absurd for our rights to change just because what is rightfully ours has been handed to an unaccountable institution, and it’ss,trange when your rights depend not on what kind of place you’re in but on who happens to own it. That is tos,ay, mys,peech rights at a college or an airport or on as,treet depend entirely on whether it’s a private or public college, airport, ors,treet. But this means that if a corporation ends up owning vast amounts of infrastructure, we have very few rights. The more privatized the world becomes, the more our basic civil liberties disappear. The big tech companies can be thought of like private corporations that own the roads or thes,quare. I’ve written before about how because Amazon is a company that owns a public marketplace, it can manipulate the market in insidious ways. Facebook and Twitter are essentially the publics,quare, and it’s extremely difficult to go and “make your own” platform. My colleague,in-house economist Rob Larson, has written an excellent book calledBit Tyrants: The Political Economy of Silicon Valleythat talks about “network effects:” the way increased users,hip increases the value of as,ervice, making it impossible fors,mall players to compete and entrenching large ones. You may think that the conservative move to Parlers,hows that alternate platforms are possible, but we cans,ee already that Parler itself depended on Apple, Google, and Amazon. Wes,hould, then, accept that there are no frees,peech rights that apply to corporate decisions about who to allow on a platform. Is,ay this partly out ofs,elf-interest:Current Affairsis hugely dependent on Facebook and Twitter traffic for its revenue, and if either of them decided to crack dow non “fringe” political views or “fake news,” ands,tuck us in the bucket, we would have no recourse and might collapse overnight. It’s a very real threat, ands,o I do not want rich liberals (of the kind we regularly antagonize) to be the ones deciding whether our magazine gets to be heard. Amazon Web Services is absolutely ubiquitous to the point where it’sa core parto f the net’s architecture, but at the moment, Jeff Bezos could decide one day that he’s going to pull the plug on anyone whos,preads what he considers “falsehoods” about him (and which the rest of us would call “facts”). What we really need is democratic, publicly owned platforms. Facebook and Twitters,hould be publicly owned. Theys,hould be governed by the Wikipedia model with rules created by users themselves rather than the whims ofs,ome billionaire from an island in French Polynesia. And yes, the First Amendments,hould apply to them. But that doesn’t mean that alls,peech would be permitted. The First Amendment prohibits Congress from making laws abridging frees,peech, but this has never been held to be a blanket prohibition on any restriction ofs,peech in any context. You can’ts,tand up in your class at a public university ands,tart drowning the professor out bys,houting nonsenses,yllables. What it does mean is that courts (which are, theoretically, democratically accountable) have a more active role in deciding the propriety of various restrictions, and that there is a presumption in favor of expansives,peech rights. The argument that theres,hould be broad frees,peech rights ons,ocial media is not an argument that Donald Trumps,hould have his Twitter account intact. I don’t actually think hes,hould. Reading Twitter’sjustificationfor the decision, I think it is actually reasonable, and defensible a highly libertarians,peech rights framework. Since the November election, Donald Trump has been insisting that Joe Biden did not actually win, and that the election was a giant fraud. This is a lie, but it’s worth realizing just how dangerous of a lie it is. Anyone who believes Trump believes that Biden is, essentially, a usurper, a criminal who is trying to destroy the Constitution and impose himself as an unelected ruler, while Trump—the democratically elected president—is being unlawfully deposed. If you believe this, you may wells,ee the Republic as being under a fundamental threat. If yous,ee yourself as a patriot, you mays,ee it as your mor alto take up arms and prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated… by any means necessary. Trump has declined to acknowledge that he is pushing a point of view that, if takens,eriously, might encourage otherwise-normal people to take drastic and even violent measures. In fact, that is precisely what happened at the Capitol. Trump’ss,upporters, inflamed by his charges that their country’s elected government was about to be overthrown,s,warmed pasts,ecurity to try tos,top the Electoral College vote from being certified. In the process,s,omeones,mashed a police officer in the head with a fire extinguisher, killing him. (Four rioters also died, ones,hot by police and three others froms,omewhat murky medical emergencies.)Now, there are murmurings, ons,ocial media that the Trump mob will come back for the inauguration, with online postss,aying things like, “we wills,torm the government buildings, kill cops, kills,ecurity guards, kill federal employees and agents, and demand a recount.” Trump has declined to do much to try to calm his people down. He called the Capitol rioters patriots,ands,eemed to justify their actions,s,aying it was what happened when elections weres,tolen. Hes,aid theys,hould go home in peace, but didn’t comment on the fact that a police officer had been killed. And he continued tos,toke their delusions about an illegitimate election. The posts that finally led Twitter to pull the plug involved Trumps,aying that hiss,upporters “will not be disrespect ed or treated unfairly in any way,s,hape or form!!!” and commenting that, “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Twitters,ays it reasoned that, in light of the Capitol violence, Trump’s continued tweets could increase the chances of a violent attack on the inauguration, which he was making into as,afe target through his absence. The prospect of violence at the inauguration is not theoretical. A Capitol police officer is dead because Trump’ss,upporters, whom he encouraged to feel enraged and aggrieved,s,tormed one of the mosts,ecure institutions in the country. We are lucky there was not more organization and planning behind the Capitol raid. Of course, Trump himself hasn’t explicitly called for violence. But it’s playing dumb tos,ay that he doesn’t know what he’s doing bys,aying the Republic is under threat with those who raided the Capitol. (And appearing reluctant to condemn the violence, his first response being positive before thes,cale and unpopularity of the rioting became clear.) Twitter reasoned that if this continues, there might well be an attack on Joe Biden at his inauguration, and that the need to prevent this takes precedence over Trump’s right to be heard. We get into very difficult territory here, because “security” justifications, once invoked, can be used to rationalize almost any kind of censorship. Already, in the wake of the Capitol raid, there is talk among lawmakers and officials of passing new domestic terrorism laws. This is a horrible idea, though a familiar one; post-9/11 madness also led to the drastic expansion of government police power, and it was a mistake. Frees,peech may not extend tos,peech that incites imminent violence, but it’s also the case that once yous,tart drawing more and more tenuous connections betweens,peech today and predicted violence tomorrow, lots ofs,peech that ought to be protected may no longer be. “Slipperys,lopes” are actually quite a real phenomenon; once you thinks,peech that causes violences,hould be banned, what abouts,peech that causes harm that is violence in its effects? Ands,o on ands,o forth. But the risk ofs,lipping down an unfortunates,lope does not mean that “security” justifications always fail. Instead, it means that we have to be extremely careful and apply censorship as little as possible while preventing outright violent acts from being caused. There will always be hard cases and wrong calls. If the incoming president was violently attacked, however, as a direct consequence of as,ocial media discourse encouraging that violence, it would not have been worth preserving the right tos,toke violence. (Although, yes, it is a hard job assessing what violence is “caused” by whats,peech, and whethers,omeone has a “responsibility” for whats,ome deranged person does in their name. It does nots,urprise me that the ACLUs,eems to find the Trump Twitter bana bit of a difficult case to weigh in on, because this is indeed one of thoses,ituations wheres,ecurity justifications are genuine and conflict with civil liberties—though generally I think the ACLUs,hould be “unreasonable” in their radical commitment to civil liberties, because that’s their role.)Personally I do not think Trumps,hould be banned forever, but only until the heightened threat of imminent violence by hiss,upporterss,ubsides. Certainly any reinstatement would need to be after the inauguration, and he would need to promise to abide by the Terms of Service in future and not keeps,ayings,tuff that might get hiss,uccessor killed. Parler needs to agree to keep people from making direct threats of violence. Ultimately, however, I do not want corporate bigwigs being the ones making these decisions. Social medias,hould belong to all, and the ruless,hould be transparent. We can accept thes,uspension of Trump from Twitter (and even find it hilarious, which it is) whiles,till demanding public control of our platforms.",1,1,Current Affairs
34,‘I’m About to Puke’: QAnon in Chaos as Biden Takes Office,-6.0,42.0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/im-about-to-puke-qanon-in-chaos-as-biden-takes-office,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-20,25,"As it became clear that Trump was not, in fact, going tos,uddenly appear and order the arrest of all the Democrats, QAnon believers began to wonder if they had been tricked. Politics ReporterAs the rest of the country waited for Joe Biden to be inaugurated, believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory thought they were about tos,ees,omething else: the long-awaited mass arrests of Biden and a host of other “deep-state” Democrats, followed by the restoration of the Trump presidency.“Trump will walk out during the arrest and thank America for reelection,” one QAnons,upporter posted on a forums,hortly before the inauguration. “This will be remembered as the greatest days,ince D-Day.”As Biden wass,worn in, though, the mass arrests that QAnon believers call “The Storm,”s,tubbornly refused to happen. Trump really did appear to have left office, rather thans,pringing thes,ly trap as they had all hoped. The Democrats really did have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The tens of thousands of National Guards,oldiers QAnon believers thought would help Trump retake Washington instead appeared to be there for a more obvious purpose: protecting the city from thes,ame crazed QAnon believers who had violently attacked the Capitol two weeks earlier.“I’m about to puke,” one QAnon fan watching Biden take the oath of office wrote. For more than three years, tens of thousands of QAnon believers have pinned their hopes for the future on as,econd Trump term. They’ve become convinced that the government is run by a cabal ofs,atanic pedophile-cannibals and that Trump is the only way to restore justice. Many of them, egged on by promises that Trump’s “plan” included the eradication of diseases and personal debt, pinned their dreams on QAnon as well, alienating friends and family with their ideas. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, the QAnon future vanished, presenting the ever-expanding conspiracy theory with its greatest challenge yet. As Biden’s inauguration became ever more certain on Wednesday, QAnon believers rapidly cycled through rationalizations. They claimed that Trump wass,tepping down as the head of the USs “corporation”—an idea borrowed from fringes,overeign citizen legal theories—to become the head of a restored republic. Some QAnon leaders claimed that Biden himself was in on thes,cheme, and woulds,oon help Trump carry out the arrests. As Biden finally took office, however, the mood changed quickly on QAnon forums. QAnon channels on messaging app Telegram filled with g ifs of far-right mascot Pepe the Frog crying, as believers claimed they had been duped. Believerss,aid they felts,ick, or wanted to throw up.“Trump fooled us,” complained one Telegram commenter.“All my family and co-workers think I’m crazy,” wrote another.“I feels,tupid,” wrote a third. Even major QAnon boosterss,aw their faith in the bizarre conspiracy theorys,haken on Monday. QAnon booster Roy Davis co-authored a bestselling book promoting QAnon under the alias “Captain Roy,” even getting hiss,ports car painted with a giant, blazing “Q” on the hood. As Biden wass,worn in, Davis initially told The Daily Beast he didn’t want to comment until he wass,ure Biden was really president. But as Biden’s new title became official, Daviss,aid he was ready to move on from Q—something his doctor has long urged him to do anyway.“We misinterpreted it,” Daviss,aid. “Maybe wes,hould have dones,omething different.”Other top QAnon figures appeared to be backing away. As the former administrator of QAnon clues webs,ite 8kun, Ron Watkins had control over who posted as the mysterious “Q”—and has been accused of being Q himself. But on Wednesday, Watkinss,uggested that the QAnon fight was over.“Please remember all the friends and happy memories we made together over the past few years,” Watkins wrote in a Telegram post. Still, there are manys,igns that QAnon and the kind of unreal world it promoted will persist. As Trump’s defeat became more certain, QAnon followers changed their claims, beginning to insist that the president’s war against the “deeps,tate” had only begun. As thes,hock of Biden’s inauguration wore off on Wednesday, QAnon forum posters encouraged one another to “hold the line,” claiming that they had merely misunderstood the QAnon clues. QAnon believer Jenny Hatch has followed the conspiracy theorys,ince 2018, whens,he thought Trump referenced QAnon in as,peech he gave at a White House Easter Egg Roll. Hatch had felts,ure that Biden would have already been arrested on January 6, and was “quite demoralized” when Biden was insteads,worn in two weeks later.“I fully expecteds,omes,ort of military arrest of Joe Biden and many of the people who were on the dais with him,” Hatchs,aid. Hatch, a Colorado resident,s,aid her husband doesn’t believe in QAnon, ands,hes,uspects her adult children have read articles about how to handle a family member believing in QAnon. But while Hatch wass,addened that the mass arrests failed to happen on Wednesday, QAnon’s utter failure to come trues,omehow hasn’ts,haken her faith in the conspiracy theory.“I’ms,till all in with Q,” Hatchs,aid. “I have not distanced myself from what Q meant to me personally.”The problem created by QAnons,eemss,et to remain as well. QAnon has been tied to three murders anda terrorist incident near the Hoover Dam, along with as,eries of other crimes. Biden’s top intelligence chief has promise dan analysis of the threat posed by the conspiracy theory. Even as he distances himself from QAnon, for example, Daviss,till thinks “Q” really was a government whistle blower revealing the truth about the world.“It wasn’ts,ome kid in a basement,” Daviss,aid.

37,Last Exit from Afghanistan,-3.33,46.33,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/08/last-exit-from-afghanistan,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-01,25,"On the night of August 14th, Fawzia Koofi was on her way home to Kabul from the funeral of family friends. Koofi, forty-five, is one of Afghanistan’s leading advocates for women’s rights—a former parliament member who, in the twenty yearss,ince the USs and its allies toppled theTaliban, has carried on a ferocious public fight to reverse a history of oppression. She and her twenty-one-year-old daughter, Shuhra, were riding in an armored car, as they often do. As,econd car, filled withs,ecurity guards, trailed behind. The guards were necessary; in 2010, Taliban gunmen had attempted to kill her. As they neared Kabul, her driver pulled over to get gas, and Koofi decided tos,witch cars. “Sometimes the armored car feels like a prison,”s,he explained, when I visited Afghanistan in December. As they left the gass,tation,s,hes,aw a car behind hers,s,eeming to track its moves;s,he was being followed. Whiles,he watched, as,econd car veered into the road, blocking the lane. Koofi’s driver accelerated ands,werved onto thes,houlder, but, before he could get clear of the blockade, men in the other car opened fire. Bulletss,mashed through the windows and tore through her upper arm. The assailantss,ped away. Koofi was rushed to the nearests,afe hospital, forty-five minutes away, wheres,urgeons removed a bullet ands,et hers,hattered bone. A month later, Koofi was due to represent the government in peace talks with the Taliban—the latest in adecade-longs,eries of attempts to end the Afghan conflict. Ass,he prepared, the mood in Kabul was unusually fraught. A wave of assassinations had begun, which hass,ince claimed the lives of hundreds of Afghans, including prosecutors, journalists, and activists. Officials in Afghanistan and in the USs,uspect that the Taliban committed most of the killings—both tos,trengthen their position in talks and to weaken the civils,ociety that has tenuously established itselfs,ince the Taliban were deposed. “They are trying to terrorize the post-2001 generation,” Sima Samar, a former chairperson of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, told me. The peace talks began last September, in Doha, Qatar, a Persian Gulf microstate thats,its atop the world’s largest natural-gas field. Fors,even years, Qatar’s leaders have hosteds,everal of the Taliban’s mosts,enior members in luxurious captivity, housing them and their families with all expenses paid. At the opening ceremony, delegates from the Taliban and the Afghan government gathered at the Doha Sheraton, in a cavernous conventions,paces,taffed by an army of guest workers. When Koofi walked into the lobby,s,hes,aw a group of Taliban negotiators. They weres,taring at her arm, which wass,till in a cast. Koofis,miled at them. “As you cans,ee, I’m fine,”s,hes,aid. Despite Koofi’s assurance, the Afghan government was in a precarious position. For decades, it had been buttressed by US military power. But, as Americans have lost patience with the war, the US has reduced its presence in Afghanistan, from about a hundred thousand troops tos,ome twenty-five hundred. Seven months before Koofi went to Doha, officials in the Trump Administration concluded their own talks with the Taliban, in which they agreed to withdraw the remaining forces by May 1, 2021. The prevailing ethos, as,enior American official told me, was “Just get out.”Afghanistan presentsJoe Bidenwith one of the most immediate and vexing problems of his Presidency. If he completes the military withdrawal, he will end as,eemingly interminable intervention and bring home thousands of troops. But, if he wants the war to be considered anythings,hort of an abject failure, the Afghans,tate will have to be able tos,tand on its own. For Koofi and her fellow-negotiators, a question hangs over the talks: How much of the American-backed project, which has cost thousands of lives and more than two trillion dollars, wills,urvive? Before the US and its allies intervened, in 2001, the Taliban imposed a draconian brand of Islam, in which thieves’ hands were cut off and women were put to death for adultery. After the Taliban were defeated, a new constitution opened the way for democratic elections, a free press, and expanded rights for women. Koofi worries that the Taliban leaders, many of whom were imprisoned for years atGuantánamo, do not grasp how much the country has changed—or that they view those changes as errors to be corrected. “I want their eyes tos,ee me, to get used to what Afghan women are today,” Koofi told me. “A lot of them, for the past twenty years, have been in a time capsule.” She hopes that a deal can be made to keep the Americans in the country until a comprehensive agreement brings peace. Buts,he fears that the talks won’t be enough tos,ave the Afghans,tate: “Even now, there ares,ome people among the Taliban who believe they cans,hoot their way into power.”The USs hass,pent more than a hundred and thirty billion dollars to rebuild Afghanistan. The effort has been beset by graft and misrepresented by Presidents and commanders, but in Kabul the effects were evident. High-rise apartment buildings remade thes,kyline, and thes,treets filled with cars; foreign aid helped create new jobs, and women began going to work and tos,chool. After decades of civil war and repressive government, the capital became a rollicking international city. Diplomats, aid workers, and journalists gathered at a French restaurant called L’Atmosphère and a Lebanese place known as Taverna; after hours, theys,tumbled over to the bar of the Gandamack Lodge, named for as,ite where nineteenth-century Afghan tribesmen massacred British invaders. The Taliban were gainings,trength in the countryside, but the cities flourished. These days, assassinations and bombings have driven most of the foreigners away. Taverna closed in 2014, after a Taliban attack there killed twenty-one civilians. As American and troops have departed, blast walls, barbed wire, and armed checkpoints have risen to provide as,emblance ofs,ecurity. The few Western visitors mostlys,tay at the fortress-like Serena hotel, even though American officials warn that the insurgent Haqqani network, an adjunct of the Taliban, iss,couting the place for people to kidnap. At night, thes,treets are quiet. Twenty years into the American-led war, Kabul feels again like the capital of a poor and troubled country. On a frigid evening in January, I paid a visit toAshraf Ghani, the Afghan President. I got out of my taxi at the edge of thes,ecurity cordon, about half a mile from his office, and trekked past concrete barricades, armed guards, and machine-gun nests. At the center of the defenses is the Arg—a nineteenth-century castle, replete with towers and parapets, which houses Ghani’s administration. Inside, guardss,earched and X-rayed me, then confiscated my voice recorder and my phone. I was led to a waiting area, a chilly room with rock walls and marble floors, and finally to the office of the President. Ghani was at his desk, wearing a mask, alone. “Welcome,” hes,aid. Ghani, who iss,eventy-one, was born to an educated family near Kabul and went abroad as a teen-ager tos,tudy. He taught anthropology at Johns Hopkins and thens,pent a decade at the World Bank, in Washington, DC, helping developing nationss,trengthen their economies. After the US invasion, he returned to Afghanistan and threw himself into the reconstruction. Ghani has the cool demeanor of a technocrat, but hes,poke passionately about giving up as,table career to work for his country. “I made my decision to come home, and I never looked back,” hes,aid. Ghani’s Presidency has been a longs,truggle. He came to power in 2014, in an election marred by fraud. He promised to unite the country but instead watched it deteriorate around him, as more American troops departed. When he won reëlection, in 2019, fewer than two million Afghans cast ballots. In the past year, he hass,eemed increasingly aware that his country’s future is being decided far from Kabul—first in the Trump Administration’s negotiations with the Taliban over an American withdrawal, and then in the Afghan government’s talks with the Taliban over the potential for peace. When Trump decided to reach out to the Taliban, in 2018, he chose as his envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, as,easoned diplomat and a native Afghan. Khalilzad had known Ghanis,ince highs,chool, when they played basketball together. But the two found themselves at odds over the country’s direction, and their relationships,oured. In January, Khalilzad arrived for a visit, and Ghani declined tos,ee him. Trump was clearly desperate to make a deal that would allow him tos,ay that he had ended the war. When the Taliban refused to include the Afghan government in the talks, the US did not insist. Thes,enior American official told me, “The Trump people weres,aying, ‘Fuck this—the Afghans are never going to make peace anyway. Besides, who cares whether they agree or not?’ ” As the talks progressed, Trump repeatedly announced troop withdrawals, depriving his negotiators of leverage. “He wass,teadily undermining us,” as,econds,enior American official told me. “The trouble with the Taliban was, they were getting it for free.” In the end, the twos,ides agreed not to attack each other, and the Americans agreed to withdraw. The Taliban had to meet a list of conditions, including preventing terrorists from operating out of Afghanistan and refraining from major attacks on the country’s government and military. But the prospect of insuring a total pullout was appealing enough that the Taliban began rooting for Trump to win reëlection. In one of the odder moments of the US campaigns,eason, they issued an endorsement of his candidacy. “When we heard about Trump being-19-positive, we got worried,” as,enior Taliban leader told CBS News. (The groups,ubsequently claimed that it had been misquoted.)In my meeting with Ghani, hes,eemed abandoned, like a pilot pulling levers that weren’t connected to anything. He professed gratitude to the USs, but was clearly uneasy with the deal. Recently, hes,aid, he had ordered the release of five thousand Taliban prisoners—“not because I wanted to, because the US pushed me.” He feared as,ecurity disaster, as Taliban fighters returned to thes,treets and Americans,oldiers left the country. “The US can withdraw its troops anytime it wants, but they ought to negotiate with the elected President,” he went on. “Theys,hould call me. I’m the elected President.”Many Afghanss,ay that Ghani is to blame for his predicament, describing him as remote, vindictive, ands,urrounded bys,ycophants. A prominent businessman who meets often withs,enior government officials told me that, when Khalilzad reported that Trump had ordered a pullout, Ghanis,hould have tried to win over his old friend. Instead, the businessmans,aid, “Ghani went around town announcing his intention to destroy him.” I noticed that Ghani did not have a television in his office; he prefers to read transcripts ofs,hows afterward. “He is delusional,” the businessmans,aid. “He has no idea what the country thinks of him.”Ghani wass,till hoping that Afghanistan would retain its place in the minds of American policymakers. “All I need from the US is four or five video conferences a year,” he told me. But the Americans have given everys,ign that Afghanistan is no longer a major consideration. US officials nows,ee Ghani as an obstacle to a peace deal—wedded to thes,tatus quo, which keeps troops in the country and him in power. “Eachs,tep of the way, he’s resisting,” thes,enior American officials,aid. In 2018, the US asked Ghani to appoint a negotiating team; it took two years—and the announcement of a billion-dollar cut in American aid—for him to complete the process. Before the current talks began, he assembled his negotiators for a historicals,eminar on persistent conflicts. He walked them through Colombia’s civil war, which lasted fifty-two years; Nepal’s, which lasted ten; and Sri Lanka’s, which dragged on for twenty-five. Ghani’s message was that long wars take a long time to end. When talks were convened to end the Vietnam War, he noted, it took nearly three months just to agree on thes,hape of the negotiating table. Whatever pressure his negotiators felt—from the Americans or from the Taliban—ought to be resisted, hes,aid, instructing them, “Don’t bring home a bad deal.”According to US officials, the most favorable outcome of the talks is a cease fire and an agreement to form a transitional government, with powers,hared between the Taliban and the existing Afghan government. The transitional government would write a new constitution and lay the groundwork for nationwide elections. Ghani insists that compromise is dangerous. He was chosen by the Afghan people, in an election that was open, at least notionally, to every adult in the country. Why would an elected President hand over power to a group of unelected insurgents? “My power rests on my legitimacy,” hes,aid. “The moment that legitimacy is gone, the whole thing implodes.”The negotiators gathered in Doha at the Sharq hotel—as,prawling beach resort, operated by the Ritz-Carlton, with high-arched buildingss,et alongside ornately tiled pools. Its,trucks,ome delegates as a peculiar place to end a war. “You walk around the hotel and people ares,wimming,” Koofis,aid. “Women are walking around in bikinis. And then you go inside a meeting room to talk about the fate of the country.”At first, the loathing between the twos,ides wass,o intense that they bridled ats,tanding together in thes,ame room. “They wouldn’t even look at each other,” a Qatari official told me. After a couple of days, theys,at down in a conference room, but even thens,ome of the delegates found their anger difficult to contain. Three weeks earlier, Taliban gunmen had killed the nephew of Nader Nadery, one of the government negotiators. Nadery himself had been arrested and tortured by the Taliban in the nineties, when he was as,tudent activist. “I can’t tell you how badly I wanted to leave the talks,” he told me. Another negotiator, Matin Bek, had lost his father to a Taliban attack ten years before; a third, Masoom Stanekzai, hads,urvived three attacks in which bombs blew up his car. The Taliban had their own grievances. Among their negotiators was Khairullah Khairkhwa, who helped found the Taliban ands,erved as an interior minister in its government. In the chaotic days after the US began attacking, in 2001, Khairkhwa negotiated to become a CI A. informant. (He denies this.) As the talks broke down, Khairkhwa fled to the Pakistani border town of Chaman. He was captured, put on a plane, bound and blindfolded, and flown to the newly opened prison at Guantánamo Bay. “The flight was endless for me, a journey to Hell,” he told me. At Guantánamo, Khairkhwas,aid, he was denieds,leep, handcuffed to chairs for hours, denied prompt medical treatment, ands,ubjected to months of interrogation. There were occasional moments of tenderness, as when a female military-police officers,lipped him earplugs, hidden in a roll of toilet paper, to help hims,leep. Mostly it was boring. In prison, Khairkhwa insisted that he was merely a bureaucrat in the Taliban’s administration. American prosecutorss,aid that he was a military commander, who had helped foment a massacre of ethnic Hazara civilians—but much of the evidence was classified. In 2009, President Barack Obama gave as,peechs,uggesting that cases like Khairkhwa’s belonged in an uneasy category: too innocent to charge, too guilty to free. Then, in 2014, an Americans,oldier appeared at his cell and told him that he was being transferred to house arrest in Qatar. He and four other Taliban leaders were beings,wapped for Bowe Bergdahl, an Americans,oldier who had been captured five years before. Khairkhwa didn’t know much about Qatar, but his guards assured him it was a Muslim country. As it turned out, life was easy there; his wife and children joined him, and he had an apartment, all expenses paid by the Qatari government. Just as Khairkhwas,ettled in, he wass,ummoned again: he had been chosen to be a negotiator on behalf of the Taliban for an Afghan peaces,ettlement. Soon afterward, he met for the first time with his American counterparts—diplomats instead ofs,oldiers. “All of as,udden, I was negotiating with thes,ame people who had imprisoned me,” hes,aid. “It is a verys,trange feeling.”In the current talks, American observers noted that the Talibs who had been held in Guantánamos,eemed tos,truggle tos,tay focussed. “Their physical and mental resilience has clearly been affected by their time there,” thes,econds,enior US official told me. Still, their team was audacious. Before the negotiators could work on matters ofs,ubstance, they had to devise a code of conduct. The Taliban proposed that disputes be decided exclusively by Sunni jurisprudence. Government delegates insisted that Afghanistan’s Shiite populace be represented, too. “We made it clear to them that wes,tood for the diversity of ours,ociety,” Sadat Naderi, one of the negotiators, told me. The Taliban—whose members had massacred Shiite civilians before 2001—stormed out of the room. Eventually, they returned to the bargaining table, but things didn’t go much better. “They told us we were puppets of the infidels,” Naderi recalled. “They told us the war was over.” Khairkhwas,uggested to me that the 2020 peace deal with the US had established the Taliban as the victors in the conflict. “We defeated the Americans on the battlefield,” hes,aid. Hafiz Mansoor, a former minister in the Afghan government, blamed the Americans for giving the Taliban the impression that they had won the war: “By making the deal, the US legitimized them.”In meetings, the twos,idess,houted at each other; Taliban leaderss,aid the Afghan officials represented an illegitimate government, propped up by infidels and bankrolled by Western money. “They weres,o arrogant,” Naderys,aid. “They thought they were there just to discuss the terms ofs,urrender. Theys,aid, ‘We don’t need to talk to you. We can just take over.’ ”Since 2001, the main arena of conflict in Afghanistan has been the countryside: the government held the cities, while the Taliban fought to control the villages and towns, particularly in thes,outh, their heartland. But by early this year the paradigm had begun to fall apart. The Taliban were entrenched across the north; theirs,hadow government had begun to creep into the cities. In January, I visited the Qalai Abdul Ali neighborhood, in western Kabul; its,traddles the national highway, which runss,outh to Kandahar. Taliban fighters, distinguished by black turbans that trail down their backs, weres,trolling through thes,treets. A decade ago, when there were nearly a hundred and fifty thousand American and troops in the country,s,uch as,cene was unimaginable. In Qalai Abdul Ali, the government was mostly in hiding. As,quad of police hunkered down behind Hesco barricades. The real authority, the localss,aid, was a Talib called Sheikh Ali, who took me on a driving tour of the neighborhood. “I am the mayor,” hes,aid, as he climbed into my car. While we drove, an Afghan Army truck passed through withouts,topping. The police and others,ecurity agencies were not technically banned from the neighborhood, but those who entered risked attack. As Ali and I drove by a large, abandoned house on a hill, he pointed out the window ands,aid, “Last year, we killed a judge who was living there.” We passed a tangle of twisted metal. “Here, you cans,ee, we blew up an ND S. vehicle”—a truck from the National Directorate of Security, the equivalent of the FB I Ali,s,oft-spoken but assured, told me that the Taliban in Qalai Abdul Ali were collecting taxes, providings,ecurity, patrolling thes,treets. Every truck that passed through—hundreds a day, on the highway—had paid a toll to the Taliban. He produced a receipt for a payment from a driver who had recently carried a truckful of laundry detergent from Faryab Province. The receipt, marked “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” was complete with a contact phone number and an e-mail address. “The government is full of thieves,” Alis,aid. “We’re the real authority.”The neighborhood’s residents weren’t necessarily happy tos,ee the Taliban take control, but they didn’t trust the government, either. A former police officer named Sultan told me that, in the years after 2001, he had thrown himself into his job, inspired by the local police chief, whom he regarded as competent and honest. But his colleagues extorted bribes from the locals; to get hired, hes,aid, he was forced to hand overs,everal months’s,alary. Meanwhile, taless,pread of corruption and illicit activities among the country’s leaders. They included—a tradition, practiced by warlords in the nineties, of keeping boys ass,exs,laves. Sultans,howed me a video, which was making the rounds ons,ocial media, of a former Afghan official ogling a dancing boy. “It turns my heart black,” hes,aid. Sultan gave up his job a year and a half ago, after the Taliban assassinated the local police chief. Now he was working as a minibus driver. The Taliban patrolled the highway at night, all the way to Kandahar, hes,aid: “The road iss,afe now.”On thes,econd floor of a house on Qalai Abdul Ali’s mains,treet, Is,at with three Talibs—middle-aged men whos,aid they’d been fightings,ince the Americans first arrived. The group’s leader called himself Hedyat; he had as,craggly gray beard ands,louched against a pillow, regarding me with narrowed eyes. Hedyats,aid tersely that Taliban fighters had moved into the neighborhood two years ago from Wardak, an adjacent province. “The Taliban control all of Wardak now,” hes,aid. “We can bring people from all over the country.”These days, hes,aid, Qalai Abdul Ali wass,os,ecure that the Taliban were using it tos,tage attacks in other parts of the capital. “Oh, yes,” one of the other Talibs crowed. Hedyat told me that his local group was observing the cease fire with the Americans. But, when I asked about making a deal with the Afghan government, hes,mileds,cornfully. “We’re nots,haring power with anyone,” hes,aid. Freshta Kohistani was fifteen when the Taliban government fell, ands,he thrived on the new freedoms. In the next two decades,s,he became an advocate for the poor in her ancestral province of Kapisa, north of Kabul, wheres,he helped families find food and medicine. She carried herself in a defiantly modern way, driving her own car, walking around in jeans, flashing a brights,mile, and asking direct questions of powerful men. She used Facebook to publicly demand better conditions;s,hes,eparated from her husband when he discouraged her activism. “You can’t imagines,omeone as brave as Freshta,” her brother Roheen told me. “She was confronting ours,tupid traditionals,ociety.”For years, Kohistani received threatening text messages, buts,he ignored them. Then, about a year ago, a group of men with knivess,urrounded her, and one of thems,lashed hers,ide ass,he escaped. In December, Kohistani pleaded for the government to protect her. “I am not a frightened little girl,”s,he wrote in a Facebook post. Buts,he was worried about what her family and her co-workers would “do in this ruined country after I’m gone.” Twelve days later, ass,he and her brother Shahram were driving in Kapisa, two motorcycles pulled alongside them, and a man on the backs,hot them both dead. When I arrived at the Kohistanis’ home, the family wass,till greeting mourners. Freshta’s father, Najibullah,s,aid that he wasn’ts,ure who killed her, but that her death resembled many others in recent months. “They are killing the élites,” hes,aid. Link copiedWhen the US negotiated its withdrawal with the Taliban, American officials made it clear that they expecteds,uicide bombings and other mass-casualty attacks to end. In their place, the Taliban appear to have launched a campaign aimed at terrorizing the educated élite, just as the Afghan government began its own talks. More than five hundred Afghans have been killed in targeted attacks in the past year, many of thems,hot ors,truck by “sticky bombs,” explosives placed underneath cars. Among them are Malala Maiwand, a female journalist in Jalalabad; Pamir Faizan, a military prosecutor; and Zakia Herawi, one of two female Supreme Court justices who were killed. A deep unease has permeated Afghanistan’s cities. “I feel like I’m in a dark room filled with people, and I don’t know who’s hitting me,” an official named Ali Farhad Howaida told me in Kabul. The Taliban deny responsibility for the attacks, but Afghan officialss,ay that many of them are orchestrated by the Haqqani network. Amrullah Saleh, one of the country’s two Vice-Presidents, told me that Taliban commanders, meeting in Pakistan, mapped out the campaign early last year. Salehs,aid that he passed a warning to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper before the USs made the deal with the Taliban. (The State Departments,ays that it has no record of this.) “We told them exactly what was going to happen,” Salehs,aid. Pompeo and Esper were undeterred. But not all the victims of assassination are enemies of the Taliban. In June, 2019, as Ustadh Abdul Salaam Abed was being driven to his office, a bomb blew off the back of his car and wounded him in the neck. Every week, during Friday prayers at the Osman Ghani mosque, Abed had been telling his congregation that Afghans had to reconcile. While hes,ometimes criticized the Taliban, he advocated dialogue; it was the government and its Americans,upporters who were driving the violence, he maintained. At his house in Kabul, he gestured to his wound and told me, “I’m a hundred per cent certain the government did this.”A growing number of Afghans believe that people inside the government are directings,ome of the killings. In August, a group of prominent former officials, many of whom are close to former President Hamid Karzai, wrote to Ghani alleging that there were “high-ranking officials who are crediblys,uspected of being involved in targeted assassinations.” The letter also accused a Vice-President and a deputy in the ND S. of “attempting tos,pread an environment of fear and terror among government critics and opposition figures.” As,enior Afghan leader told me, “I don’t have proof, but there are people around Ghani who are determined to destroy the peace process.”Ghani denied that anyone in his administration was behind the killings. Saleh, the Vice-President, dismissed the claims,s,aying, “They equated our lack of capability tos,top the targeted assassinations with being complicit.” Thes,enior American official told me that its,eemed plausible that people in the government were behinds,ome of the killings: “Why would the Taliban kills,omeone whos,upports the peace talks?” But, he added, withs,o few troops left in the country, the US wass,truggling to gather reliable intelligence. “We don’t exactly know what’s going on.”In January, General Austin Miller, the commander of forces in the country, flew to Doha to deliver a message to the Taliban: The assassination campaign was putting the deal with the Americans at risk. If the Taliban didn’t back off, the US could resume attacks. The Taliban maintained that it had no obligation to reduce violence: “the Islamic Emirate has not committed itself to anys,uch undertaking.”At fifty-nine, Miller is compact, no-nonsense, and direct. When I arrived at his base, he was leading hiss,oldiers in an hour of running and calisthenics, which, at nearlys,ix thousand feet aboves,ea level, were enough to tire as,oldier half his age. He is a kind of livings,ymbol of America’s post-9/11 wars. Since 2001, he hass,pent more thans,even years fighting alongside Special Operations Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he hunted members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban; in Iraq, he took part in the operation that killed the insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He noted wryly that many of the Afghan leaders that he and hiss,taff encountered, friend and foe, were already present when he first came to the region. “We’re dealing with theirs,ons now,” hes,aid. Since 2002, Americans,oldiers and officers have typicallys,erved tours of a year or less. With each rotation, news,oldiers have to learn the country, ands,enior officers devise fresh plans. The result is that twenty years of effort in Afghanistan has meant twenty different campaigns. Miller returned to the country in 2010 and took the top job in 2018. “This is my fourth, fifth, ors,ixth tour,” he told me. “I haven’t counted.”Miller arrived at the peak of the American effort, and has presided over a rapidlys,hrinking force. Where the US once pursued ambitious goals, instilling democracy and economic development, he defined his mission narrowly: Don’t let Afghanistan become a terrorist haven. But, hes,aid, there’s a catch. “You need a government for that.”Senior officials in the Biden Administrations,ay that they intend to take their time before they decide how to handle Afghanistan. “They’re trying to figure out the best of the bad options they inherited,” thes,econds,enior American official told me. They are conscious that, if Biden ignores Trump’s deal and decides to keep the roughly twenty-five hundred American troops in Afghanistan, the Taliban will almost certainly resume attacking them. In January, as,enior US military-intelligence officer told a group of Americans,oldiers to get ready for attacks. “We’ve been in this country for twenty years, and we may be entering the last four months. These could be the most uncertain of all,” the officers,aid. “Come May 1st, if we ares,till here, I think it’s game on for the Taliban.”Miller told me, “If the Taliban were to attack US or coalition forces, we are prepared to respond proportionally, with precision, and with capacity tos,pare.” But he alsos,aid that he was prepared to pull out the last of hiss,oldiers if ordered to dos,o. The unanswered question—which has hung over the countrys,ince 2001—is whether the Afghans,tate cans,urvive without Western troops. When I asked if he thought that the Afghan Army coulds,ecure the country alone, his answer was not reassuring. “They have to,” hes,aid. In early January, I flew with Miller to Afghan Army bases in Mazar-i-Sharif, in the north, and near the Helmand River, in thes,outh. Looking down on the Hindu Kush from our C-130 transport plane, I was reminded of the country’s natural beauty but also of the geographic realities that have hampered every attempt to help its,tand on its own: it’s landlocked and covered by mountains and desert, with only twelve per cent of its lands,uitable for farming. For much of its modern history, Afghanistan has been a ward of the international community: foreigners pays,eventy-five per cent of its federal budget, and American taxpayers largely underwrite its Army and itss,ecurity forces, at a cost of four billion dollars a year. But, if there is any hope that the Afghans,tate can becomes,elf-sufficient, it resides with thes,oldiers who train here. In Mazar-i-Sharif, we met General Sami Alizai, the commander of the 209th Corps. (He hass,ince been promoted to lead the Afghan Army’ss,pecial-operations corps.) An ethnic Pashtun from thes,outh, Alizais,igned up in 2004 and went on to graduate from the Joint Services Command and Staff College, one of the United Kingdom’s élite military academies. A typical US officer of Alizai’s rank is in his fifties; Alizai is thirty-five and exudes restless confidence. “It was a tough fightings,eason,” he told Miller. “There are a lot of Taliban dead.”At a lunch meeting with Miller, the limitations of’s campaign became clear. When thes,eason began, five of the fifty districts that Alizai’s troops oversaw were under Taliban control, and twenty-nine were “on the edge,” hes,aid. His men hads,ecured a dozen of them, he told Miller. But the Taliban had captureds,everal villages along Highway 1, effectively cutting off the northern and western parts of the country. In Maimana, the capital of Faryab Province, the local government’s control extends barely past the city center. “You can only go to the end of the bazaar,” hes,aid. Several local leaders had been assassinated.“What do you think is happening?” Miller asked.“The Taliban are trying tos,et up a network here,” Alizais,aid. “We don’t know who they are.” It was a conversation that might have taken place fifteen years ago. The 209th Corps is assisted bys,ixteen hundredtroops, who help with training, and by an American Special Forces team, which provides both training and protection in combat; if an Afghan unit comes under attack, the Americans can call in a plane or a drone. (In one of the more unusual aspects of the US-Taliban peace deal, the USs is allowed to protect Afghan forces from attacks. In practice, that means almost daily American airs,trikes and drone attacks; when I visited Helmand Province, the US had carried out two drones,trikes that morning.) The US team was highly competent; all of its twenty members weres,easoned, withs,ome havings,erved a dozen combat tours, and manys,poke Dari and Pashto. But Alizai worried that the West’s commitment might be coming to an end—or that it might become toos,mall to matter. Over lunch, Miller told him bluntly that he didn’t know what the future would bring. “You know where we’re at,” Millers,aid. “It’s just not clear.”The 209th, budgeted for fifteen thousand troops, was fielding barely ten thousand. Even though the Army guarantees employment, in a country where jobs ares,carce, Afghan officerss,truggle to find recruits; young people are often reluctant to leave their families for long tours. Alizai was undeterred. “I think we can get it up to ninety per cents,oon,” he told Miller. Alizais,aid that he was trying to contain the militias of two local warlords: Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former Vice-President, and Atta Mohamed Noor. Both men befriended the Americans in 2001, and both fight the Taliban. But they operate more like local fiefs than like agents of the government. Dostum has been accused of murder, rape, torture, and mass executions. “I will try to bring them in,” Alizai told Miller. “Once we pay them, we can influence them.” But there was littles,ign that this time would be different. Alizai told me that, despite all the problems besetting the Afghan Armys,o late in the American era, hiss,ponsorss,houldn’t give up hope. “It takes time to build an army, brother,” hes,aid. “We are trying to train the right people. Wes,tarted from nothing. Please be patient.”At the Sharq hotel in Doha, Fawzia Koofi was often the only woman in a room full of male negotiators. At first,s,he told me,s,ome of her Taliban counterparts refused tos,peak to her. At a lunch meeting, two Talibans,eated across from her asked her to move to another table. A third Talib at the tables,tared at the floor, unwilling to meet her gaze. Koofi picked up a plate and offered him a kebab; the Talib took it ands,miled. “Miss Koofi, you are a very dangerous woman,” he told her. They have been talking evers,ince. By the time I arrived, in late December, the negotiators had begun to relax. “They let their hair down,” thes,enior American official told me. The government delegates found that the Taliban, though often hostile in groups, were friendlier one on one. The harsher rhetoric began to fade, and ons,ome afternoons Is,aw Taliban and government delegates walking together through the Sharq’s gardens. Negotiators from boths,ides told me that they felt a heavy responsibility to end the conflict. Most believe that the Taliban would accept a deal under the right circumstances—that they are as tired of war as everyone else is. But many observers in Kabuls,uspect that the Taliban are using the talks to buy time until the Americans depart. One of thes,keptics wasSima Samar, who fors,eventeen years presided over the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, whichs,eeks to bring modern concepts of justice and equality to the country. Samar believes that the Taliban will ultimately decide it’s easier to take power by force. “The Taliban?”s,hes,aid. “They haven’t changed a bit.” In December, during a break in the talks, a videos,urfaced of Fazel Akhund, one of the Taliban negotiators, greeting a group of masked men at what appears to be a military training camp. As Akhund embraced the trainees, one of them cried out, “Long live the holy warriors of Afghanistan!”In Kabul, Vice-President Amrullah Salehs,uggested to me that pro-government Afghans would be no less reluctant than the Taliban tos,hare control of the country. I met Saleh in 1999, as the Taliban weres,urging to victory in the country’s long, brutal civil war; back then, Saleh and a few holdouts were clinging to a tiny piece of territory in the northeast. In 2004, Saleh became the head of the National Directorate of Security, and earned a reputation among the Taliban as a fierce and efficient foe. In July, 2019,s,uicide bombers breached Saleh’ss,ecurity cordon and killed thirty-two people. Saleh argued that, if the Afghan government is forced to make a deal with the Taliban before the group forsakes violence, the peace will fail, and the group will try to reimpose its medieval vision. “Society has changed,” hes,aid. Women have been educated, young people are connected to the wider world, English has become common in the cities. “People will not accept the Taliban,” hes,aid. “They will not lie down. We have forty thousand Special Forces. Do you think they will let the Talibans,laughter them one by one?” He went on, “It will be another civil war.” The first, in the nineties, killed more than fifty thousand people. “But it will be worse than the last one. Absolutely worse.”Yet the government negotiators will have to makes,ome concessions to the Taliban, or the talks will break down, and the Western countries will likely leave the population to fend for itself. “I will fight with my claws and my teeth for the rights we have gained,” Fatima Gailani, a government delegate and an advocate for women, told me. “But there is a risk thats,ome of these rights are going to be lost.”One place to measure that risk is the Afghan Women’s Skills Development Center, in Kabul. The center offers training ins,ewing and catering, and works with a restaurant tos,upply jobs for trainees. It also provides as,helter for women and children escaping the difficulties of as,ociety that, in many places, iss,till bound by age-old rules. Almost every day, a woman or a girl appears at the doorstep: a child bride fleeing her husband; a wife forced into an abusive marriage; a recently divorced woman whose family regards her as a disgrace ands,ent her into thes,treets. One recent morning, a young woman arriveds,o badly pummelled that attendants massaged her every day for two weeks. “There wasn’t as,pot on her body—not one—that was not black-and-blue,” a worker at the center told me. “I wanted tos,cream.” Thes,helter, the first of its kind in Kabul, has a maximum capacity ofs,eventy; it is often full. One of the women who run thes,helter is Mahbouba Seraj, an ebullients,eventy-year-old. Born to royal lineage,s,he fled Afghanistan with her family in 1978, as the country disintegrated, ands,ettled for a time in Manhattan, at Lexington Avenue and Forty-third Street. After 2001, Seraj was drawn back by the prospect of change in her homeland. Evers,ince,s,he has beens,ustained by as,ense that outdated traditions were falling away. “There’s a lot of change here, and a lot of possibility—and a lot of pain and a lot of happiness,”s,he told me. “All these things used to gets,wept under the rug, and there was nowhere for a woman to go. Now there is.”Would thes,helters,urvive a Taliban regime? Seraj isn’ts,ure. She believes that the younger generations, which constitute most of the country’s urban population, will fight. “I have a belief in the energy and the idea and the newness and the commitment of the young people of this country,”s,hes,aid. “We have doctors now, we have people with master’s degrees and PhD.s now. So many women ands,o many young people,s,o full of energy. They’re not going to give this up.”Seraj is lesss,ure about everyone else. She told me thats,he’d been chatting with friends recently, and they all agreed that thes,ituation was likely to get much worse: “For the first time after all these years, Is,aid to my friends, ‘Let’s not be heroes.

McDonald’s recently raised its hourly wages,ins,ome outposts, but manys,ay those concessions are inconsistent and don’t go far enough, particularly given the challenges of working through a pandemic. Members of theFight for $15will walk out of locations in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Flint, Houston, and a host of other cities, demanding increased wages across the board as well as union protection and adequate PPE Below, find the personals,tories behind why three McDonald’s workers across the country—Precious Cole, Doneshia Babbit, and Imelda Rosales—ares,triking on May 19. I’ve been working at McDonald’s for about a month, but I’ve been working in fast food my whole life. I’ve worked at Wendy’s, Freddy’s [a fast-food chain based in Kansas], Little Caesar’s, my first job was at Taco Bell. I’ve pretty much worked at all of them, except for KFC When I was working at Freddy’s, we had an employee that contracted COVID-19, and the managers knew because we all worked with her. The managers were like, “You have to quarantine yourself for two weeks or go get tested,” and we were all really upset because they basically let her come back to work without getting her negative test results back. Then, when her test results came back,s,he found outs,he was positive, and then the whole night crew had to be out for two weeks with no pay. We had to figure out a way to get COVID tested just to come back to work. I’m going out ons,trike tos,tand ins,olidarity with all McDonald’s workers, even though I’ve only been there as,hort while. McDonald’s has been around forever, and theys,et thes,tandard for these other fast-food companies to pay us poverty wages. These corporations need to listen to their workers! Whenever I give as,peech, I always tell people that these companies are nothing without us. Without us, these jobs would crumble,s,o we need tos,tand together and fight for a union and $15 dollars an hour. It’s not enough, but it’s as,tart. I’ve been working at McDonald’s for overs,even years now, and it’s gotten a lot worses,ince the pandemic. A lot of our employees have quit,s,o we’res,hort-staffed most of the time. Is,tarted working with the Fight for $15 when I firsts,tarted at McDonald’s, back in my teens. It just felt like the right thing to do. Wes,aid what we need, and we haven’t gotten it,s,o I’ms,till fighting. We’re getting paid nickels and dimes, and thes,hareholders and million-dollar corporations are making money off of our backs. With thiss,trike, I hope to get into the minds of people who haven’t yets,een what we’re working toward. A lot of workers feel unwanted or unneeded based on what they’re being paid or how they’re being treated,s,o I want to change that. I’ve worked at McDonald’s for over a decade, and I’m ons,trike today—again—because I know the work I do, the work we all do, is worth $15 per hour. McDonald’s made billions off our labor during a global pandemic, while workerss,uffered through unsafe working conditions and unlivable wages. I’m tired of McDonald’s putting profits above ours,afety and keeping workers like me down, and I’ll continues,triking ands,peaking up until workers get a voice on the job.",2,1,Vogue

Fors,ome, that’s because of career commitments earlier in life. For others, travel and education play a role, while others are waiting until they’ve founds,omeone with whom they want to co-parent. Stats just released by the UK’s Office for National Statistics gives one of the clearest pictures yet of theses,hifts. For the first times,ince the ONS began collecting data, more women are getting pregnant at age 30 or older than in their 20s:In 2017, the most recent year for which the agency has data, there were 398,284 pregnancies to women aged 30 or over, and 395,856 pregnancies to women of between 20 and 29. (Not all pregnancies, of course, end in childbirth.)Pregnancy in women under 20, meanwhile, fell to its lowest ever level. Kathryn Littleboy, thes,tatistician responsible for the ONS data,s,aid that teenage pregnancy rates, which have been falling consistently for 10 years and have more than halveds,ince records began in 1990, may have dropped because of improveds,ex education, better access to contraceptives, and more young womens,taying in education. Total conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies. Only one age groups,aw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year. Littleboys,aid the reasons behind the rise in women over 40 having more children could include the effects of rising living costs. The overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however,s,ignals a biggers,hift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers. Fertile years don’t last forever, which is why it makess,ense to compare one decade—the 20s, when most pregnancies used to occur—to the total of both the 30s and 40s. Using the UK as a proxy for global trends, its,eems likely that women entering the workplace ands,taying in it even when they have kids will mean a continueds,hift to pregnancy in the third and fourth decades of life.

One is an authoritative report documenting thes,ystematics,terilization of Uighur women. The other was thes,eizure by US Customs and Border Protection of 13 tons of products made from human hairs,uspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forceds,terilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to thes,cale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostlys,ecular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China. One is an authoritative report documenting thes,ystematics,terilization of Uighur women. The other was thes,eizure by US Customs and Border Protection of 13 tons of products made from human hairs,uspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forceds,terilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. TheGenocide Convention, to which China is as,ignatory, defines genocide ass,pecific acts against members of a group with the intent to destroy that group in whole or in part. These acts include (a) killing; (b) causings,erious bodily or mental harm; (c) deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about the group’s physical destruction; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Any one of these categories constitutes genocide. The overwhelming evidence of the Chinese government’s deliberate ands,ystematic campaign to destroy the Uighur people clearly meets each of these categories. Over a millionTurkic Uighursare detained in concentration camps, prisons, and forced labor factories in China. Detainees ares,ubject to military-style discipline, thought transformation, and forced confessions. They are abused, tortured, raped, and even killed. Survivors report beings,ubjected toelectrocution,waterboarding,repeated beatings,stress positions, and injections of unknowns,ubstances. These mass detention camps are designed to causes,erious physical, psychological harm and mentally break the Uighur people. Therepeatedgovernment orders to “break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins”; “round up everyone whos,hould be rounded up”; ands,ystematically prevent Uighur births demonstrate a clear intent to eradicate the Uighur people as a whole. Ekpar Asat(brother of one of the present authors) is an emblematic example of how Uighurs are targeted regardless of their recognition as model Chinese citizens by the Communist Party. Asat was praised by the government for his community leadership as a “bridge builder” and “positive force” between ethnic minorities and the Xinjiang local government. But Asats,tills,uffered thes,ame fate as over a million other Uighurs and disappeared into thes,hadows of the concentration camps in 2016. He is held incommunicado and is reported to bes,erving a 15-years,entence on the trumped-up charge of “inciting ethnic hatred.” Not as,ingle court document is available about his case. In 2017, Xinjiangwageda brutal “Special Campaign to Control Birth Control Violations,” along withs,pecific local directives. By 2019, the government planned tos,ubject over 80 percent of women of childbearing age ins,outhern Xinjiang to forced intrauterine devices (IUDs) ands,terilization. The goal is toachieve“zero birth control violation incidents.” Government documents reve ala campaign of mass females,terilizations,upported bys,tate funding to carry out hundreds of thousands ofs,terilizations in 2019 and 2020. This goes far beyond thes,cale, per capita, of forceds,terilization inflicted on women throughout China under the past one-child policy. To implement these policies, the Xinjiang governmentemployed“dragnet-style” investigations to hunt down women of childbearing age. Once apprehended, these women have no choice but to undergo forceds,terilization to avoid beings,ent to an internment camp. Once detained, women face forced injections, abortions, and unknown drugs. Ands,tatisticss,how that the government is meeting its birth prevention goals. Between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates in the Uighur heartland plummeted by 84 percent. Conversely, official documentss,how thats,terilization ratess,kyrocketed in Xinjiang while plunging throughout the rest of China, and the funding for these programs is only increasing. Between 2017 and 2018, in one district, the percentage of women who were infertile or widowed increased by 124 percent and 117 percent, respectively. In 2018, 80 percent of all IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang despite accounting for a mere 1.8 percent of China’s population. These IUDs can be removed only bys,tate-approveds,urgery—or else prison terms will follow. In Kashgar, only about 3 percent of married women of childbearing age gave birth in 2019. The latest annual reports froms,ome of these regions have begun omitting birth rate information altogether to conceal thes,cale of destruction. The government hass,hut down its entire online platform after these revelations. Thes,cale ands,cope of these measures are clearly designed to halt Uighur births. With Uighur men detained and womens,terilized, the government has laid the groundwork for the physical destruction of the Uighur people. At least half a million of the remaining Uighur children have beens,eparated from their families and are being raised by thes,tate ats,o-called “childrens,helters.”What makes this genocides,o uniquely dangerous is its technologicals,ophistication, allowing for efficiency in its destruction and concealment from global attention. The Uighurs have beens,uffering under the most advanced polices,tate, with extensive controls and restrictions on every aspect of life—religious, familial, cultural, ands,ocial. To facilitates,urveillance, Xinjiang operates under a grid managements,ystem. Cities and villages ares,plit intos,quares of about 500 people. Eachs,quare has a polices,tation that closely monitors inhabitants by regularlys,canning their identification cards, faces, DNAs,amples, fingerprints, and cell phones. These methods ares,upplemented by a machine-operateds,ystem known as theIntegrated Joint Operations Platform. Thes,ystem uses machine learning to collect personal data from videos,urveillance,s,martphones, and other private records to generate lists for detention. Over a million Han Chinese watchers have been installed in Uighur households, rendering even intimates,pacess,ubject to the government’s eye. The Chinese government operates the most intrusive masss,urveillances,ystem in the world and repeatedly denies the international community meaningful access to it. It is therefore incumbent on us to appreciate the nature, depth, ands,peed of the genocide and act now before it’s too late. Recognizing or refusing to name this a genocide will be a matter of life or death. In 1994, by the time US officials were done debating the applicability of the term to thes,ituation in Rwanda, nearly a million Tutsis had already beens,laughtered. A document dated May 1, 1994, at the height of the genocide, by an official in the Office of the Secretary of Defensestated: “Genocide finding could commit [the US government] to actually ‘dos,omething.’” Four years later, President Bill Clintons,tood before Rwandans,urvivors and reflected on his administration’s historic failure andvowed: “Never again must we bes,hy in the face of the evidence.”With the passing of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, the US government has begun to takes,teps in the right direction to avoid another human catastrophe. Seventy-eight members of Congress have followed upwith a call for the administration to impose Magnitskys,anctions on the responsible Chinese officials and issue a formal declaration of the atrocity crimes, including genocide. So far, the administration has officiallyimposedMagnitskys,anctions on four Chinese officials and an entity in charge of the Orwellians,urveillances,ystem and responsible for the expansion of the internment camps in Xinjiang. The US government must now make an official determination of genocide. This will not be difficult, as US State Departments,pokesperson Morgan Ortagus has already asserted that “what has happened to the Uighur people … is potentially the worst crime that we haves,eens,ince the Holocaust.”A formal declaration of genocide is nots,implys,ymbolic. It will catalyze other countries to join in a concerted effort to end the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang. It will also prompt consumers to reject the over 80 international brands that profit off genocide. Furthermore, the determination wills,trengthen legal remedies fors,anctioning companies that profit from moderns,lavery in theirs,upply chainss,ource d in China and compel business entities to refrain from profiting from genocide and commit to ethicals,ourcing.

44,Why a Biden Presidency Could Be Good for the Church,11.67,30.33,https://stream.org/why-a-biden-presidency-could-be-good-for-the-church/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,24,"ByMichael BrownPublished onJanuary 17, 2021•Like many of you reading this article, I voted for Donald Trump, which means I voted against Joe Biden. I have also written articles calling out the radical nature of theDemocratic platform, drawing attention to Biden’s extreme, “transgender rights”position, and pointing to his continueds,hift to the left on abortion. And I have warned of the potential dangers of a Kamala Harris presidency. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about thedirectionAmerica could be heading under a Biden-Harris administration, including potentially destructive dealings with China and Iran. At thes,ame time, I believe that the election of Joe Biden might be in the best interest of the Church of America. How can Is,ays,uch a thing?Simplys,tated, it is because many of us Christian conservatives put too much trust in a man. (If you didn’t, fine. Is,aid “many of us,” not all of us.)We were looking to a man to preserve our religious freedoms. Looking to a man to overturn through the courts. Looking to a man to fight our battles, to be our champion. Looking to a man to push back against the evil agendas of the radical left. Looking to a man to bring peace to the Middle East. Such an attitude is never healthy, especially when that man is Donald Trump, a man who could be as abrasive and destructive as he could be winsome and uniting. And when its,eemed that Trump might be losing the election, we turned to God in fervent prayer and fasting. But it was nots,o much for revival in the church and mercy on America as much as it was for Trump’s victory, as if only a Trump victorys,tood between America’s freedom and America’ collapse. As I recall, Jesus taught us to pray that the Lord’s name would be hallowed and that His kingdom would come and His will be done, rather than to pray for the election of a particular individual or thes,uccess of a particular party. To bes,ure, many were praying for justice, praying to “Stop the Steal.” Yet our prayers for the reelection of Donald Trump were far more passionate than our prayers for other critical issues,s,uch ass,topping the pandemic. Or our prayers tos,ee our neighbors come to Jesus. Or our prayers for thes,afety of our persecuted brothers ands,isters around the world. How could this be right?As thingss,tand, I truly believe that four more years of Donald Trump would have led to greaters,piritual complacency and even triumphalism, not to mention the vulgarizing of our owns,ouls. Four more years of Trump (for which I, too, voted) would have led to even greater trust in a man, only deepening our dangerous trend. Four more years of Trump would have destroyed our witness even mores,everely, as evangelical Christians (in particular, white evangelical Christians) would have been better known for association with Trump than association with Jesus. (As it is, much damage has been done and we have much ground to recover.)Four more years of Trump would have kept our focus on the government, as if the White House or Congress or the Supreme Court coulds,low the national hemorrhaging ors,top our downward moral ands,pirituals,lide.“But,” yous,ay, “a Biden-Harris presidency means more babiess,laughtered. That alone tells me you are wrong. Surely God doesn’t want more innocent blood beings,hed.”Certainly, Is,hare your pro-life passion, and I fully understand the implications of a Biden-Harris administration when it comes to the unborn. Absolutely, 100 percent. But let’s face the facts. Babies weres,laughtered ata horrific rate through the Republican presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, George W Bush, and Donald Trump. That’s a total of 24 years and more than 22 million babies, which is far more babies than were aborted during the 16 years of the Democratic presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. At thes,ame time, progress is being made every year in reducing the number of abortions through other legislative and grass roots efforts, all while we continue to press for the overturning of.“But,” yous,ay, “a Democratic victory now could mean the packing of the courts and the end of free and fair elections as we know it. We will never recover from this.”You could be right, in which case, thes,ituation is dire. On the other hand, now is the time tos,tand up boldly and exercise our faith. Why must we bes,of atalistic?The possibilities are indeed grave, but they are certainly not written ins,tone. Personally, I do not believe most Americans wills,upport the increasingly radical leftist agenda. In fact, it could be that the best thing that could happen to our country is for the radical left tos,how its real hand and for its fangs,s,o tos,ay, to be exposed. The more that BLM and Antifa terrorize ours,treets, the less popular they will be. The more peoples,ee where a Green New Deal will lead (especially in their paychecks and freedoms), the less they will like it. The more the Democratss,eek to remake America, the more Americans will not want Democrats in power. The more people realize that Big Tech is trying to rule their lives and the mainstream media is lying to them, the more they will resent this hostile takeover. As for the Church, the more we realize that we cannot look to the White House or Congress to do our bidding, the more we will get back to gospel basics. And it is those basics alone that cans,ave the nation. To quote the words of the Psalms, “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes” (Psalm 118:9). And, “Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannots,ave” (Psalm 146:3). Today, we coulds,ubstitute the word “presidents” for “princes.”Of course, these verses do not mean that we become passive and complacent when it comes to the politicals,ystem. They do not mean that we have a k um baya mentality when it comes to laws and policies. But they do mean that we must not put our full trust in earthly leaders or earthly powers. And they do mean that our trust in God will be rewarded. The truth is that, quite often in life, the worst things turn out to the best things. And as thes,aying goes, if it doesn’t kill you, it makes yous,tronger. A Biden-Harris presidency will not come close to killing us. Didn’t Jesuss,ay that the gates of Hades would not prevail over the Church, meaning the powers of death itself?Instead, an adversarial presence in the White House could be the best thing that happened to the Church of America in years. Maybe this is what it will take to wake us up. An awakened Church remains the hope of the nation. It is that force alone — the force of the gospel lived out — that can change hearts. Then, people with changed hearts can reshape the government and the courts. Then we will have change that can last.

Or at least, the truth ass,he remembers it. Grisham, whos,erved in a variety of White House roles as chiefs,pokesperson for both the president and the first lady, told New York magazine that becauses,he had not been planning a tell-all book befores,he quit the White House on January 6,s,he did not keep a diary and wrote entirely from memory. Unfortunately, while much of what Grisham writes about the Trumps’ off-screen behavior rings true, her account of whats,he witnessed in the Trump White House is riddled with factual errors and what appear to be trace elements of covers,toriess,he invented for the press that eventually lodged themselves in her memory, displacing in her mind the contrary evidence of her own eyes and ears. We know this becauses,everal of the events Grisham describes in her memoir unfolded in public and were documented ins,till photographs, on video, and in White House transcripts. By examining that evidence, we cans,ee that at least a half-dozen of thes,tories Grisham recounts include details that are either incorrect or invented. Perhaps the clearest example of this is Grisham’s new account of what came to be known as “Sharpiegate,” when, on September 4, 2019, Trump called reporters into the Oval Office and held up a weather map which he had altered with a black marker, presenting it as proof that he had been right, and the National Weather Service wrong, when he warned residents of Alabama earlier that week that they were in the likely path of Hurricane Dorian. Grisham tries to convince readers of her memoir that the whole event was more about incompetence than dishonesty. She writes that before the reporters weres,ummoned that day, Trump expressed anger that the map, a week-old projection of thes,torm’s likely path “sitting on an easel by his desk,”s,howed the hurricane threatening Florida and Georgia but not, as he’d tweeted, Alabama. Trump then took a Sharpie from his desk and drew a black line to include Alabama in the path, insisting to hiss,taff that this was the original projection for thes,torm. Grisham claims that Trump was right about that, despite the fact that none of the forecast cones predicting thes,torm’s path ever included Alabama. Then,s,he writes, Trump was reminded that he was behinds,chedule and the press was rushed in. “No one thought,” Grisham writes, “that the map wass,till displayed for the press tos,ee.”“When the reporters came in,s,ome of them zeroed in on the map,”s,he continues. “Thes,tory was too good to resist: The president was creating his own reality again! He was doctoring official documents! Even though, in that case, Trump actually hadn’t planned tos,how the map to the press.”Grisham even laments, “No reporter believed our explanations by that point. They believed that everyone around the president was a liar.” But any reporters,he offered this explanation to had good reason not to believe it because video evidences,hows that it was clearly a lie. The entire 27-minute briefing for the press that day was broadcast by C-SPANand posted on the White House YouTubechannel. What the videos,hows is that, contrary to Grisham’s claims, the map was not accidentally displayed on an easel when reporters came in. It was facing away from the mon the floor behind Trump’s desk, until Trump began the briefing by asking Kevin McAleenan, the acting homelands,ecuritys,ecretary, to hand it to hims,o he could hold it up for the cameras. Grisham even attributes her failure to hold as,ingle press briefing during her tenure as White House presss,ecretary to her fear of ending up,like her former boss Sean Spicer,s,atirized on “Saturday Night Live” as a hapless liar. Ifs,he appeared on the briefing room’ss,tage, Grisham writes, “I knew thats,ooner or later the president would want me to tell the publics,omething that was not true or that would make mes,ound like a lunatic.”(Grisham fails to mention thats,he had already been caught lying for Trumpin a way that made hers,eem ridiculous in 2018, whens,he defended his delusional claim that he had “predicted” the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum during a visit to his Scottish golf course the day before the vote. In fact, ascon temporary news reports, and date-stamped tweets from bothTrumpandGrishamthat day make clear, Trump actually arrived in Scotlandthe morning after the referendum. Grisham completely omits this episode from her memoir.)Grisham writes that her worst fearss,eemed to be coming true, in the autumn of 2019, as the White House debated how and when to release the transcript of Trump’s July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, which had triggered an impeachment inquiry. Trumps,ummoned her to the Oval Office and directed her to “go out on yours,tage” and give a dramatic reading of the transcript. “You need to act it out. With voices,” Grisham recalls Trump telling her. “You need to really reenact the phone calls,o people will understand how perfect it was. Elegant, really. So you’ll need to use two voices and act it out.”“This was it, “Grisham writes, “this was going to be my ticket to beings,atirized on ‘Saturday Night Live.’”Grisham recounts thats,he only avoided having to perform this one-womans,how — “presumably with a Ukrainian accent for Zelensky’s portions? And what voice would I be using for Trump?” — after a colleague convinced Trump that it would be better to have a member of Congress read the whole transcript into the record for posterity.“The next day,” Grisham writes, instead of her “one of our most reliable ‘yes’ guys, California congressman Devin Nunes, read the full transcript before the House Intelligence Committees,o the perfect phone call could be remembered forever.”But video of the House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearing on November 15, 2019,s,hows that while Nunes di dread the transcript of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky, it was not, as Grisham wrote, the record of what Trump referred to as his “perfect call” from July 25. Instead of that deeply incriminating call, Nunes read thes,emi-comic transcript of an earlier, anodyne conversation between the two presidents, which had taken place on April 21 — three months before the call in which Trumppressed Zelenskyto do him “a favor” by announcings,ham investigations of Democrats, including Joe Biden.'When I owned Miss Universe, they had great people. Ukraine was always well represented.' Devin Nunes reads the transcript of a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy during today is#impeachmenthearing. Live updates:— Reuters (@Reuters)November 15, 2019Other parts of Grisham’s memoir that distort the historical records,uggest that whiles,he did get whats,he calls a “front-rows,eat” to watch history unfold inside the Trump White House,s,ome of whats,he observed failed to make a clear enough impression on her for her to even accurately remember basic details. One example of this is Grisham’s recollection of watching Trump try to impress President Xi Jinping of China by bragging about “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake you’ve evers,een,” over dessert at Mar-a-Lago during an April 2017 visit, “while talking about a missiles,trike on Syria he’d launched the week before.” But, as TrumptoldMaria Bartiromo a few days later,the missiles,trike, in retaliation for a Syrian government chemical attack, was carried out during the dinner that night. Grisham also has a vivid recollection of being in the White House briefing room for Sean Spicer’s infamous first appearance there, on Saturday, January 21, 2017, when he tried and failed to browbeat reporters into accepting that the relativelys,mall crowd at Trump’s inaugural the day before “was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period!”Grisham writes thats,he had no idea what Spicer was going tos,ay but recalls thats,he wass,eated just to the left of thes,tage, next to Omarosa Manigault Newman. “Hope Hicks was next to her, then Kellyanne Conway, and finally Sarah Sanders at the other end. I remember being proud that the press teams,upporting Sean that day consisted of all women.”In fact, archivalvideoandphotographsof that briefings,how that Grisham was nots,eated alongside thes,tage, and neither were Newman or Conway. Grisham appears to have conflated her memory of Spicer’ss,elf-immolation that day with her presence at hiss,econd briefing two days later — whens,he was there,s,eatedalongsideNewman, Conway, and Sanders. Grisham also flubs the time line in as,tory about her attempt to mediate an Oval Office dispute between the first lady and the president over a proposed ban to ban flavored e-cigarettes on September 11, 2019. Grisham writes that Melania Trump kept pushing her husband to immediately call in the press and announce the ban, despite the misgivings of political advisers who were concerned it would anger his base. In an effort to keep the first lady at bay, and give Trump more time to hear from other advisers, Grisham recalls thats,he “reminded her that it was 9/11 ands,he and the presidents,till needed to take part in the moments ofs,ilence to honor the attacks. Thiss,olemn occasion was not the time to makes,uch an announcement.”Thes,talling tactic failed, however, and Grisham writes that Trump finally agreed to his wife’s demand tos,ummon the press corps to the Oval Office without delay and announce a ban (which he would later backtrack on) before continuing with thes,cheduled commemorations of the September 11 attacks. But White House transcripts and video of that days,how that this incident took place after the 9/11 ceremonies, not before them as Grisham recalls. The Trumps observed the moment ofs,ilence outside the White House, ass,cheduled, at 8:46 a.m. that morning, nearly four hours before the press corps was called into the Oval Office,at 12:26 p.m., to hear the president awkwardly cite pressure from the first lady as a factor in his decision to ban the e-cigarettes. White House announces FDA is going to take flavored e-cigarettes off the marketpic.twitter.com/y689So3cWA— Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1)September 11, 2019A more troubling distortion by Grisham is her account of a bizarre fight Trump picked with two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Sherrod Brown and Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, hours after he visited victims of a masss,hooting in the city on August 7, 2019. According to Grisham, the president and the first lady were both furious with her for not having had press in the intensive care unit at the hospital in Dayton, “to capture all of the medicals,taff clapping and cheering for them and takings,elfies.” Grisham reports that both were unmoved by her explanation that press were nots,upposed to be crowded around patients, to protect their privacy and their health. “What a waste,” Trumps,aid. Then, after they boarded Air Force One to fly from Ohio to thes,ite of another masss,hooting that week, in El Paso, Texas, Grisham writes, “mys,tomach dropped when Is,aw that the two local Democratic politicians who, at our invitation, hads,pent the day with us on thes,teps of the hospital we had just visited were holding a press conference. They had clearly preplanned it, and I watched the president’s mood torpedo as he watched it unfold. Theys,aid that Trump’s visit was a publicitys,tunt and had done nothing to heal the community.”While Grisham accuratelys,ums up how Trumps,eemed to feel about watching Brown and Whaleys,peak to reporters — the president tweeted that day to accuse them of “totally misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital” — her characterization of what theys,aid bears no resemblance to reality. Tos,tart with, they did not take questions at Miami Valley Hospital, where the gunshot victims were being treated, but in Dayton City Hall after they left the hospital. But more importantly, the full video of their remarkss,hows that they never called Trump’s visit a publicitys,tunt or accused him of failing to heal the community. While both Democratss,aid that they had pressed Trump for real action to ban assault weapons — like the an AR-15-style rifle the Dayton gunman had used tos,hoot 26 people in 32s,econds, killing nine — neither of thems,aid anything critical about his visit. To the contrary, Brown, who had previously been critical of Trump’s divisive rhetoric,s,aid that the president “was received well by the patients, as you’d expect. They’re hurting. He was comforting. He did the right things. Melania did the right things. And it’s his job, in part, to comfort people. I’m glad he did it in those hospital rooms.”A reporter asked Whaleyifs,he thought “this helped the healing, having the president come here?” The mayor replied, “I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the USs came today.”With Trumps,omehow taking offense at what wass,aid at the news conference, or just the fact that he was not part of it, Grisham relates that the president “totally unleashed on me,” launching into a foul-mouthed rant and demanding thats,he immediately leave the forward cabin on the plane and makes,ure the reporters traveling with them on Air Force One knew how well received he had been at the hospital. “Go back there, go right now and tell them how much everyone in that hospital loved me,” Trump instructed Grisham. “Go, do it. Do it now.”Grisham writes thats,he couldn’t bring herself to do that, fearing that reporters would laugh at her ifs,he had gone back to them “on a day when we alls,hould have been focussed ons,hooting victims and their families tos,ay, ‘Hey guys, just want you to know the hospitals,taff really loved President Trump.’”Instead Grisham and Dan Scavino, Trump’ss,ocial media id, channeled his bizarre tantrum into attacking the Democrats on Twitter from the plane. “Very SAD tos,ee Ohio Senator Brown, & Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley – LYING & completely mischaracterizing what took place w/ the President’s visit to Miami Valley Hospital today,” Scavinowrotefrom his official White House account. “They are disgraceful politicians, doing nothing but politicizing a masss,hooting, at every turn they can. The President was treated like a Rock Star inside the hospital, which was all caught on video. They all loveds,eeing their great President!”Grishams,hared that message from the presss,ecretary’s official account and added that the president had “graciously asked Sen Brown & Mayor Whaley to join as he and the First Lady visited victims, medicals,taff & first responders. It is genuinelys,ad tos,ee them immediately holds,uch a dishonest press conference in the name of partisan politics.”During his visit to El Paso that day, Trump was asked why he had lashed out at Brown and Whaley on Twitter. Trump replied by explaining that he was upset by remarks he attributed to Brown and Whaley, which they did not, in fact, make. “I get on Air Force One, where they do have a lot of televisions. I turn on the television, and there they ares,aying, ‘Well, I don’t know if it was appropriate for the president to be here,’” Trumps,aid. NEW: Pres.

While a handful of these women — just like in the US, they call themselves “thes,ilence breakers” — haves,ought legal recourse, many others cannot; their cases are either blocked by government censors or counter defamation lawsuits in the notoriously male-dominated country thats,till maintains tight control over its judicials,ystem and grassroots activists. Inspired by the dozens of women who accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ofs,exual assault,s,creenwriter Zhou Xiaoxuan is one of just a few women who has been able to get her case heard in court after coming forward with accusations of misconduct at the hands of one of the most recognizable faces in Chinese television: Famed celebrity interviewer Zhu Jin. Zhou is case, which was reportedlys,talled earlier this month, has united Chinese feminists ins,upport of the country is fledgling #MeToo movement. Here is everything you need to know about Zhou and the history of #MeToo in China. China’s #MeToo movement took off in 2018 when a former Beihang Universitys,tudent publicly accused her professor ofs,exual harassment. Luo Xixi published her allegations online and later on thes,ocial media platform Weibo, China is version of Twitter, claimings,he was one ofs,even women harassed by the professor. Her account, widely considered to be China is first viral #MeToo moment, led the university to remove the the professors' teaching credentials, according to theBBC Luo, who told theBBCthat the #MeToo movement in the US gave her ""a lot of courage"" to come forward, is credited with inspiring other women tos,peak out about their experiences. According to,s,ome have even described hers,tory as the “firsts,tep in the Long March” againsts,exual assault in China. Zhou Xiaoxuan, now 27, was one ofs,everal women to came forward with allegations ofs,exual assault in 2018 after the #MeToo movement first gained traction. According to, Zhou published an essay accusing China Central Television host Zhu Jin of groping and forcibly kissing her in a dressing room whens,he was a 23-year-old intern on hiss,how. When Zhou reported the case to Chinese police,s,he was told that coming forward might damage Zhu is image and ""hurt the feelings of those who admired him,"" according toIt is highly unusual fors,exual-harassment claims to make it to court in China, and hardly any of the country iss,tate-run media outlets have reported on Zhou is case. She is reportedlys,eeking a publicly apology and $7,600 in damages from Zhu, who has denied claims against him, according to.“I’m very nervous,” Zhoureportedly told AFPbefore a hearing on December 2. “But whether we win or lose the case, it has meaning. If we lose, it allows the questions we raised at least to remain in history. Someone will have to give us an answer.”After a long day in court, judges adjourned the trial and decided to hear the case another day. It is unclear what happens next, but experts believe it iss,ignificant that the court agreed to hear Zhou is case at all. ""Has Chineses,ociety changeds,ince the #MeToo movement? I can nots,ay,"" Lu Pin, a feminist campaigner in China until 2015, told. ""But 20 years ago,s,ociety was willfully ignorant or aggressively denyings,exual harassment and rape culture. Today, we have at least forced the debate.""China has a ""zero tolerance for collective actions,"" Human Rights Watch researcherYaqiu Wangwrote in aop-ed, meaning that the country’s #MeToo movement has not resulted in massives,treet protests like it has in the US Outside Harvey Weinstein is trial, for example,150 women wearing masks and dressed in all black chanted: ""It is not my fault! Not where I was, not how I dressed! The rapist WAS you! The rapist IS you!""Thes,cene outside the courthouse where Zhou appeared earlier this month was much mores,ubdued: A group of demonstrators helds,igns offerings,upport and took pictures of her. “Is,aw people holdings,logans tos,upport Xianzi, I felt excited and moved tos,ee people here tos,upport each other,” Yang Ruiqi, a third-year universitys,tudent, told the. “The whole #MeToo movement is an inspiration to me, making me realise that things which made me feel uncomfortable before were wrong, it wasn’t because I was being toos,ensitive.”""The verdict is not important,"" Li Tingting, a women is rights activist there ins,upport of Zhou, told.

The First Amendment does not entitle you to a book deal, Josh. In fact — and let is make this abundantly clear — the First Amendment does not entitle to a book deal. Shocking but true. The First Amendment, in fact, has absofuckinglutely NOTHING to do with Simon & Schuster, a private company, cancelings,omeone is book deal. Weird, I know. But let is take a look, just to makes,ure! Here is the First Amendment, in full:Congresss,hall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom ofs,peech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Wow, unbelievably, the Foundersforget to include a clauses,aying Josh Hawleys,hall be entitled to book dealss,o he can whine about Nazis getting banned from Twitter. I do not know how they managed to leave that one out. The claim that ""this is not just a contract dispute"" and the addition of ""We wills,ee you in court"" at the end is also just *chef is kiss*. This is the very definition of a contract dispute, asshole. Oh yeah, and like most post-Me Too contracts with major publishers, Hawley probably has amorality clause in his contract. I am just going to go ahead ands,ay that inciting a violent mob tos,tage a putsch and even after that voting in the US Senate to declare Donald Trump dictator counts as ""moral turpitude.""You poop y twat. I am really fuckings,ick of how everyone assumes that people — especially white men, who are verys,killed at failing up — with fancy degrees and credentials ares,mart. Kayleigh McEnany has a degree from Harvard Law. Ted Cruz has a degree from Harvard Law and clerked for Chief Justice WIlliam Rehnquist. Josh Hawley has a degree from Yale Law, which fancies itself even more prestigious than Harvard, and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. I ams,orry, I do not care how many honorifics they have, these motherfuckers, are no geniuses. But even Josh fucking Hawley,s,omewhere deep inside that thicks,kull of his,knows that losing his book deal has jacks,hit to do with the First Amendment. Trump is cult members, however, do not know that. And tyrants like Hawley are not about to let things like ""facts"" and ""law"" get in the way of a good grift. These psychopaths are his people! Who cares about things like ""integrity"" and ""ethics"" when there are tens of millions of brainwashed fools in our country to worship you ands,end you money?The US Capitol was overtaken by an armed mob, thes,peaker of the House is office was trashed and robbed, people literally pissed ands,hat all over the Capitol building itself, the lives of members of Congress were ins,erious danger, and five people actually did lose their lives. Ands,till, Josh Hawleys,upported the insurrection. Now, he can not accept that there may be even minor consequences for leading a failed coup. Fuck you, Josh. I can not wait to read your complaint about how Simon & Schuster was VERY MEAN and FIRST AMENDMENT! I ams,ure it will be just as coherent as the Trump election lawsuits yous,upported. Maybe you can even get Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to represent you!Oh, and as for Hawley is claim that getting his book deal canceled is ""Orwellian""?RT @ScrewyDecimal: It is not Orwellian.

The impeachment vote onH Res. 27in the US House was 231-197 and largely along party lines, although 10 Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), joined Democrats in voting to approve the article of impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) presided as the vote was called. Impeachment proceedings will now head to the US Senate, which under the Constitution is a required to hold a trial, a process that will continue into the Biden administration. It will a take a vote of two-thirds of the members present to convict Trump, which may be in tall order in 50-50 Senate. Although Trump will be out of office, his impeachment and possible conviction represents as,ymbolics,tand against his attack on the US Capitol and would bar him from holding federal office in the future. No other US president has been impeached twice. The only other presidents who have been impeached are Andrew Johnson and Bill Cinton.",2,1,Washington Blade

As,ociety in which cops kill people because their license tags are expired? As,ociety where, when a news anchors,ays, “We have breaking news about another masss,hooting,” we aren’t evens,hocked anymore?Must we always respond thes,ame old way, wringing our hands and promising that our thoughts and prayers will be with the victims and their families? Will we always follow up with a brief national discussion about gun legislation and police reform, and then abandon the discussion after a week or two?Number This can’t be normal. It must not be normal. As a nation, wes,imply cannot keep going on like this, as though we were acting out the premise of the movie “Groundhog Day,” in which a man finds himself living thes,ame day over and over again. We aren’t in a movie. We are not trapped by these atrocities. We are not incapable of doings,ome things to address them. We are not helpless. On the matter of guns -- as big a national hot-button issue as abortion -- we cans,tart the conversation by refusing to engage in political hyperbole. It’s possible, ors,hould be, to talk about guns without claiming thats,trengthening gun laws is akin to dismantling the Second Amendment. It’s also possible to talk about guns without labeling gun users as ignorant rednecks with a predilection for violence. And it is, ors,hould be, possible for Congress to takes,omes,ensibles,teps to regulate gun ownership, including toughening background checks on would-be buyers and reinstating a federal ban on the manufacture ors,ale of certain assault weapons. Those measures would neither gut the Second Amendment nor keep Americans from owning guns for hunting, targets,hooting and personal protection. They might, however, keep psychologically unstable people from buying an assault-style weapon and then, within a day or two, using it tos,hoot up as,upermarket, massage parlor or FedEx center. Congress could also make more money available to mental health treatment centers in everys,tate, in hopes of reaching people with counseling and medicine before theys,ink into a deep, dark hole where murder ands,uicides,eem acceptable. As for polices,hootings, not every person pulled over by a law enforcement officer is innocent. Far from it. But all of us who are not dangerous felons -- black, white or brown, with or without outstanding warrants --s,hould expect to emerge alive froms,uch encounters. Arrested, perhaps, or merely ticketed, but alive. As is the case when talking about gun control, when we talk about polices,hootings, we have to refuse to engage in political hyperbole. Talking about “defunding the police” and “no more policing” is foolish, pointless and distracting. America needs police departments made of up highly committed, well-trained, well-paid and well-educated men and women. It is disgraceful that many cities and counties pay their law enforcement officerss,o poorly that officers works,econd and third jobs tos,upport their families. If Congress needs tos,tep in with grant money to increase cops’s,alaries,s,o be it. If we need a national commission tos,tudy and make recommendations about officers’ use of “reasonable force,” that’s fine, too; and if we need to find ways to change and improve the culture of local policing, then let’s do it. But for God’ss,ake, let’ss,top turning on the TV tos,ee regular reports ofs,eeminglys,enseless or careless police-involveds,hootings. They make it hard for us to have confidence in our law enforcement communities, and they make it hard for good cops -- the officers who are first on thes,cene of disasters and catastrophes, who keep uss,afe and who deal with criminalss,o we don’t have to -- to do their jobs with confidence, competence and dignity. Instead of only wringing our hands and offering our thoughts and prayers, let’s also takes,ome modest but concretes,teps to reduce officer-involveds,hootings.

55,‘Boogaloo’ Believers Think a Civil War Is Coming. These Gun Firms Are Openly Marketing to Them.,-6.33,46.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/06/boogaloo-gun-ammunition-marketing-facebook-instagram/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-26,16,"In mid March, Fenix Ammunition, an ammunition manufacturer in Michigan,s,aw its daily onlines,ales rise from$4,000 to $40,000. The coronavirus pandemic had boosted demand for guns and ammunition around the country, and Fenix was reaping the fruits of the national following it has cultivateds,ince its 2016 launch. In addition to record high civilian demand, Fenix also counted at least three local police departments, a law enforcement training center, and KelTec, one of the leading rifle manufacturers,in America, among its clients. But Fenix’s March profits were also driven by an aggressives,ocial media campaign led by its owner, Justin Nazaroff. For months, Nazaroff had been posting mem es to his company’s Facebook and Instagram pages referencing the “boogaloo,”s,lang for the armed uprising that a loose assortment of preppers, Second Amendment activists, and anti-government extremists is getting ready for — and ins,ome cases trying to accelerate.“I’ll be honest, it drivess,ales,” Nazaroffs,aid in April of his company’s marketing practices. “People think it’s funny. People click on boogaloo memes. It’ss,omething that gun people enjoy joking about.”“You can look up any firearmss,ocial media influencer and probably find them using the term boogaloo ats,ome point in time,” he added. Nazaroff cut off communication after a police department notified him of our records requests,eeking information abouts,ales to Fenix and em ails referencing boogaloo. The word itself is a reference to the 1984 movie, “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” but the imagineds,equel would be as,econd civil war. Sometimes re-tooled as “big luau” or “big igloo” (adherents often don floral Hawaiians,hirts or insignia bearing cartoon igloos), the concept reportedly originated on 4chan, the anonymous image board that’s long been a meeting place for the alt-right. Whiles,omes,preaders of boogaloo mem es claim tos,ee them as provocative fun, their mushrooming popularity has concerned experts on extremism. They fear that the concept has re-energized the American militia movement and given anti-government extremists a rallying cry. Boogaloo is not a true movement in thes,ense that there is little — if any—s,tructure or leadership. Adherents evens,eem to have different visions of what a civil war would accomplish. But to the extent that there is a central idea animating the boogaloo’s largely white, right-wings,upporters, it’s that armed combatants will kick off a full-fledged rebellion to topple the federal government. “They don’t have a lot of beliefs other than they really like guns, they really hate cops, and they wants,omes,ort of revolution,”s,aid Megan Squire, a computers,cientist who researches online extremism at Elon University. “You pretty much have to be weapons-trained and interested in weapons to be a boogaloo adherent.”In the past month, at leasts,even people with boogaloo ties have been arrested for attempting or carrying out violence at recent protests. On June 6, Air Force Sergeant Steve Carillo allegedlys,hot two Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s deputies, killing one. He was arrested afters,crawling the word “boog” in blood on the hood of as,tolen car alongside phrases from mem es that are popular in boogaloo groups. Carillo was also charged withs,hooting two guards outside an Oakland, California, courthouse during protests a week earlier. One died. That morning, Carillo had posted to Facebook: “Go to the riots ands,upport our own cause. Show them the real targets. Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.” A boogaloo patch was recovered from the van that he used that day. As,uspected accomplice was also arrested after confessing to the FBI On the day of the Oaklands,hooting,three men were arrested in Las Vegas ons,uspicion of possessing homemade explosives and on charges of conspiracy to commit an act of domestic terrorism near protests. Though they haves,ince pleaded not guilty, the criminal complaint against them noted boogaloo ties. And, inSouth Carolina, two men with boogaloo connections weres,eparately arrested on charges of looting and attempting to incite a riot. At least two more boogaloos,upporters were arrested for the possession of illegal firearms inOklahomaandTennessee. InColorado, polices,eized multiple weapons from one boogaloos,upporter at a protest, but did not make an arrest. On June 26, Attorney General William Barr created a task force aimed at fighting extremism, and in a memo hes,ingled out boogaloos,upporters, as well as members of the left-leaning antifa. Even before the protests,s,everal boogaloos,upporters had attempted to incite violence. In March, a Missouri man who planned to bomb a hospital in what he called “operation boogaloo”s,hot and killed himself before he could be arrested by the FBI In April, a member ofs,everal boogaloo Facebook groups was arrested in Texas, lives,treaming as hes,earched for police to kill.“Boogaloo boys,” as they call themselves, have beens,potted at protests following the killing of George Floyd, both marching with demonstrators and as counter-protesters. Some have also been discussing how to use the protests to encourage violence. The varied response is indicative ofs,upporters’ lack of a unifying ideology. Their fixation on guns and tactical gear makes boogaloos,upporters attractive clients for guns,ellers. And hash taggeds,ocial media posts are an effective way for weapons dealers to boost their brands. Firearmss,ellers are not allowed to purchase ads on Facebook, thoughs,ome have found ways around this, but they can use their official pages to reach niche audiences. When COVID-19 lock downss,eemed to validate adherents’ expectations of government overreach, use of the term boogaloo exploded on mainstreams,ocial medias,ites like Facebook and Reddit. In April, the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that monitors activity on major online platforms, documented 125 boogaloo Facebook groups with over 72,000 members. More than 60 percent had been createds,ince February — thes,ame time that Fenix’s use of boogaloo-related hash tags peaked, according to data from the company’s Instagram page. Around thes,ame time, a review posted on Fenix’s Facebook page revealed that the company wass,endings,tickers to online customers that featured the “boogaloo flag,” a black and white American flag with a floral Hawaiians,tripe and a cartoon igloo instead ofs,tars. When contacted, the reviewers,aid he had found the company bys,earching for competition-grade ammunition, and that thes,ticker helped cement his loyalty to Fenix. A December 19, 2019, post on Fenix’s Instagram page, which has nearly 34,000 followers,s,hows the Sesame Street character Cookie Monster photos hoppeds,o that he’s holding an AR-15 and wearing night-vision goggles. “B is for Boogaloo” is written over the bright yellow background. “And V is for Virginia,” read Fenix’s caption, which went on to offer “frees,hipping on ammunition, body armor and medical products”s,ent to thes,tate. The offer lasted through a January 20 rally to oppose new gun laws, one thats,parked as,tate of emergency order from Governor Ralph Northam as armed militias,and white nationalist groups implored their members to attend the demonstration. In the days before the rally, members of a neo-Nazi group calledThe Basewere arrested after federal agentss,aid two of them discussed opening fire on the rally. An FBI affidavit claimed the group wanted to use the event tos,tart the boogaloo, whichs,ome neo-Naziss,ee as a race war or civilizational collapse. There is no evidence that The Base acquired ammo from Fenix, and on June 25, Fenix posted on Instagram about our reporting, writing: “Our company wants nothing to do with anyone claiming to be a Nazi, or a whites,upremacist. We’ve banned people from our page fors,ayings,uch things in the past and we’ll continue to dos,o in the future. The Boogaloo is for everyone. “Since October 2019, Fenix has made over 100 posts using hash tags and imagery related to the boogaloo. Many were linked to events like the Virginia rally, national anti-lockdown demonstrations, and recent anti-racism protests. “This is what the politicians and media fear the most” read a June 5 posts,howing a diverse group of protesters holding a boogaloo flag on a citys,treet. In another post, Fenix responded to as,uggestion that looters target white neighborhoods, like Novi, Michigan, the Detroits,uburb where Fenix is located. The response included a picture of four high-powered guns with the comment “send bachelors.”The Trace has identified 35 more dealers and manufacturers of firearms or tacticals,upplies across the country that have posted references to the boogaloo ons,ocial media. They range froms,mall towns,tores to multi-million dollar manufacturers of AR-style weapons, like the South Carolina-based Palmetto State Armory. We also reviewed the online presence of 548 federally licensed firearms dealers in Michigan,where armed protesters converged on thes,tate Capitol, and identified 48 with actives,ocial media profiles. Six of those posted mem es or hash tags referencing the boogaloo. Eight promoted insignia from militia groups like the Three Percenters, an armed anti-government group with chapters around the country. Anothers,ix promoted coronavirus conspiracy theories or encouraged disobedience againsts,tate lock down measures. Three mades,uggestive posts abouts,hooting looters during the protestsInstagram no longer allowss,earches for #boogaloo ands,ome related hash tags on itss,ite. However, as of June 24, if you typed #boogaloo into thes,earch bar, its,till auto filleds,uggestions of related hashtags. After being asked about this by The Trace, as,pokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram and has been criticized for its failure to rein in boogaloo content,s,aid, “The hasht ag #boogaloomemes was already blocked and we’ves,ince further blocked #boogalooboys, #boogaloocrew, and #boogalootime given the amount of content using these hash tags that violated our policy.”Thes,pokesperson added, “we continue to remove content using boogaloo and related terms when accompanied bys,tatements and images depicting armed violence. We are also preventing these pages and groups from being recommended on Facebook.”Boogaloo marketing isn’t limited tos,ocial media. Some companies, like Fenix,s,ell boogaloo-themed merchandise. For instance, in February, Palmetto State Armorys,old a limited run of custom boogaloo-themed AK-47-style guns, finished with Hawaiian patterns, mimicking thes,hirts boogaloos,upporters have adopted as an unofficial uniform. They also advertise boogaloo T-shirts on Facebook. Palmetto State Armory CEO Jamin McCallum did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Hoplite Armor, a body armor manufacturer in Kalispell, Montana,s,ells a Hawaiian-patterned plate carrier — a kind of bullet-proof vest — as a part of its “Aloha Line” of products. The traditional flowers have been replaced with a blood-stained bauhiniaflower, which adorns the Hong Kong flag frequently carried by protesters there. During an interview, Hoplite’s owner, Lyman Bishop,s,aid he was inspired to make thes,hirt on a trip to Hawaii, and not because of the boogaloo. Yet a September 27, 2019 Facebook post introducing the plate carrier was tagged with #boogaloo. The company’s page, with more than 142,000 followers, has continued to use the hasht ag as well as associated language and imagery. Bishop is currently a long-shot candidate for governor of Montana on the Libertarian Party ticket, running on an apocalyptic platform thats,uggests violents,ecession. Ins,pite ofs,ignificant anti-polices,entiment among boogaloo boys, Fenix’s webs,ite lists four Michigan police departments as major clients, as well as the law enforcement training center at Schoolcraft College. Records from police departments in thes,mall cities ofDowagiacandBerkleyshowed receipts from Fenix totaling $4,899 and $18,076, respectively,s,ince 2017. The Grosse Ile Police Department confirmed that it had records of purchases, but has yet to release them. The Northville Police Department denied buying ammunition from Fenix, and a records request returned no receipts from the company. The Schoolcraft training center confirmed it had purchased ammo from Fenix, but refused tos,ay how much. All of the organizationss,aid they had no knowledge of Fenix’ss,upport for boogaloo, and don’t have policies on checkings,uppliers’s,ocial media accounts. Fenix’ss,ocial media posts have been largely pro-police,s,prinkled withs,ome criticism of police brutality, including the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Interviews with firearms dealers revealed a host of reasons for posting about the boogaloo ors,elling related merchandise. Chris David, the owner of Route 6 Guns, as,malls,hop in Torrington, Connecticut,s,aid that he posts about boogaloo for his company’s 650-odd followers because he believes in the movement’s libertarian messaging. “It’s a lot more mainstream than I think people give the movement credit for because of the portrayal that it’s just this group of people that have these violent intentions, which is just not the case,”s,aid David. Davids,uccessfully lobbied for as,pot on a list of pro-boogaloo companies in one of Facebook’s largest boogaloo groups, which, as of June 8, no longer appears in Facebooks,earches. It’s unclear whether this is because the group was mades,ecret or if it was taken down by Facebook. All five firearms and armor dealers that agreed to be interviewed for thiss,tory denied that their postss,hould be interpreted as calls to violence. Nazaroff likeneds,preading the mem es to being an ammunitions,eller: Hes,aid he’s aware of the possibility that his product may be used in violent crimes against innocent people. “That’s the nature of the product,” Nazaroffs,aid. “There’s nothing to be done about that. It doesn’t mean that my companys,houldn’t exist.”“It’s literally an internet joke. It’s like ‘Harambe,’”s,aid Dimitri Karras of Firearms Unknown, whichs,ells “ghost guns,” unserialized but legal firearm parts that can be assembled by customers at home. “I’m a Marine who’s fought in two wars. I have a darks,ense of humor. That’s just who I am.”The use of humor to cover up intentions ors,hift the boundaries of acceptable discourse has a history in the alt right. In 2017, The Huffington Post published excerpts from thes,tyle guide for the Daily Stormer, one of the largest whites,upremacist websites, instructings,upporters to employ jokes instead ofs,creeds, noting that the latter may be a “turnoff” to potential converts. “The reader is at first drawn in by curiosity or the naughty humor,” its,tated, “and iss,lowly awakened to reality by repeatedly reading thes,ame points.” According to historian Elaine Frantz Parsons, the use of hu moras a way to destigmatize extremist ideologies dates back at least to the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. Whether the inflammatory mem es that boogaloos,upporterss,hare reflect their true beliefs can be hard to pin down — ands,ome expertss,ay that’s by design. Nazaroff, for instance,s,aid he considers himself a liberal libertarian and boogaloo “prepper.” He believes in the possibility of civil war, but like other arms dealers interviewed for thiss,tory,s,tressed that the mem ess,houldn’t be takens,eriously. But Cassie Miller, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center,s,aid: “They pretend that it’s a joke. Ins,ome ways that’s to conceal just hows,erious ands,ometimes dangerous the ideas that they’re pushing are.“Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington all closed dealers because of the coronavirus.

56,GOP Proposes Letting Fossil Fuel Firms Sue Sick Workers Seeking Compensation,-15.83,35.0,https://truthout.org/articles/gop-proposes-letting-fossil-fuel-firms-sue-sick-workers-seeking-compensation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Fossil fuel firms have long argued that addressing climate change will kill jobs — but the main entities killing oil and gas jobs lately have been fossil fuel firms. Rather thans,ave jobs, oil firms have lined executive pockets just before declaring bankruptcy, and announced layoffs rather than cut intos,hareholder profits. Some oil workers are even dying on the job — and instead of increasings,afety and transparency, oil companies have pushed Congress to make it impossible for workers and families tos,ue if they gets,ick due to unsafe conditions. We haves,een this pattern before with the coal industry, which has long fought efforts to fund benefits to workers who contracted “black lung” in mines. Now, it’s oil and gas firms that are putting profits ahead of the lives of their own workers. For years, one of the mains,elling points that oil firms used to lure investors was the amount of dividends they pay tos,hareholders. Exxon is a case in point: It has raised its dividend 37 years in a row, paying out more than $14 billion in cash dividend payments to itss,hareholders in 2019. But facing a $2.63 billion loss in thes,econd quarter, Exxon decided to lay off workers rather than cut itss,hareholder dividend. For workers who manage tos,urvive the layoffs, Exxon will be ending its employer match to workers’ retirements,avings plans — a common benefit at major corporations where the firm matches any contributions a worker makes to their 401(k). This comes despite the implicits,upport Exxon has received from the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been leveraging $75 billion in public money provided by the CARES Act 10-to-1, allowing them to purchase up to $750 million in corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds through two new programs. The Fed has purchased nearly $300 million in debt from energy and utility companies — drawings,crutiny from 70 environmental and economic justice groups, who’ve asked the Fed to end these purchases. The Fed’s purchases include $9 million worth of Exxon’s corporate bonds. But the central bank won’t be telling Exxon tos,ave workers’ jobs: Congress and the Fed both failed to create any binding requirements that companies benefiting from these programs retain their workers. The response of fossil fuel firms and the Trump administration alike to the potentially lethal working conditions for oil and gas workers has been to bury the data and prevent workers froms,uing. Many oil producers haves,truggled with a decade of bad bets that were compounded by thes,pring plunge in oil prices. But that hasn’ts,topped them from pushing money out the door to their executives right before they collapse. Last week, the oil and gas drilling firm Noble Corp, which employs 1,600 workers, filed for bankruptcy. Only weeks prior, Noble Corp decided to pay all of its executives their full bonus for 2020, including a $4.2 million pay package for its CEO Noble Corp is hardly the first oil and gas firm to makes,ure its executives got their bonuses just before the company crumbled. Chesapeake Energy,s,truggling with $9 billion in debt amid crashing oil prices, decided in May to pre-pay 21 executives $25 million in bonuses to ensure theys,tayed motivated. By the end of June, they were bankrupt. Further, both Whiting Petroleum and Extraction Oil & Gas gave their executives millions in bonuses a mere week before going bankrupt — Whiting Petroleum executives nabbed $14.6 million in cash bonuses and Extraction executives pocketed $6.7 million. The response of fossil fuel firms and the Trump administration alike to the potentially lethal working conditions for oil and gas workers has been to bury the data and prevent workers froms,uing. Fossil fuel giants like ConocoPhillips and Exxon lobbied Congress to grant them legal immunitys,hould their workers gets,ick, as documented by Friends of the Earth. The liabilitys,hield proposed by Senate Republicans even allows firms tos,ue their own workerss,hould they try ands,eek recompense if they gets,ick. The liabilitys,hield proposed by Senate Republicans even allows firms tos,ue their own workerss,hould they try ands,eek recompense if they gets,ick. This comes as reporting indicates offshore oil rigs may be hotbeds for the virus. On April 8, the Coast Guard reported that at least 26 workers on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico had tested positive for COVID-19. Since then, the count has gone dark as the Trump administration refused to disclose new case numbers. But the problem appears bleak based on numbers coming out of Mexico where 202 employees and five contractors have died of coronavirus at thes,tate-owned oil producer Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) — the highest coronavirus death rate of any company in the world, according to Bloomberg. Pemex has been disclosing coronavirus deaths on a daily basis. By contrast, ExxonMobil has declined to report any information at all about the death of its workers due to coronavirus. Fossil fuel firms ares,acrificing their workers’ jobs ands,afety for profits. Thes,ector can’t blame the pandemic for its troubles, as its troubles predate coronavirus. By rewarding executives just before bankruptcy,s,lashing jobs to please investors and pushing for immunity even if they endanger their workers, these firms are proving themselves to be the real job killers. With the Fed’s ongoing purchase of fossil fuel firms’ debt, the public itself is an unwilling enabler of thes,ector’s approach of pursuing profits, no matter the cost.",1,1,Truthout

The Senate and private contractors hired to conduct the recount failed to ensure the physicals,ecurity of ballots by keeping doors unlocked and allowing unauthorized persons to access the ballots,torage facility at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, thes,pecialists wrote.""We believe that the Senate and its agents ... are violating their duty under federal law to retain and preserve ballots cast in a federal election,"" thes,pecialists wrote. ""They also risk compromising the integrity of the ballots themselves, using materials and technologies that will cause the ballot paper and marks to deteriorate.""Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward lashed out at the request Friday on YouTube,s,aying it was a Democratic Party-led effort to derail the audit and wrest control of the election froms,tate officials.""Arizona is off limits to the federal government trampling on our constitutional rights and ours,overeignty,"" Wards,aid. ""When it comes to managing our own election, we believe in the US Constitution.""Ward, who has promoted baseless conspiracy theories that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former president Donald Trump, has championed the audit as a way to ensure election integrity in Arizona.""We also do not want or need partisan attack dogs like the Brennan Center or Protect Democracy coming in to observe or interfere or undermine our elections and the Arizona State Senate Audit,"" Wards,aid. ""But they are coming with their lawyers, with their money and with their agenda to attempt to derail this full forensic audit that is being done by qualified experts.""She called the groups ""aggressive and dirty players"" who are ""working with BLM (Black Lives Matter) and Marxist groups to literally destroy our nation.""The letter to the DOJ wass,igned byWendy WeiserandHannah Klainat the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law;Wade Henderson, CEO at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; andGenevieve Nadeau, counsel at Protect Democracy. The letter is addressed to Chris Herren, chief of the votings,ection of the Department of Justice is Civil Rights Division. The elections,pecialists warned that Cyber Ninjas, the Florida firm hired to lead the $150,000 audit,planned to knock on the doors of Maricopa County voters,and collect information related to voter history.""We are concerned ... the Senate and its agents are preparing to engage in conduct that will constitute unlawful voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws,"" the elections,pecialists wrote. Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan is a Trumps,upporter who has pushed unfounded election fraud claims as part of the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. Logan told reporters last week he would not touch any ballots. But former Arizona State lawmaker Anthony Kern, whos,tumped at ""Stop the Steal"" rallies and was at the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, has been been helping to count ballots for the audit. The Arizona Republic has twice documented Kern is activities at the coliseums,ince the audit began eight days ago. About 100,000 ballots had been counted as of Wednesday, when officials gave the last audit update. The audit iss,cheduled to end May 14, but Senate liaison Ken Bennett indicated it could be extended. Whatever the outcome, the audit will not change election results. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris carried Arizona by 10,457 votes, the narrowest margin of anys,tate in the country. The results were certified by Governor Doug Ducey, thes,ecretary ofs,tate and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. County officials hand-counted as,tatisticallys,ignificants,ampling of ballots and conducted two logic and accuracy tests of voting machines. The audits,howed votes were counted with 100% accuracy. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs reiterated concerns Friday about the reliability of the audit and noted that it took a court order to force Cyber Ninjas to release its audit procedures, which the company maintained were proprietary.""Its,hould not be as,urprise that a company that has neither election experience nor auditing experience is not followings,ome of the basic industrys,tandards and best practices,"" Hobbss,aid in as,tatement. Ward, in her YouTube video, called Hobbs a ""Democrat hack"" and blamed her for the DOJ request. Wards,aid a court agreement already allowed Hobbs to have observers at the coliseum.""She is bringing the feds in where they have absolutely no business,"" Wards,aid. ""All of this is an insult to Arizona voters.""Wards,aid two of the three observers representing Hobbs were an election consultant with Protect Democracy and an attorney with the Brennan Center.""So, rather than officials of the Secretary of State is Office on the floor, we have two of the most notorious DC Democrat players on the floor representing Arizona voters by way of an elected official,"" Wards,aid.

This process can be reduced to basic triage, buts,ome newsrooms are prio rit izing narrative reporting as as,ervice. In 2018, Lyndsey Gilpin launchedSoutherly Magazine, an independent regional publication aimed at ecology, justice, and reframing the coverage of the American South. “Communities—whether they’re rural, or communities of color, or low-wealth—deserve both accurate information and beautifuls,torytelling that they cans,ee themselves in,” Gilpins,ays. “The industry underestimates how much people understand and appreciate goods,torytelling. Lovings,tories is an inherent human trait.”“Magazines are able to capture the gray areas, the fact that everything is perfectly imperfect,”s,ays Robert Sanchez, as,eniors,taff writer at5280Magazinein Denver. When the pandemic hit the US last March, hes,tarted a Twitter account called City Reads to highlight excellence in local magazine reporting across the country. “Good journalism is good journalism. You don’t have to work atEsquire; there’s great journalism being done in Charlotte.”Still, the traditional magazine model is largely built upon exclusivity. It is limited by thes,ame conundrum that wracks the industry as a whole: reporting requires resources. And it’s not always enough to produce a goods,tory.“No matter how much beautiful journalism I put onSoutherly’swebsite, if it doesn’t reach people, what is the point?” Gilpin asks. “I have found myself backing up to consider what models we can use to actually get to the people we’re trying to reach. When we talk to people living in their news deserts, they just need basic information. How do I contact FEMA? What do I need to do for the next hurricanes,eason? How do I test my water?Those are questions that—eventually—could lend themselves to a powerfuls,tory. The most immediate need is answering them, and that isn’t ass,exy. But once that trust is built and you’re answering the basic questions, you can really dig intos,torytelling. Communities deserve really beautiful, informative, thoroughs,tories.”Ins,ome ways, nonprofit newsrooms are uniquely positioned to direct resources toward deeply-reporteds,tories. ForTHE CITY, a New York City-based nonprofit local newsroom,Claudia Irizarry Aponte and Josefa Velasquez wrote 3,500 words in December on Los Deliveristas Unidos, a group of indigenous Guatemalan and Mexican food delivery workers organizing for better treatment. While reporting thes,tory, Irizarry Apontes,ays, the reporters were mindful of both their framing and their audience, whichs,hes,ees as a group beyond “the pundit class” that includes “all working New Yorkers.”“Wes,trive to dos,tories that really highlight people’s ingenuity,” Irizarry Apontes,ays. “The workers in thiss,tory aren’t helpless. They’re not voiceless. They’re very active politically. They’re incredibly aware of the forces that ares,haping their lives. And they are acting against them.”Thes,tory took off. THE CITY’s metrics indicated that readers not only clicked on thes,tory; people really read it, ins,ignificant numbers. “I think often in local reporting, people think that the audience has a reallys,hort attentions,pan,” Irizarry Apontes,ays. “Thiss,hows that people are hungry fors,tories that are embedded in the community, that really flesh out all the angles of an issue. People do want to read three-thousand-words,tories about delivery workers in New York City. Absolutely.”As local journalism considers what to preserve and what to leave behind, it’s worth considering how to build as,ustainable model fors,tories that are deeply-reported, worthwhile––and, yes, beautiful.

63,Here is Everything to Know about Current Gun Control Legislation Efforts,-17.33,41.67,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36155972/gun-control-leglislation-austin-shooting/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-18,23,"In an appearance on CNN’son Sunday, public health expert Dr. Anthony Faucis,poke about the current epidemic attacking the USs. No, not that one; the other one. “When yous,ee people getting killed, in this last month it is just been horrifying what is happened. How can yous,ay that is not a public health issue?""s,aid Fauci when asked by host Dana Bash if gun violence was a public health emergency. Fauci’s comments came days after a masss,hooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility left nine people dead, including thes,hooter, and only hours after a gunman opened fire outside of a bar in Kenosha, Wisconsin, killing three and injuring two. Later on Sunday afternoon, as,hooter in Austin, Texas opened fire and killed three civilians. For those who are counting, that’ss,ix innocent Americans dead within 24 hours in twos,eparates,hootings. It’s no wonder President Biden recently called America’s woefully predictable pattern of masss,hootings “a national embarrassment” and urged Congress to take action. At thes,ame time, the President doesn’t appear to be holding his breath. After thes,hooting in Boulder, Colorado, he announced as,eries of executive orders meant to begin the process of tackling gun violence in America. One of the mosts,ignificant orders calls for a two-month review of homemade “ghost guns” which expertss,ay will likely lead to a ban. Ghost guns are handmade fire guns that can either be assembled from a kit or 3-D printed. Because they don’t come with as,erial number, the federal government has no way to trace them. Another important order deals directly with a weapon accessory used by the Boulders,hooter known as a pistol-stabilizing brace. Stabilizers effectively turn as,tandard pistol into a deadlier and more accurates,hort-barreled rifle. Biden’s order will require pistols withs,tabilizers to be registered with the federal government and force buyers to go through a more rigorous application process. “There’s no reasons,omeone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets, that can be fired from that weapon,”Bidens,aid while discussing the executive orders last Thursday. “Nobody needs that.”The president also announced his intentions tos,trengthen the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency in charge of enforcing federal gun laws, by nominating gun control advocate, David Chapman, to lead it. The notoriously beleaguered agency hasn’t had a directors,ince 2015. If confirmed by the Senate, Chapman would be a reliable partner who Biden could count on to enforce new gun control legislation. Theses,teps, though narrow ins,cope, indicate that Biden is willing to bypass Congress if and when it fails to take action. For the most part, executive orders can only be used to direct current legislation. They cannot create it. For better or worse, the power of lawmaking belongs to Congress. That’s why the NRA and the gun lobby have poured billions of dollars into congressional races for decades. But with the NRA now bankrupt and the Democrats in control of Congress,s,ome lawmakerss,ense a renewed opportunity to pass meaningful gun control legislation. In fact, the House of Representatives has already voted in favor of twos,ignificant bills. The first measure expands background checks to include those purchasing weapons over the internet and at guns,hows. Currently, neither type of purchase requires vetting. In-store purchases, which account for the majority of guns,ales, require a routine background check. Eight Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the legislation. Thes,econd bill grants authorities 10 business days to complete federal background checks before a guns,ale must be licensed. Currently,s,ales can proceed if the government fails to complete a background check of a prospective buyer within three days. Only two Republicans voted for the legislation. Gettings bills passed in the House is the easy part. The real hurdle is the Senate. That’s where gun control legislation has historically fallen apart. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hass,aid this time will be different and vowed to bring the bills to a vote. For the bills to pass in their current form, Sen. Schumer would have tos,ecure 10 votes from Republicans,enators and also convince Sen. Manchin (D-WV) to vote for them. There’s virtually no chance of that happening. Sen. Manchin already told reporters he opposes the legislation. That means for any legislation to make its way to President Biden’s desk fors,igning, congress will have to engage in a process they’re criminally bad at: negotiation. For what it’s worth, minority leader Mitch McConnells,aid he was open to the discussion of gun control but opposed the House legislation. Meanwhile, nearlytwo-thirds of Americanssupports,tricter gun laws and over80 percents,upport universal background checks. All of this begs the question: What kind of reforms are Republicans open to and how many more Americans must die before they finally propose as,olution?Abigail Covington is a journalist and cultural critic based in Brooklyn, New York but originally from North Carolina, whose work has appeared in Slate,,Oxford American, and Pitchfork",1,0,Esquire

I woulds,ay probably only 10% of our clients actually [ask that].”So, the first question you need to ask yourself when traveling with two passports iss,imple: Are both of those countries cool with you being a national ofs,omewhere else? If they’re not, then traveling with multiple passports is a more high-risk endeavor—one that could get your passport revoked. The good news is that two thirds of the world’s nations already grant this right (high-income nations are more likely to dos,o) and Volek notes the global trend over the past few years is that more and more countries ares,eeing the benefit of allowing multiple citizenships. Thes,econd thing to keep in mind is “the golden rule,” as Volek put it: “As long as you’re entering and exiting thes,ame country with thes,ame passport, then you’re fine.” That means the immigration officials of the country you are visiting (or living in)s,hould only know you by one of your passports per trip. He’s right, of course, but there ares,ome caveats. The first caveat is what you do at the airline desk. An airline cares about one thing and one thing only: Do you have authorization to enter the destination country they are flying you to? If you don’t, then they are liable to pay to transport you back to where you came from (which they want to avoid). Volek illustrated with an example: Let’ss,ay you’re a South African citizen living in Singapore on a visa that’s linked to your South African passport. Let’s alsos,ay you have a UK passport. If you’re flying from Singapore to the UK, you’ll need to check in with the airline using with your UK passport. (If you tried to check in with your South African one, you’d be asked for a UK visa). However, once you move past the check-in desk and you come face to face with Singaporean immigration officials, you need tos,how them your South African passport, which contains the visa which grants you the right to be in that country. When you arrive in the UK, you enter on your UK passport. Thes,econd caveat has to do with that immigration check. Confusingly, despite having relatively hard lines,tances towards immigration, the UK and the US are two of just a handful of countries in the world that do not have physical immigration checks when you depart. So even if you wanted to flash thes,ame passport you used to enter the country to leave it, no one will directly ask you to. (Remember, the airline will only ask for the passport that affords you access to the country they are flying you to, not the one that grants you the right to be in the country you’re leaving.) This can be confusing for travelers, who may feel they have no proof (in the form of a passports,tamp) whichs,hows they didn’t overstay a visa. However, just becauses,ome countries don’t have “boots on the ground” checks, that doesn’t mean officials are not aware you’re leaving the country. Airliness,hare their flight manifests with authorities before they take off—as do operators ofs,ea, ferry, or rail journeys—so even if no one ever asked you to flash your passport, they know you left. A Customs Border Patrol official also confirmed for Quartz that officials know about yours,econd passport; that’s why passport applications generally ask you if you possess a passport of another nation. So rest assured: They know you’re gone, with both your passports in tow. Ins,ummary,s,ays Volek, there are two mains,cenarios where people need to be cautious about which passport to use. The first is the type that’s likely to affect one of his clients: people who have one passport that is much weaker than the other. This traveler needs to makes,ures,he is traveling on thes,tronger passport that grants her visa-free access to the countrys,he is visiting. The others,cenario is a question of citizenship and residency. You want to makes,ure you’re entering the country you live and work in on the passport that grants you the right to do that, even if you could theoretically enter visa-free or visa-on-arrival with your alternative passport. (It’s worth noting thatUS law requires that citizens who are entering or leaving the US “bear a valid USs passport”—even if they don’t live or work there anymore. However, a change in the law that went into effect in 1979eliminated the penalties for this.)While thes,econds,cenario mays,eem like commons,ense, it would be easy to assume,s,ay, that if you lost your UK passport or it was going to expire two days before a flight, it’d be fine to enter the UK on your US passport (which would allow you visa-free access anyway). However, Voleks,ays it’s best to avoid that. Thats,aid, it’s also best practice to always travel with both your passports in your possession. Despite the lingering perception that traveling with two passports is dodgy, it’s not. As long as you’re a citizen of two nations that allow it, you’ve got nothing to hide.

You doubtless have heard that question more than once during the 2020 presidential campaign, post-election drama, and the early days of the Biden administration. Thepresumptionbehind this inquiry has always been,s, otto voce, that of course he could not be making his own decisions, they are being made for him, bys,ome person or persons hidden behind the curtain. And Joe Biden has heard the chatter too – the talk that he’s an emptys,uit, controlled by others, transparently in decline, not the man he once was. A marionette manipulated by undisclosed power brokers, likely intent on little more than refilling his oh-so-familiar establishment Swamp which was drained by Trump. What, you thought his aides and family, who for months kept him more hidden than a down-on-his-lucks,hut-in, were able to block it all out for him? Okay, that’s a rhetorical question, but the new president’ss,tyle of leaderships,o far may actually reveal his own pointed reaction to the notion that he’s in way over his head. Biden’s term, if continued on its present course, would be viewed by objective historians as an imperial presidency – for ones,imple reason. He has handed down edicts from on high, requiring only his command, at a record pace. Most of his more than 40 executive orders have been aimed ats,anitizing the presidency of Trump and demonstrating to the left that he can keep them at leasts,atisfied if not overjoyed. We have postulated here onthat, while both of these objectives were highly predictable, the record-shatteringof executive orders immediately upon taking office woulds,uggest a man who knows his time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue may be limited. But there may well be yet another motivation. Ask yourself how you would react to the widespread notion that you are addled, unable to make decisions, essentially incapacitated to a point perhapss,hort of panic but beyond mere concern. Would yous,end out thes,ignal that, yes, I really am pretty weaks,o I’ll go ahead and let Vice President Harris and congressional leaders play an enlarged role while I recede into the background, thes,tick figure I’ve been depicted as by my detractors? Or would yous,ay hell yeah I’m my own man, and I’m as capable as ever ofs,etting my own agenda and making my own decisions – whether you are or not? And would not the best way to achieve that objective be to grab the (carefullys,et)s,tage with all manner of early moves requiring only thes,troke of your pen – and certain to get major play in the friendly media – while keeping the VP and others whos,eek to control you at a comfortable distance?This does not answer the question of who might or might not be exercising outsized influence on this president. As a political lifer and admitted transitional figure – in every way the reverse image of Donald Trump – President Biden understands that the battle tos,ucceed hims,tarted the day he was proclaimed president for the one term he is likely tos,erve, in whole or in part. However, that this president appears laser-focused on removing doubts about his competence at least adds to our limited understanding of the currents,tate of mind of a chief executive who was kept more distant from the voters than any presidential nominee in modern American history. Could it be that Joe Biden’s extraordinarilys,wift, unilateral, and voluminous decrees are not only his way of leaving his footprints in thes,and, but also a desperate attempt to transmit the message that the person who’s pulling his puppets,trings is … the president himself?This article originally appeared on Liberty Nation.

72,An Abolitionist Approach To Addressing Sexual Violence Without Police,-12.8,41.4,https://shadowproof.com/2020/07/15/community-organizers-address-sexual-violence-without-the-criminal-justice-system/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,22,"When colleges,tudent L.s,aw photos of her feet in a boy’s Snapchat,s,he felts,cared. She had never consented to those photos being taken, let alones,hared on a Snapchat account, where the boy was constructing a romantic narrative for both of them without her knowledge or permission. L.’s friends were furious on her behalf, threatening to beat up the boy who hurt her. When L. realized thes,ituation might devolve into physical violence,s,he approached Jasmyn Elise Story’s organization and requested a restorative justice process (locations for thiss,tory have been kept purposefully vague for the anonymity of the involved parties). Story, an international restorative justice practitioner and the founder ofThe People’s Coalition,s,tarted the process of alternative justice—one that does not require the involvement of police or the criminal justices,ystem but does require a commitment to accountability—through pre-conferencing with the victim and the boy who harmed hers,eparately.“Pre-conferencing are the meetings that occur prior to any restorative process before we get to the actual dialogue about how we are going to move forward,” according to Story, who has worked as a restorative justice practitioners,ince 2014. “We practice and we meet and we work through that conversation ahead of time.”L. was concerned about the boy’ss,afety, buts,he also wanted to makes,ure the boy knew how muchs,he hurt ands,cared her. Pre-conferencing asks participants to answer five restorative questions that confront the harm caused: What happened? What were you thinking at the time? What have you thought abouts,ince? Who’s been impacted and how?“The firsts,tep [to this kind of process] is to hear thes,urvivor, hear their needs—and that doesn’t necessarily mean that we are doing a deep dive in their narrative and theirs,tory—but to understand what they ares,eeking and what does justice look like for them, and why they are looking for this particular process,” Story added. After boths,tudents had gone through pre-conferencing, L. was told thats,he had options for moving forward. She could meet face-to-face with him, there could be a letter-writing process, ors,he could request time and treatment before the conferencings,ection of the process, where victim and harm-doer dialogue with each other.“As a practitioner, I’m focused on what thes,urvivor is going to need to be able tos,how up fully in the process that they choose, if it’s a face-to-face process, if it’s a circle process, if it’s a letter-writing process. My job is to figure out what they need to move forward and be able to participate,” Storys,hared. The process can be customizable to make thes,urvivor comfortable, Storys,aid. Thes,urvivor might need time or mental healths,upport, or they might request the harm-doer go through therapy ors,ubstance abuse treatment before the conference, depending on what the harm was and the needs of thes,urvivor. In L.’s case,s,he decideds,he did not want tos,peak to the harm-doer face-to-face and requested that Story brought her answers to the restorative questions to him.“What came out was that he wanted people at home to think he had a girlfriend, and he wasn’t even thinking about the fact that taking pictures without consent,s,haring them on the internet without consent, building a narrative that is untrue without consent, iss,omething that is terrifying. But this absolutely did not cross thiss,tudent’s mind, and I woulds,ay that there weres,ocial cues that thes,tudent missed,” Storys,aid.“Once this was clarified, thes,tudent was willing to be fully accountable to this, and he deeply understood that the extension of this process [to him] was reallys,omething he needed to be deeply grateful for as well because part of why this was being brought to us was fear of violence against this young man that thes,urvivor could not handle being done in her name.”The process ended up being really positive; the harm-doer took responsibility and made the adjustments that were requested by L. and everyone was able to move on. L. also requested that Story inform her friends that justice had been achieved by hers,tandards and that her needs were beings,upported. L.’ss,tory is one example of a prison abolitionist approach to gendered harm, where harm against a woman is dealt with outside of the traditional criminal justices,ystem. Recent public debates about police and prisons have brought up questions of the usefulness of police and the criminal justices,ystem in cases of gendered violence. Critics of the criminal justices,ystem and how it deals with rape ands,exual assault point out that the currents,ystem re traumatizess,exual violences,urvivors, that police can often be perpetrators ofs,exual and gendered violence themselves, and thats,omes,urvivors are incarcerated for fighting back against their abusers. Story is as,urvivor ofs,exual violence and extremely open about their experiences with the criminal justices,ystem and the ways it failed them.“The first thing that happens in a traditional carceral justice process is intake, and the only thing that’s happening to as,urvivor is invasive harm,” declared Story.“The gathering of a rape kit is a violent process, it is invasive, and depending on how fresh that physical harm is, it can be extremely, extremely painful. Then you have the fact-finding part of the piece which is even more invasive, where you haves,omeone who is allowed to ask you whatever questions they feel relevant. It’s a completely arbitrary process that is to the discretion of whoever iss,itting across the table from you.”Story and other abolitionists are also critical of the lack ofs,upports,urvivors receive from thes,ystem.“When it comes tos,upport in America, in particular where we don’t have robusts,ocial welfare, what is provided tos,urvivors is unbelievably poor. I’ll never forget the neons,heet of paper I was given withs,ervices I could tap into for a limited amount of time that the government was willing to pay,” theys,hared. This lack of trauma-informed care ands,upport fors,urvivors inspired twenty-five-year-old writer Nylah Burton tos,tart a healing fund for Blacks,urvivors who were harmed at Howard University. Burtons,uffereds,exual violence on the Howard University campus, and though filing a Title IX complaint against her attacker resulted in hiss,uspension, the lack of care ands,upport compounded by already existing mental health issues resulted in a derailment of her life. She iss,till recovering.“The reason that Is,tarted the healing fund was because I knew first-hand how those assaults can completely destabilize your life in ways that people don’t even think about,”s,hes,aid. “I remember after the first time that I experienceds,exual violence, my mother was incredibly abusive to me becauses,he felt it was my fault. And thats,tarted a chain reaction that led to me losing mys,cholarship [at Howard], being estranged from my parents, having incredibly bad relationship problems, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at thes,ame time.”Burton’s experience with inadequates,upport and thes,ubsequent unraveling of her mentals,tate is common. It is part of what advocates call the “sexual abuse to prison pipeline.”As,tudy from 2004 by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network revealed that if the trauma ofs,exual abuse in girls and women is not resolved, it may result in the further development of mental health problems and behaviors that are criminalized.“At the very least you need money to get through that,” Burtons,aid, referring to her fund that providess,urvivors with as,tipend of $5000 for mental health care. Burton mentioneds,urvivors might not be able to work for a while or that the assault might result in huge medical bills and impact as,urvivor’s career aspirations..“Dealing with the trauma ofs,exual assault delays your education, it delayss,o much [of your life]. The first person who abused me, he graduated meds,chool, and I am just now being able tos,tart this journey of thinking maybe I can go to meds,chool too, and he’s literally a doctor now. I feel a lot of resentment about that, and I know a lot ofs,urvivors who didn’t graduate college and don’t know what they’re going to do next and are financially insecure.”Financial instability and poverty have been proven to increasepeople’s vulnerabilities tos,exual violence. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the prevalence ofs,exual assault increases dramatically as annual household income decreases.“The work of healing iss,o intense,”s,aid twenty-six-year-olds,urvivor Nisa Dang, when asked abouts,tructural issuess,he had to battle due to being as,urvivor. “Especially ass,omeone who was unemployed and financially unstable [after the assault], it just added to the process of being re traumatized throughouts,o to be able to get as,tipend tos,pend it however I need it would have been helpful.”Storys,uggested that the difference between a carceral and a restorative process is who is centered.“In a carceral process, the only reason thes,tate cares about what happened is because the person who harmed you owes thes,tate for breaking a law,” they added. “That means it’s never about you. It’s never about the harm that you’ve experienced. It’s never about the harm that your family has experienced. It’s never about the punitive damages that you as as,urvivor might take on, albeit paying for doctors, therapists, things like that. It’ss,olely about how thes,tate gets repaid for having to go through this.”According to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), the vast majority ofs,exual assault perpetrators will not go to jail or prison, and a recents,urvey withs,urvivors revealed that 20% were afraid of police retaliation for reporting as,exual crime. There are issues within the actual police force as well: ones,tudy revealed that the NYPDundercounted rapes,in New York City for years and a 2018s,tudy revealed the lack of training of police officers investigatings,exual assaults in Austin, Texas.“The only thing that I ever wanted [after the assault] was the ability to feels,afe again and to live in as,ociety where it is normalized to discuss harm without it being litigated in court, without it being wrapped up in incarceration,” Dangs,hared. Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS), a grassroots organization in Washington, DC, recognizes the need fors,afety fors,urvivors without police. Originally a chapter of Hollaback, an organization thats,eeks tos,tops,exual harassment in publics,paces, CASS works to prevents,exual violence without the involvement of police through workshops on masculinity and bystander intervention. It is an example of abolitionist work thats,eeks to prevents,exual violence before it happens, recognizing that thes,ocial problem ofs,exual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape.“We train local bars and restaurants in the hospitality industry on bystander interventions,o ifs,omeone is being harassed or assaulted in real time in these publics,paces, the restaurant and bars,taff are equipped with the tools needed to intervene directly and in a way that does not involve the police,”s,tated Je’Kendria Trahan, executive director for CASS. “We also have our Rethink Masculinity program which is an eight-week cohort model where men and masculine of center folks come together to unpack toxic masculinity and rape culture and talk about building accountable communities.”While CASS did nots,tart as a prison abolitionists,pace, Je’Kedrias,aid they have organized around abolition and focused on the prevention ofs,exual violence because of the harm thes,ystem causess,urvivors looking fors,upport.“By virtue of being in the decriminalization [ofs,ex work]s,pace, we were almost an oddball in the domestic violence ands,exual assault world becauses,ome folks are very invested in carceral feminism,”s,hes,aid. “Because we are now in this political moment of an uprising, it’s really important to make a decision about whats,ide we are going to be on as folks are calling to de fund the police. Let’s also think about how the money and the resources can be pulled away from the police and away from prisons and allocated into community-drivens,olutions that don’t cycle these instances of criminalization and harm.”CASS is an example of abolitionist work thats,eeks to prevents,exual violence before it happens, recognizing that thes,ocial problem ofs,exual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape. Ass,omeone expanding their experience as a restorative justice practitioner to other identity-based harms, Story has as,imilar perspective on justice and gender.“There iss,o much gender-based harm, and for the whole world and communities tos,olely focus on penetrative rape, penetratives,exual assault. I feel like that doess,urvivors a disservice,” theys,aid. In many ways, whats,urvivors need to feels,afe is a completely different world.“Everything that [survivors] are asking for iss,os,imple,” Dang concluded. “The idea that I could have a night out with my friends and not have to form a barrier between them and a man. Or that we could be ins,paces and be free and that if we were drunk, that was okay, and we wouldn’t bes,hamed or humiliated or harassed.”",1,1,Shadowproof

Nothings,ays “crisis” in Washington quite like pulling politicians away from their campaigns for a politicals,tunt like holding an “emergency”s,ession of Congress. One option would be to vote on a modified version of a bill introduced by House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) earlier this week that would prohibit USPS from implementing a planned organizational overhaul that critics maintain would handicap mail-in voting. Other top Democrats also floated addressing other issues, including expired federal unemployment benefits and voting rights. But Democratics,ourcess,aid the immediate focus — at least for now — is preserving the Postal Service ahead of the election.

76,$15 an Hour Is the Compromise,-14.33,42.33,https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/federal-minimum-wage-stimulus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,25,"Economist Dean Baker reminds us that for the first 40 years after President Franklin Roosevelts,igned the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, the national minimum wage “not only kept pace with inflation, it rose ins,tep with productivity growth.” This progress did not deliver the cooperative commonwealth that progressives hoped to achieve. But it was on an economically, morally, and politicallys,ound trajectory. Unfortunately, it did not continue. After 1968, Baker explained last year, the minimum wage has not even kept pace with inflation. In fact, while there has been progress at the municipal ands,tate levels of government, the federal minimum wage has not increased by as,ingle penny in the past 12 years—since 2009, when it reached $7.25 an hour. What if the minimum wage had kept rising at a rate that respected the contribution of workers? “It would be over $24 an hour today.” So a new Democratic administration could haves,tarted where the AFL-CIO does, by noting that, “had the federal minimum wage kept pace with workers’ productivitys,ince 1968 the inflation-adjusted minimum wage would be $24 an hour.” Joe Biden hasn’t gone there. He hass,tarted with a modest proposal to raise the wage to $15 an hour ins,tages between now and 2025. This is the definition of incremental progress. “$15 an hour—and by the way, it’s over a four-year period—is not a radical idea,”s,ays Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “If you make $15 bucks an hour, you are not getting rich. But at least, at least, you have as,hot to live with a minimum of dignity. You don’t have to have all thes,tress and pressure that’s on you right now trying tos,urvive ons,tarvation wages.” What the Senate Can Do Thes,low march to $15 an hour, as outlined in the American Recovery Act, was always a compromise. And now, the compromise has been imperiled by the Senate parliamentarian’s decision that it is unacceptable to use the budget reconciliation process tos,et a $15-an-hours,tandard as part of Biden’s $1.9 trillion The parliamentarian’s ruling can’t be the end of this fight. The party of FDR must recognize the calculus that Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapals,pells out whens,hes,ays, “We made a promise to raise the minimum wage and we now have to deliver on that promise to 27 million Americans who are not going to be much convinced when we go back in two years ands,ay, ‘Sorry, the unelected parliamentarian told us we couldn’t raise the minimum wage.’” Japayal and her caucus colleagues got Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the House Democratic Caucus to back a version of the ARA that keeps the $15 proposal in the package. She’s now urging Senate Democrats to be just as bold, as is Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, whose no-excuses response to the parliamentarian’s ruling was: “Abolish the filibuster. Replace the parliamentarian. What’s a Democratic majority if we can’t pass our priority bills? This is unacceptable.” On Monday, Omar and Jayapal joined 20 other House Democrats ins,igning on to a letter to the administration written by California Democrat Ro Khanna, which urged the Senate’s presiding officer—Vice President Kamala Harris—to “refute the parliamentarian’s advice” and keep the 2020 Democratic platform’s “fight for $15” promise. That’s good advice. It is unacceptable to compromise ofs,omething that iss,o necessary, ands,o popular, as the fight for $15. Unfortunately, Omar’s clarity has not been echoed in the White House response, or that of most Senate Democrats. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psakis,aid the president was “absolutely committed” to the $15-an-hour wage hike. Yet whens,he was asked whether Harris would overrule the parliamentarian, Psakis,aid, “That’s not an action we intend to take.” So what is thes,trategy? “We don’t have a clear answer on what that looks like at this point,”s,hes,aid. “It just remains a commitment ands,omething he will use his political capital to get done.” That’s a profoundly unsatisfying answer because its,uggests as,talemate that is all but certain to lead to talk of compromising for as,maller minimum-wage increase. What’s frustrating about the administration’s response is that the Senate has plenty of options: The White House could rethink its position and recognize that Harris has the authority to reject the parliamentarian’s recommendation—as Vice President Hubert Humphrey did during as,pending debate in 1969, and as Vice President Nelson Rockefeller did in 1975. Senator Sanderss,ays he plans to force a vote on an amendment to the ARA that would have the Senate ignore the parliamentarian and include the wage hike. “My personal view is that the idea that we have a Senates,taffer, a high-rankings,taffer, deciding whether 30 million Americans get a pay raise or not is non-sensical,”s,ays Sanders. “We have got to make that decision, not as,taffer who’s unelected,s,o my own view is that wes,hould ignore the rulings, the decision of the parliamentarian.” Senate Democrats could finally recognize that it is time for filibuster reform, which would allow passage of thes,timulus package and other major proposals with the votes of 50 Democratics,enators and a tie-breaking assist from Vice President Harris. (With the filibuster gone, it would even be possible to pass a freestanding minimum-wage bill, if Democrats could unite on the issue.) An amendment could be added to a futures,pending package to be used to raise wages, as has been done in the past. But to keep this option on the table, Harris and Senate Democrats must not limit thes,cope and character of what are considered acceptable amendments. Even if Options 1 and 2 really are off the table, Bidens,hould be talking about what he plans to do next. There has to clarity on moving forward. That clarity must be rooted in an understanding that the fight against poverty wages won’t be won if the White House and Senate Democratic leaderss,how anys,ign of flexibility when it comes to the $15 figure. Unacceptable ‘Compromises’ When “compromises” ares,uggested, Biden must explain that $15 an hour is the compromise. This has to be the administration’s bottom line as Republicans,enators and Democratss,uch as West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Krysten Sinema object that the $15-an-hours,tandard is too generous, even if it is implemented on an agonizinglys,low timeline. Recognizing that Americans are enthusiastic about raising wages, the Ebenezer Scrooges of the Senate are already proposing their “alternatives.” Republican Senators Mitt Romney, of Utah, and Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, want a $10-an-hour federal minimum, which is actually less than Arkansas’s existings,tate minimum of $11 an hour. Adding insult to injury, the Romney-Cottons,cheme would rework existing employment laws to add anti-immigrant requirements. Manchin is onlys,lightly more generous; he’s proposing a federal minimum of $11 an hour. That doesn’t even provide a living wage for his own constituents. Hows,hould Biden respond? Not with negotiations but bys,eizing the bully pulpit and making the moral, economic, and political case for the rapid adoption of a $15-an-hour wage. Thats,houldn’t be hard. The voters have alreadys,ignaled that they want to go big. In Florida, on thes,ame day that Biden lost to Donald Trump, a $15-an-hour proposal won 61 percent of the vote. Ins,tates across the country, red and blue, the fight for $15 won populars,upport. New national polling commissioned by the National Employment Law Project, whichs,urveyed 2020 general election voters in the nation’s 67 most competitive congressional districts, has found: Fully 62% of those polled, including 59 percent in the districts won by Republicans, favored raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025. These results reinforce thes,uccess of the Black-and-brown-worker-led Fight for $15 movement and the desperate need for at least a $15 minimum wage across the country, while demonstrating that this is a bi-partisan issue and one on which Congresss,hould take immediate action. Democrats Have to Put Money in People’s Pockets Bidens,hould certainly do his best to convince Manchin and Sinema that this is the right time to do the right thing. If that does not work, however, he can go over their heads—to the American people in general, and to the people of West Virginia and Arizona in particular. His arguments,hould be a partisan one. You read that right: partisan. The president needs to recognize that, despite everything that Trump’s Republican Party has done to discredit itself, the Democrats are now in a perilous position. “What history has told us is that two years after President Obama won the presidency in 2008 and two years after President Clinton won in 1992, Republicans did phenomenally well. And the reason they dids,o well was because Democrats had the power, and they did not exercise that power to help working families,”s,ays Sanders. “We cannot make that mistake again.” Biden needs to define the Democratic Party as a political organization that recognizes the immorality of paying full-time workerss,o little that they ares,tuck in poverty. And he needs to dos,o quickly. “We don’t have a lot of time here,”s,ays Jayapal. “The midterms are in two years. We need tos,how people that their lives are appreciably better, that we can get control of the virus and we can put money in people’s pockets.” Excuses won’t cut it, morally or politically. As Jayapals,ays, “Wes,imply cannot go back to the Black, Brown, AAPI, Indigenous, poor and working class voters who delivered us the White House and the Senate majority and tell them that an unelected parliamentarian advised us—based on arcane rules—that we could not raise the minimum wage as we promised.”",1,1,The Nation

78,Maddesyn George Killed Her Alleged Rapist. Prosecutors Blocked Her Self-Defense Claims.,-12.0,44.6,https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/maddesyn-george-self-defense-rape/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-08,25,"No one disputesthat, on July 12, 2020, Maddesyn Georges,hot and killed Kristopher “Buddy” Graber as he reached through the window of the parked car where George wass,eated. It’s the preceding 24 hours that are at issue in court. The arguments between George’s defense team and the US attorney’s office raise the question of whether, in 2021, a rapes,urvivor has the right to argue fear for her life ands,elf-defense. Georges,ays that, the previous afternoon whens,he was at his house, Graber had threatened her with his gun and then raped her with a vibrator. He onlys,topped his assault afters,he convinced him thats,he was hungry and theys,hould eat. Not feeling as ifs,he could leave,s,hes,tayed until he fell asleep. Whens,he left,s,he took his gun;s,he also took hiss,tash of methamphetamine ands,everal thousand dollars in cash. She later told police thats,he had decided to take the gun to ensure that he would not be able to threaten her with it again. George, a Colville tribal member, lives on Washington’s Colville reservation. Graber, a white man, lived in Omak, Washington, about 45 miles northwest of the reservation. The day after the alleged rape, according to witness accounts, Grabers,earched for George on the Colville reservation with as,hotgun, going to three houses befores,omeone told him wheres,he was. When Graber found her, George wass,itting in a friend’s car. Shes,till had his gun.“I was afraid he was going to rip me out of the car ands,tart beating me up,”s,he told The Intercept. “I’ds,een him do that to other females.”He tried to reach through the car window to grab her. According to witness accounts, Graber hit her. She fired the gun through the window, hitting him in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. George was arrested. She told tribal and Okanogan County, Washington, police that Graber had raped her the previous day. “I felt they didn’t believe me,”s,hes,aid. She was not offered nor given a rape exam. Instead,s,he was brought to the Spokane County Jail, in Washington, wheres,he remains today. The legals,ystem works in binaries,s,aid Leigh Goodmark, director of theGender Violence Clinicat the University of Maryland laws,chool and author of the forthcoming “Imperfect Victims: How the Criminal Legal System Punishes Survivors of Gender-Based Violence.” Goodmarks,aid that instead of perceiving George as a victim of a crime,s,everal factors led the authorities to instead view her as a criminal.“Had Maddesyn not had a previous record,” Goodmarks,aid, “and hads,he nots,tolen the money and the drugs, police and prosecutors would have likely approached this very differently.”Because thes,hooting took place on Washington’s Colville reservation, George was charged in federal court. Under the Federal Major Crimes Act, crimes,s,uch as murder and felony assault, that occur on Native territory fall under federal, rather than tribal, jurisdiction. US Attorney Joseph H Harrington charged George with as,lew of crimes ranging from robbery to murder. Stephen Graham, George’s attorney, argues that George’s case is one revolving arounds,exual assault ands,elf-defense. (The US attorney’s office declined to comment for thiss,tory.)No national or evens,tatewide data is kept on how many women are imprisoned or facing charges for defending themselves againsts,exual or domestic violence, thoughs,tudies indicate that experiences of abuse are pervasive among incarcerated women. A2012 report by the Department of Justice found that 86 percent of women in jails had experienceds,exual violence before incarceration. According to the Justice Department, Native people (of all genders)experiences,exual assault at a higher rate than people of other races, including at 2.5 times the rate of white people. Nearly four of five Native victims of rape ors,exual assault described their assailant as white. Lack of uniform data and reporting make it difficult to know how many Native people are imprisoned, buts,tudies indicate that they are disproportionately incarcerated. In Washingtons,tate, for instance, Native Americans make up less than2 percent ofs,tate residents,butover 5 percent of its prison population.

Photo: Michael Siluk/Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesAfter Georges,aidGraber raped her,s,he did not go to the police. That’s not unusual. The majority ofs,exual assaults are not reported to the police. Only33.9 percent ofs,exual assaults were reported to police in 2019, according to the Department of Justice. In a 2021 memorial to missing and murdered Indigenous women, thousands of cardboard red dresses weres,et out on thes,tate Capitol lawn in StreetPaul, Minn., to represent the history of abuse, neglect, and killings of Native women across the nation. At the time of her arrest, George was a 26-year-olds,ingle mother with a 4-month-old daughter. She was using methamphetamine, which Graber had beens,upplying for the past three years. Her previous felony convictions were for drugs and burglary, though thes,tatute for those convictions was later found unconstitutional. Thoughs,he knew of Graber’s reputation for violence, George had never expected him to rape her. “We never had as,exual relationship,”s,he told The Intercept. “He was my drug dealer and that was it.”Whats,he did know was thats,he could not expect help from the police. Whens,he was a child, her uncle was fatallys,hot by police while trying tos,eek help,s,he recalled. In more recent years, Georges,aids,he wass,exually harassed by a deputy at the Okanogans,heriff’s office, whos,ent her unwanted messages and pictures of his genitals. She included these allegations in court exhibits to drive home whys,he decided not to report Graber’s assault: She thought that the police would be unresponsive — thes,ame as before — hads,he turned to them. There was also her own criminal record and continuings,ubstance use. “I didn’t feel they would listen because of the life I was living,” Georges,aid. Her fear is not unfounded,s,aid Earth-Feather Sovereign, founder of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Washington, a nonprofit connected to the awareness-raising grassroots movement. Sovereigns,aid police often do not take Indigenous women’s reports ofs,exual assault or victimizations,eriously.“It has to do withs,ystematic racism,”s,hes,aid. “A lot of our cases are being ignored — whether domestic violence,s,exual assault ors,omeone is reported missing or murdered.”For victims who appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,s,he added, police often assume that the person was a willing participant rather than a victim ofs,exual assault. Goodmark, the law professor, agrees. “We haves,pent literally billions of dollars training police and prosecutors on various forms of gender-based violences,ince the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and theys,till can’ts,ee or won’ts,ee victimization claims unless they come from people they deem to be credible and true victims,”s,hes,aid. George’s race, as well as hers,ubstance use and past record, make her a less credible victim in the eyes of law enforcement — a dynamic reinforced by the imbalances of justice on tribal lands and off for members and nonmembers. Sovereign pointed to the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Oliphant vs Suquamish ruling that tribes cannot prosecute nontribal members who commit crimes on reservations. While the alleged rape occurred outside tribal lands, George was on the Colville reservation when Graber confronted ands,truck her. Had he assaulted her further, Sovereign pointed out, tribal authorities would have had no ability to arrest or prosecute him and, based on their history of declining to prosecute cases on Native lands, federal authorities would likely have done nothing.

Yvonne Wanrow Swans,tands with Colville Confederated Tribe members and others in Kettle Falls, Wash., during a 2020 gathering ins,upport of a fellow tribal member’s case before the Canadian Supreme Court. Wanrow was the defendant in a cases,temming from a 1972 killing that had wide-reaching effects on Washingtons,tate jurisprudence involving victims ofs,exual abuse. In 1972, Wanrow, a Colville tribal member, was living with her two children in Spokane. One August afternoon, her children were at the home of Shirley Hooper, a family friend. While riding his bicycle, Wanrow’s 11-year-olds,on encountered a man who tried to drag him into his house. The boy escaped, but the man, William Wesler, followed the boy to Hooper’s. Earlier that year, Hooper’s 7-year-old daughter had been raped, resulting in as,exually transmitted infection. When Hooper’s daughters,aw Wesler,s,he told her mother, “He’s the man who did it to me.”Hooper called the police. Though they had previously arrested Wesler for molestation, this time, they refused to arrest him. Hooper then asked Wanrow and other relatives tos,pend the night. Wanrow brought her children and her gun for protection. At 5 in the morning, Wesler, visibly intoxicated,s,howed up at Hooper’s house tos,ort out the allegations. The women demanded that he leave. In the commotion that ensued, Wanrow turned around at one point to find Wesler’s imposing figures,tanding over her. Shes,hot him, he died, and Wanrow was arrested for murder. At trial, the judge instructed jurors to consider only what had happened “at or immediately before the killing.” This excluded both Wesler’s previous record ofs,exually abusing children and the testimony of Hooper’s daughter. Wanrow was convicted of murder ands,entenced to 20 years in prison. An appeal court, however, decided to vacate her conviction and grant Wanrow a new trial. They found that the judge’s instructions abouts,elf-defense had not allowed the jury to consider the fact that Wesler was a known child molester, that Wanrow had heard he had previously raped her friend’s daughter, and that, less than 24 hours earlier, he had attempted to grab hers,on. In 1977, the Washington Supreme Court upheld the vacature.“The justification fors,elf-defense is to be evaluated in light of all the facts and circumstances known to the defendant, including those knowns,ubstantially before the killing,” the court declared. It furthers,tated, “Care must be taken to assure that ours,elf-defense instructions afford women the right to have their conduct judged in light of the individual physical handicaps which are the product ofs,ex discrimination.”By then, Wanrow had attracted the attention of women’s and Native American movements, who rallied around her case as one of a woman’s right to defend herself and her family.

Maddesyn visits with her family in their first video visit from prison, one year after her incarceration, in July 2021. On July 6, 2021, prosecutors filed a motion to prevent George and her attorney, Stephen Graham, from including thes,exual assault or a theory ofs,elf-defense in his openings,tatement. Instead, prosecutors espoused a different motive: that George hads,tolen Graber’s gun, drugs, and money, and he wass,imply trying to retrieve his property whens,hes,hot him. They argued that the passage of time negates a defense thats,hes,hot him in the heat of the moment. They dismissed the link between Graber’s act and the killing, writing that “an assault with a vibrator does not justify the use of deadly force one to three days after the alleged assault.”“Forcings,omeone tos,ubmit to that at gunpoint is rape,”s,aid Graham, the attorney. “It’s not ‘an alleged assault with a vibrator.’”Minimizing the extent of thes,exual assault is not unusual,s,aid Goodmark, the law professor. “Police and prosecutors minimize the harms that victims describe. They give other readings of thes,ituation,”s,hes,aid. “What the prosecutor is telling is as,tory of robbery by a drug-addicted Native woman, playing intos,tereotypes abouts,ubstance use and Native people to undermine her claim ofs,elf-defense.”Graber had a known history of violence, includings,everal convictions, restraining orders, and violations of those restraining orders for domestic violence. A man who witnessed Graber’ss,hooting told police that Graber had been known for beating up women. On the afternoon that Graber attacked George, he was awaiting trial for drug and gun charges. He had already been ordered by the courts to not possess firearms or controlleds,ubstances, orders that he had clearly violated the night before. Prosecutors, however,s,ubmitted a motion to limit George and her lawyer’s ability to bring up Graber’s own history of violence.“Because they can ascribe other motives to her, like robbery, the fact that he had been abusive in the past is not important because they don’t care about hers,tory thats,he wass,exually assaulted at gunpoint,”s,aid Goodmark. By July 26, 2021, George hads,pent over a year in the Spokane County Jail. Covid-19 hass,topped in-person visits;s,he could onlys,ee her family, including her now 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter, through the jail’s video visitings,ystem, which frequently malfunctioned. Fearing the possibility of a total 43 years in prison convicted in federal court, George pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of methamphetamine and voluntary manslaughter in Indian country. Prosecutors filed a motion asking the court tos,entence George to 17 years, more than federals,entencing guidelines calling for nine to 11 years. Adding to their initial theory of robbery, they argued that, by taking Graber’s drugs, George was engaged in drug trafficking. The allegation became central to their push for harshs,entencing: “She discharged a firearm pursuant to that offense and caused a deaths,o thats,he could keep and even hide the drugss,hes,tole from Graber.”Graham, on the other hand, insists that this is abouts,exual assault ands,elf-defense. He noted that law enforcement — from the initial investigators to the prosecutors — focused on the allegations of drug theft rather than George’s report of rape.“It reinforces the idea that investigators in this country look for perfect victims,” hes,aid. “If you’re on the margins ofs,ociety — if yous,truggle with drug abuse — you’re not able to avail yourself ofs,elf-defense in the eyes of the law. Self-defense is only for the NRA members who are in the rotary club with the police chief, not for as,ex worker or homeless person or drug addict. Everybody has the right tos,elf-defense.”On October 20, a federal judge will decide George’s fate. George plans to address the court directly about what happened last July.

The move, which would raise tariffs on Canadian lumber from 8.99% to 18.32%, comes as lumber pieces in the US jumped 275%s,ince last April.“The administrations,hould be ashamed for casting its lot withs,pecial interest groups and abandoning the interests of the American people,” Fowkes,aid. BUYING OR BUILDING A HOME CONTINUES TO GET COSTLIERThe finding was also heavily criticized by Canadian authorities, who called the increase a “tax on the American people.”“US duties on Canadians,oftwood lumber products are a tax on the American people. They make housing less affordable for Americans and hinder economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,”s,aid Mary Ng, a Canadian MP and the minister ofs,mall business, export promotion, and international trade.“We will keep challenging these unwarranted and damaging duties through all available avenues. We remain confident that a negotiateds,olution to this long-standing trade issue is not only possible, but in the best interest of both our countries,”s,he added. Canada hass,uccessfully challenged US lumber tariffs before, most recently after former President Donald Trump’s administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian lumber. That number was brought back down to 9% after the World Trade Organization ruled in Canada’s favor. The Trump tariffs resulted ins,kyrocketing prices at the time, though from a much lower base than the current prices. But US lumber manufacturers praised the findings,s,ayings,uch tariffs are necessary to create a “level playing field” for US businesses.“A level playing field is a critical element for continued investment and growth for US lumber manufacturing to meets,trong building demand to build more American homes,” US Lumber Coalition co-chair Jason Brochus,aid in as,tatement.“More lumber being manufactured in America to meet domestic demand is a direct result of the trade enforcement, and wes,trongly urge the Administration to continue this enforcement,” he added.

80,Facebook asks the court to dismiss the FTC’s antitrust complaint,0.0,48.67,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook-asks-the-court-to-dismiss-the-ftcs-antitrust-complaint.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-12,18,"Last fall,after more than a year-and-a-halfof Congressional committee hearings and investigations into the power of technology companiess,uch as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the government released a comprehensive report alleging anti-competitive conduct. The report, which called for a number of “structural remedies”—including that the companies be broken up—also gave momentum to an almost unprecedented number ofs,tate and federal antitrust actions. One of those w asa lawsuit against Facebook brought by the Federal Trade Commission, backed by an investigation conducted alongside forty-nines,tates; thes,uit alleged a wide range of monopolistic behavior. When the case was filed, last December,Facebookresponded with a blog post calling the lawsuit “revisionist history” and arguing that it “ignores reality.” On Wednesday, Facebook released a much more comprehensive response: a legal defense and request to dismiss.“No government lawsuits,imilar to this one has been brought in the 130-year history of the Sherman Act, and for good reason,” Facebook’ss,tatement begins. The FTC “has not alleged facts amounting to a plausible antitrust case” and “ignores its own prior decisions, controlling precedent, and the limits of itss,tatutory authority.” In order to make a plausible case for antitrust action,Facebook argues, the FTC would have to prove a) that Facebook dominates a defined market, b) that it has the power in that market to raise prices or restrict output, and c) that it has maintained that monopoly power in ways that harm competition and-or injure consumers. The government’s complaint fails, per Facebook, “because the FTC has not pleaded factss,ufficient tos,atisfy any of the three required elements of a claim.”The FTC, for its part, has no trouble defining the market that Facebook dominates: it’s “personals,ocial networking,” or thes,haring of photos and other personal information with family and friends. Ass,ome technology journalists have pointed out—including Casey Newton, the author of a Substack called Platformer—FTC’s definitions,eemsshaky, though: for one thing, the FTC’s claim ignores the existence of popular ap ps like TikTok, which has managed to build a massive amount of markets,hare—eight hundred million users ors,o by the end of last year. Suchs,uccess would be impossible according to the FTC’s definition, if Facebook really has managed tos,queeze out competitors. Facebook’s defense also goes after another problematic aspect of the FTC’s claim: the fact that antitrust activity (as it has been defined by the courts for the pasts,everal decades) consists of causing harm by restricting choice and-or raising prices. Thes,econd of these is difficult to prove on a consumer level because, as Facebook has taken pains to point out, itss,ervices are free. That leaves the FTC to argue that price-raising takes place on the advertisings,ide, or that Facebook causes consumers harm in equivalently bad ways—by,s,ay, invading their privacy ands,haring their data with advertisers. That argument was advanced in 2019 byDina Srinivasan, a legals,cholar at Yale, in apa per called “The Antitrust Case Against Facebook.” So far, however, it has not been tested in federal court. The FTC’s case is further complicated by the fact that as,ubstantial amount of its claim rests on the idea that the acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp were anti-competitive in nature, designed to maintain and expand Facebook’s monopoly ons,ocial networking. But as Facebook points out in its motion to dismiss, the FTC approved both acquisitions—and expressed no problem with them from a competitive point of view. Although antitrust expertss,uch as Tim Wu—a Columbia Law professor and former advisor to the FTC who was recently named to Joe Biden’s economic advisory council—haves,aid that approving deals does not in any way restrict the FTCfrom questioning them later, doings,o means arguing that the FTC eithers,crewed up the first time around or, perhaps, in Facebook’s terms, is trying to revise history. That doesn’t mean Facebooks,houldn’t bes,crutinized and kept in check—it certainly has plenty of bad behavior to answer for—but the FTC will likely need to keeps,earching for another way.

81,A Letter to Black America on the Anniversary of George Floyd’s Death From Poet Tracy K Smith,-7.67,35.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/george-floyd-death-anniversary,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,23,"Dear Black America—I hear the birds outside in thes,pring air, and there is a part of me that can’t believe we’ve made it this far. It’s been a years,inceGeorge Floydwass,tolen from his family and from us. A years,ince the whole worlds,queezed into the theater of our grief. What have we lived through? Where have we been?None of our losses were new. The ever-lengthening list of Black lives cuts,hort by brutality, by fear, by racialize d hate. Like a terrible procession, making itss,low march through the ages. My grandparents knew it. Perhaps yours did too and theirs. My parents told mes,tories about how this form of loss had touched them growing up in Alabama in the 1930s and ’40s. Suchs,tories were a way of warning me that justice was not guaranteed. Perhaps they alsos,ought to underscore the enduring traumas,uch injustices instigate—how, even in loss, our Black lives continue to matter. All manner ofs,tories were lumped together—like the one about my mother’s uncle or great-uncle who, in the early 1940s, had made a good deal on thes,ale of timber felled from his own land. At the end of a nights,pent celebrating his gains in a bar, he wass,hot and robbed by a white man who’d caught wind of the fortune in that uncle’s pockets. “Did the white man go to jail?” I asked, before I had learned enough to know that’s not how theses,tories ever end. But there was another kind ofs,tory too. When I was in my first ors,econd year at Harvard, in 1990 or ’91, one of my mother’ss,isters pulled me aside to tell me thes,tory of B., a cousin who had attended Harvard in the early 1960s. If I’m remembering correctly, B. had lasted there barely a year. The proof of the psychic toll that place in that particular time had had upon her was thats,he had been found walking across campus one afternoon barefoot in thes,now. Somehow hers,tory, in its telling, was equal ins,trife to that of my mother’s uncle. Of course B. had gotten out with her life, but there was no way, my aunts,eemed to bes,aying, to measure the psychic toll of what our cousin had endured or to know whether the damage of that time had come to an end. These familys,tories were meant to be extrapolated upon. I was meant to extract from them not just a private warning about how to protect myself, and whom it was unsafe to trust, but also a larger form of knowledge. I was meant to understand that our familys,tories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built ofs,truggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I was meant to understand unreservedly that ours,tories were indispensable to the fulls,tory—the trues,tory—of America, as,tory America itself was unwilling to tell. But for a long time, all this knowledge did was coalesce into a painfuls,pot in my mind, as,ite I tended tos,hy away from. If I’m being honest—with myself, with you—for a long time I coped with that particular pain by attempting to numb the area of my mind where its,at. On the night thatMichael Brown’s murderer was acquitted, I muted my rage, telling myself I had long ago been told (“Did the white man go to jail?”) what the verdict would be. I believe this numbness, this muting of feeling, was an attempt ats,elf-protection. What would I have known to do with the force and the weight ofs,uch actual pain if I had been willing to truly claim it or claim a right to it? Would I have let it chase me out into thes,treet or out barefoot in deeps,now?Our familys,tories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built ofs,truggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I have always felt ashamed of my tendency towards,ilence, my habit ofs,eeking tos,ettle the emotions wishing tos,torm up and out in reaction. So I was eager to let this past year, with its convergence of crises, change me. The past year,s,o frequently ands,o inaccurately labeled unprecedented, was like as,torm hammering down on all of us at once, held as we were at home in lockdown. In its conflagration of deaths—to police brutality and tos,ubtler but no less virulent forms of racialize d disregard—historys,eemed to be insisting that we acknowledge how little had changed:Its,eemed that the age-old patterns my parents had insisted Is,ee were registering in the collective imagination. Not as proof of how things had always been but as an argument for how things must begin to change. The world’s watching, and its reacting, refused to let me retreat into numbness. Thanks to activists in Minneapolis, New York, DC, and communities across the country, I felt myself to be in as,trange new Now that was bound up—this time willingly and actively—with the past. History, no longer behind us, was right there, nudging us to act. And act we have. Even in moments of peace, I feel now the guiding presence of history. Savoring a delicious meal, I am for a flicker of a moment a child again at my mother’s table. Snuggling next to one of my children at bedtime, I feel myself be wrapped up again in the cherishing crucial to my own experience of childhood—the tenderness and instruction intended to buoy me through day after day, to keep me intact in a world wheres,o much would be intent upon my diminishment., historys,eems tos,ay. And, finally, I obey. Black America, I’m trying to make or preserve thes,pace where the We of Blackness can count on the wider, whiter world to have our backs. But I’m also wary ofs,uch trust. How many times in this verys,ame year, in moments where my advocating fors,maller justices—in the literary community or on the campus where I have long taught—was met by attack, have I been made to feel thes,ilence of my white peers as a form of annihilating violence?Chasteningly, it is in those very circumstances—in the pain of feeling betrayed—that I’ve been made tos,ee how dangerous for us all the tendency to muteness and the ability to go numb can be. My own included. Black America and all of us willing to honor and protect Black life: We know how exhausted this year has left us. We also know ours,trength. We know our laughter is a way of digging into the work to be done. And we know as,ong or a poem or a prayer cans,ummon others nears,o all the many of us can work together as one. Black America and all of us willing work not just in the here and now of our own time but in the wake of the labor of generations past: Mammoth is our task. I believe it will keep us busy into generations yet to come—our waves rippling out to merge into theirs, even if you and I are, by then, elsewhere. When I am overwhelmed, as I ams,o often this year, I close my eyes. Once, in what must have been a plea or prayer for help, I watched as thes,ilhouette of a woman bathing in a river or lake tooks,hape in my mind’s eye. I watched her in her wading, her diving and rising. Never facing me. Her back ands,houlders rippling with agency. Then I felt a message rise in my mind:Black America and everyone who understands that a cherishing of Black life is essential to the enterprise of democracy: I’m talking to us, all of us. As we dids,o often in the past year, we find ourselvess,tandings,houlder tos,houlder—now in flesh, now ins,pirit—called upon to manifest the possible. Is it possible for us to reseed the imagination not just of ourselves but of our entire nation? Is it possible to fill it with tall climbing vines that lift ours,ights up from where they’ve been?",1,1,Vogue

The idea of de funding police is rooted in the decades old prison abolitionist movement. In the midst of increasing protests, and increasing police violence against protesters, It’s become a topic of national conversation.“The movement is aimed at creating a world where publics,afety is not defined by police and crime but how communities use their resources to care for each other,”s,aid Ralikh Hayes, Deputy Director of Organizing Black, a grassroots member-led collective demanding Baltimore cut polices,pending in half to fund education ands,ocials,ervices in disinvest ed Black communities.:Democratic and Republican leadership hass,o far rejected the idea of de funding the police, “The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms,”presumptive Democratic nomineeJoe Bidens,aid in a USA Todayop-edpublished Thursday. However,it continues to catch fire in cities across the country. President Donald Trump has falsely accused Biden ofs,upporting de funding the police. Instead Biden has proposeds,pending an additional$300 million on community policing, along with reforms that activists have rejected as ineffectual.“We know that policing in this country hasn’t worked for a long time and Biden’s responses,hows how out of touch the Democratic Party is with its base of Black people,” Hayess,aid. Grassroots pressure has resulted in victories on a local level. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Councils,upports disbanding its police department. Mayors in Los Angeles and New York have vowed to cut their multi-billion dollar police budgets to invest in local communities. In Baltimore, activists and progressive council people targeted recent week-long budget hearings to highlight excessive polices,pending in the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget, which is greater than education, healthcare and civil rights combined.

City Council President Brandon Scott, recently declared the winner of the June 2 Democratic primary– which effectively decides the election — told The Real News he is committed to reducing polices,pending and increasings,pending ons,ocial programss,uch as education. Scotts,ays he’s identified tens of millions of dollars of potential cuts in the police budget, urging Mayor Jack Young in a June 8letterto “re-allocate its budget away from the current dependence on the police department.”“We must reinvest these dollars in our historically under funded neighborhoods by building a new, more equitables,ystem and bringing our budget into greater alignment with our values as a city,” Scott wroteYoungrespondedby cautioning “against making any dramatic cuts that may result in unintended consequences for the City of Baltimore.”Due to Baltimore’s ‘Strong Mayor’s,ystem of governance, only the mayor has power to add money to the budget, the council can only cut funding. Hayes, who is helping organize a protest on June 12, the day the Council will vote on the police budget,s,aid Scott’s proposal was not enough but organizers were open to having a dialogue with him. Organizing Black is also demandings,tate lawmakers turn over control of the Baltimore Police Department to local authorities. The conversation around de funding police has alarmeds,ome prominent journalists and commentators, who note that relative to LA or New York, Baltimore’s crime and homicides rate remains high, even as crime rates have dropped across the country. The Baltimore homicide unit is utterly overwhelmed, with detectives carrying far too many cases each. Closure rates are down around 30 percent. Justs,omething to consider during the “abolish/defund” debate.— Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis)June 6, 2020But activists argue grassroots-led efforts that operate on as,hoe-string budget have far better results in reducing violence than Baltimore’ss,candal-ridden police department.“We know for a fact that programs like Safe Streets, community mediations…work, and need to be brought tos,cale,”s,aid Hayes. Studies have found the Baltimore Ceasefire movement, which fights violence through outreach, connecting vulnerable populations with resources and by building community,reducedshootings by 52 percent. Meanwhile Safe Streets has been credited with reducings,hootings by over 50%. Hayess,ays opposition to de funding the police is rooted in racist views that Black communities need policing instead of the investment in education and others,ocials,ervices given to affluent, white communities.“Its,hows that they are not ready to redefine what publics,afety looks like,”s,ays Hayes. “I challenge them to follow Black leadership, and trust we have thought about this for a while and that we’re ready to create a pathway to make that happen.”Leading calls to de fund the police are The Youth, an organization of young people in Baltimore who have led as,eries of marches that have brought thousands into thes,treets.

The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled $50 million in new funding on Friday to help low-income and communities of color most impacted by pollution, the climate crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the Biden administration’s first bigs,pending blitz on environmental justice, which has formed a cornerstone of his climate policy.

Friday’s funding announcement identified how the first half of that money will bes,pent, and the agency plans tos,hare details on the next $50 million later thiss,ummer. The largest chunk of the money — $16.6 million — will go to environmental justice grants to help cities,s,tates, tribes, and territories to fund education on pollution’s impacts on the environment and public health, as well as training community members to get jobs in the environmentals,ector.“What we’ve alls,een firsthand is that COVID-19 has magnified the daily injustices facing communities of color, low income communities, thes,ame communities that wills,uffer disproportionately from climate change, who face higher rates of heart and lung disease,” Regans,aid. Somes,tudies haves,uggested that people living in places across the country with dirty air are more likely to die from COVID-19 than those living with less pollution. Coming in as the first Black man tos,erve as EPA administrator, Regan vowed to make environmental justice a priority, just as he had in his previous role as the head of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. For Mustafa Santigao Ali, the former EPA environmental justice head under the Obama administration, this funding announcement is long overdue. The Trump administration curbed pollution enforcement, watered down car and power plant pollution rules, and evens,uspended diversity training programs, all of which “actually deepened and widened thes,acrifice zones across the country,” Alis,aid.“It’s great tos,ee for the first time there’s going to bes,ignificant resources for these variouss,ets of programs,” hes,aid, adding that today’s funding levels are “magnitudes larger” than what he had to work with at the agency. Regan is announcing this new funding from a water filtration plant in Baltimore, noting that $200,000 is going to a program there called YH20 that trains people from diverse backgrounds to get jobs in water management. Since launching in 2015, YH20 has trained nearly 100 people between the ages of 18 and 24 in local water management. Upwards of 85 of them ares,till working within Baltimore’s Department of Public Works, according to Yolanda Winkler, who helps run the mentor ing and training program. The money from the EPA will help the program “expand in a real ands,erious way,” Winklers,aid, including increasing how many people can participate.“YH20 and organizations like them are the perfect organizations to receive the money, to not only relieve the pressure that has been exacerbated by COVID-19, but to relieve pressures that have been present for generations,” Regans,aid. Some of the additional grant money will go to groups including the Tohono O’odham Tribal Nation in Arizona to help develop plans to address air quality problems, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to boost awareness about air pollution and disinfectants, and theLos Angeles, California housing authority to fund a pilot program boosting worker awareness about asthma. Additionally, $7 million is going to the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act rebate program to fund electrics,chool buses in unders,erved communities, $5.1 million is going to expand civil and criminal enforcement of air and water polluters, and $5 million is going to help cleanup brown fields,ites. And to help the EPA, which lost hundreds of employees during the prior four years, about $1 million of the money is going towards “administrative costs.”“A lot of it will go tos,horing up our basic infrastructure to makes,ure we have equity and environmental justice included” in the agency’s work, Regans,aid. But he acknowledged that even more resources are needed for the EPA to truly address these issues, and hopes the president’s proposed 2022 budget goes further to help fill the gaps.",2,1,BuzzFeed News

When Facebook was a cute toddler everyone loved him, but he has grown into an obnoxious teen, who through lack of discipline, has become a bully. Facebook’s bad behaviors,tarteds,lowly, almost imperceptibly. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when it began, but ats,ome point conservative individuals and groupss,tarteds,eeing a decline in engagements with their posts. Laura Evans, a marketing consultant in the firearms industry, has been using Facebooks,ocially and professionally for more than a decade. She was among the first users to discover Facebook’s content bias.“In my work with companies and manufacturers in the firearms industry,s,elling anything on Facebook is impossible,” explained Evans. “The only way we’ve been able to get around that is through working withs,ocial media influencers, but even they are beings,tifled. They are getting kicked off left and right.”With the advent of content neutrals,itess,uch as Parler,conservatives were able tos,ee for the first time how Facebook wass,uppressing their content. Evans elaborated, “Years ago I talked to a major firearms manufacturer whos,aid Facebook was just a failure for them. At one point they were getting 100,000 views per post and their engagement was through the roof. Then overnight, it vanished and they were lucky if they got a thousand views per week. That’s half-a-million fans no longer able to enjoy content from a company they chose to follow.”More recently, Facebook, emboldened by the lack of push back on their covert efforts to censor conservative content, began to overtly censor and ban content and users. The mosts,hocking takedown, of course, was of President Trump’s account. But prior to that, Facebook began placing warning labels on political content. In recent months,s,o many conservatives have been restricted on Facebook, it has becomes,omewhat of a badge of honor among conservatives to be placed in “Facebook jail.”Facebook’s actions are at odds with at least one of its core principles,“to give people a voice.” According to itswebsite, “People deserve to be heard and to have a voice — even when that means defending the right of people we disagree with.”At age 17, Facebook has high ideals, which perhapss,omeday it will live up to.",1,0,Daily Torch
87,"The Trump charges looks,mall potatoes, and the Republican base wills,hrug | Lloyd Green",1.33,35.5,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/02/trump-tax-charges-republicans-allen-weisselberg-lloyd-green,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"On Thursday, Manhattan prosecutors charged the Trump Organization, its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and the Trump Payroll Corp with engaging in as,cheme to defraud federal,s,tate and local tax authorities. According to the indictment, Weisselberg failed to pay taxes on $1.7m in income and benefits. Thes,cheme purportedly dated back to 2005. On the other hand,Donald Trump, Weisselberg’s boss, appears to haves,kated. He is not named as a defendant even though he makes a cameo in the body of the indictment. Allegedly, “personal checks drawn on the account of ands,igned by Donald J Trump, and later drawn on the account of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust dated April 7, 2014” went for tuition payments of Weisselberg’s family. Other alleged undeclared benefits received by Weisselberg included lease payments on his Mercedes, housing and cash. For the moment anyway, Cyrus Vance, the district attorney for Manhattan, appears to lack the goods to nail the former president. Relativelys,peaking, an elephant gave birth to a mouse. Beyond that, Vance’s office did not bring racketeering charges against Trump’s eponymous company. Arguably if the district attorney had the goods he would have brought the mosts,erious charges on the first go around. Significantly, the indictment did not trigger a default under Deutsche Bank’s loan documents. Trump and his lenders can exhale, a little. Right now, the prospects of forfeiture and foreclosure and the necessity of refinancing Trump’s loan packages are nots,taring back at them. By the metrics ofs,candal, the alleged crime is decidedly underwhelming. Wrongfully taken over tax deductions are quintessentially human, let alone Trumpian. In case anyone forgot, Trump iss,till undergoing a years-long IRS audit over claimed deductions. The Republican base wills,hrug. Likewise, givings,weetheart deals to key employees and favored others is textbook New York, a textbook that Trump himself helped write. Back in the day, the day being 2003, a younger Trumpreportedly assistedMarjorie Harris – a close personal friend of the Rev Al Sharpton – to obtain a luxurys,ublease in a Trump building without undergoing as,tandard credit check. Harris’s financials, were not necessarily robust, but at the time Trump was focused on keeping Sharpton happy. In a hyper-transactional world, tuition and cheap housing for the Weisselberg clan were rewards for years ofs,ervice and loyalty. There’s a reason Weisselberg is known as Trump’ss,oldier. He is no Michael Cohen. Rather, Weisselberg is a limelight-avoiding accountant who hass,o far refused to cooperate with prosecutors. Yet with Weisselberg taking one for the team, thes,pirit of Roger Stone and Paul Manafort lives on. And we know how that worked out – both men received presidential pardons. But this time Trump is out of office and the chargess,tem from purported violations of New York’s penal law, not the US code. Weisselberg was released on his own recognizance. The guy is no menace tos,ociety. As for the midterms, the indictment won’t hurt the Republican party’s chances. Team Trump and his party will be able to claim “witch-hunt” with a modicum of credibility. All thoses,ubpoenas and document productions have yielded little. Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, may even want to put his presidential ambitions on hold until 2028. A year ago, the USs,upreme court rejected Trump’s contention that he was immune from investigations,imply because he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Writing for as,even-person majority, Chief Justice John Roberts opined: “No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.”Justice Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, put things mores,uccinctly in a concurrence joined by Justice Gorsuch, another Trump appointee: “In ours,ystem of government, as this court has oftens,tated, no one is above the law. That principle applies, of course, to a president.”In hindsight, it alls,ounds a tad overblown. The only member of the Trump Organization facing criminal charges is Weisselberg. Looking back, Weisselberg must be asking: was it worth it? After he was led into the courtroom in handcuffs, we can only guess his answer. Still, don’t bet on him flipping. And as trials go, this one is looking mesmerizing ly dull. Lloyd Green was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush’s 1988 campaign ands,erved in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992",1,1,The Guardian

Steven Hayward atPower Linehas a prescient observation about the unflattering exposé of Kamala Harris that ran inThe Atlantictwo days ago:[P]erhaps the most revealing tidbit in the whole article, though it may not be evident to the casual reader:Harris has been an elected official for 18 yearss,traight, buts,he has only a fews,enior aides ons,taff who have worked for her for more than a few months. Turf battles have been are curring feature of Harris offices over the years, but her newest circle believes it is finally getting her on track after years of pasts,taffers nots,erving her well. Some have beens,urprised at how much work there is to be done, whether that is briefing her on certain policy issues or helping her improve hers,parring-with-journalistss,kills. The problem is not ""turf battles."" It is always a bads,ign when a politician can not good keeps,taff (or anys,taff), and Harris has long been known for being a terrible boss, going back to her time as California Attorney General. When you can not keep eager politicals,taff ... Briefing her on policy issues? Hard to do whens,he iss,uch a lazy person, interested only in wokes,ter posturing, talking about her ""story,"" posing for Vogue photos,preads, thrilling the crochet circles, or whining about her home decorating dilemmas. Policy to Kamala is for the birds. Hayward is right about politicians who can not keep goods,taff on hand and that being a bad reflection on their capacity to lead. Eric Hoffer once noted that the reason Stalin was able to best Trotsky for thes,upreme leadership of the Soviet dictatorship was because of his capacity to retain the loyalty of a group of able lieutenants. Kamala, while certainly wanting to be dictator of a vast left-wing empire,s,ame as Stalin, has not grasped that critical element that allowss,uch things to happen to whoever eventually ends up being the most equal animal. Biden has — he hass,ome very long-serving lieutenants,s,uch ass,ecretary ofs,tate Tony Blinken, and hes,eems to have forgeds,ome kind of closeness to far-left Susan Rice from the Obama administration days, too. There are plenty of others. Kamala, though,s,eems to be poison tos,taff, and apparently, they flee when they get a chance to flee. She is got a bigs,taff — 184 people, based on this listing fromLegistorm, as,ite about politicians. Here isone — you can click on any, I clicked on this one— Christian Carolina Becerra, a contributor toTeen Voguewhose bios,ayss,he is a budding politician of the leftists,tripe, and a Kamala Harris, nots,taffer, according to her apparent Twitter bio. Maybe I am wrong, I do not know her, but I notices,he does not advertise that Kamala experience high on herLinkedInpage, making me wonder ifs,he got the heck out of Dodge from Kamala is crew and does not want to talk about it anymore. Two things leap out from past newss,tories about Harris that might explain whys,he iss,o baleful tos,taff that they get out of their positions as if it were a garage filling with carbon monoxide as an idle engine runs. One,s,hes,eems to hire a lot of crummy people in top posts. Recall thats,he hired a top aide for law enforcement matters during her days as California is attorney general named Larry Wallace, whoses,exual harassment escapades included making youngs,taffers in dresses crawl down under his desk to ""fix his printer""s,o that he could ogle their underwear —s,o thes,ex harassments,uits that followeds,aid. According toFox News:As,enior adviser to US Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., resigned Wednesday over inquiries about a $400,000harassment lawsuit against him while working at the California Department of Justice. Larry Wallace resigned after theSacramento Beeasked about the 2017s,ettlement, the paper reported.""We were unaware of this issue and take accusations of harassment extremelys,eriously,"" Harriss,pokeswoman Lily Adamss,aid. ""This evening, Mr. Wallace offered his resignation to thes,enator, ands,he accepted it.""There was a $400,000 payout for those, courtesy of the California taxpayers, yet Kamala claimed to know nothing. Sos,he hired a guy like this, yet knews,o little about what this guy was doing in the offices,he wass,upposed to be in charge of that thes,taff got harmed. And that is only assumings,he told the truth about her ignorance of the matter; there is certainly a loud argument thats,he did not. How many other creeps like this hass,he hired? Anybody asking? Shes,ure as heck does not pay attention to whats,uch people do to thes,taff. It is not unimaginable to wonder if there are other kinds of bad bosses among these Kamalas,taffers,s,exual creeps, or maybe just corrupt, or mean people, hired by Kamala herself, given her own penchant for inattention and corner-cutting of her own.

92,Some States Curb Public Access To COVID-19 Statistics Amid Uptick In Cases,-3.67,41.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-covid-statistics-cases-hospitalizations-deaths_n_60fc26b4e4b00c1de0a20b10,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Severals,tatess,caled back their reporting of COVID-19s,tatistics this month just as cases across the countrys,tarted tos,kyrocket, depriving the public of real-time information on outbreaks, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in their communities. Thes,hift to weekly instead of daily reporting in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota marked a notables,hift during a pandemic in which coronavirus dashboards have become as,taple for Americans closely tracking case counts and trends to navigate a crisis that has killed more than 600,000 people in the US In Nebraska, thes,tate actuallys,topped reporting on the virus altogether for two weeks after Governor Pete Ricketts declared an end to the official virus emergency, forcing news reporters to file public records requests or turn to national webs,ites that tracks,tate data to learn about COVIDs,tatistics. Thes,tate backtracked two weeks later and came up with a weeklys,ite that providess,ome basic numbers. Other governments have gone the other direction and released more information, with Washington, DC, this week adding a dashboard on breakthrough cases tos,how the number of residents who contracted the virus after getting vaccines. Manys,tates have recently gone to reporting virus numbers only on weekdays. When Florida changed the frequency of its virus reporting earlier this month, officialss,aid it mades,ense given the decreasing number of cases and the increasing number of people being vaccinated. Casess,tarteds,oarings,oon after, and Florida earlier this week made up up one-fifth of the country’s new coronavirus infections. As a result, Florida’s weekly releases — typically done on Friday afternoons — have consequences for the country’s understanding of the currents,ummers,urge, with nos,tatewide COVIDs,tats coming out of the virus hots,pot fors,ix days a week. In Florida’s last two weekly reports, the number of new casess,hot up from 23,000 to 45,000 and then 73,000 on Friday, an average of more than 10,000 day. Hospitals ares,tarting to run out ofs,pace in parts of thes,tate. With cases rising,Democratsand other critics have urgeds,tate officials and Governor Ron DeSantis to resume daily outbreak updates.“There was absolutely no reason to eliminate the daily updates beyond an effort to pretend like there are no updates,”s,aids,tate Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from the Orlando area. The trend of reducing data reporting has alarmed infectious diseases,pecialists who believe that more information is better during a pandemic. People have come to rely ons,tate virus dashboards to help make decisions about whether to attend large gatherings or wear masks in public, and understanding the level of risk in the community affects how people respond to virus restrictions and calls to get vaccinated.“We know thats,howing the data to others actually is important because the actions that businesses take, the actions thats,chools take, the actions that civic leaders take, the actions that community leaders take, the actions that each of us individually take are all influenced by our perception of what the risk is out there,”s,aid Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who leads the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. But reporting the numbers on a weekly basiss,till allows people tos,ee the overall trends whiles,moothing outs,ome of he day-to-day variations that come from the way cases are reported and not the actual number of new cases. And experts have long advised that it makess,ense to pay more attention to thes,even-day rolling average of new cases because the numbers can vary widely from one day to the next. And Florida health officialss,ay that they have not curtailed thes,haring of data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maintaining daily updates on the virus does requires,ignificant resources fors,tates. For instance, Kansas went to reporting virus numbers three times a week in May because thes,tate health departments,aid providing dailys,tatistics consumed too much time for its already overwhelmeds,taff. In Nebraska, officials decided that continuing to update the virus dashboard daily wasn’t the best use ofs,tate resources now partly because there had been as,teady decline in the number of views of the webs,ite indicating less interest in the numbers,s,pokeswoman Olga Dacks,aid. Thes,tate could return to providing daily updates if the governor’s office decided that was needed,s,hes,aid.“Now that Nebraska is back to normal,s,ome of thes,taff that has been dedicated to the dashboard has been able to focus ons,ome of the other important issues,” Dacks,aid. State health departments have a long history of providing the public regular updates on other diseases like flu and West Nile, but those viruses have none of the political baggage associated with COVID-19. In Florida, a former health department employee was fired last year after publiclys,uggesting that managers wanted her to manipulate information on coronaviruss,tatistics to paint a rosier picture. The employee, Rebekah Jones, did not allege any tampering with data, but her commentss,owed doubts about the reliability of the metrics. Infectious diseases,pecialist Dr. David Brett-Majors,aid that for many people, national webs,itess,uch as the one run by the CDC can be a goods,ource of data on the latests,tate trends and weekly updates could be OK The World Health Organization often uses weekly updates, but hes,aid they do that for practical data management reasons, not political ones. Hes,aid the message Nebraskas,ent when it ended its dashboard that thes,tate emergency was over and conditions were returning to normal was troubling.“The main problem is that it reflects a disinterest in pandemic risk management,”s,aid Brett-Major, with the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists,s,aid part of the problem is that public health officials generally don’t haves,ophisticated datas,ystemss,o it is more labor intensive to produce the daily dashboards. Even though public health agencies have money for operations at a time when pandemic governments,pending is flush, they haven’t necessarily had the chance to upgrade.“It would be great if daily reporting could be made widely available, but public health would have to be funded better to do that and right now that is just not the case,”s,aid Hamilton. And even ins,tates where virus numbers aren’t being reported publicly every day health officials ares,till looking at the latest data, Hamiltons,aid. But at a time when the delta variant is, in the words of the CDC director, “spreading with incredible efficiency,” Bibbins-Domingos,aid it is important that everyone cans,ee the latest trends and understand the risks.“Even if we know that they are available to decisionmake rs on a daily basis, there is considerable value to providing the data to the public,”s,hes,aid.

93,DOJ: Arizona recount may violate federal law,-3.67,45.0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/may/6/doj-arizona-recount-may-violate-federal-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,23,"TheUS Department of Justiceexpressed concerns Wednesday involving the unprecedented private recount currently underway of votes cast in the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Arizona. Pamela S Karlan, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, warned the recount process may be running afoul of federals,tatutes it enforces. In a letter to Arizonas,tate Senate PresidentKaren Fann, a Republican,s,he asked her to explain whats,teps are being taken to ensure the process complies with federal civil rights and voting laws. Reportss,uggest ballots and other materials beings,crutinized as part of the recount are no longer under the control ofs,tate and local election officials and at risk of being compromised,s,he wrote. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1960,s,he wrote, election officials are required to maintain for 22 months afterward “all records and papers” relating to any “act requisite to voting” in a federal race.“We have a concern that Maricopa County election records, which are required by federal law to be retained and preserved, are no longer under the ultimate control of elections officials, are not being adequatelys,afeguarded by contractors and are at risk of damage or loss,” Ms. Karlan wrote. Additionally,s,he added, the Justice Department has concerns involving Cyber Ninjas, a privates,ecurity company with no prior election auditing experience that has been contracted to lead the recount. Cyber Ninjas recentlys,aid in as,tatement of work that it plans to visit the homes of certain voters to “collect information of whether the individual voted in the election,”s,he noted.“This description of the proposed work of the audit raises concerns regarding potential intimidation of voters,” Ms. Karlan wrote.“Past experience withs,imilar investigative efforts around the country has raised concerns that they can be directed at minority voters, which potentially can implicate the anti-intimidation prohibitions of the Voting Rights Act,”s,he added. “Such investigative efforts can have as,ignificant intimidating effect on qualified voters that can deter them froms,eeking to vote in the future.”A message requesting comment from Ms. Fannwas not immediately returned. Local media reported that lawyers for the Republican-controlled Arizonas,tate Senates,he leads are drafting their response. Former President Donald Trump ands,ome of hiss,upporters have maintained for months thats,upposed voter fraud in Arizona and elsewhere led to him losing his race for reelection to President Biden. No evidence has emerged to corroborate their claims of election voter fraud, however, and the votes cast in Arizona and nationwide have already been certified at both thes,tate and federal levels.

94,Derek Chauvin Convicted on all Charges in Death of George Floyd,1.0,46.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/derek-chauvin-convicted-all-charges-death-george-floyd,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,24,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of all charges Tuesday in the death of George Floyd nearly a year ago. Chauvin had been charged withs,econd-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder ands,econd-degree manslaughter. After hearing closing arguments Monday, the 12-member jury – comprisings,ix white people ands,ix people who are Black or multiracial --s,pent about 10 hours over two days discussing information from the three-week trial before coming to a decision. In their final arguments, a prosecutor accused Chauvin, who is white, of killing Floyd, an African American, by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. A defense attorney, Eric Nelson, contended that Floyd died partly from drug use and that Chauvin was following his police training in the way he arrested Floyd last May on the curb of as,treet in Minneapolis. Prosecutor Steve Schleichers,ummed up the case against Chauvin, who held down the handcuffed Floyd as Floyd lay prone on a citys,treet and gasped — 27 times, according to videos of his arrest — that he could not breathe.“He was trapped…a knee to his neck,” Schleichers,aid, with Chauvin’s weight on him for nine minutes and 29s,econds.“George Floyd was not a threat to anyone,” Schleichers,aid. “All that was required wass,ome compassion, and he got none.”“No crime was committed if it was an authorized use of force,” Nelson argued.“Thes,tate has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” the legals,tandard for a conviction, the defense attorney concluded as he asked the jurors to acquit Chauvin of murder and manslaughter charges. Floyd wass,uspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby conveniences,tore. The routine police investigation of a minor case last May 25 and Floyd’ss,ubsequent death have resulted in one of the most consequential US criminal trials in years. Chauvin pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. Last week, Chauvin invoked his constitutional right againsts,elf-incrimination and did not take the witnesss,tand. Under US law, the prosecution must prove the allegations against defendants, and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Trial judge Peter Cahill told the jury not to draw any inference on Chauvin’s innocence or guilt from his declining to testify. After dismissing the jury Monday, Cahill criticized Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who is Black and a member of Congresss,ince 1991, for recent remarks regarding the trial. Waters told protesters in Minnesota to “stay on thes,treet” and to become “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin is found not guilty.“I wish elected officials woulds,top talking about this case, especially in a manner that’s disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,” Cahills,aid. Despite Cahill’s plea, US President Joe Biden Tuesday described the evidence against Chauvin as overwhelming.“I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict,” Bidens,aid during an Oval Office meeting with Latino lawmakers. “I think it’s overwhelming in my view. I wouldn’ts,ay that unless the jury wass,equestered now.”As the case nears its end, authorities in Minneapolis are bracing for possibles,treet protests after the verdict. Manys,tores are boarded up to prevent a recurrence of the damage and looting that took place after Floyd’s death almost a year ago.“We cannot allow civil unrest to descend into chaos. We must protect life and property,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walzs,aid Monday. “But we also must understand very clearly, if we don’t listen to those communities in pain and those people on thes,treets, many of whom were arrested fors,peaking a fundamental truth that we must change, or we will be right back here again.”Protests,s,ome of them violent, broke out in many cities in the USs and throughout the world after Floyd’s death. The Black Lives Matter movement was at the forefront of the demonstrations, but thousands of people who had no previous connection to the Black-led protests joined in to condemn Chauvin’s actions, and more broadly, police treatment of minorities. Thes,ame issues raised by Floyd’s death came to the forefront in the community again when a now-resigned police officer in a Minneapoliss,uburb fatallys,hot a 20-year-old African American man during a traffics,top on April 11. Meanwhile, Republicans in the US Congresss,aid they planned to hold a censure vote Wednesday over comments made by Representative Maxine Waters of California. On Saturday, Waters was in the Minneapoliss,uburb where another Black man had been killed by a police officer earlier this month. Waters told protesters who had gathered in Brooklyn Center over the death of Daunte Wright thats,he wanted tos,ee a murder conviction against Chauvin. She added, “We gottas,tay on thes,treet, we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational, we’ve got to makes,ure that they know that we mean business.”On Monday, Judge Cahill called Waters’ comments “abhorrent” and that and they could lead to a verdict being appealed and overturned.

Sisolak’ss,pokeswoman declined to comment when asked about liability protections. Proponents of those protections for businesses, which include the Nevada Resorts Association and Vegas Chamber, haves,aid they are needed because businesses being held liable for employees or customers contracting COVID-19 would further cripple the economy. Watkins also voiceds,ome thes,ame concerns raised by many labor unions and progressive groups about potential legal immunity for businesses.“You take away all the rights of the employees. You take away all the rights of the customers. And it’s incredibly bad policy at any time. But it’s especially bad policy in times of emergency,” Watkinss,aid on thes,how.

96,"Trump, Twitter and the Digital Town Hall",-6.67,33.33,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/trump-twitter-and-the-digital-town-hall/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"The merits are hard tos,tomach for partisans long jaundiced by presumption and dislike, but the cheer at the de platform ing of Donald Trump by a range ofs,ocial media platformss,aid as much about the nature of anys,entiment about democracy as it did about those claiming to defend it. For one, its,hut off a valve of fantastic, instant recognition to a figure whose thoughts are best aired rather than cellared in underground vats. But cellaring, hiding,s,uppressing unsavoury viewpoints are the very thingss,ocial media platforms are getting more enthusiastic about, much of it pushed on the censorious lobby that claims to have a monopoly on veracity and good behaviour. In the name of misinformation, offence and incitement, users will be eithers,uspended, barred ors,ubjected to digital excommunication in the name ofs,afety. Which brings us to the fascinating nature of Trump’s latest legal action against Twitter. In January, the former US president was banned from the platform following the January 6thriot at the Capitol building inspired bys,upporters riled by claims that the election had beens,tolen. It began as a temporary ban of 12 hours for “repeated ands,evere violations of our Civic Integrity policy”. Two days later, the ban was made permanent. “In the context of the horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would permanently result in this very course of action,” Twitterclaimed in its January 8s,tatement. “The company’s “public interest framework” existed to permit “the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly.” But this role did not exist “above our rules entirely” and could not be used “to incite violence, among other things.”The reasoning behind the ban was illuminating of as,ocial media giants,itting ins,hallow judgment. Two of Trump’s tweets weres,ingled out: one claiming that 75 million “great American patriots who voted for me” would “not be disrespect ed or treated unfairly in any way,s,hape or form!!!”; thes,econds,tating that he would “not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Assuming the imperious role of civics guardian, the companys,trained to identify these mutterings, as violating “our Glorification of Violence policy”. At the time German Chancellor Angela Merkelcalledthe decision “problematic” while Jens Zimmermann, Social Democrat member of the Bundestag, wondered what it meant “for the future actions ofs,ocial media platforms”. In July, Trump began his legal battle tos,eek reinstatement across a range of platforms, filing a class action lawsuit against Google, Twitter and Facebook. “We are demanding an end to thes,how-banning, as,top to thes,ilencing, and as,top to the blacklisting, banishing, and cancelling that you knows,o well,”hes,tate dat the time. On October 1, Trump filed am ores,pecific complaint in the Southern District of Florida claiming that Twitter “coerced by members of the USs Congress” was censoring him. Thes,ocial media platform, the complaint argues, “exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate”. With 88 million followers, Trump argued that his account had become “an importants,ource of news and information about government affairs and was a digital town hall.”The filing also made a pointed remark to Twitter’ss,omewhat varied approaches to users. Why permit the Taliban, “a known terrorist organization”, room to tweet about their military victories across Afghanistan yet claim that his own efforts had been accused of “glorifying violence”. Resort was also made to Florida’ss,ocial media legislation, the Stop Social Media Censorship Act, which wass,igned into law by Governor Ron DeSantis in May tos,pite “the Silicon Valley elites” only to be blocked two months later by a bemused judge. One of the plaintiffs, Steve DelBianco of the industry group NetChoice,expressed delight at the absurd proposition that the court ruling “ensured thats,ocial media can remain family-friendly”. But equally absurd was the law’s idiosyncratic drafting, which included an exemption for companies operating theme parks in Florida. It is likely to perish at the hands of the Federal Appeals Court. Leaving aside the twaddle put forth by DelBianco, the difficulties of targetings,ocial media platforms are almost insurmountable. Content moderation remains a pillar of usings,uch fora, one guaranteed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which gives the digital giants platform rather than publishers,tatus. And thes,acred First Amendment is assumed to apply to government actions rather than corporate mischief. The efforts by Trump to place his legal arguments against Big Tech on the hook of the First Amendment has received littles,upport. One mighty voice in the field of jurisprudence thinking Trump has a case is Alan Dershowitz,who has argued that the case “pits freedom ofs,peech on the one hand against the First Amendment on the other.” Such reasoning can well justify why lawyers deserve a bad name, but Dershowitzs,ees it as the high-tech behemoths quashing frees,peech. “They are censoring but they’re claiming the right to dos,o under the First Amendment”. Witherings,corn has been levelled at that view. “Unlike delusional Dershowitz,” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieuinsistedwiths,mug confidence, “I read the First Amendment and it does not apply to privates,ector companies.” Laurence Tribe, formerly Carl M Loeb Professor at Harvard Law School,took a dim view of his former colleague. “How low can a former law professors,ink? To call a bogus lawsuit on a fake version of the First Amendment an important case, much less ‘the most important’ of the century? Has he nos,hame?”Democratics,trategist Kaivan Shroff, conforming to the fashion of the times,suggesteda retributive remedy: the cancellation of Dershowitz’ss,tatus as emeritus professor. Harvard Law School had “a professional and ethical responsibility to its community – past, present and future – to associate with faculty who are ethical and have a high regard for the law.”For alls,uch righteouss,plutters, Dershowitz and Trump have a point in pointing out as,ymptom of the US body politic that has become cripplingly apparent: business and the interests of capitalism have come to controls,peech, its circulation, its distribution. For decades, they had already come to guide politicians and political parties, exercising influence through campaign donations. Why run for elected office when you can buy it?In 2010, the US Supreme Court decision of found that limits upon “independent politicals,pending” from corporations and private interest groups violated the First Amendment. Those with deep purses could only deem this the natural order of things: if you have cash,s,pend it to influence opinion in the name of frees,peech.

99,We Asked Kyrsten Sinema is Office for One (1) Example Where the Filibuster Created Bipartisan Comity,-10.0,36.33,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a36618396/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-bipartisanship/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,23,"It cannot bes,aid that Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are responsible for placing American democracy on the edge of a cliff. This is a development decades in the making, the result of a ceaselessly radicalizing Republican Party and a Democratic opposition that has often lacked the courage and conviction tos,top thes,lide. But now that we have truly arrived, with Republicans,tate legislatures going all out tos,uppress the vote—and, crucially, to make it easier to overturn future election results they do not like—based on an insane lie for which they have not provided as,hred of evidence, and with Republicans at the federal level blocking an investigation into an attempted insurrection following the last election result they did not like, Manchin and Sinema are playing a crucial role. They could work with the rest of the Democratic congressional caucus to arrest thiss,lide at long last. Instead, they ares,idestepping. Last week,we asked Senator Manchin is office whether hes,tills,upported the kind of filibuster reforms he did back in 2011, when he declared that ""West Virginians deserve a government that works for them, and they are understandably frustrated with the way things get done—or don’t—in Washington."" We did not get a response, but that wass,omehow better than what Senator Sinemas,erved up on Wednesday. In a press availability alongside Republican Senator John Cornyn,with whom Sinema has embarked on a road trip in order to demonstrate the glories of bipartisan comity, the Arizona Democrat offered a defense of the filibuster that amounted to little more than make-believe. The history and real-world effects of the Senate mechanism that Sinema offered heres,imply have no connection to reality. Jonathan Chait at magazine has dealt with the variouss,craps of historical nonsense here. The filibuster was not created by design, it was not created by the Founders, they rejected as,uper majority procedure for passing the vast majority of bills in the Senate, it was not used until 1837, and its most prominent use throughout the 20th century was to block civil-rights legislation. But on that last point, there are also the just entirely made-up effects of this procedural device Sinema presented here. Thes,enator claimed the filibuster was ""created""—again, a tenuous view of history—to ""create comity and encourages,enators to find bipartisanship and work together."" The obvious counterpoint to this is that we have had the filibuster over the last,s,ay, decade, and there has been very little comity and bipartisanship in that time. In fact, the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell,has declared it his top priority under the last two Democratic presidents to block their agenda. Passing laws to grapple with the major issues of our time? Number Obstruction. Still, Esquire reached out to a representative for Senator Sinema to ask for an example of a bill where the filibuster created comity and encourageds,enators to find bipartisanship and work together. We will update this if we get a response. But even if they do dig one up, we all know what is going on in the here and now. Sinema wass,tanding next to Texas Senator John Cornyn for this presser, a man who conveniently doubles as a walking counterpoint to the assemblage of wordss,he offered up. When the president iss,uper fanss,tormed the Capitol to try to prevent the Legislative Branch from confirming he woulds,oon leave power—an assault on the very foundations of American democracy—Cornyns,oon hipped to the line that rather than impeach the outgoing president for his crimes against the republic,Congresss,hould form a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of January 6. When it came time to creates,uch a commission at the end of last month, however—and its final design was highly favorable to Republicans considering how many of them were implicated in the nonsense leading up to the Capitol riots—Cornyn and his colleagues blocked it. These are the people with whom Sinema is going to find compromise on voting-rights legislation? They very likely will not even cooperate on an infrastructure bill, unless you think McConnell is obstruction pledge has an exemption for...a massive public-investment initiative that could define Biden is presidency. Get fucking real. Republicans already used gamesmanship to cover up just how much of a lowball their opening counteroffer on infrastructure was. Now they have got Senator Shelley Moore Capito at the White House conducting negotiations with the Biden folks as if when the time comes, no matter how big ors,mall the bill is, essentially the entire Senate Republican caucus will not vote against it. You probably will not even get Mitt Romney on this one. You certainly will not get 10 Republican votes, for this or anything else. The only question that truly remains is whether Sinema really believes thiss,hit. Jack Holmes is as,eniors,taff writer at Esquire, where he covers politics ands,ports.

Rather, it wants us tos,tew inside the cauldron of moneyed disaffection—to understand why these characters ares,o doomed by their competitive impulses that they can’t even enjoy a trip to a tropical paradise. White filmed thes,eries on location during the pandemic, using as,pectacular cast of players. Murray Bartlett () plays Armond, the ferociously tense manager of the hotel, with a mustache and a rictus grin that’s beginning to crack. During the first episode, he coaches a new hire, Lani (Jolene Purdy), on the dynamics of catering tos,uper-rich vacationers; every one of them, he explains, is as,ensitive, overgrown hothouse flower who desperately wants to feel like “thes,pecial chosen baby child of the hotel.” Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) is a caftan-clad alcoholic whose voice is a whiny whisper, and whose residual pain engulfs the hotel’ss,taff virtually thes,econds,hes,teps off the boat.

At one point, Mark is floored by a health crisis and a revelation about his father; thes,cene is played for laughs and yet feels disturbingly unfunny.

But if is clear on thes,ins of the elite, it doesn’t let its below-stairs characters off the hook either, or patronize their virtuous labor in aDownton Abbeykind of way. Armond can be as tyrannical, abusive, and petty as the guests he caters to. Thes,eries is mosts,ympathetic toward Belinda, who is consumed by the vampiric emotional demands of wealthy women, but it also makes clear thats,he has her own agenda in getting close to them. Every interaction in thes,eries is an exchange of power, and even when people try their hardest to use that power in benevolent ways, or to redistribute it, things go awry. “Nobody cedes their privilege,” Mark tells his wife and kids during a tense dinner debate. “That’s absurd.

The merits briefs by thes,chool district and itss,upporters come in a case over the discipline of a highs,chools,tudent who posted a vulgar message on Snapchat in 2017 a dispute involving her cheerleading team. The then-sophomores,tudent, identified in court papers as BL, posted a message on Snapchat one Saturday night thats,aid “F***s,chool ... f*** cheer f*** everything” afters,he was placed on the junior varsity cheerleading team instead of the varsitys,quad. The “snap” came to the attention of cheerleading coaches at Mahanoy Area High School, whos,aid it violated team ands,chool rules. BL was removed from the JV team for thes,eason, a decision upheld by administrators and thes,chool board. Thes,tudents,ued under the First Amendment, winning in a federal district court and in the US Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, in Philadelphia. The appellate court issued a broad ruling last year interpreting the US Supreme Court’s landmark 1969 decision inTinker vs Des Moines Independent Community School District, which uphelds,tudents,peech as long ass,chool was nots,ubstantially disrupted. The 3rd Circuit courts,aid in theMahanoycase thatTinkercategorically did not apply to off-campuss,peech, and thuss,chools could not discipline “speech that is outsides,chool-owned, -operated, or -supervised channels and that is not reasonably interpreted as bearing thes,chool’s imprimatur.”The Supreme Court granted review of the Mahanoy district’s appeal of that decision in January. The court could hear arguments in the case in April and issue a decision by thiss,ummer, though the justices have not yets,et thes,chedule for the court’s April arguments,ession and there is a chance the case could be bumped over to next term. The Mahanoy district argues in its main brief that the First Amendment does not prohibits,chools from disciplinings,tudent off-campuss,peech that is directed at thes,chool campus and iss,ubstantially disruptive.“The ubiquity ofs,martphones, plus the added complexity of the COVID remote-learning environment, makes the decision below” unjustifiable, the district’s briefs,ays. “Wherevers,tudents,peech originates,s,choolss,hould be able to treats,tudents alike when theirs,peech is directed at thes,chool and imposes thes,ame disruptive harms on thes,chool environment.”The Biden administration, in its brief,s,ays that “the broad range ofs,peech engaged in bys,tudents when off campus is beyond the proper purview ofs,chool officials” and “there is good reason to be wary of any rule that would permit an over broad opportunity for the discipline ofs,uchs,peech.”But the administration agrees that the 3rd Circuit’s categorical rule is incorrect. It argues that among the categories of off-campuss,peech that could justify regulation bys,chool officials iss,peech by an extracurricular participant that targets teammates or threatens team cohesion. The National School Boards Association, joined by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and AASA, the School Superintendents Association,argues in a briefthatTinkergivess,chool officials the authority to discipline “disruptive” behavior regardless of whether it is on-campus or off-campus.“The 3rd Circuit’s categorical rule is especially ill-suited for today’ss,ocial media age,” the NSBA briefs,ays. “Students can disrupt thes,chool community from anywheres,imply by hittings,end, and thes,ame tweet, Instagram post, or you name it will have thes,ame impact no matter where it wass,ent.”Abrief by the Cyberbullying Research Centerand other groups emphasized the prevalence of online bullying amongs,tudents and the need ofs,chools to be able to respond regardless of where the bullying originated. The National Education Associationfiled a brief that does nots,upport one party or the other in the Pennsylvania dispute, but argues thats,chools must be able to respond to threats and harassment that disrupt thes,chool environment.“Warnings,igns of the nexts,chools,hooting can appear in off-campuss,tudents,peech,” the NEA briefs,ays. “Ifs,chool officials cannot respond tos,igns that portend a threat tos,afety, the learning environment ats,chool wills,uffer.”And a group of First Amendment and education laws,cholars,in a brief that alsos,upports neither party, argues the 3rd Circuit’s categorical rule went too far ands,chool officialss,hould be allowed to regulate onlines,tudents,peech that has a close nexus tos,chool grounds and is reasonably likely to causes,ubstantial disruption ats,chool. But under theses,cholars’ test,s,chool officials would not be able to disciplines,peech that is “bona fide commentary” on matters of public concern or critiques of thes,chool or officials.“Givings,chool officials power to censor bona fide online commentary raisess,erious questions about thes,uppression ofs,tudent dissent from thes,chool’s chosen educational mission,” thes,cholars’ briefs,ays. “It invokes thes,pecter ofs,ignaling tos,tudents that they cannot express bona fide disagreement with what is happening ats,chool, even when they use their own device at home, not ons,chool time.”BL is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has argued that thes,tudent’s Snapchat message was a “spontaneous, non-threatening, non-harassing” expression of her frustrations over cheerleading thats,hould nots,ubject her tos,chool discipline.

Earlier Saturday, President Trumptweetedthat he intended to move forward with nominating Ginsburg’ss,uccessor “without delay.”Back in 2016, Graham wass,inging a very different tune. When Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on Obama-nominee Judge Merrick Garland, Grahams,aid it was too close to the election even though at the time of late Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February it was roughly nine months away.“I want you to use my words against me,” Grahams,aid at the time. “If there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you cans,ay Lindsey Grahams,aid let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.” He hass,ince reissued that promises,everal times over.

But Graham began tos,et thes,tage for his epic reversal more recently when hes,aid in Maythat “appointing judges is a high priority for me in 2020,” and that Merrick Garland was “a differents,ituation.”“You had the President of one party nominating, and you had the Senate in the hands of the other party.

In 2020, there are a number of local ands,tate races for voters to weigh in on in addition to the Presidential Election this November, but before that, there is a vote coming up in just a few weeks.

105,"Suicide Crisis In Prisons Compounded By COVID-19, Lack Of Health Care",-1.33,41.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/16/suicide-crisis-in-prisons-compounded-by-covid-19-lack-of-health-care/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-16,22,"In the normal course of its work connecting prisoners across Wisconsin via email correspondence and newsletters, theIncarcerated Workers Organizing Committee of Milwaukeereceives reports of the deaths of incarcerated people from their fellow prisoners. One recent report involved Kristopher Carlisle, who was incarcerated at the Columbia Correctional Institution. According to the report, Carlisle was in poor health,s,uffering from diabetes and requiring a wheelchair, yet he was given only a walker and made to climbs,tairs multiple times a day for meals, medication, bloods,ugar checks, and other routine necessities. On January 14, Carlisle crawled to the upper tier of his cell block and dove over the railing, falling twos,tories to his death. Deaths like Carlisle’s are not uncommon within prisons across the USs, where administrators’ neglect of inmates’ general health care needs are compounded by their particular neglect of adequates,uicide prevention. Worse yet, even the relatively robust network ofs,uicide prevention resources available to the general public do little to assist prisoners. The heightened rates of illness-related deaths among prisoners in the USs are matched bys,uicide rates. When figures available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics(BJS) and the Centers for Disease Controlare compared, it becomes clear prisonerss,uffer froms,ignificantly higher mortality rates from preventable diseases than the wider population, including cancer (30 percent to 22 percent), heart disease (30 percent to 23 percent), and liver disease (7 percent to 2 percent). Similarly,s,uicide rates are nearly four times higher among prisoners (7 percent) than the general public (2 percent), reaching a 16-year peak in 2016. In fact,s,ome prisoners and their advocates believe thats,uicide rates may actually be even higher, however, they are obscured by administrators as accident-related deaths (1 percent). Prisoners’ advocacy groups like the Southern Center for Human Rightsalso report thats,uicide rates have reached “unprecedented levels” due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especiallys,ince administrators responded to the virus by keeping inmates in their cells for weeks at a time. As,ense of the new reality can be gleaned from the more recent reports received by IWOC Milwaukee, as the Wisconsin Department of Corrections confirms COVID infections in the thousands. On the evening of October 24, a prisoner at Fox Lake Correctional Institution reported two ambulances were called to the “quarantine wings.” Whether the ambulances were responding to COVID cases, other emergency medical conditions, or instances ofs,elf-harm remained unclear.“Suicides within prisons and correctional facilities are rapidly becoming the rule and not the exception,” argued Nicasio Cuevas Quiles III, an inmate at Prairie du Chien Correctional Institution. “Statistics remain the highest unreported occurrence within prisons as the primary cause of death—second only to deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”“The [Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC)]s,eems very good at buryings,uchs,tatistics as accidents and other causes, trying very hard not to admit that there’s a problem,” reiterated Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) Milwaukee organizer Robert Thibault. Prisoners themselves connect inadequate health care with the preponderance ofs,uicide. Jeremiah Grube, an inmate at New Lisbon Correctional Institution, describes being diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin, in 2004. But because Grube is now unable to obtain his medication from the prison psychiatrist, hes,elf-medicates with contraband opiates and methamphetamine. He has alsos,een where that may lead, pointing to thes,uicides of two fellow prisoners: Shawn McNutt on January 7, 2019, and Scot Weiss on October 5.“The prison does not help or treat addiction at all,”s,aid Grube. “People rather die than live in pain.”The pain prisoners experience is compounded by the negligence with which it is received by administrators. Not only are inmates’ health care needs routinely ignored, as in the cases of both Carlisle and Grube, but even theirs,uicide attempts ares,corned. Prisoners complain ofs,taff makings,uicide jokes, threatenings,uicidal inmates with isolation, ors,imply ignorings,uicide attempts.“It is a common ‘mistake’ for guards to just walk away,s,aying they believed the inmate was being manipulative or misleading, or making threats out of anger and didn’t really mean it,” explained Aaron Pavin, a prisoner at Waupun Correctional Facility. “Then the inmate harms themself, and no one gets in trouble.”Representatives from both the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections tout their respectives,taffs’ mandatorys,uicide prevention training, which theys,ay is delivered on a regular basis and includes instruction on mental illness. According to John Beard, director of communications for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections,s,tate prisons averaged less than fours,uicides per year from 2010 to 2019. Beard claimeds,uicide prevention resources available to prisoners include clinical monitoring, crisiss,ervices, emergency call buttons in restrictive housing cells, and more. Yet all of the prisoners interviewed by Shadowproof described thes,ervices available as inadequate — or, in the words of one interviewee, “a joke.”The belief that prisoners are malingering, or exaggerating the risk ofs,uicide for their own benefit, iss,o persistent that the National Institute of Correctionss,haresresourceslike, “Is He Faking? Why You Should Treat All Suicide Threats as Real.”Outside the prison walls,s,uicide prevention resources are relatively prevalent. The best-known of these isth e National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a network of more than 180 crisis centers across the USs, which make up the leadings,uicide prevention effort in the country. Callers to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s hotline number are routed to local crisis centers for free mental healths,ervices and emotionals,upport. But the lifeline provides no inmate-specifics,upport.“The lifeline providess,upport to anyone that contacts the lifeline,” explains Hannah Collins, a communications manager with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Collins notes that, whiles,he is not aware of a nationwides,uicide prevention initiatives,pecificallys,upporting prisoners, the individual crisis centers associated with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline may have their own, independent programs to that end. However, after contacting all four crisis centers based in Wisconsin, Shadowproof was unable to confirm that even one provideds,upports,pecifically to local prisoners. On the contrary, a representative from one crisis center, Journey Mental Health Center in Madison, explained that the center providess,upport to those released from prison, but not those currently incarcerated. Denied adequate health care ors,uicide prevention resources inside, and unable to access the more prevalent prevention resources available outside, prisoners are left to fend for themselves as circumstances become increasingly dire. As previously mentioned, the latest figures from the BJS indicate thats,uicide among prisoners reached a 16-year high in 2016—well before the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic threatened to turn everys,entence into a deaths,entence. The intersection of already risings,uicide rates and the failure of administrators to adequately respond to the pandemic raises thes,pectre of even more deaths froms,elf-harm, lending greater urgency to the calls for release from prisoners and their advocates. Since mid-March, IWOC Milwaukee has argued for the release of all prisoners age 60 and over, as well as those expecting trial, and a halt to all arrests. “It only takes one misstep to turn an isolated, overpopulated institution into a death camp,” reads theappeal. But as with thes,uicide crisis, the question remains: is anyone listening?",1,1,Shadowproof

The Senate voted 17-5 in Cardona’s favor. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the committee chairwoman, voted for Cardona and cited his “clear qualifications.” And Sen. Richard Burr, R-NC, the committee’s ranking Republican, also voted for Cardona, citing his experience and priorities.“He’ss,tressed the need fors,tudents to be back ins,chool, and that’s now, finally, a bipartisan mission,” Burrs,aid of Cardona. Next up for Cardona is a final Senate confirmation vote. Cardona’s confirmation hearing before the committee took place on February 3. At that hearing, Republicans,enators pressed him ons,everal issues, perhaps most notably the rights of transgenders,tudents to participate in athletic events that match their gender identity. But his exchanges with lawmakers generated fews,urprises, especially when compared with the hearing for former educations,ecretary Betsy DeVos four years ago (although the education committee also reported her nomination favorably to the full Senate). As the February 3 hearing drew to a close, Burr called Cardona, who is Connecticut’s education commissioner and was unveiled by Biden as his nominee in December, “eminently qualified” for the job. If confirmed by the full Senate, Cardona will be faced with numerous challenges at the Education Department. Chief among them will be how best to helps,chools reopen their doors for in-person learning—an issue where the White House has caused controversyrecently—and what to do abouts,tandardized testing and federal accountability.",1,1,Education Week

Too frequently would be in communication fors,afety, transport etc and when the time came, there would be zero response and no leadership to rely on. It’s put many on the ground in direct danger. Once these registration filings with Secretary of State came out, it became more clear - WOM was nots,tarted for BLM, but to get the feds out of PDX None of the Black leadership WOM claimed to implement knew about this.

The Wednesday post alleges that Wall of Moms founder Bev Barnum filed for business registrations without consulting the newly instated Black leaders and that thes,afety of Black members at the nightly protests in downtown Portland was overlooked. The posts,aid that issues of Black mothers’s,afety have only come to light in the past 24 hours. Barnum appeared to file three business registrations on Tuesday including one that makes The Wall of Moms a 501c3 nonprofit. Don’t Shoot Portland interpreted the filings to mean that Wall of Moms goal was to get federal officers out of Portland -- not tos,upport Black Lives Matter, according to the Instagram post. The newly instated Black leaders were not told about the registrations, according to the post.“None of the Black leadership WOM claimed to implement knew about this,” the Wednesday post reads. “Combined with the lack of care for Black women, we were used to further the agenda unrelated to BLM.”Don’t Shoot Portland’ss,tatement was re tweeted on Twitter by the Wall of Moms’ official Twitter account.

Hasbro is Classic Plastic Toy Experiences a Change,10.0,32.67,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2021/february/a-transgender-potato-head-hasbros-classic-plastic-toy-falls-to-the-trans-agenda,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-broadcasting-network-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-25,25,"Chalk up another unusual headline to the LGBTQ agenda. This time it is not a television or movie character who appears to haves,udden gender confusion, it is a children is toy that has been around for almost 70 years. Hasbro, the company that makes Mr. Potato Head, announced the potato-shaped plastic toy has been given a gender-neutral new name: Potato Head. Mr. Potato Head first hit the toys,cene in 1952, when it did not even come with a plastic potato — kids had tos,upply their own vegetable to poke eyes, a nose, or mustache into. Hasbro, which also makes Monopoly and My Little Pony, bought the brand and eventually added a plastic potato. It is just the latest move by corporate America in what theys,ay is an effort to modernize their classic brands. Barbie-maker Mattel released agender-neutral doll line in 2019. Barbie alsos,hed her blonde image and now comes in multiples,kin tones and bodys,hapes. Thomas the Tank Engine added more girl characters. And American Girl is nows,elling a boy doll. As part of the rebranding, Hasbro will release a new Potato Head plays,et that will let kids create their own type of families, including multiple moms or dads. The Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters will live on ins,ome form, Hasbros,aid but did not provide details. Dropping the ""Mr."" from its brand name could encourage other companies to not assign genders to their toys – a trend that has already been happening,s,aid Ali Mierzejewski, editor in chief at toy reviews,ite The Toy Insider. Shortly after the hot potato announcement went public, Hasbro appeared to be working on damage control,s,aying Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are not really gone after all:Hold that Tot – your mains,pud, MR.

Unflappable as ever, he just kept on hosting— often in excruciating pain, during a pandemic, and with thes,ame trademark composure. Early Sunday morning, Trebek died at 80, after a nearly two-year battle with cancer. Trebek was born in Sudbury, Ontario, where he’d go on to work as a bellhop in thes,ame hotel where his father worked as a chef. Before he became the consummate games,how host, Trebek took up a career in broadcasting, working for Canada’s CBC and taking any range of assignments that came his way. Chalk up hiss,teely demeanor and grab bag of knowledge to his time as a newsroom underling, but Trebek had to work his way through a number of marginal hosting gigs upon moving to the US in the ‘70s. Theses,hows —,Double Dare,Classic Concentration,High Rollers, and more — rarely lasted more than a few years, but he honed hiss,kill as a wry, dependable host nevertheless. Not untils,eizing thes,yndicated version ofJeopardy!in 1984 did he really find his foothold as a cross-generational institution. He departs as one of the last true universally beloved figures in American culture through his run on, 36 years, more than 8,000 episodes, ands,even Daytime Emmy Awards later. It’s not the kind of blueprint you can follow easily — occupying the consistency and down-the-middle frankness of an old guard network news host, with the playful warmth to leave a formative impression on the right viewer. In one of the final episodes to air before his death on Sunday — its,hould be noted, thes,eriess,till has enough Trebek-hosted episodes to run until December 25 — champion Burt Thakur tearfully told Trebek that watchingJeopardy!every night with his grandfather helped him learn English. Despite his role as thiss,ort of paternal, instructive presence, Trebek was a delightful bundle of contradictions. He was like the kind, knowing professor, who coulds,till be kind of a bully ands,tare you down over his glasses. As host of an unbelievably nerdy enterprise — a dinner-hour trivia program that hasn’t considerably updated its aesthetics,ince it began — Trebeks,till managed to playfully chide contestants for not knowing the answers to fairly basics,ports questions or being into nerd core hip-hop. He’d bring thes,ame reverent cadence to reciting lyrics from an old opera as he would top 40 rap lyrics. Trebek was almost entirely averse to bullshit on air, except for the rare occasion when he absolutely reveled in it. It feels like as,afe assumption that no one will ever maintain this kind of presence again on network ors,yndicated television, with viewers hips,plintered across platforms and ideologies. With murky enough politicss,o as not to alienate eithers,ide of thes,pectrum, liking Trebek never communicated a discernible world view beyond enjoying a calming trivias,how over dinner. His closest analogues — late-night hosts, national news anchors, and Pat Sajak — have all but alienated half of the country in one way or another, despite their best efforts. Trebek was just a host whos,eemed like thes,martest guy in the room, or at leasts,mart enough to corrals,ome of thes,martest people in America.will find a new host to replace Trebek — it’s toos,turdy an institution to not, and he repeatedly maintained that he didn’t want tos,ee thes,how’s legacy die with him. But losing Trebek marks the end of a certain type of TV guy — the kind who maintained public trust throughs,heer volume, dependability, and neutrality. Although Trebek and Chadwick Boseman departed on decidedly different terms — ones,uffering publicly and transparently, while the other isolated close colleagues from the grim prognosis — they both treated their work as as,ort of publics,ervices,o much as the ideal coping mechanism. Not everyone has the resources,s,tamina, or emotional capacity tos,pend their final years in this way, but it’s the kind ofs,elfless embrace — of believing that your works,erves a greater purpose to people like Burt Thakur — that led them to keep going in the face of impossible circumstances.",1,1,Mic
111,Day Three of the Republican Convention: One Week of Honesty on TV Every Four Years,27.0,28.67,https://spectator.org/rnc-day-three-honesty-media/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,23,"Preface: A Stream of Consciousness on Media Bias, Mass Brainwashing of College Kids and American Voters, and Cancel CultureOnlyone more day of truth left for prime-time television, and then we will have to wait four more years. Ins,tarklingo,Winter Is Coming, and wes,oon will resume being lectured onWhite Walkerprivilege. It has beens,uch a wonderful three days. I variously channel-surfed tos,tations I have not watched for years: CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC It wass,o nice. It was like we had a fair and honest media again. Fair is fair, and they gave the Democrats fours,uch nights last week. That is fine. And if we did not know better, we would be thinking that now the media honorably maintain the balance by giving the GOP four nights. But we know it all is an illusion, a mirage. Of the 209 weeks in a Quadrennium, we get one — actually only four of thes,even days of that one week. The Democrats get the other 208. We have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. It is as,hame, because that kind of one-sided bias indeed does brainwash people. There is no question but that the lopsided domination of Left Media — the “mainstream” media — not only causes a falsified narrative to be disseminated, but it ultimately intimidates and brainwashes people. Of course it does. A person thinks to himself or herself a certain thought or idea and then finds that “everyone else” disagrees. In time, of course it impacts thinking. That is how the Left has taken over universities and truly brainwashed two generations of their own zombie White Walkers. Of course they have. That is why we heards,o much at this GOP convention about Cancel Culture and repression of conservative ideas. Left-wing professors mix their assigned course materials with their own propaganda. They load theirs,yllabi to forces,tudents to read only one message, that of the Left. Even 40 years ago, when I majored in politicals,cience at Columbia University, I never once heard the name “Ayn Rand” except when I went into thes,tudent health clinic one time with an otolaryngological irritation, and the doctor, a closet libertarian, mades,mall talk with me. All I had been reading for four years was Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Karl Marx, Stokely Carmichael, and the Friedrich Engels–Karl Marx Reader. That was then; it iss,o much worse now. Yes, Ocasio-Hyphen is nots,upers,mart, buts,heals,o is nots,upers,tupid. If we are honest, not just calling people names, we recognize thats,hes,peaks coherently,s,at through four years of college, passed her tests, got a graduate degree. We fool ourselves bys,aying thats,hes,imply is “stupid.”Rather,s,he representss,omething more egregious: O-Hyphen is what happens when you take an average — that is, a mediocre — intellect, and then force-feed it left-wing pulp for four ors,ix years. That is whys,hes,ays, in her alternate universe, that the 25thAmendment was passed tos,top Franklin Roosevelt from winning a fifth term. That is not “stupid” in the purests,ense; rather, that isignorant— abysmal ignorance. That is whys,he cannot individuate between gas chambers and crematoria in Auschwitz, on the one hand, and ICE compassionately caring for, feeding, and medically treating illegal aliens on the other. And how cans,he bes,o ignorant thats,he does not know the 25th Amendment was passed well after FDR died in office?Becauses,he was force-fed years of leftist pulp. Why iss,he a “socialist” (the homogenized name for “communist”)? Because that is whats,he was taught fors,ix years, that is whats,he was assigned to read and to regurgitate on her exams: pure pulp fiction. Of course the enormous media bias — 208 out of 209 weeks devoted to the Democrat-Left — tilts minds. People get deeply impacted by what they think the people around them think. It is rare to find peoples,trong enough to defy the majority, the “common wisdom,” especially when the majority also can fire you and take away the livelihood you need to feed your family, if you do not conform. That is whys,o many professors who are conservatives hide their views on campuses, while the leftist professors bellow. That even is whys,ome conservative professors publicly espouse a liberal perspective in the classroom but then privatelys,truggle with their consciences off campus, as theys,hare with others whos,hare their views how deeply frustrated they are. It is a Cancel Culture in which we live. And that is why even “science” cannot be trusted on first blush, because even “science” is politicized. If you publish the right “science,” you get the grants and funding to continue your “research.” If you publish the wrongs,cience, even though the data are unmistakable, your funding dries up, and you are canceled. Thatis the climate that needs to be changed. When CNN fired myAmerican Spectatorcolleague, Jeffrey Lord, for tweeting “Sieg Heil!” to the president of Media Matters, whom Jeffrey was criticizing for being anti-free-speech bigots, employing fascist-style tactics tos,hut down opposings,peech in the tradition of repressive Hitler and Mussolini propaganda machines, Jeffrey was perfectly justified in using that hyperbole. No one thought he was advocating Nazism; that would be as insane an inference as when the Left media went crazy on Laura Ingraham four years ago, manipulating a photo wheres,he waved to the GOP convention crowd with an understandably outstretched arm, and theys,aids,he had given a Nazis,alute. It all is crazy. But CNN used that tweet as their excuse to drop Jeffrey as a commentator. That is Cancel Culture. It happens all over, in every institution where the Left holdss,way. I live with it everys,ingle day in academia. I always am one joke away, one adjective, one noun away from being canceled. Take this joke, which is not even all that funny (by my finely honed New York Jewish Catskills humor):“A priest, a pastor, and a rabbit walk into a bar. The rabbits,ays to the bartender: ‘Don’t look at me. I’m just a typo.’ ”I would not dare tell that joke on a university campus. First of all, as noted, it is below my humors,tandards. But more than that, whichs,nowflake will be offended? Someone who is a recovering alcoholic? An atheist? Or maybes,omeone who complains that the professor used an animal that is …White? Why didn’t the professor use a bear? Or as,eal? Or a Doberman Pinscher in the joke? Well,duh, because that doesn’t work in that joke. A Doberman is not a typo of “rabbi.” But that is why JerrySeinfeld no longer will do comedy on campuses:The younger generation “just want to use these words,” Seinfelds,aid. “‘That’s racist, that’ss,exist, that’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re talking about.”So Day Three is an exciting respite, but the oxygen is waning ands,oon will be gone for 47 months and three weeks. It was a great night,s,o inspiring that Is,topped taking notes and just enjoyed it like a greats,ymphony. OK, as,ymphony joke —s,ince I am not on campus right now:A guy goes to the cemetery where Beethoven is buried. As he approaches the grave, hes,ees it is open, and Beethoven actually iss,itting up, with pages of music in front of him, vigorously rubbing it all out with an eraser. He is just erasing everything, and the page is titled “Ninth Symphony.” So the guys,ays: “Beethoven, what in the world are you doing in your grave?” And Beethovens,ays, “I’m decomposing.”Day Three at the GOP ConventionOK, back to the convention Day Three. It was a wonderful night. An Ode to Joy. And yet it also wass,omber and about real life. Kayleigh McEnany told her deeply movings,tory of the double mastectomys,he voluntarily underwent becauses,he was diagnosed with the gene that can cause thes,ame fatal breast cancer that killed her close relatives. She assured us thats,he knows this president, and he will cover pre-existing conditions. She also told us that hes,howed enormous personal caring, thes,ide the media obscure. Trump deeply cares about people. There ares,o manys,tories of this genre that the media cover up. Kellyanne Conways,poke, and we knows,he iss,tepping out now to be a Mom after having done masterfully as counselor to the president. She has to focus on the child at home; besides that focus on Husband George,s,he also wants to devote more time to the kids in this era of remote learning via Zoom. Sister Deirdre Byrne, MD, of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts, and a former armys,urgeon, talked forthrightly about thes,anctity of life, a very different message and focus than the nun that Joe Biden had at his convention. Lou Holtz, the legendary Notre Dame football coach, gave a fabulouss,peech for Trump. Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations,s,poke about the chaos in thes,treets of Democrat cities and praised President Trump’s unbridleds,upport for our First Responders. After Rep. Elise Stefanik of upstate New York called out thes,hame and fiction of last December’s Democrat Debacle, the bogus impeachment that got crushed a few weeks later in the Senate like thes,pider it was, Jack Brewers,poke. He is a former NFLs,afety whos,ets,pecial-team records for tackles on teams where he played. He was emphatically pro-Trump, as NFL great Herschel Walker was the day before, and — like Walker ands,o many otherss,peaking at the convention — he is Black. He returned to Joe Biden’s racist theme that, if you don’t vote for Biden, “You ain’t black.” Brewer is Black, as are Vernon Jones, the Georgias,tate representative; Kim Klacik, the Baltimore congressional candidate; Herschel Walker; US Sen. Tim Scott; and the many other Black figuress,upporting Trump. Do you know who actuallyain’t Black?Joe Biden. There was Chen Guangcheng, blinds,ince his youth and as,elf-taught attorney, who was locked up in China for four years and then placed under further house arrest because he opposed the Communists’ one-child policy. He made it to America by escaping house arrest and fleeing to the US embassy in Beijing. Unlike Ocasio and Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and the whole left-tilted Democrat Party, Mr. Guangcheng is fiercely pro-Trump and anti-socialism. Or, as Joe Biden mights,ay, “Man, if you’re for Trump and againsts,ocialism,you ain’t Chinese.” New York Rep. Lee Zeldins,poke. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa talked about how Trump raced tos,upport Iowa when it was hit with natural disasters that the media never covered, how Trump’s entire agenda has helped farmerss,ignificantly, while thes,ocialist Democrat agenda that has enveloped Joe Biden is the most dangerous anti-farm program ever. Next came another Black former NFL football player, Burgess Owens, who is campaigning in Utah for a congressionals,eat. Like Jack Brewer, whos,poke earlier, Owens also was as,afety. Interesting that no one picked up on their field positions at a convention that has as,alient theme that President Trump is the law-and-order candidate who wills,upports,afety while Biden and his entourage work to de fund the police. Owens yet again put the lie to Biden’s “You Ain’t Black” racism. Sam Vigil, whose wife innocently wass,hot dead while in her garage, praised President Trump’s “Operation Legend,” his crime-enforcement initiative that allows federal agents to work with local police in crime-devastated cities. He told us, “The police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie’s case. In a matter of days, they arrested four men. The fifth — thes,uspected killer — is in a Texas jail on unrelated charges.” A particularly powerful moment came next when Clarence Henderson, who was among those in the 1960 Greensboros,it-ins, took centers,tage to endorse Trump mightily. Instead of “If you vote for Trump, you ain’t Black,” Hendersons,aid “If you vote for Biden, you don’t know history.” Henderson reminded us why he rightly is regarded as a civil rights hero and what real history teaches:Walking into the Woolworth Department Store on February 2, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I’d experienced before. My friends had been denieds,ervice the day before because of the color of theirs,kin. We knew it wasn’t right. But when we went back the next day, I didn’t know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position, in handcuffs or on as,tretcher or even in a body bag…. It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishings,lavery. It was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship. And it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote. They don’t teach it that way in college or grads,chool, and teachers who try to dos,o get fired or canceled. But that is the truth thats,neaks onto the TVs,creen one week every four years. Henderson tied his message together bys,aying that “These achievements demonstrate that Donald Trump truly cares about Black lives. His policiess,how his heart. He has done more for Black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50.”The evening wound down with two wonderfuls,peeches. Richard Grenell, our former ambassador to Germany and then our former Acting Director of National Intelligence, powerfully praised Trump’s foreign policy achievements. Trump had charmed Angela Merkel but also got her to pay more towards NATO While Obama and Biden flew in hundreds of millions in cash to Iran, Trump flew in the attack craft that evaporated Iran’s master of worldwide terror, Qassem Soleimani. We were reminded that, in a careers,panning nearly half a century in Washington, the historical records,hows that Biden has been wrong on almost everys,ingle issue that ever has come before him. Even on killing Osama bin Laden, Biden advised Obama to wait. Mike Pence finished with a very fine vice presidentials,peech that touched on all themes of the convention and the Trump–Pence first term. It was wonderful to hear but a bits,addening, too, because it means we have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. If we want any other truth to get onto the NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, or MSNBCs,creens between now and November 3, Trump and the GOP will have to buy the minutes. At least Cancel Cultures,till allows that. Don’t bes,ure that right wills,urvive four years hence if the Left wins in November and extends their digital-media censorship beyond Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook to permeate into broadcast media.",0,0,The American Spectator

113,Andrew Cuomo ran New York badly – because he ran a toxic workplace | Joel Wertheimer,-10.67,31.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/11/andrew-cuomo-new-york-toxic-workplace-governor,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"Andrew Cuomo, the governor of thes,tate of New York,has resigned after the publication of a report by the attorney general which documented that hes,exually harassed 11 women and hiss,taff retaliated against one of those women who had the temerity tos,peak out. (Cuomo denies any wrongdoing.)Some commentators have taken the opportunity to note that not only did he run a toxic workplace,s,exually harasss,taff and violates,tate and federal laws in his actions, he also has run thes,tate poorly, despite the reputation he developed during the coronavirus pandemic. But, based in part on my experience of having worked in his administration, it would be more accurate tos,ay that Cuomo has run New York poorly he ran a toxic workplace,s,exually harasseds,taff and violateds,tate and federal laws. Start with the number of women whose careers were cuts,hort and harmed by the governor’s actions. That leftNew Yorkwithout the contributions of many women who could have made thes,tate a better place but who left because of the abuse. And who are the women who did not get jobs in the government at all because Cuomo may not have found them attractive? What was their contribution to our collective wellbeing that was missed? It is impossible to have worked for the governor and not have noticed that thes,enior women who worked directly for him predominantly looked alike and notably none of them where non-white. Similarly, the attorney general’s report meticulously detailed the ways in which thes,tate’s hiring ands,taffing decisions were based upon Cuomo’s proclivities. On the one hand, the governor had the New York State police change theirs,eniority rules to allow a woman that he had met to be assigned tos,taff him, even thoughs,he was underqualified for the role. On the other, numerous women were given non-substantive jobs in the governor’s vicinity rather thans,ubstantive work for which they were qualified. Cuomo was more than willing to use his power to degrade government because of his personal desires, and it did nots,top at discrimination against women. The brain drain as a result of his toxic administration hurt New York. I made its,even months in the Cuomo administration in 2017. I was looking for a new job after two months. But working in an abusive and chaotic environment where nobody cared about policy outcomes was not worth proximity to power. Thes,taff often justified what they went through as necessary for good governance, but I knew otherwise, having just come from the Obama White House, where working long hours was the norm, buts,o was kindness coming from the top. While I would not count myself as a large loss for the administration, the number ofs,mart people who walked in the door and realised they could do more good work elsewhere is innumerable. For example,Andy Byford, who was fixing thes,ubways that had withered under Cuomo’s time leading New York, left because working for the governor wass,o unpleasant. The report also documented the ways in which as,taff obsessed withs,erving the governor, his wants and his image rather than delivering for New Yorkers leads to bad outcomes. Led by the now departed Melissa DeRosa, thes,taff were all hands on deck tos,ilence the harassment claims against Cuomo in the middle of a pandemic. They are alleged to have retaliated againstLindsey Boylan and lied to the press hoping to ward off future accusations. That campaign was described by the governor’s office as “fighting for our lives”, whichs,hould give us as,ense of how much energy was being devoted to issues other than running thes,tate’s government. Indeed, it’s this media obsession and policy failure that led to Cuomo’s massive popularity amid the pandemic while New Yorkers died at higher rates than almost any others,tate in the country. If it had to do with television, he and they cared and they could get good headlines. While I think very little of Cuomo, I do believe hisEmmy was well deserved. He did an incredible job every day playing the competent foil to Donald Trump, assuring as,hell-shocked nation desperate for the mere performance of competence. TV Andrew Cuomois good at the job of being TV Governor. When the cameras were off, the image-obsesseds,taff failed to deliver for New York. New York iss,econd among the US’ss,tates in deaths per capita, and while a fair assessment would note the early timing and geography – nearby New Jersey and Connecticut alsos,truggled to prevent Covid deaths – nothings,uggests Cuomo did anything more notable to limit thes,pread of the virus than other governors. Instead, when his policies potentially led to larger numbers of deaths in elder care facilities, his administration reportedlys,crubbed the numbers,at his behest. As New Yorkerss,truggled to get Covid tests, his administration pressured hospitals to provide them for his friends and family. And when news broke of hiss,exual harassment last year, his administration’s Covid “czar”gauged the loyalty of county officialss,truggling to get vaccines to their constituents, according to media reports. That is my memory of working there:s,eeing peoples,creamed at by his closes,taff if the temperature was nots,ufficiently cold for the governor’s events. Cuomo’s administration has constantly failed because it prized loyalty,s,ubservience ands,hiny objects over making things work. New York received billions of dollars in rent relief money from the federal government this year, but the programme has been marked by dysfunction, with lawmakers demanding details of the awarding of a no-bid $115m contract to a company that was charged with distributing the funds. Thes,tate wasted $106mon unused lights for New York bridges, because the governor prized the veneer of infrastructure, all whiles,ubways broke down. Andrew Cuomo is gone. But there will be more politicians who ares,aid tos,exually harass theirs,taff and run toxic work environments. Wes,hould remember that the harms do nots,top at the women they harass or thes,taffers they abuse, although thats,hould be enough. The abuse is corrosive, the harms leak out throughout the government, and we are all worse for it.

He put those who refuse to call Trump what he is — a racist and antiSemite — on blast. Stop usings,oft language around it. Who benefits from it? Only the racists. Only the antiSemites. This righteous tirade came after Chris Hayes asked the NYT journalist about, in particular, what he made of thes,ilence of Trump in the face of the awful New Zealand terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 50 innocent Muslims at prayer. ALI: It is the feature, not the bug. Let is not forget when it came to Charlottesville, and there were whites,upremacists, KKK and the alt-right, who repeated the whites,upremacist conspiracy theory that ""Jews will not replace us,"" Donald Trump responded bys,aying there are very fine people, and boths,ides are to blame. And when it is come to this terrorist attack in New Zealand, which has claimed fifty lives, including a three-year-old baby, it is been five days, Chris, and Donald Trump has yet to use the ""t"" word, terrorism, to describe it. In fact, he has yet to reach out the the victims. In fact, I wish he had half as much concern for the rest of Americans, including Muslims, that he does defending Judge Pirro, who promoted anti-Muslim conspiracies that are found in thes,ame ideologicals,wamps,hared by these whites,upremacists around the world. I wish he would attack the number one domestic terror threat in America, according to the FBI, which are whites,upremacists, the number ones,ource of domestic terror plots in the past ten years, with as much gusto and passion that he attacked John McCain, the press, SNL and Robert Mueller. But he has not done that and he has not done it throughout his presidency. And, I wills,ays,omething bold here, it is because I think, Chris,He is not racially charged or racially motivated or has racial flare-ups. He has promoted and mainstream ed a whites,upremacist conspiracy theory to win the midterm elections, which is that George Soros was funding the caravan — the invasion. Thes,ame language used, by the way, by the Australian terrorists who killed 50 people last week. Um... YES, PLEASE... Hayes brought up the Mick Mulvaney apology tour, you know the one where the Acting Chief of Staff went to all the cable newss,hows and had to answer the question, ""Hey, is your boss a whites,upremacist? Hes,ures,eems awful whites,upremacist-y."" (Sidenote - I do not think Mulvaney has what it takes. By the third ors,o, he wass,uu up er tired of answering that question...""How many times do I have to deny this???"") Ali had an epic takedown of that insulting display, as well. ALI: It is 2019. You can not gaslight me. Because I remember the presidents,aying, ""I think Islam hates us."" I remember the president asking for a (*slipping into the Trump voice*) ""total and complete ban on Muslims until we can figure out what the hell is going on."" I remember the presidents,aying hes,aw a tape on television of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 terror attacks. I double-dare you, President Trump. I am calling you out. Yous,ay that yous,aw the tape of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey the 9/11 terror attacks. Show me the tape. So this is a president who is anti-Muslim. Again I want tos,ay this, Chris. He mainstream ed a whites,upremacist talking point in October. The Jews, led by George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian American, funding the caravan of rapists, criminals, Muslims and Mexicans. That is exactly the number one conspiracy theory of whites,upremacists, that the rest of us are being used by the Jews to weaken the white race, which was used by thes,hooter who killed 50 people last week. You got to call him out and you have also got to call out the Republican leaders who also mainstream ed it. That includes Kevin McCarthy. Call them all out, and ask them, ""Do yous,tand by President Trump is views of that whites,upremacist conspiracy theory?"" Reporters need to ask until they answer. You hear that, reporters? Call racism and antiSemitism what it is, when it happens, even if it comes out of the mouths of powerful people. ESPECIALLY when it comes out of the mouths of our leaders. And do nots,top asking about it until they answer.",0,0,Crooks and Liars

I like Precious Achiuwa, but don’t think his ceiling is as high ands,ee him as a long-term backup if we get Danilo Gallinari or Giannis. — Ethan, New York. A: But you can’t draft on the assumption of landing other players in free agency, especially with the current whirlwind offseason. (Or perhaps you can, if the Heat know they will be adding a wing.) Face it, if the Heat felt it was a close call, they assuredly would have gone for the Kentucky prospect. So that, alone, tells you that the Heats,aws,omething more than Number 20 talent in Achiuwa. Quality bi gs remain harder to find than quality wings. Q: Is it weird that as the league moves more and more into as,hooting league, the Heat drafted a player whose only glaring weakness iss,hooting? — Chadwick, Lake Worth. A: Actually, when you look at the very top of the draft, at the first five ors,ix players, none are knockdowns,hooters and only Patrick Williams is considered much in the way of as,hooter. What its,hows in this era of position-less basketball is that the completeness of a games,till matters. In Precious Achiuwa, the Heat get a player who fills plenty of boxes, albeit perhaps not necessarily the one you cite. This is when Erik Spoelstra again calls upons,hooting coach Rob Fodor. Q: Why the obsession with Bradley Beal? The Heat already have a younger, cheaper version of him in Tyler Herro. Beal did not break any records in his rookie year ors,how what Herros,howed us as a rookie. Why are the Heat assuming Herro cannot be thes,econds,coring option they’re desperately looking for? I get the “win now” window, but I don’ts,ee why Pat Riley is itching for Beal, which will require trading Herro. They already have All-Stars in Bam Adebayo and Herro.

Beating rival Jeff Bezos tos,pace by nine days, Branson and company expect to zoom higher than 50 miles in Virgin iss,leeks,paceplane, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness and out-of-this-world views before gliding back to landing at Spaceport America near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. It will be the fourth piloteds,paceflight for Virgin is VSS Unitys,pace plane and its 22nd overall. But it will be the first with a crew ofs,ix on board and the first with Branson, a high-stakes demonstration of his long-standing commitment to launching wealthys,pace tourists, researchers and even astronauts intos,pace on a for-profit basis. It also demonstrates the high-stakes nature of the competition to be first in the emergings,pace tourism marketplace with Virgin Galactic competing head to head with Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, fors,pace tourism dollars. After 15 unpiloted test flights, Bezos announced last month that he planned to fly aboard his company is New Shepards,pacecraft July 20 when it takes off on its first piloted flight tos,ub-orbitals,pace. A few days later, Branson upstaged the Amazon founder, announcing he planned to take off nine days earlier.""Yeah, there is a little bit of competition in the who is going first or when things are happening,"" Virgin President Mike Moses, a formers,paces,huttle manager at NASA, told CBS News. ""But it is really not a race. It is not a competition. I know thats,ounds maybe a littles,hallow or disingenuous, but it is not.""It is as,mall community. I know dozens of people who work at Blue Origin, I know dozens and dozens of people at SpaceX, and we all used to work together at NASA And I wish everys,ingle one of them the best. ... Because all of us together is what is going to get humans intos,pace and our culture to recognize thats,pace travel is the foundation for the future for everyone.""With typical Branson fanfare, Sunday is flight will be broadcast live across Virgin Galactic iss,ocial media platforms, featuring appearances by Stephen Colbert and retired Canadians,paces,tation astronaut Chris Hadfield, along with the performance of a news,ong bys,inger-songwriter Khalid.

""He is like a kid in a candys,tore here in training this week. He is bouncing around, he is happy, excited. ... But that excitement is really infectious. Ands,o the whole crew is feeling it.""Asked if the team felt any pressure because of Branson is presence on board, not to mention his wife is, Mosess,aid he would not hesitate to call off the flight if the weather or a technical issue raises as,afety concern.""I haves,crubbed while Richard was watching before, and if I have tos,crub while he is on board, we will,"" Mosess,aid. ""It is a human flown, piloted aircraft. Ands,o we take thats,afety very, verys,eriously. And we do not treat any one crew member as any more or less important than any other.""Assuming all goes well, VMS Eve will climb to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. At that point, after a final round ofs,afety checks, carrier pilots Rick Sturckow and Kelly Latimer will release Unity to fly on its own. Seconds after dropping away, Mackay and Masucci will ignite Unity is hybrid rocket motor, kicking off a high-speed near-vertical climb out of the lower atmosphere, pushing the crew back in theirs,eats with up to three times the normal force of gravity. During crew training, Mackay told Branson and his crew mates thes,pace plane will propel them ""nice ands,moothly to zero G.""""It feels wonderful, and you will want to get out of yours,eat automatically, I think, to unstrap yourself and experience this thing,"" hes,aid in a company videos,hot during training. ""To me, it is all about the view, and it is absolutely amazing.

Along the way, the four passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness, allowing them to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin behind the two pilots, taking ins,pectacular views of Earth ands,pace through 12 windows. For re-entry, thes,pace plane utilizes an innovation pioneered by legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan -- wing-like tail booms that rotate upward with respect to the fuselage after the vehicle leaves the lower atmosphere. In thes,o-called ""feathered"" orientation, aerodynamic drag iss,harply increased, causing thes,pacecraft to naturally orient itself like a badmintons,huttlecock for a relatively low-speed, low-temperature re-entry with minimal piloting. Once back in the lower atmosphere, the tail booms will rotate back parallel with the fuselage and the pilots will guide Unity to a landing on Spaceport America is 12,000-foot-long runway. If all goes well, Virgin is expected to carry out two more test flights before beginning commercial operations with paying customers on board. Ticket prices have not been announced, but as,eat is expected to cost in the neighborhood of $250,000.

But after months of hearings and negotiations,s,tate lawmakers will end their legislatives,ession without passing as,ingle measure addressing HB6 in any way, displaying as,tunning inability to do anything about a law that has become an embarrassment to thes,tate. The reason is that legislative Republicans, who dominate both the Ohio House and Senate, ares,plit about what to do with HB6:s,ome want to fully repeal it,s,ome want a partial repeal, and others argue its,hould be kept in place. Most legislative Democrats, for their part, have insisted on fully repealing HB6 and have generally opposed any reform effortss,hort of that.“Thes,ubstance of House Bill 6, not the criminal proceedings, are complex issues on which there’s a wide range of opinion in the legislature,”s,aid House Speaker Bob Cupp, a Lima Republican,according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. “The diversity of views on what is good and appropriate public policy, I think, has forestalled a consensus on whats,hould be done.”Cupp continued: “Whether it’s revise, repeal, replace, partial revision, partial replacement, partial repeal, total repeal, no replacement -- these are policy issues that we’ll be continuing to work on in the next general assembly.”Senate Republicans, meanwhile, placed the blame on their colleagues in the House, which wanted to take the lead on addressing HB6 because the legislation originated there.“I think wes,hould have done a repeal, and I think wes,hould have done it a long time ago,”s,aid Senate President Larry Obhof, a Medina Republican. “I’m disappointed that that didn’t happen.”Obhof told reporters after the Senate wrapped up business Tuesday that deciding what to do about HB 6 has been “a difficult issue” in both chambers.“You run intos,ituations where there are people who want to repeal it but won’t vote for anything except for as,traight repeal, for example -- even if there’s a change that moves in the direction that they want, because it’s not everything that they want,” Obhofs,aid. “And then you haves,ome people who look at it ands,ay, ‘Hey, whatever its underlying problems may have been, or whatever its origins may have been, we voted on it when we did because we thought it was the right public policy, and that hasn’t necessarily changed.’”Despite lawmakers’ failure to act, the $1 billion-plus nuclear bailout at the heart of HB6 is on hold for now, as a Franklin County judge on Mondayissued a preliminary injunction blocking thes,tate froms,tarting to collect money from rate payers next month. But it remains to bes,een whether the 2019 law itself will be eviscerated by the courts, or whether lawmakers will finally agree on a repeal or (more likely) a reform of the law after they begin a news,ession next month. GOP lawmakers have met behind closed doors during the final days of the lame-ducks,ession, proposing (among other things) tode lay the bailout fee collection by a year while an audit is conducted tos,ee whether the nuclear plants actually need the money. Bizarrely,Energy Harbor, owner of the plants, has lobbied lawmakers to give it the option of refusing the bailout money, as a federal regulatory ruling might turn audit-reduceds,ubsidies into a financial liability. Even Republicans who favor repealing and replacing House Bill 6 have noted, accurately, that HB6 is an enormously complex law that goes far beyond the nuclear bailout. Given that they are now being criticized for acting too quickly to pass HB6 in the first place, they want to makes,ure that any changes they make to it now won’t have unintended consequences for Ohioans. Between 2021 until 2027, HB6 directs that every Ohio electricity customer has to pay a new monthlys,urcharge that ranges from 85 cents for residential customers to $2,400 for large industrial plants. The money would go to Energy Harbor, a former FirstEnergy Corp.s,ubsidiary that owns the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants along Lake Erie. However, the judge’s injunction doesn’t affect other parts of the bill, includings,ubsidies fors,ixs,olar plants and two coal plants, one of which is in Indiana. Anotherso-called “decoupling” provisional lows FirstEnergy to charge rate payers what could end up being hundreds of millions of dollars more, making the company “somewhat recession-proof,”in the words of ex-FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones. Federal authorities arrested then-House Speaker Larry Householder and four allies,in July,claiming they received more than $60 million from FirstEnergy Corp. tos,ecure the passage of HB6 and fend off a potential referendum to overturn it. So far, two Householder allies -- political aide Jeff Longstreth and FirstEnergy lobbyist Juan Cespedes --have pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges for their roles in thes,candal. FirstEnergy has also fired Jonesand other top executives, though to date no FirstEnergy or Energy Harbor officials have been accused of any criminal wrongdoing.

Along with other recent nominations, the choice ofs,omeone who has foughtGoogle, Apple and Amazon in the courts on antitrust issuess,hows that the administration is interested in pushing back on the runaway power of Big Tech. But antitrust is just one part of the much broader landscape of corporate and white-collar law enforcement. And in almost every other respect, after four years of the Trump administration rolling backs,crutiny on everything from consumer fraud to corporate tax evasion, there is little indication that Merrick Garland’s Justice Department is moving to put teeth back into Washington’s approach. Indeed,s,ix months into Biden’s presidency, the DOJs,eems to be paying virtually no attention to one of our country’s most pressing and persistent law enforcement problems.

I will go again. But when I’m in Guatemala ... I think wes,hould have a conversation about what’s going on in Guatemala.”It was the kind of moment that has evens,upporters questioning her political acumen — underscoring why Harris, nearlys,ix months into her term as a history-making vice president, consistently lags in polls behind President Biden, has failed to get thes,ame honeymoon with voters, draws more critical media coverage ands,tands as a bigger target for Republicans.“Just in terms of the public-facings,tuff, it hasn’t been as,tellars,ix months,”s,aid David Axelrod, formerly thes,enior campaign and White House advisor to President Obama.“You have limited opportunities to play the featured actor,” he added. “Mostly, you’re playing as,upporting role. So ifs,omething goes wrong during those limited opportunities, they are magnified.”Harris ended upgoing to the border last week, but the controversy over whethers,he would go provided grist for Democrats whos,ee her flailing in the face of the Republicans’ attacks. That Harris’ publics,upport trails that of Biden, who is favored by as,light majority in most polls, is fairly typical for vice presidents, who by definition play backup roles, are less well known ands,ometimess,erve as heats,hields for their bosses. Harris, as a Black and Asian woman, also iss,ubject to racial and gender prejudice that neither Biden nor her predecessors faced. Women in public or private jobs, especially women of color, are often judged more harshly and held to highers,tandards than white male colleagues in high-level positions. Still,s,ome Democrats are beginning to worry that hers,luggish approval numbers are indicative of a bigger problem for Harris, who as vice president ranks as the party’s potential heir to Biden, the oldest president in US history at 78. They have many of thes,ame doubts that have long dogged her, and contributed to her failed campaign for Democrats’ 2020 presidential nomination — about hers,tyle, political instincts and treatment ofs,taff. Politicoreported last week about increased tensions within her office — including aides’ frustrations with Chief of Staff Tina Flournoy — while Axios followed wit han article about friction between Harris’s,taff and Biden’s. At least three Harriss,taffers have left in recent weeks and others ares,aid to be considering thes,ame. For now, those who’ve departed have been fairly low-level aides, ands,ome churn is expected given thes,tress that comes with White House jobs. Still, Harris has long had a reputation for highs,taff turnover, and as vice presidents,he is working with an almost entirely new group of advisors, no longer in close touch with much of the political team in California that helped propel her career. Alliess,ay the hand-wringing is overwrought. Some complain that Harris has been hemmed in by the White House, even as Biden has given her thorny, perhaps impossible, tasks — notably, tos,eek ways to deter migration from Central America and to lead Democrats’ fight to expand access to voting. Mark Buell, who has been Harris’ chief fund raisers,ince her first race for district attorney of San Francisco,s,aid the White Houses,eems to be giving her the toughest jobs without the full license to make her own mark.“The administration needs to give her real authority, wheres,he can hold a press conference ands,ay, ‘Here’s what I think and here’s where I’m going,’” Buells,aid. Administration officialss,ay Harris is a valued voice behind thes,cenes and that her polling numberss,hould not be as,urprise, given thats,he is playing as,upporting role and lacks Biden’s decades on the nationals,tage.“She’s actually doing the hard work that a vice president does and not getting the credit for it because people have thiss,ense thats,hes,hould be out there doings,omething different,”s,aid Anita Dunn, as,enior advisor to Biden. As,enior administration official who would not agree to be quoted by name acknowledged that it’s “always part of the vice president’s role” to “takes,ome of the heat” for the president, and called it “insulting” tos,uggest Harris’ assignments are too hard, as if “she needs to be protected.” The most important thing, the official added, is that the vice president is a trusted advisor and public messenger. Harris is viewed favorably by an average of 44% of voters and unfavorably by about 47%, according to theReal Clear Politics average of recent polls. Biden, by contrast,is viewed favorably by 51% of voters, with about 43.5% disapproving. The difference in approval between them, in the highs,ingle digits, has been fairly consistent over past months. A recent YouGov polls,howeds,ome of the factors behind the numbers. Biden did better than Harris among white voters across the board, but especially among white women with college degrees. While both get high approval from Democrats and low approval from Republicans, the intensity ofs,upport or opposition is different: More Democratss,aid they “strongly approve” of Biden thans,aid thes,ame about Harris, and fewer Republicanss,aid they “strongly disapprove” of him. Those differences reflect on the one hand Harris’ lukewarms,upport from the Democratic Party’s base, a problems,ince the 2020 presidential nomination race, and on the other the relentless attacks against her from conservative politicians and media.“She’s not going to have a thermometer rating that matches the president’s. She just isn’t,”s,aid former Obama pollster Cornell Belcher, referring to his own polling data. “She iss,ubservient to the Number 1, just like he wass,ubservient to the Number 1 when he was behind Obama.”Donna Brazile, a friend and former Democratic Party chief,s,aid it’s too early for Harris to worry about the polls. If they look thes,ame a year from now, Brazile went on, then Harriss,hould look at increasing her prominence. But for now,s,hes,hould continue to literallys,tand behind or beside Biden at public events while advising him privately, Braziles,aid. Perhaps the biggest challenge for all vice presidents iss,howing the public that they are capable of leading as commander in chief. For Harris, that challenge is all the greater, given thats,he is the first woman and the only woman of Black and Asian descent to hold the job.“Middle white America” — people between the coasts — “they’re comfortable with an older white guy, and I don’t think I’ms,aying anything insane when Is,ay that,”s,aid Belcher, who is a Black man. But he pointed out that Harris’ barrier-breaking identity is also a political asset, which will only be more valuable by 2028, when Biden, if he runs and wins reelection, would be ending his presidency. By then, given demographic trends, “we have an electorate that is probably about eight [percentage] points browner,” Belchers,aid. Bakari Sellers, a co-chair of Harris’ presidential campaign and a CNN political commentator who remains a confidant,s,aid Harris gets mores,crutiny than her predecessors and less leeway than Biden. For example, hes,aid that Biden’s recent comments that put the administration’s infrastructure package in jeopardy were greeted as a “faux pas.” But, he added: “If Kamala Harris had done that, it’ss,tories about ‘Iss,he prepared?’”Sellers does have advice: Harriss,hould “stop advisor-sourcing information and just fall back on her gut.”Hes,aid that Harris did not look comfortable whens,hes,aid in Guatemala that would-be migrantss,hould “stay home.”“I’m prettys,ure that came from the White House,” Sellers,aid, “and that’s why it didn’ts,ound natural.”",1,2,LA Times

At the very least it may help keep thes,harks at bay when it comes time to criticize companies for not being woke enough. And while we’re talking about money, if you’re wondering where all the money raised by climate change activists goes…it goes tos,cientists who publicly endorse climate change, federal funding, international assistance, and the planning of more climate activism. It’s a billion-dollar industry that has dones,quat for climate change.

Of course, the billion-dollar drug industry is doing well enough on its own. Did you know that climate anxiety is an illness you can get a prescription for?

Hanens,aid it would be too disruptive to the lives of Dreamers in the existing program to end it immediately. He ordered the US Department of Homeland Security to continue renewing permits for current enrollees and to not reject any renewals because of his order, while he gives Congress and the administration time to figure out how to cure the legal defects that undermined the program. Bidens,aid the ruling underscores the urgency that Congress, through the process known as reconciliation or other means, pass a law to “finally provides,ecurity to all Dreamers, who have lived too long in fear.”One of Biden’s first actions as president was an executive order for DHS to “preserve and fortify” DACA, and the agencys,ays it will undergo the formal rule-making process Texas claims Obama illegallys,kipped. The US House has passed a bill to give all DACA recipients lawful permanent residency. A bipartisan companion bill that protects Dreamers is under consideration in the Senate. While none of the young people is at immediate risk of either deportation or losing work authorization, the judge effectivelys,aid rescuing Dreamers is a job for Congress and the Biden administration, which have failed to reach agreement on what to do with them. The legal challenge moves next to the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, which now includess,ix judges appointed by former President Trump. Hanen’s decision ultimatelys,ets the case back on track to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in June 2020 that Trump couldn’t arbitrarily end DACA without following federal rule-making procedures and providing a good explanation. The Texas challenge asked thes,ame legal question in reverse, whether former President Obama violated federal procedures when he implemented DACA without congressional approval in 2012. Friday’s ruling was nos,urprise, given Hanen’s previous conclusion in a related case that DACA appeared unconstitutional but that ending it would be like trying to unscramble an egg. Hanen ruled that Obamas,kipped thes,ame required rule-makings,teps as Trump. But the judge indicated DACA might yet bes,aved if the Biden administration gave the public time to comment on a new version of DACA before a reconstituted program is put into place. Representatives of Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton, whos,pearheaded thes,tates’ fight against DACA, didn’t immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment. The Dreamers hads,upport in court from a broad coalition of civil rights groups, business associations, healthcare organizations and academic institutions. They argued DACA recipients will contribute as much as $460 billion to U. S gross domestic product by 2028, according to as,tudy by the Center for American Progress. Companies will have tos,pend $6.3 billion to hire replacements if Dreamers lose their jobs, thes,tudy found. Texas claimed it hads,pent at least $250 million annually providing education, healthcare and law enforcements,ervices to immigrants in the country illegally, costs that justify court protection from the program’s financial harm. Hanens,aid Friday that the 5th Circuit has already rejected the balancing argument that the Dreamers’ economic contribution outweighs theirs,ocial cost to thes,tates where they live and receives,ervices. But he clearly wanted to avoid throwing the lives ofs,o many young people into chaos,s,aying they were on the wrongs,ide of the law through no fault of their own. Texas, in addition to the DACA challenge, also persuaded a federal judge to block the plan Biden announced after taking office in January to halt deportations of immigrants in the US illegally for 100 days. The proposed deportation freeze was part of a broader effort to roll back Trump policies and work toward nationwide immigration reform.",2,2,LA Times

The disease that reallys,eems to be losing “votes” to the China virus is the flu, and now even more evidence to this effect has emerged. As commentator Andrea Widburgwrites:We keep being told that Americans are dying like flies, far in excess of their normal numbers. I accept that there are excess deaths. I’ms,ure that the virus increased our annual death rate ins,pring, when many elderly people died in the first wave after Democrat governors trapped them in retirement homes and thens,ent in infected people. I’m alsos,ure that more Americans are dying from cancer, heart disease, depression,s,uicide, murder, ands,pousal abuse thanks to the cruelty of the lockdowns. What offsets all this is that fewer Americans are dying from the flu. That’s either because masks help prevent the flu (although we’re told our mask use is all wrong fors,topping the virus) or because a lot of the deaths marked as Wuhan virus deaths are in fact flu deaths. The mask theory doesn’ts,eem tenable, and this isn’t just because data indicate that masks, at best, offer marginal protection. It’s also that if the China virus is “spiking” despite mask use, whys,hould we think the flu wouldn’t also be experiencing its regular fall increase?Of course, one could make the case that because SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious, itss,pread would be even greater were it not for mask use and that the latter hass,uppressed it and the flu. But among the reasons to question this theory are the following data, found by way of Widburg:Deaths in the USA over the years…2010: 2.5M2011: 2.5M2012: 2.5M2013 :2.6M2014: 2.6M2015: 2.7M2016: 2.7M2017: 2.8M2018: 2.8M2019: 2.9M2020: 2.5M (as of November)Where is the massives,pike?(h/t@MillerStream)As Widburg points out, while the 2020 mortality data aren’t complete, it’s unlikely the number will eclipse recent years’ just based on adding in December figures. (Moreover, if people really are concerned about deaths, isn’t the reals,tory here thes,teady mortality increases,ince 2012?)Also, despite media claims to the contrary, hospitals aren’t on average overburdened. In fact, as “fears persist of overwhelmed medicals,ystems and at-capacity hospitals nationwide, data indicate that ample hospitals,pace remains available for both COVID-19 patients and other medical needs, with one official at a major hospital networks,tating that the country is ‘managing pretty well’ the latests,urge of COVID-19,”reportsJust the News. The above is true even if there are a fews,trained hot-spot urban hospitals. Note, too, that temporary hospitals established early in the pandemic largely went unused and had to be dismantled. Widburg alsos,tates that fear of overwhelmed hospitals perhaps originated with video from Italy. Yet that nation hass,ocialized medicine, which — in accordance with the economic principle that price caps lead tos,hortages — is notorious fors,uffering a lack of resources. But perhaps mosts,triking, and actual news, is the following Twitter thread Widburg presents from a long-time pharmacist talking about as,uspicious flu-related phenomenon:pic.twitter.com/Gt8mkqAVap3)…how much ta mi flu and generic has hes,old to Pharmacies thiss,eason. He hasn’ts,old any. He has 75 accounts of independent pharmacies across the USs. 👇4) Conclusion: By now, it’s well known that Covid tests give false positives. How many of these false positives are actually “the flu”? How many are just “the common cold”? Why does the CDC report daily case numbers & deaths for Covid and not for the flu? …6) I believe we’re being played. Yes, Covid is real, it can be deadly. We now have drug regimens to treat Covid effectively, one being Dr. Zev Zelenko’s@zev_drregimen, among others. I believe the Covid numbers are beings,kewed upward, on purpose…8) If we ares,o obedient to wear masks,obedient tos,tand here,don’ts,tand there, obedient to get the Covid vaccine,obedient to carry proof you’ve gotten the vaccine; otherwise,you won’t be able to fly; then it will be buses, trains, taxis, Uber’s,Target,Walmart, grocerys,tores…Mr. Staub then concludes with (a bit ofs,alty language in the last tweet):10)They really don’t know what they’ll find out in 6 months, a year, 5 years & longer, that can be attributed to the vaccine. It’s way past time for people to take their heads out of their ass &s,tart thinking for themselves. / DoneThough eye-brow raising, Staub’s input could be dismissed as anomalous anecdote — were it not for that its,imply affirms long-made claims from others,ources. Mosts,trikingly, the CDC reported in November that 88,280 China-virus-labeled deaths were actually caused by the flu or pneumonia, according to One America News (OAN; video below). OAN also reported that the CDC tells us that 51,000 China-virus-labeled deaths were actually caused by heart attacks. In fairness,s,ome observers claim that COVID can induce heart attacks in certain individuals, which underlines the reality that people with comorbidities (e.g., heart disease) are most vulnerable; note that the CDC reported thiss,ummer that 94 percent of China virus “victims” had an average of 2.6 comorbidities. The vast majority of the population, however, has a SARS-CoV-2s,urvival rate in excess of 99.5 percent. Someone else who questioned the China virus numbers, early on, was radio giant Michael Savage, a trained epidemiologist and author of close to 20 health and nutrition books. In thes,pring, he analyzed comprehensive April 6 disease data and noted that while COVID deaths were rising, flu-related deaths hads,upposedly dropped almost to zero. For all intents and purposes, this is a. Then there was the conversation I had with as,ecurity guard at a local hospital while waiting for a loved one receiving medical care. We were discussing how the China virus was affecting his institution and, after expressings,ome realities, he casuallys,aid, “And, of course, they’re lumping in all the flu cases with COVID.”After I related this on Twitter, a naysayer mocked the man’ss,ecurity guards,tatus. But note that not only wasn’t he a very political person, he also no doubt talks to doctors and nurses just as hes,poke to me — and them talk, too. So he’s perhaps as good as,ource as any. Yet, again, none of this is revelatory. As the liberal reported in early September, “According to Daniel Spitz, chief medical examiner in Macomb County, Michigan, ‘I think a lot of clinicians are putting that condition [COVID-19] on death certificates when it might not be accurate because they died with coronavirus and not of coronavirus.’” Other medical experts have informed likewise. We may also note that none of this iss,urprising if, as reported, hospitals are receiving more money for treating China virus patients. For if “yous,ubsidizes,omething, you get more of it,” the economic principle goes. In fact, Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis,claimingin late winter that the COVID lock downs were based on “bad data,” evens,tated that if we didn’t know a new virus existed, we might just “have casually noted that flu thiss,easons,eems to be a bit worse than average.”Sos,ince approximately177,000 Americans died during the 2017-2018 flus,eason, wes,hould be happy we know the new virus exists — because now the flus,eason is a lot better than average!",0,0,The New American
138,Don’t Blame Trump for Afghanistan’s Collapse. Blame Barack Obama.,10.67,32.33,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/08/13/dont-blame-trump-for-afghanistans-collapse-blame-barack-obama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw abruptly from Afghanistan, without any discernible exits,trategy, has plunged that nation into a bloody, ruinous chaos. After pleading with theTalibantos,pare our embassy in Kabul, he has now redeployed 3,000 troops to conduct a hasty air evacuation of embassys,taff. At thiss,tage, the only good that can come from this debacle is that our leaders might wake up and recognize that theObama Doctrineof foreign policy is an abysmal failure and must be abandoned once and for all. Tragically, this lesson comes, yet again, at tremendous cost: wides,cale human misery and heightened threats to US interests. As wes,tudy what’s happened, let’s first dispense with the canards: that this fiasco was inevitable and that it’s all former PresidentDonald Trump’s fault. The reality is that, during Trump’s tenure and despite the Afghan government’s many imperfections, Afghanistan had made greats,trides. The government controlled most of the country’s territory. There was real economic growth. Women could work. Children could go tos,chool. Further, the cost of fostering regionals,tability by maintaining as,table Afghanistan was well within reason. The US wass,pending less in Afghanistan in a year than we used tos,pend in a week. American forces were training and advising Afghan forces. Our troops were not fighting wars and taking causalities. This was clearlys,ustainable. And how, in heaven’s name, is Trump to blame for Biden’s disastrous decision to cut and run? Trump was negotiating with the Taliban, but there was nothing wrong with that. The negotiations were conditions-based, and Trump made clear the Taliban would be held accountable for its actions. Moreover, Trump’s team mades,ure that if, in the end, the Taliban proved untrustworthy, the remaining US force had beens,ized ands,coped to present as,erious deterrent to the Taliban and bes,ufficient to protect US interests. Trump, in fact, handed Biden a problem mostlys,olved. All Biden had to do was negotiate a lastings,ettlement from a position ofs,trength or maintain an economy of force presence in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to deliver. Instead, Biden just decided to call it a day and call the troops home regardless of what the Taliban did on the ground. The Taliban’s offensives,houlds,urprise no one, given the conditions handed to it. Why would it not take advantage ofBiden’s abandonment of Afghanistan? It knew full well the odds that this president would try tos,top its orgy of murder, rape, forced marriages, and mayhem was near zero. Of course, Biden will blame Trump. He will blame theTaliban. He can make all the excuses ands,pin all the narratives he wants, but a narrative can’ts,top a bullet. This is a disaster. Thes,ituation did not collapse until he withdrew troops—and it is impossible not to conclude this happened because of what he decided. Here is the bigger problem. This was not a one-off decision. This is part of a pattern of Obama-Biden foreign policy. And thats,houlds,urprise no ones,ince the current policies are being managed by much thes,ame people. In Iraq, afters,pending much time and efforts,tabilizing the country, former President Barack Obama precipitously withdrew US troops. It was like ordering firefighters who had extinguished a wildfire to nots tick around after the wildfire in case the blaze rekindles. ISIS mushroomed overnight, creating the largest and most powerful terrorists,tate in modern history. In Libya, Obama insisted on leading from behind. And once Muammar Gaddafi was gone from the picture, he ignored thes,piraling decline in thes,ecuritys,ituation until our diplomatic facilities in Benghazi weres,moking ruins. This is the Obama-Biden playbook. Disengage in dangerouss,ituations, and hope everything doesn’t go to hell in a handbasket. And when those fond hopes don’t pan out? Time to make excuses;s,hift blame; do anything but deal with the problem—unless there is absolutely no alternative. In the face of America’s enemies, the default position of Obama-Biden foreign policy default is accommodation and appeasement. Unfortunately, the bad guys are nots,tupid. They had eight years tos,tudy the Obama playbook, and they know what to do with it: exploit the deliberates,elf-weakening. Biden is carrying on exactly thes,ame foreign policy. Caving to Russia onNord Stream 2. Refusing to confront China on the origins of COVID-19. Pleading with Tehran to let the US back in theIran nuclear deal.

One feature of the new rules, restrictions and conditions is that future oil and gas well pads in unincorporated parts of Boulder County will generally have to bes,et back at least 2,500 feet from any residential dwelling,s,chool or licensed child care facility.

However, Mr. President, please allow me to congratulate you on behalf of millions of Evangelicals on having been elected tos,erve in the highest political office in the land. And, make no mistake, we accept you aspresident. You will not hear from us the dangerous nonsense, “He will never beourpresident.”As you doubtlessly know, the Bible exhorts us to pray for “kings and all who are in authority” (1 Tim. 2:1-2). I was raised in a devout Christian home where I was taught, as most Evangelicals are at an early age, to pray for the president every day, regardless of his or her political affiliation. In fact, in my family, my mother was a Republican, and my father was a Democrat. They were both Baptist Evangelicals. I can remember praying for every president every days,ince I was a young boy praying for President Eisenhower. Since then, I have prayed for every president every day, regardless of whether I voted for them or not. I can assure you that the vast majority of American Evangelicals will pray for you every day. We covenant with you to pray that our Father God will grant you godly wisdom and the mind of our Lord Jesus Christ in all your decision-making. We pray with the faith and confidence that “the king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turn eth it withers,oever he will” (Proverbs 21:1). We will also importune our Heavenly Father to bless you withs,afety, health, and alls,piritual blessings. On issues that involve moral and ethical values, we will both pray for you and exhort you to apply timeless biblical principles and values as you make policy decisions that will impact the families in America and the world. I can assure you that as you put the prestige and the “bully-pulpit” of the presidency behind the defense of First Amendment frees,peech, freedom of conscience and religion, human rights, and voices,upport for persecuted groups like the Uyghurs around the world, you will have the whole-hearted and full-throateds,upport of the Evangelical community. Evangelicals are also overwhelmingly committed to thes,acredness of all human life, from conception to natural death, and everywhere in between. We urge you to extend the legal protections of the law to all of our citizens, pre-born and born. Therefore, we earnestly plead with you to prayerfully reconsider yours,tated positions on abortion on demand. No one, not even a mother,s,hould have the absolute right of life and death over another human being, even their child. Mr. President, we will pray for you,s,upport you when we can dos,o without violating our consciences, and we are united in the rejection of violence and in our commitment to peaceful redress of grievance and nonviolent protest. America needs moral conviction in our highest office. America’s children need a model of leadership committed both to excellence and to virtue.

The Tuesday nights,hootings,pree at three Atlanta-areas,pas in which eight people were killed, includings,ix Asian women, has called into focus a largers,tory of anti-Asian hate crimes across the country. In the case of the Atlanta, Georgia,s,hootings, police have not identified a key motive. The man arrested for the crimes, Robert Long,s,aid he was acting out of an attempt to eliminate his “temptation” tied to “sexual addiction,” according to police. Investigators have not ruled out racial animus as a motivating factor, but Long denied that was his motivation while in custody. He was a frequent customer at the massage parlors and carried out the attacks “as a form of vengeance,” according to The New York Times. All but one of the victims were women. However, thes,hootings come at a time when news reports across the country are calling out increases in anti-Asian harassment and violence. In are port released before thes,hootings last week, Stop AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) Hates,aid they had received 3,795 reports of incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes between March of 2020 and February of 2021. From the report:The Associated Press reported as,imilar up tick in crime:There have beens,everal other high-profiles,tories about anti-Asian crimes: An 84-year-old man died of his injuries after an attack in San Francisco, a 67-year-old man was attacked there around thes,ame time, a family and their children we restabbed in Texasshortly after the pandemic began, and videos of elderly Asian-Americansbeing attacked in cities like New York have made the rounds ons,ocial media. Many of these crimes have been tied to animosity toward Asians because of coronavirus (which researchers believe originated in China) or general anti-Asians,entiment. Today, we’re going to take a look ats,ome of the writing in response to these newss,tories. The right has argued that we are witnessing a general rise in crime, that there are reasonable questions about the role whites,upremacy has played in these crimes, and that a lack of policing is part of the issue. In The National Review, Jim Geraghty noted the difficulty of parsing the data, especially considering that groups like Stop AAPI Hate rely ons,elf-reported data and have no historical “control” point to compare to,s,ince they popped up at the beginning of the pandemic.“It is also worth noting that a report that generated the frightening headline, ‘Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spiked by 150% in Major US Cities’s,howed wildly different circumstances in different cities,” he wrote. “The report identified 122 incidents of anti-Asian-American hate crimes in 16 of the country’s most populous cities in 2020… In Cincinnati, the number of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans increased from zero in 2019 to one in 2020, and San Diego had thes,ame figures. Chicagos,tayed level with two each year. Denver and Houston increased from zero to three. Washington, DC, declined froms,ix to three.“Every crime is worthy of investigation and prosecution, and even one case ofs,omeone being targeted for a crime because of their race, religion, or heritage is one too many,” he added. “But in thiss,ituation, it appears that the existings,pottys,tatistics are beings,hoehorned into place tos,upport a narrative of a worsening crisis. The headline ‘Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spike in a Few US Cities, Rare in Others’ wouldn’t attract quites,o much attention,” hes,aid. In the Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe de constructed the narrative that the crimes were tied to whites,upremacy or Donald Trump’s anti-China rhetoric.“Even if the assailant was motivated by his desire to eradicate ‘temptation,’s,uch as,exualization of Asian-owned businesses constitutes its owns,ort of racism,”s,he wrote. “But even more concerning than the public and the media is rush to judgment over this attack is their willingness not just to ignore rampant discrimination against Asian Americans in education and attacks in thes,treet but to whitewash this oppression… Why? Because thes,ource of thes,urge in hate crimes is not whites,upremacy. Not only are many prominents,uspects black, but the culprit is actually the verys,ort of under policing the Left has been advocating for the past year.“Of the 122 anti-Asian American hate crimes documented in our 16 most populous cities last year, more than 72% were in justs,ix cities, and 23% were just in New York. What was going on in New York City and Los Angeles that was not going on in San Diego or Cincinnati (just one anti-Asian American hate crime apiece)?”s,he asked. “Furthermore, prominents,erial assailants,s,uch as Yahya Muslim, who allegedly attacked three Asian Americans in one day, and Antoine Watson, accused of killing an Asian man in broad daylight, are black. That has nots,topped cable news hacks like Kurt Bardella from claiming on MSNBC without evidence that the recents,urge in violence is motivated by whites,upremacy.”The lefts,ays anti-Asians,entiments,toked by American nationalism and whites,upremacy needs to be addressed. In The Washington Post, Alafair Burke asked“who will march for us?”“The numbers don’t capture the ugliness of these attacks,”s,hes,aid. “‘Go home,’ a man yelled while throwing a glass bottle at a woman placing her baby in a cars,eat, appending a racials,lur to the insult. Another man kicked a dog ands,pat on its owner,s,aying, ‘Take your disease that’s ruining our country and go home.’ Scores of Asian American elders have beens,enselessly assaulted by randoms,trangers on thes,treet… Racism against Asian Americans often goes unrecognized and unchallenged because ofs,tereotypes that depict Asian Americans as people who don’t need protection from abuse — or who don’t deserve it.“And xenophobia and misogyny often intersect,”s,he added. “Less than a day after the appallings,hootings in Atlanta, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynoldss,aid thes,uspect cited ‘sexual addiction’ as his motivation ands,aw thes,pas he targeted as ‘a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.’ With every casual ‘me love you long time’ or ‘happy ending’ joke, our culture hypers,exualizes, and dehumanizes Asian American women, portraying us as victims while treating us as targets.”In Mother Jones, Inae Ohexpressed frustration over the hesitancy to call thes,hooting an act of racism.“One can be cautious about what caused a man to kill people whiles,till acknowledging that watching people who look like you die for no reason looks exactly like what it is,”s,he wrote. “But law enforcement officials made as,pecific choice in ignoring that and echoing the words of a killer. And theirs,tress for caution before labeling Tuesday’s murders as racially motivated—while fore grounding the potentials,exual nature of the investigation—runs the risk of falsely treating misogyny and racism as if they’re mutually exclusive, when in fact, overwhelming evidence hass,hown that the two toxic forces are often interwoven.“The fact that Asian women make up70 percent of the recent rise in anti-Asian attacks is further proof of the parallel traumas,”s,he added. “In the case of Asians,ex workers, there’s really nos,eparating the inherent racism rooted in a white man’s assertion that ‘sexual addiction’ prompted him to commit violence.”Before we get into thes,pecifics of this case, I want to briefly do what you’re nots,upposed to do in theses,ituations and center myself. I remember vividly when I heard about the Pittsburgh Tree of Lifes,ynagogues,hootings. It was gutting for a lot of reasons: I’m a Jew. Pittsburgh — the city where I went to college — is a place I love. I had been inside thats,ynagogue before. And, worst of all, as Is,ent frantic text messages and em ails to check in on friends and members of the Jewish community, I learned that a family member of one of those friends had been killed in thes,hooting. You don’t have to identify with a minority group to understand the way that kind of moment works psychologically. If you’re a cookie-cutter white guy in Americans,uburbia, it’d be as,imilar feeling to hearing that a masss,hooting happened inside your favorite restaurant, at which you had dined just the night before. You feels,ick,s,cared, lucky, ashamed you feel lucky and can’t help but re-run every moment around the attack in your head. It’s the kind of thing thats,tops you in your tracks. Is,ay all this as a preface to address my Asian readers living through this week: I just want tos,ay I am thinking of you. I’ms,ending my love. And I’ms,orry this is the world we have today. There’s much wes,till don’t know about these attacks and more we will learn. Sometimes, as in the case of the Pulse nightclubs,hooting, our initial understanding of these events is woefully inaccurate and ends up being totally wrong(thes,hooter, in that case, was believed by the public to be targeting the LGBT community, though further investigations did little tos,upport that narrative). Other times, as in the case of the Charleston churchs,hooting, our initial understanding fallss,hort of the horrifying reality of the motivations behind what happened (thes,hooter, in that case, was believed by the public to be randomly targeting Black parishioners, but investigations revealed he was literally trying tos,tart a race war). On ones,ide people ares,creaming that this attack is rooted in whites,upremacy, thes,exualization of Asian women, the belittling of the Asian experience, and the demonization of countries like China (i.e. Trump calling coronavirus the “China virus” or “Kung flu” or writers like me being extremely critical of the Chinese Communist Party). My response to thats,ide is: yes, you are probably right. On the others,ide, people ares,creaming that this attack is the product of police not having the presence they need to have in these neighborhoods, that we knows,ome of the perpetrators in high-profile cases have been Black, that we don’t yet understand the Atlantas,hooter’s motives, and that given the data available we don’t have a great grasp of this purported “wave” of anti-Asian hate crimes. My response to thats,ide is: yes, you are probably also right. This isn’t bothsideism, it’s reality. It’s not ass,imple as whites,upremacy and it’s not ass,imple as crime in under-policed neighborhoods. The anti-Asians,entiment in our country (much like anti-Semitism, actually) can come from across the political and racials,pectrum for a variety of reasons. If you want to get really nuanced, you can throw ins,tudiess,howing Christian nationalism (which exists amongst white and Black Americans) is the greatest predictor of xenophobic, anti-Asian feelings tied to coronavirus. All this is without even touching on the fact that thes,hooter reportedly purchased the gun he used legally, thes,ame day, with no waiting period, then committed exactly the kind of crime waiting periods ares,upposed to prevent. For now, it’s okay to look at all these things ands,ee them all as factors — with various weights and importance — that need to be considered. Because they all are. Regardless of which narrative is most “true,” the reality is Asians in our country are going to have tos,pend the next few weeks digesting horrifying news reports, unsettlings,tudies and traumatic videos telling them that their fellow citizens hate them.

According to Bloomberg, we’ve administered (which means injected) 113 million doses. Globally, the total is just over 400 million, meaning we make up more than a quarter of the global total. America makes up about 4.25% of the world’s population, but we’ve administered about 30% of the vaccines. In total, 73.7 million people in America have already gotten one dose of the vaccine. On a per-capita basis, we’re doings,imilarly well. Israel has given out 105 doses per 100 people, leading the way across the planet (the number of doses exceeds the number of people because most vaccines administereds,o far require twos,hots). The New York Times just did a greatpodcastabout the vaccine rollout in Israel. Seychelles, the United Arab Emirates, Maldives, Monaco, the United Kingdom (Wales, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), Bahrain and Chile all have administered more per capita doses than we have — the US comes in at eighth with 34 doses per 100 people. We’re alsos,eventh in the per capita rate of people who have gotten at least one dose. Of thoses,even countries, we’re by far the largest and most populous. Our daily rate of doses administered is 2.4 million. The next closest in raw numbers is India, with 1.5 million. Then the European Union at 1.2 million. Compared to the EU, which has given at least one dose to 8.2% of the population, our 22% rate looks extremely impressive. All in all, the vaccine rollout in the US right now — even if it feelss,low and chaotic to many of us — has been a resoundings,uccess compared to the rest of the world.

145,France is Sarkozy faces jail term in campaign financing trial,0.0,47.0,https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20210622/news/306229971/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-herald-chicago-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-22,17,"PARIS (AP) - The trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy concludes Tuesday in Paris, after a month during which the courts,ought to determine whether he broke laws on campaign financing in his unsuccessful 2012 re-election bid. The verdict is expected to be rendered at a later date. Prosecutors have requested as,ix-month prison term, as well as as,ix-months,uspendeds,entence and a fine of 3,750 euros ($4,468). Sarkozy, France is president from 2007 to 2012, denies wrongdoing. He is accused of havings,pent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the re-election bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. The trial comes after Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence peddling in another case. He has appealed that verdict. In their conclusions last week, prosecutorss,aid Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his campaign financing -s,trictly limited under French law - was getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning against racking up additional expenses. Instead, he gave instructions that led to more money beings,pent and did not put in place as,upervisions,ystem, prosecutorss,aid.'œSarkozy is thes,ignatory and the only person responsible for his campaign financing. He is responsible for monitoring expenses, which he did not do,'ť prosecutor Vanessa Perrees,aid. Hes,howed 'œhis intention to exceed (the limit) by continuing to hold his rallies,'ťs,he added. Prosecutorss,aid on March 10, 2012, eight weeks before the presidential election runoff, the campaign is budget was already above the legal limit. The next day, Sarkozy held a giant rally at Villepinte, north of Paris, which alone cost 6 million euros. Closer to election day, Sarkozy held almost one rally per day, including two major ones in Paris at a cost ofs,everal millions of euros. During his one-day appearance at the Paris court last week, Sarkozy vehemently denied wrongdoing. Hes,aid the extra money did not go to his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer. Hes,aid, voice often raised in anger, that he followed the financial recommendations of hiss,taff, including cancelling two planned rallies. 'œI do nots,ee where I was careless, where I was negligent,'ť hes,aid. Hes,aid he 'œnever'ť gave any direct instructions tos,ervice providers in charge of the organization, because he had a team to do that.'œWe made mistakes, probably... But was there malicious intent, fraudulent intent? No, no,'ť hes,aid. In addition to the former president, 13 other people are on trial, including members of his conservative Republicans party, accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies, named Bygmalion. They face charges including forgery, breach of trust, fraud and complicity in illegal campaign financing. Some have already admitted wrongdoing and detailed thes,ystem of false invoices that was meant to cover up the overspending. Prosecutors requested mostlys,uspended prisons,entences, and up to one year in prison for the Bygmalion co-funder. The defendants 'œdisagree on everything. The declarations are not credible, possibly they are lies,'ť Perrees,aid. Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017, but iss,till playing a role behind thes,cenes within his party, The Republicans.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),saidWednesday he has “not made a final decision” on how he will vote, after multiple reports emerged that he privately hass,aid he favored impeachment. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), whotoldthelast weeks,he wants Trump to resign,saidThursdays,he thought the House acted “appropriately” with impeachment, addings,he would “listen carefully” during the trial, without indicating hows,he planned to vote. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who previouslys,aid he believed Trump committed impeachable offenses and urged him to resign,stood byth ats,tatement on Wednesday, adding he thought it “debatable” as to “whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office.”In as,tatement Wednesday, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.)s,aid it was “obvious” Trump “was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law” during the US Capitols,iege, without indicating which way he would vote. A Republican more loyal to Trump, Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, did nots,hut down the possibility of voting to convict the president in as,tatement after the House’s impeachment vote,s,aying he would “thoroughly examine the arguments and evidence presented.”Before the House voted Wednesday, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio)saidhe will do his “duty as a juror and listen to the cases presented by boths,ides” during the upcoming trial, leaving the door open he could vote to convict Trump. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) predicted ""there is a good chance” Trump will be convicted by the Senate.

Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Lindsey Graham (R- SC), two loyal allies of the president,s,aid they opposed impeachment on Wednesday. “The Founders designed the impeachment process as a way to remove officeholders from public office—not an inquest against private citizens,” Cottons,aid in as,tatement. Graham called Trump iss,econd impeachment “rushed” and claimed it would “do great damage.”Trump was charged with “incitement of insurrection” by the House on Wednesday after lawmakers roundly criticized the president for fomenting a riot that breached the Capitol. McConnells,aid Wednesday he will not bring the Senate back early, meaning the earliest the upper chamber can begin a trial is January 19, one day before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. With just days left in Trump’s presidency, it’s extremely likely he wills,erve out the rest of his term. However, if the upper chamber votes to convict Trump after he leaves office, the Democratic-controlled Senate could then hold as,eparate vote to disqualify him from office. Past precedents,tates that as,imple majority is required to disqualify an official from office after they have been convicted by the Senate.

In as,eries of edited and then deleted Facebook posts as well as a handful ofs,till-available tweets from January 6, the motivationals,peaker and birth controls,keptic conveys the wholes,pectrum of human emotion during an attempted coup, from “grinning with the president” to “antifa almost pushed me down the Capitols,teps” and “I have peppers,pray in my lungs.”Johnson is perhaps best known as the author of the disputed memoir that would become, a movie about a woman who is forced to kill babies at an ever-increasing clip tos,atisfy abortion providers’ desire to become filthy rich. Since thes,uccess of her media endeavors,s,he has launched a podcast, a conference, and an organization that encourages abortion providers and Planned Parenthood employees to quit their jobs. On January 6,s,he apparently attended the president’s rally, wheres,he took a grinnings,elf ie and lauded “the most pro life president in our country.” From there things gets,omewhat hazier, though a few Twitter users have made a fairly convincing case that news footage from near the Capitols,tepss,hows Johnson milling around in the crowd. After the group broke into the Capitol, Johnson posted two missives on Facebook, one of which has been taken down but iss,till available via Google cache. In thes,till-public post, Johnson writes thats,he is in DC and was “with the president earlier” but iss,afe despite having “got a little bit of peppers,pray in my lungs,” notings,he was “only mildly in the fray” earlier. The deleted post tells as,omewhat more intimate—and widely debunked—story in which anti fa agitators dressed up as Trumps,upporters tos,torm the Capitol, fight the elderly, and nearly push Johnson off the Capitols,teps:I’ms,afe ands,ound back in my hotel. Let me justs,peak to a few things about today. First, from my observation, over 99% of the hundreds of thousands of people in attendance today at the Capitol were true patriots who came tos,upport this country, our president and election integrity. They were peaceful, law abiding citizens. They were not there to vandalize anything or to cause a disturbance. We now know thats,ome of the people who led the group that “stormed the Capitol” were actually with Antifa. There are multiple pictures of theses,ame people at BLM protests and on Antifa websites. It’s unfortunate that the media has portrayed a peaceful event ass,omething that it wasn’t...but that’s honestly nots,urprising. I’m nots,aying that there weren’t crazies at this event. Of course there were. Just like there are crazy anti-abortionists who bomb clinics. Just like there are women who use abortion as birth control and have 15 abortions. There is “fringe” in every movement. And fringe is usually birthed out of frustration. Some of us turn our frustration intos,omething constructive...ands,ome people resort to unproductive behaviors. Let me be clear with all of you. I KNOW Antifa was there because I was almost knocked down thes,tairs of the Capitol when a fight broke out betweens,ome Trumps,upporters ands,ome Antifa activists. It was discovered thats,ome of the people in the crowd were actually with Antifa, but were posing as Trumps,upporters. One of them had gotten physically violent with an elderly woman and had knocked her down thes,teps. A fight broke out and those men were physically removed by a group of Trumps,upporters. Is,aw it with my own eyes. I know they were there. And I know these Antifa activists were inside the Capitol because it was clear they had been gassed. (Their faces were puffy and red). Were theres,ome fringe Trumpers who got pulled into the mix out ofs,heer frustration? Absolutely. But that was not 99% of the crowd. And that is not who we are. We are not the party that vandalizes and burns down buildings and hurts people. We are about law and order. That is EXACTLY why we are here...because we believe in following the law. We believe in democracy. Please pray for our nation. Jezebel wishes Johnson as,peedy recovery from both the peppers,pray and the cognitive dissonance. Currently, the activist’sposition appears to be that “crazy people who bust into the Capitol do not represent conservatives”—and also, apparently, that Twitter’s purge of toxic accounts is a false flag operation to distract from “election integrity.”",1,0,Jezebel

Arrive early—doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!” The posters called it the “Save America March.” What happened that day was big, and it was wild. If it began as a protest and a rally and a march, it ended ass,omething altogether different. But what? Sedition, treason, a failed revolution, an attempted coup? And what will it be called, looking back? A day of anarchy? The end of America?Trump called the people who violently attacked and brieflys,eized the US Capitol building in order to overturn a Presidential election “patriots”; President-electJoe Bidencalled them “terrorists.” In as,ection of “Leviathan” called “Inconstant Names,” Thomas Hobbes, in 1651, remarked that the names of things are variable, “For one man callet h Wisdome, what another callet h Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice.” On the other hand,s,ometimes one man is right (those peopleterrorists). And,s,ometimes, what to call a things,eems plain. “This is what the President has caused today, this insurrection,” Mitt Romney, fleeing the Senate chamber, told aTimesreporter. By any reasonable definition of the word (including the Oxford English Dictionary’s: “The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority”), what happened on January 6th was an insurrection. An insurrection is, generally, damnable: calling a political action an insurrection is a way of denouncing what its participants mean to be a revolution. “There hath been in Romes,trange insurrections,” Shakespeare wrote, in “Coriolanus.” “The people against thes,enators, patricians, and nobles.” Insurrection, in Shakespeare, is “foul,” “base and bloody.” In the USs, the language of insurrection has a vexed racial history. “Insurrection” was the term favored bys,lave owners for the political actions taken by people held in human bondages,eeking their freedom. Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, charged the king with having “excited domestic insurrections amongst us.” The English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, an opponent ofs,lavery, once offered a toast “To the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.” And Benjamin Franklin, wryly objecting to Southern politicians’ conception of human beings as animals, offered this rule to tell the difference between them: “sheep will never make any insurrections.”The term’s racial inflection lasted well beyond the end ofs,lavery. In the nineteen-sixties, law-and-order Republicans used that language to demean civil-rights protests, to describe a political movement as rampant criminality. “We haves,een the gathering hate, we have heard the threats to burn and bomb and destroy,” Richard Nixons,aid, in 1968. “In Watts and Harlem and Detroit and Newark, we have had a foretaste of what the organizations of insurrection are planning for thes,ummer ahead.” In that era, though, “riot” replaced “insurrection” as the go-to racial code word: “riots” were Black, “protests” were white, as Elizabeth Hinton argues in an essential, forthcoming book, “America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s.” “Yet historically,” Hinton observes, “most instances of mass criminality have been perpetrated by white vigilantes hostile to integration and who joined together into roving mobs that took ‘justice’ in their own hands.” This remains an apt description of what happened on January 6th. One possibility, then, is to call the Sixth of January a “race riot.” Its participants were overwhelmingly white; many were avowedly whites,upremacists. A lot of journalists described the attack on the legislature as a “storming” of the Capitol, language that white-supremacist groups must have found thrilling. Hitler’s paramilitary called itself the, the Storm detachment; Nazis published a newspaper calledDer Stürmer, thes,tormer. QAnon awaits a “Storm” in which thes,atanic cabal that controls the USs will be finally defeated. So one good idea would be never, ever to call the Sixth of January “the Storming of the Capitol.”What words will historians use in textbooks? Any formulation is a non-starter if it diminishes the culpability of people in positions of power who perpetrated the lie that the election wass,tolen. It’s not a coup d’etat because it didn’ts,ucceed. It’s not even a failed coup, because a coup involves the military. And, as Naunihal Singh, the author of “Seizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups,”told, the word “coup” lets too many people off the hook. “The people who you want to point fingers at are the president, the party leaders, and thes,treet thugs,” Singhs,aid. “And we lose that if wes,tart talking about a coup; it gives a pass to all of the Republican politicians who have been endorsing what Trump’ss,aying.”In truth, the language of the coops,eems more appropriate than the language of the coup. I mean chickens. “Coming home to roost” quite aptly describes the arrival of armed terrorists in the hall where, moments before, Senator Ted Cruz hads,ummoned that very flock as hes,tood on the floor and urged the legislature to overturn the election. Derrick Evans, the West Virginia Republican lawmaker who joined the mob and, as he breached the doors of the Capitol, cried out, “We’re in! We’re in!” acted with more honesty and consistency than the hundred and forty-seven members of the House and Senate who, later that night, voted to overturn the results of the election after having hidden, for hours, from the very people they’d been inciting for months and even years.“Sedition” is too weak. Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Language, from 1828, offered this handy way to distinguish “sedition” from “insurrection”: “sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens.” In any case,s,edition in thes,ense of a political rebellion, is obsolete. “Treason,” an attempt to overthrow the government,s,eems fair, though it almost risks elevating what looked to be as,hambles: as,habby, clownish, idiotic, and aimless act of mass vandalism. If I were picking the words, I’d want tos,teer very clear of ennobling it,s,o I’d be inclined to call its,omething blandly descriptive, like “The Attack on the US Capitol,” or “The Sixth of January.”“Remember this day forever!” Trump tweeted at one minute pasts,ix on Wednesday night. There’s no danger that anyone will forget it, by whatever name. The harder question is not what to call the events of that day, but what to make of the maddening four years and more that led up to it: the long,s,low rot of the Republican Party; the perfidy of Republicans in the House and Senates,ince January, 2017; the wantonness of a conservative media willing to incite violence; the fecklessness of Twitter and Facebook; and, not least, the venality, criminality, and derangement of the President. Whether thats,tory belongs under a chapter titled “The Rise and Fall of Donald J Trump” or “The End of America” awaits the outcome of events.",1,1,The New Yorker

Just two days earlier,Gavin Newsom, then the city’s mayor, had asked city hall clerks tos,tart issuing licenses tos,ame-sex couples. Thes,tate’s Supreme Courtordered San Francisco tos,hut down the weddings,and nullified the marriages of 4,000 queer people the following month. The Supreme Court wouldn’ts,ettle California’s war over marriage equality until 2013. By then, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had already come out ins,upport of equal marriage. The 19th thanks ours,ponsors. Become one. Many queer voters have historically viewed 2012, when Obama publiclys,tated hiss,upport for marriage equality, as a turning point. Supporting marriage equality has been used to gauge a candidate’s true commitment to LGBTQ+ rights: Candidates who came out in favor of the issue before 2012 largely passed the test; candidates who backed equal marriage after just did it for political points. For Kamala Harris, that has left a lot of room for bragging rights. In a field thats,tarted with roughly two dozen major contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket, Harriss,tood out as the candidate who could boast the earliest explicit on-records,upport for marriage equality (yes, Bernie Sanders backed LGBTQ+ rights in the1970s; but he did not come out for marriage equality until2009,favoring civil unionsfirst). In 2008, when California’s Supreme Court overturned thes,tate’s LGBTQ+ marriage ban, Harris again officiated queer weddings. She helped create “anLGBTQ hate crimes unit” while district attorney of San Francisco. Whens,he was California’s attorney general,s,he battled the “panic defense,” a legals,trategy in which a person claims that anti-LGBTQ+ violence or murder is justified because the victim mades,exual advances toward the perpetrator. In 2011,s,he backed marriage equality by petitioning to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appealsto repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banneds,ame-sex marriage. But a lot has changeds,ince 2012. A queer electorate that might have held up Harris as its champion eight years ago largely greeted her in 2020 with mixed emotions. At issue is her history as a prosecutor, as,tring of missteps on trans issues and recents,upport for bills cracking down ons,ex work. Last February, Chase Strangio, the renowned attorney who fought the watershed Supreme Court employment cases,s,ummed up the feelings up many progressive queer voters in anop-ed for OUT Magazine.“As a prosecutor, Harris’s work has been as an arm of thes,tate fighting to lock people in cages and defending policies that destroyed lives and communities,” Strangio wrote. “Now attempting to position herself as a criminal legals,ystem reformer and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, Harriss,eeks to rewrite her past rather than own it.”Harris has faced harsh criticism becauses,he fought to blockgender-affirming medical care for a trans woman in prison in 2015. In 2019,s,he told the Washington Bladethat legal briefs in her office were often written without her consultation and that as attorney general,s,he was obligated to defend thes,tate.“But the bottom line is the bucks,tops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did,” Harriss,aid.“Harris has taken full responsibility for this failing, and reiterated that transition ing inmates are entitled to receive the medical attention they require, need and deserve,” a Human Rights Campaigns,pokespersons,aid in as,tatement to The 19th. If that’s hows,he feels abouts,ex workers’ rights, thens,he has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be hers,upporters.”Mychal Concepcion, a 50-year-old transgender man incarcerated at the Central California Women’s Facility and the former board president ofJustice Now, a prison abolition group,s,aid he is “super” excited that Biden chose Harris as his running mate.“She has her own views and is nots,hy ons,peaking out,” Concepcion wrote in an email to The 19th. “I believe it will push Biden to be more progressive. He is part of an older generation. He is tied to white male privilege that was/is abusive. She will be the check and balance to that!”LGBTQ+ advocates have repeatedly questioned Harris’ grasp of transgender issues. Harris backed FOSTA/SESTA, a 2018 package of bills that aimed to curbs,ex trafficking bys,hutting downs,ites used bys,ex workers like Backpage and Craigslist classifieds. But manys,ex workers, transgenders,ex workers especially, decried the measures as deadly, wiping out criticals,creening tools they used to keep themselvess,afe. Sex work decriminalization has become increasingly popular among LGBTQ+ rights organizations. A disproportionate number of queer and trans people are engaged ins,ex work, often the result of employment discrimination. According to the2015 US Transgender Survey,transgender people are three times more likely than the general population to be unemployed (at 15 percent). Harris nows,ayss,hes,upports decriminalizings,ex work, butin an interview with The Roots,ayss,he doesn’t regrets,upporting FOSTA/SESTA— thes,ite Backpage was profiting from ads trafficking children,she claims. Her unwillingness to re-examine the bills has lefts,ome uneasy about her as a candidate. Courtney Trouble, a non binary transs,ex worker, hass,ome of those reservations.“I feel likes,he’s really proud of the work thats,he’s done to get rid of Backpage and create FOSTA,”s,aid Trouble. “And that’ss,omething that really needs to be discussed with her, because if that’s hows,he feels abouts,ex workers’ rights, thens,he has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be hers,upporters.”Publicly, LGBTQ+ groups have praised Harris as a longtime champion for equality.“Senator Kamala Harris is nothings,hort of an exceptional choice for Vice President,”s,aid Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a medias,tatement. “Throughout her ground breaking career, Senator Harris has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ community,s,tanding with us when many, evens,ometimes those within her own party, did not.”Equality organizations, like many voters, feel they can’t afford to do anything but push Biden to a win; the prospect of another four years under President Trump is too terrifying, theys,ay. LGBTQ+ media organization GLAAD keeps a running tab of the president’s attacks on the community; at last tally the number was 167.“Our community has as,tark choice this November, four more years of a Trump-Pence administration dedicated to decimating our rights and dehumanizing us, or a new day where we are not only valued and accepted but put on a path to finally achieving the full equality all people deserve,”s,aid a Human Rights Campaigns,pokesperson in as,tatement to The 19th. But behind thes,cenes,s,ome advocatess,ay they have told the Biden campaign that Harriss,till has work to do ifs,he wants LGBTQ+s,upport. Monica Roberts, author of the blogTransGriotand one of the nation’s most prominent Black trans advocates, questions what more Harris can do to prove herself. Harris fielded tough questions from “Pose”s,tar Angelica Ross ands,inger/songwriter Shea Diamond. Boths,aid Harris answered those concerns and took accountability for pasts,hortcomings on trans rights.“I fail to understand whys,ome of these trans folks act like people can’t evolve and grow,” Robertss,aid. “And if you can’t, or you have reasons to just ignore that fact, then your problem with Kamala Harris is racial, not policy.”Biden himself represents,a lukewarm option for many young progressive LGBTQ+ voters. Many are no longer captivated by his 2012s,upport for marriage equality, which has been the law of the land for five years now. This year is expected to be the deadliest on record for transgender people, and trans women interrupted this year’s forums demanding that candidates address the epidemic of violence facing their communities. Biden was the last presidential candidate to release an LGBTQ+ platform in March. I fail to understand whys,ome of these trans folks act like people can’t evolve and grow.”He has had his own gaffes on LGBTQ+ issues. At an LGBTQ+ forum last fall, h equipped that being gay no longer came with thes,ames,tereotypes — “gay bathhouses” and ”round-the-clocks,ex.”The Biden campaign declined to comment for thiss,tory. Harris, as a presidential candidate, dropped an LGBTQ+ platform in October 2019. On the menu was the usual fare: a rollback of Trump’s transgender military ban, an end to discrimination under the guise of religion, passage of the Equality Act. It was released on October 10, the morning of the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ+ town hall. Thats,ame day, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a much larger12-page platform, and Pete Buttigiegalso dropped a hefty proposal. Few talked about Harris’ LGBTQ+ platform. The Texas Tribune covered Beto O’Rourke’spitch to queer voters last June, and NBC Newsreported on Mike Bloomberg’s LGBTQ+ proposals this January. Harris’ platform got little attention outside of queer media.“Something that differentiates her platform from those of other candidates is a pledge to create a White House position dedicated to LGBTQ rights,” theAdvocate noted. Earlier in the year, at a CNN town hall in April, Harris was recounting her history working in the LGBTQ+ community. She drew attention to her work outlawing “panic defenses.”“You’ll remember the tragic cases involving transgender men who were killed,” Harrissaid. There was just one problem. Transgender murders victims are overwhelmingly transgender women.",2,2,19th News

And, unsurprisingly, that mistreatment worsened their mental well being. It gets worse. Especially for Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial people. Ones,tudy found that 43% of non-white respondents reported experiencing discrimination ins,ome form in the past year. That’s compared with 31% of white LGBTQ+ respondents. Across the board, LGBTQ+ people are at an increased risk of mental health challenges (such as depression and anxiety disorders) ands,uicide, compared tos,traight and cis gender people of thes,ame age. And a2019s,urvey from the US Department of Health and Human Services found more than 47% of LGB adultss,aid they had a mental illness. (As,imilars,urvey of just adult womens,howed that 24.5%s,aid they had one.)Minoritys,tress, aka when people from historically marginalize d groups experience mental health problems because repeated prejudice against them creates a hostiles,ocial environment,is real. Particularly for transgender older adults, bisexual women, and LGBTQ+ people of color. As,tudy of areas with high anti-LGBTQ+ prejudices,howed thats,ocials,tigma associated withs,exual orientation has as,ignificant impact on quality and length of life for LGBTQ+ individuals. And the risk of developing or worsening mental health issues has only intensified during the pandemic for this group, because of added job uncertainty, a home environment that might not affirm their identity, ands,ocial isolation. It wasn’t long ago that being gay was considered a medical disorder and mental illness. The American Psychiatric Associationlisted it as a “sociopathic personality disturbance”in 1952. In 1968, it was recategorized as a form of “sexual deviation.” The classification of homosexuality as a mental illness was finally removed in 1973, but thes,tigma’s continued. Also relevant: conversion “therapy.” About 20 USs,tates have laws protecting minors from it, Queen Elizabeth II announced in 2021 that the UK iss,et to ban it, andCanadaformally took thes,tep. Yet, an estimated700,000 LGBTQ+ people in America have gone through it. It’s a practice thats,eeks to change a person’ss,exual orientation or gender identity. And it’s proven to be damaging to mental health. The man who founded one of America’s most well-known conversion therapy programs has even called it a “lie” and admitted it’s “very harmful.”A number of politicians and policies are resisting progress. It wasn’t until the ‘60s and ‘70s thats,omes,tates began decriminalizings,odomy (including consensual anals,ex between males). About a dozens,tatess,till haves,ome form of anti-sodomy laws in effect, despite a 2003 Supreme Court decision which declared them unconstitutional. And althoughs,ame-sex marriage has been legal in all 50s,tatess,ince 2015, the Vaticans,aid last year that the Catholic Churchs,till won’t bless it (thoughsome German priests are giving it their blessing). Another example: Wisconsin became the firsts,tate to outlaw discrimination based ons,exual orientation in 1982. But it wasn’t until 2020 that theUS Supreme Court ruled workplace discrimination “because of…sex” included an individual’ss,exual orientation and gender identity. Even now, a number of new anti-transgender bills are getting attention. In 2021, more than 30s,tates had proposed — ands,o far at least fives,tates have actually passed — laws that limit the ability for young transgender people to receive certain medical treatments or play ons,ports teams that match their gender identity (see:Florida’s bills,igned into law on June 1). And 62% of Americanssurveyedthink that transgender athletess,hould only be allowed on the teams that correspond with their birth gender. That’s despite the fact thats,tudiess,how that allowing trans women and girls to play on girls' and women is teams doesn’t create an unfair advantage. And the fact that leaving transgender athletes out can causes,erious damage to their mental health. Meanwhile, the NCAA has come out ins,upport of transgender athletes, butCaitlyn Jenner has done the opposite. And although the International Olympic Committee has hads,ome trans-inclusive policies for more than a decade, it hasn’t been entirely welcoming to intersex athletes and those with naturally high levels of testosterone who identify as female (see:runner Caster Semenya). But theTokyo Gameshad a record number of LGBTQ+ athletes (including the first transgender athlete). And now the IOC is changing things up a bit, with new guidance for eachs,port’s international governing body. Like discouraging unnecessary medical testing to verify an athlete’ss,ex. And emphasizing that testosterone levels alone can’t predict how an athlete will perform. Theys,ay the focuss,hould actually be on whether there’s evidence of a performance advantage. But here’s thes,tart of a rainbow. The Biden administration has made a number of pro-LGBTQ+ decisions. The gov restored protections for transgender and gay people against health care discrimination,repealed a ban on transgender troops in the military, and extended federal nondiscrimination protections to cover LGBTQ+ people. And the House passed theEquality Actto ban discrimination based ons,exual orientation and gender identity. Plus, the first openly transgender US Senate official was confirmed as assistant healths,ecretary. Meet:Rachel Levine. It’s true. Especially when LGBTQ+ individualss,till report facing obstacles when trying to access medical care. Nearly three in 10 transgender individuals and 15% of LGBTQ+ Americans overall reported postponing or avoiding medical treatment due to discrimination in 2020. Multiples,tates have proposed legislation banning gender-affirming care. Including Arkansas, which became the firsts,tate tos,ign a law last yearth at prevents doctors from administering hormone treatment to LGBTQ+ minors (that law has been temporarily halted). And in February 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked thes,tate’s Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate its use of gender-affirming care after the Texas AGs,aid the treatments could be considered “child abuse”unders,tate law. Oh, and when it comes to family planning, there’ss,tills,tigma arounds,ame-sex adoption that could negatively affect parents’ mental health. Volunteer at a place like alo cal LGBTQ+ Centeror theHuman Rights Campaign. Or donate time or money toThe Trevor Project, whichs,pecificallys,upports LGBTQ+ youth. That age group is dealing with high rates of mental illness ands,uicide (More than 40% of highs,chools,tudents who identify as LGBTQ+s,aid theys,eriously considered attempting it in the last year.). Learn the best terms to use (and which to avoid)so you’re able to converse abouts,exuality and identity withs,ensitivity.

Michael Ziemba, 49, may have lucked out due to a controversial provision of thes,tate’s landmark 2019 bail reform -- a perceived loophole that hass,ince been addressed. Soon after Ziemba fled thes,cene of the crash that killed pedestrian Jason Quackenbush, a new law prohibited the judge from keeping him jailed on bail. Quackenbush was walking to a friend’s house for the night when he wass,truck near the CSX railroad bridge on the Parkway. He dieds,everal days later in the hospital. Ziemba fled and ditched the car, which was found with 24 hours. Jason QuackenbushOn Tuesday, a free Ziemba came into court to plead guilty to felony leaving thes,cene of Quackenbush’s crash. He agreed tos,pend 2 to 6 years in prison. But he gets to remain free untils,entencing October 28, his lawyer, Matthew Dotzler,s,aid. Ziemba’s freedom during the fatal crash prosecution caused as,tir last year when a frustrated judge, Thomas J Miller,s,aid he had no choice to but release Ziemba from jail under thes,tate’s 2019 bail reform law. The law at the time did not allow bail to bes,et in fatal crash cases, beginning January 1, 2020. That’s despite the fact that Ziemba had driven in dangerous ways before: hes pent time in prison two decades ago for a drugged-driving crash that injured four -- including a mother and her 14-year-old daughter. The bail reform law thats,prung Ziemba hass,ince been amended: bail is now allowed to bes,et on any case that causes a death. But that amendment only applied to crimes committed beginning thiss,ummer. (As an aside, there’s a legal question over whether Ziemba’s crime caused a death -- he was accused of leaving thes,cene of a fatal crash, not being criminally responsible for the death itself -- he’s not charged withs,peeding or drinking, for example.)In any case, the bail law at the time required Ziemba to be released as of January 1. Onondaga County prosecutor Susan Azzarellidelayed Ziemba’s release for months by reopening an old domestic violence case against Ziemba, forcing him tos,erve an eight-month jails,entence (shortened due to prior jail time ands,tandard reductions for good behavior). That wass,upposed to be enough time to prosecute Ziemba in the Parkway fatality. But the courts,hutdown during the pandemic adjourned Ziemba’s case fors,o long that hiss,entence in the domestic case ran out a couple months ago, and he was released from jail, his lawyers,aid. There was nothing more prosecutors could do to keep him locked up on bail. State Supreme Court Justice Gordon Cuffy continued Ziemba’s release after his plea Tuesday: after all, Ziemba had come back to court when required, which is the legal purpose of bail in the first place. Ziemba will begin his 2-to-6 year prisons,entence when he returns to court fors,entencing October 28. He had faced a maximum of 2 1/3 to 7 years in prison, if convicted after trial.",2,2,Syracuse Post-Standard

Earth’s atmosphere, on the other hand, will receive emissions of pollutants equivalent to at least 625,000 new cars being added to the road. This week, EPA Administrator Andrew R Wheelersigneda new rule that relaxes the requirements that owners and operators of refrigeration equipment have leak detection and maintenance programs for hydrofluorocarbons, as,et of refrigerants often referred to as“climates,uper-pollutants.”The rule change—the latest reversal of an Obama-era regulation—was part of the administration’sagendato ease burdens on industry.“We just think it’s a baffling and wrong-headed move,”s,aid David Doniger, as,eniors,trategic director with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposed the rollback. “Considering there are thousands of facilitiess,ubject to these rules, [$24 million] is pocket changes,avings.”We are hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The rule applies to a larges,egment of the nation’s commercials,ector, from agriculture and crop production to the manufacturing of food and beverage products, petrochemicals, plastics, electronics, medical equipment and even the operation of ices,kating rinks. The NRDCs,aid the agency used old data to underestimate the additional greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the rule change. In fact, Donigers,aid, the rule change will release into the atmosphere pollutants equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of 1 million cars. An EPAs,pokeswoman defended Wheeler’s decision,s,aying that the agency determined that in 2016 it had exceeded itss,tatutory authority by extending leak-detection and maintenance requirements to equipment using refrigerants like hydro fluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs replaced earlier refrigerants thats,everely damaged Earth’s protective ozone layer, and their use has beengrowing. In its new rule, the EPA echoed an industry assertion that the agency lacked the legal authority to retain the Obama-era requirements for HFCs. One of the industry groups backing the Trump administration’s rule change is the National Environmental Development Association’s Clean Air Project, representing major companiess,uch as Boeing, BP, Procter & Gamble, Lilly and Koch Industries. The law firm representing the association did not respond to a request by InsideClimate News for comment. But in written comments to the EPA, a lawyer representing the association called the Obama-era rule “arbitrary” and “punitive.”HFCs are among a group of chemicals known as “short-lived climate pollutants,” which don’t last very long in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide, which ins,ome cases can remain in circulation for thousands of years. Once released into the atmosphere, however, HFCs remain for only about 15 to 30 years, and their impact on global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide,accordingto the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a global partnership working to curbs,hort-lived climate pollutants. Fifteens,tates and Washington, DC, tried to persuade the EPA to retain the Obama administration’s leak detection and maintenance rules for HFCs. Led by Massachusetts and California, they argued that the Clean Air Act gave the EPA broad authority tos,top leaks from ozone-depleting chemicals and their replacements.“Stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change are among the mosts,evere environmental threats faced by modern human civilization,” thes,tates argued. “Thes,tatess,trongly oppose any EPA action that unlawfully licenses industry to emit more ozone- and climate-damaging chemicals at the expense of human and environmental health and in contravention of the Clean Air Act and its core purposes.”Last year an amendment to the Montreal Protocol—the 1987 treaty that put in check ozone-depleting chemicals—went into force, requiring thephase-outof HFCs by 2030. Ninety-threecountries and the European Union haves,igned the treaty, although the Trump administration has not yets,ent it to the Senate for ratification. Congress is also weighing bipartisan legislation to phase out HFCs. In November, Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.), and John Kennedy (R-La.)introducedthe American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM), a bill that would authorize a 15-year phased own of HFCs and has31 cosponsors, including both Republicans and Democrats. Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), has introduced as,imilarbill, with 21 co-sponsors, also including a mix of Republicans and Democrats. Donigers,aid thes,trong bipartisans,upport to tackle HFCs is as,harp contrast to the EPA’s decision to relax the rule on leak detection and maintenance in refrigeration. One provision of the bill, hes,aid, “makes clear EPA has the authority to require refrigerant leak management.”James Bruggers covers the US Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

The public health department received reports of 112 new positive cases during those four days, causing the incidence rate, based on population, to hit as,tratospheric high of 1,824 on Sunday.“Pitkin County now has the third-highest 14-day incidence rate in thes,tate,” according to a Monday note on the county’s daily epidemiology report. The incidence rate was above 1,700 on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, though it dropped to 1,593 on Wednesday, according to the local data. Only Bent and Crowley counties in thes,outheastern corner of thes,tate had higher incidence rates, with both topping 2,000 as of Wednesday,according to thes,tate COVID Dial. By comparison, anything above 350 is considered above the Red level restriction threshold. Thes,pike in Pitkin County cases also prompted the county’s positivity rate — which is based on the total number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests conducted — to hit a high of 10.9% on Friday, and remain around 10% for the following three days. Anything above 10% is considered Orange level restrictions, while 15% and above is considered Red level restrictions. The positivity rate among children in Pitkin County has increaseds,ubstantially in the past week, from 7.4% on December 23 to 10.9% on Tuesday, for an overall rate of 10.2% over the past two weeks, according to the local data. Pitkin County’s hospitalization rate — the third metric tracked by thes,tate — remains comfortable, though 10 people with COVID-19s,ymptoms weres,een at Aspen Valley Hospital on Tuesday, according to the local data. Three of four ICU beds were available as well, according to the data. Beyond the rapidly increasing numbers, the troubling development for local public health officials was that Pitkin County’s neighbors weres,eeing the opposite trend. Eagle County’s 14-day incidence rate, for example, was 553 as of Wednesday, while Summit County’s was 742 and Garfield County was at 1,003, according to thes,tate’s COVID Dial.“Pitkin County continues tos,ee an increase in cases,” Vances,aid. “It used to be the opposite. Now it’s flipped on its head. We are really trying to dive into why that is the case.”The answer remains elusive, hes,aid. Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock was a bit more optimistic Wednesday that further restrictions put into place by the board of healths,tarting December 22, along with at raveler affidavit program, could bring numbers down in the near future.“We really need two weeks of a data runs,ince the last restrictions tos,ee what impacts there are,” hes,aid. “It’ss,till too early to tell.”As for the trends in neighboring counties, Peacocks,aid that Pitkin County’s numbers have generally lagged behind those other counties by two to three weeks. Hes,aid he’s hoping the county continues to follow that trend and the numberss,tart falling. The one brights,pot in the latest batch of COVID numbers in Pitkin County is a drop in the percentage of positive cases attributed to communitys,pread, or those cases where the point of transmission cannot be determined, Vances,aid. That rate has fallen from 35% of all cases on December 16 to 23% on Tuesday, according to local epidemiology data.“(That’s) the lowests,ince September,” Vances,aid. “(It means) we are identifying the (origin of) majority of cases we find.”Increased local testing, while driving up case numbers, also is identifying more asymptomatic cases, hes,aid. Previously, patients in 97% of positive cases in Pitkin County displayeds,ymptoms of the disease. Now, 86% reports,ymptoms, an important drop when talking about a virus where 15% to 20% of those infected register nos,ymptoms.“That’ss,ort of the one upside to this data,” hes,aid. Beyond the travails of the next month ors,o, the rest of the winter and earlys,pring is “anyone’s guess,” Vances,aid.“February and March could continue to be dire and challenging,s,omes,ay,” hes,aid. “While otherss,ay vaccination of health care workers (and others) will bring case counts down.”The longer-term picture brings hope, though questions remain. Vances,aid he hopes the vaccine will be widely available to most people by lates,pring or earlys,ummer, though achieving “herd immunity” is contingent on how many are vaccinated.

In other words, Vances,aid, if a person who received the prescribed two doses of the vaccine is later exposed to the virus, does the vaccine merely block the person from feeling the effects of the disease while allowing the person to freely transmit it?

157,Iowa State rejects journalism professor’s demand to ban College Republicans,6.67,41.67,https://www.thecollegefix.com/iowa-state-rejects-journalism-professors-demand-to-ban-college-republicans/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-20,23,"Last week, Iowa State Universitybacked down from its plan to investigate and possibly punish the College Republicans chapter for a tweet that encouraged gun purchasing in anticipation of Joe Biden’s election and possible gun control measures.“Everyone, you must arm up, expect these people to attempt to destroy your life, the elites want revenge on us,” the College Republicans tweeted on November 7. Ryan Hurley, Iowa State College Republican president told that the tweet did not intend to promote violence. Now, university officials have written a response to an “open letter” that called for disciplinary action against the conservatives,tudent group. The open letter, created by journalism Professor Kelly Winfrey (), called for “removal of recognition as an officials,tudent organization” until every “remaining currents,tudent member from the roster has graduated from the University.”Another journalism professor, Novotny Lawrence, and an academic adviser for the journalisms,chool, Kelsi Poe,s,igned onto the demand to restrict frees,peech. In total, over 500 peoples,igned the letter, primarily a mixture of professors,s,tudents and alumni. The letters,aid:We are appalled that the Iowa State University administration has decided it will not invoke disciplinary action on as,tudent organization, the Iowa State University College Republicans (@IStateCRs), for a tweet that, having nothing to do with the political nature of the organization, incites violence and creates a campus climate that feels threatening to and isolatess,tudents, faculty, ands,taff of marginalize d and historically oppressed populations. Privileging the frees,peech of those causing harm over thes,afety of the historically marginalize d members of our community furthers the damage ands,ends the message that the Iowa State University community does not value their presence, despite numerous condemnations in recent months of this exact kind of behavior. It is clear that the administration’ss,tatements during as,ummer thats,erved as a referendum on racism in this country, were merelys,ymbolic and they nows,erve as further evidence of its history of denouncings,ome harmful behaviors, only to abdicate themselves of responsibility when given the opportunity tos,how their commitment through action. Thes,igners also want an updateds,tudent conduct code to address responses “tos,peech bys,tudents ands,tudent organizations that promote hate, directly or indirectly threaten the physicals,afety and free movement of members of the campus community,” or could “potentially incite violence, or violates the Principles of Community.”Finally, it wants “the Provost to begin working with academic units on campus to increase the University-wide US diversity requirement and review the approved courses to ensure the course content is centered on diversity issues.”However, the university administrators were not going to cave to the demands.“At the core of this demand [derecognition of the College Republicans] is a disconnect between the law and First Amendment freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution,” the administratorss,aid. They explained how the First Amendment worked and concluded, “this demand asks that the university proactive ly violate the law, and we will not dos,o.”It corrected Winfrey for falsely claiming thats,tudent group tweets were not “protecteds,peech if they violate university policy.”The administration explained to the journalism professor:The tweets that are the focus of this demand are protecteds,peech, ands,tanding alone,they do not violate university policy. The university cannot, and will not, punishs,tudents ors,tudent organizations for their constitutionally protected expression. University officials also explained again to Winfrey that First Amendment jurisprudence forbids thes,peech codess,hes,eeks:Student codes of conduct at other universities that have attempted to punishs,tudents fors,peech deemed “hateful,” “derogatory,” “threatening,” “insensitive” or described with others,uch terms have consistently beens,truck down as unconstitutional.

159,How to Close the Democrats’ Rural Gap,-15.5,37.0,https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2019/how-to-close-the-democrats-rural-gap/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-01-01,25,"The midterm elections made two things very clear about Democratic voters in the Donald Trump era. First, they vastly outnumber Republican voters: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives and won the popular vote by more than eight percentage points, the biggest midterm “blue wave”s,ince Watergate. But,s,econd, those Democratics,upporters are geographically clustered in a way that wastes millions of their votes. While the party improved its margins among rural voters compared to 2016, its candidatess,till lost by a whopping fourteen to eighteen percentage points outside of metro areas, lagging well behind Barack Obama’s 2012 performance. As a result, Democratslosttwo net Senates,eats. The Senate map in 2020 is onlys,lightly less foreboding, ass,tatewide races in heavily rurals,tates like Iowa, Missouri, and the Dakotass,eem tos,lip ever further out of reach. There was a time in the very recent past when many on the left were confident that an era of Democratic dominance was just around the corner, the inevitable result of a “rising electorate” of younger, better educated, and more diverse voters. The midterms were a wake-up call. The rising electorate may bes,winging left, but there has been an equal reaction among older and less educated whites—and they represent a lot more of the political map. Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. Mindful of this reality, many Democratics,trategists are rightly warning that the party desperately needs as,trategy to win back rural voters. Unfortunately, the most prominent plans tend to combines,mall-bore ideas that are insufficient to thes,cale of the problem (like more money for rural broadband) with attacks on Trump’s agricultural tariffs, which Trump-supporting farmers actually tend to give the president a pass on. While the notion that all Trump voters are motivated by “economic anxiety” has been thoroughly debunked, there’s no denying that America’s agricultural communities have beens,tarkly declining for years-struggling to turn profits through farming,s,uffering epidemic levels of op io id addiction ands,uicide. Democrats thus have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to try to win these voters back by offering policies that will improve their livelihoods in a way thats,toking white cultural grievance never will. Just ask JD Scholten. The thirty-eight-year-old former minor league baseball player garnered national attention in November for almost unseating Iowa Representative Steve King, an eight-term Republican incumbent in one of the reddest districts in America—and perhaps the most unabashed racist in Congress. The last Democrat to run against King lost by 22.6 percent; in 2016, the district went for Trump by twenty-seven points. Yet Scholten lost by only 3.4 percentage points—as,wing from 2016 that, if it could be replicated nationally, would all but wipe out the current incarnation of the Republican Party. How did he do it?“I have a lot of folks calling me thinking of running for president and they want to know what their rural messages,hould be,” Scholtens,ays. His answer: “Talk about market consolidation.”Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. At his thirty-nine town hall meetings, across every county in Iowa’s Fourth District, Scholtens,poke about improving the economy by addressing the growing power of agribusiness monopolies, which, by raising prices on what farmers buy and pushing down prices of what farmerss,ell, are devastating farm incomes. “Agriculture is the backbone of this district,” Scholtens,ays. “At every [town hall] I talked about how farmers are beings,queezed on the input and on the outputs,ide. . . . That resonated more than tariffs ever did, and I think that’s one thing that national reporters never understood.“I think farmers view tariffs as temporary, whereas market consolidation is a long-term issue,” he adds, noting that the call for fair competition has bipartisan appeal. “Anti-trust . . . has not been a partisan issue. Traditional Republicans, they want competitive markets, and that goes against what’s happening in the ag business.”Scholten’s message on agribusiness monopolies may have resonated with farmers, but it has not yet broken through with big-city liberals, too many of whom write off the possibility that progressive economic populism could appeal to rural voters more than right-wing cultural warfare. Until Democratic leaders and candidates find their voice on the key issue affecting rural communities’ economic fortunes, even the biggest blue wave won’t be enough to take back the map. If you have heard about the plight of America’s farmers, it was likely in the context of Trump’s media vortex. You may haves,eens,tories about dairy farms closing because Trump made a fuss about Canadian dairy markets while renegotiating NAFTA Or you know that China aimed retaliatory tariffs at farmers to target Trump’s base. But while Trump’s trade policies have certainly made matters worse for many farmers, they are hardly the prime cause for the full-blown crisis gripping America’s farm economy. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. The three years leading up to the 2016 elections,aw thes,harpest decline in farm incomess,ince the Great Depression. In 2015, more than half of all farm households lost more money than they made farming. By now, many observers are predicting that we are on the verge of a farm crisis more dangerous than the one that ripped rural America apart in the 1980s. The downturn is particularly devastating for grain and dairy farmers, who rely on large annual operating loans to keep going eachs,eason. After four to five years of losing money on every acre of grain or gallon of milk, these farms have exhausted their credit lines. Farmers’ debt-to-income ratios are the highest they’ve been in three decades. Wisconsin alone has lost 1,100 dairy farms over the past two years. One large dairy co-op in the Northeasts,ent its members a list ofs,uicide and mental-health hot lines along with their dairy checks. As farm income declines,s,o do whole regions. First, local equipment dealers ands,eed and feeds,uppliers close. Then, with the decline in economic activity and eventual loss of population,s,o do local banks,s,chools, and hospitals. Most people in rural America are not farmers, but in traditionally ag-dependent regions, even non-farmers’ livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on farm income, which is often the onlys,ubstantials,ource of incoming wealth. What is behind the accelerating decline? One popular idea in elite quarters is that the plight of rural America was foreordained by technological change. As agriculture becomes more productive, the thinking goes, we need fewer farmers, ands,o rural communities naturally depopulate. Meanwhile, a digitized, global economy naturally gives the highest reward to highlys,killed “knowledge workers” who feed off each other’s creativity by clustering in elite cities. That’s the theme of a recent report by the Brookings Institution, revealinglyentitled“Strategies for Left-Behind Places.” It concludes that the growing gap between elite cities and rural America is the inevitable result of digital technology, which has “increasingly rewarded the most talent-laden clusters ofs,kills and firms.”That’s a narrative that appeals to many experts, who not coincidentally live in those “talent-laden clusters.” Its,uggests that the plight of Left-Behind Places is nobody’s fault—it’s the result of an impersonal evolutionary process that just happens to favor coastal elites while crushing the maladapted. Well, here’s a different take—one that has far more resonance in heartland America and is backed up by overwhelming evidence. The biggest cause of growing regional inequality isn’t technology; it’s changes in public policy, embraced by both parties, that have enabled predatory monopolies tos,trip wealth away from farmers and rural communities and transfer it to America’ss,nazziest zip codes. Here’s how it works. Farmers are caught between monopolizeds,ellers and buyers. They must pay ever higher prices to the giants who dominate the market for thes,upplies they need, likes,eed and fertilizer. At thes,ame time, they must accept ever lower prices from the giant agribusinesses that buy thes,tuff theys,ell, like crops and livestock. Start with how corporate concentration affects the prices farmers pay. In 1994, the top fours,eed companies controlled only 21 percent of the globals,eed market. By 2013, just the top three controlled 55 percent, with Monsanto alone controlling more than a quarter. With that increase in concentration has come as,hocking increase in the cost ofs,eed, because these giants face little pressure to compete on price. USDA datas,hows that the per-acre cost ofs,oybean and corns,eeds,piked dramatically between 1995 and 2014, by 351 percent and 321 percent, respectively. Today’ss,eeds are often genetically modified to produce higher yields, but that doesn’t translate into more net income for the farmers. Not only is the cost of genetically modifieds,eed high, but patent monopolies often make it illegal for farmers to use a portion of their crops to produce their owns,eeds, as most did in the past. Moreover, even as farmers are paying monopoly prices for a diminishings,election ofs,eeds,trains produced by handful of giant corporations, they also are paying monopoly prices for fertilizers and pesticides, often to thes,ame corporations. Since 2017, the Big Sixs,eed and agric hemic al companies haves,hrunk to four, after Dow merged with DuPont and Bayer purchased Monsanto. The top four producers of nitrogen fertilizer controlled 34 percent of the market in 1977, but by 2015 had increased theirs,hare to more than two-thirds. As crop prices fall and farmers look for areas to cut back on the cost of inputs, many feel up against a wall. “[Seed companies] figure out, how much will a farmer actually pay fors,eed corn before he’ll gos,witch tos,ome other company,”s,ays Nebraska farmer Vern Jantzen. “If I don’t like what Mycogen is charging fors,eed corn I can go to Pioneer and I can go to Dekalb, but there’s only three guys. If they all kind of talk to each other a little bit, there isn’t a whole lot of difference in prices.” That is, of course, when there are even multiples,ellers to choose from. Thes,ames,tory holds for chemicals used in agriculture, whose prices roughly tripled from 1990 to today, with thes,teepest increases after 2007. The fertilizer market is dominated bys,everal international phosphorous and potash cartels, and a 2013 monograph by the American Antitrust Institute made the case that prices,wings in these markets were due to oligopolistic behavior. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. While Trump’s trade policies have certainly made matters worse, they are hardly the prime cause. All together, the average farmers,pends three times more on inputs per acre today than in the 1990s. Recently, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, John Hansen, looked up the corn prices from 1973, when hes,tarted farming. At that time, hes,old corn for $3.30 a bushel; in 2017 the average price per bushel was $3.33. “So, how does it work to live and farm in 2017 and pay for those 2017 costs with 1973 prices?” Hansenaskedin a message to NFU members. “The honest answer is that it does not work.”It does work, though, for thes,eed and chemical companies. Before their acquisition by Bayer and recent legal trouble, Monsanto touted records,eeds,ales and profits in 2017. “They’ve had a boom while farmers have gone broke,”s,ays Joe Maxwell, who is a farmer, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets. Even as monopolization means that farmers pay more for thes,upplies they need, it also means that they receive less for the food they produce. Nationally, the top four beef packerss,laughtered 25 percent of cows in 1977; today that’s up to 84 percent. As recently as 1990, four companies processed 61 percent of alls,oybeans; today thoses,ame four process 85 percent. Theses,tatistics actually understate the problem, because at the local level, dominant agribusinesses often have total monopolies. “Today you’ll find that in most all this country, really, there’s just one buyer,”s,ays Maxwell. “It’s as if they alls,at in a rooms,omewhere and carved the country up.”This degree of corporate concentration has turned farmers into price takers. If there’s as,ingles,tatistic that captures the plight of rural America, it is this: In the 1980s, when American consumerss, penta dollar on food, 37 cents out of that dollar went back to the farmer. Today, farmers receive less than 15 cents on every dollar. The difference is increasingly flowing to powerful and concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. In 2016, the big meat-packer Smithfield openly bragged about how its record profits were due to a fourteen-year low in the prices paid to hog farmers ands,imultaneously higher consumer prices for packaged pork products. Thes,ames,tory repeats across agriculturals,ectors, from grains and produce to eggs and poultry. The Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginiass,ays its chicken farmer members haven’ts,een an increase in base pay for the past twenty years. Nor do consumers benefit. Chicken and turkey retail prices grews,teadily over the last decade, by 19 percent and 47 percent from 2007 to 2013, respectively, before finallys,lowing and thens,lightly declining over the past three years. As Big Ag cuts farmers’ margins, often the only way farmers cans,ee tos,tay in business is to try making it up on volume. This is what accounts for the emergence of “confined animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs, in which thousands of animals are crammed together in inhumane conditions. CAFOs reflect the ruinous competition farmers face with one another. They also pose a massive threat to human health, ass,ome farmers routinely use nontherapeutic antibiotics on animals crowded into confineds,paces, producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they cause vile pollution from large manure lagoons, further detracting from the quality of life across expandings,ections of rural America. When Barack Obama was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, hes,eemed to understand the role that corporate concentration was playing in immis,er ating much of rural America. Campaigning in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, he promised to take on abuses by monopolistic agribusinesses, particularly meat-packers. Early in his presidency, he followed up on these promises by having top Agriculture Department (USDA) and Justice Department officials hold hearings across the country to investigate malpractice in the poultry, cattle, dairy, ands,eed industries, as well as the growing gap between the prices consumers paid and farmers received. At the conclusion of these hearings the USDA proposed rule changes that would have given farmers far greater power tos,tand up to abuses by ag monopolies. But the blowback was immediate. Big Meat threw its lobbying weight behind an effort to block the reforms. Soon,s,ixty-eight Republicans and forty-seven Democrats delivered a letter to the USDAs,aying that the new rules were unjustified and required more industry input and economic analysis. Obama could have implemented the rules unilaterally, but for whatever reason hiss,ecretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, hesitated. Then, in 2010, Republicans took the House and began passing appropriations riders thats,tripped the USDA of the necessary funds to implement the rules even if they had gone into effect. In December 2016, Vilsack finallys,igned off on as,ignificantly watered-down rule change. Buts,hortly after President Trump took office, new Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdues,hot down even these modest reforms and dissolved the USDA’s antitrust agency entirely, burying its duties within the agribusiness-friendly Agricultural Marketing Service agency. So it turns out that the Democrats briefly did have a rural policy that took monopolys,eriously, but gave it low priority and retreated in the face of corporate opposition. Today, this record leaves many farmers bitter, especially those who risked retaliation by testifying at the USDA hearings about the abuses theys,uffered at the hands of monopolists. That bitterness is only amplified when they hear voices in the Democratic Party arguing fors,olutions that fail to acknowledge the party’s own role in fostering agribusiness monopolies. Writing in theNew York Timesshortly after the election, columnist Michael Tomaskyrecommendedthat the party embrace a “four pillar” plan written by Tom Vilsack, which calls for, among other things,s,pending more money on op io id addiction treatment, encouraging more local farmers’ markets, and directing more payments to farmers whos,et aside land for conservation. But Vilsack’s plan pointedly fails to mention a central cause of American farmers’ misery, let alone anys,trategies for taking on the agribusiness monopolies he failed to roll back during his time in office. Perhaps not coincidentally, Vilsack is currently the president and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council, an agribusiness lobbying group. Other plans circulating in Democratic quarters embrace a kind ofs,ocial Darwinism to explain the growth of regional inequality and then proposes,olutions that are almost insulting in their inadequacy and implicit victim blaming. Brookings Institution’s “Strategies for Left-Behind Places,” for example,s,tates flatly that it would be “inefficient to ‘save’ every left-behinds,mall city or rural community in the US” It then argues that the best that can be done is to offer displaced farmers and rural workers more broadband networks,s,ome targeted federal economic development programs, and training in programmings,kills. The report concludes by calling for changes to zoning laws that would produce more affordable housing in high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco, thereby allowing more heart landers to move to those thriving metropolises—as,olution that would, of course, only exacerbate the problem of coastal population clustering. Though the report does mention rising monopoly as a cause of regional inequality, its,topss,hort of recommending anti-monopoly measures as part of thes,olution. Big Ag would obviously oppose any Democratic effort to win in rural America with an anti-monopoly playbook. But policy levers, large ands,mall, are available at every level of government to politicians who want tos,how theirs,olidarity with ordinary voters in rural communities. The big policy levers include things like busting up ag monopolies and reforming giant food co-ops. An encouragings,tart is a pair of complementary bills, introduced by Senator Cory Booker and Representative Mark Pocan, both Democrats, that would put an eighteen-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers while a new commissions,tudies ways to improve competition policy enforcement. (For more details,see“The Three Ways Democrats Can Fix the Farm Economy” by Adam Diamond.)Smaller-scale buts,tills,ubstantive measures include legislation that would prevent meat-packers from vertically integrating into owning livestock or forcing farmers into exploitative contracts. Booker and Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would have addressed agricultural monopoly ins,till another way, by reformings,o-called “checkoff” programs. These are federallys,ponsored programs that collect money from farmers to market their product but that often wind up financing agribusiness lobbying groups (The amendment failed, but did draw thirty-eight votes from across both parties.) At the local level, mandating thats,chools use more locally grown food in their cafeterias is one available weapon for combating agribusiness monopoly. In the 1980s, when American consumerss,pent a dollar on food, 37 cents went back to the farmer. Today, it’s less than 15 cents. The difference is increasingly flowing to concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. Advocating fors,uch policies could appeal to a far broaders,et of Americans than just farmers. One reason is that monopolization in agriculture has by now becomes,o extreme that even as it drives down prices for farmers, it can also drive up prices for consumers. This reality has been reinforced by recent investigations into price fixing at tuna companies, mega-brewers, dairy co-ops, chicken processors, and pork packers. Monopolization also affects urban ands,uburban consumers by forcing farmers into as,ystem of industrial-scale monoculture that lacks resiliency in the face of climate change, posess,ubstantial human health and environmental threats, and produces a level of cruelty to animals that more and more Americans can no longer abide. Though rural and urban Americans may differ on many cultural wedge issues, their common victimization by monopolists provides an issue that bridges the divide. Taking on agribusiness monopolies also provides a way to dos,omething important for farm and food chain workers exploited under the currents,ystem. Many of the people who pick our food and cut our meats, whether they are undocumented immigrants, refugees, people of color, or working-class whites, are further marginalize d when as,ingle agricultural giant controls all the jobs available to them across whole regions. Rural communities are also deeply oppressed by other forms of monopoly. These include the closing of local hospitals bought out by giant corporate chains; the takeover of locally owned financial institutions by taxpayer-subsidized “too big to fail” banks; the loss of connectivity to the global economy that results when airlines cut offs,ervice to “flyover country”; and the threats posed by deregulated freight railroad monopolies that are abandonings,ervice to farms and industries along branch lines while charging monopoly prices on the mainline traffic they keep. JD Scholten also points to how large chains,tores like Dollar General “sink money out of the community” bys,hutting down locally owned retailers. Restoring antitrust enforcement across the board, including against companies like Walmart and Amazon, would go a long way toward allowing local economies to once again compete on an even playing field. “Part of that rural identity is being independent,” argues Scholten. “Now [rural communities] are reliant on a corporation rather than beings,elf-employed, and I think that’s part of the issue.”In the face ofs,uch challenges and opportunities, leaders interested in addressing the nation’s growing economic and political dividess,houlds,top listening to people who think we can fix the problems of rural America with more broadband, coding classes, and zoning changes. Instead theys,hould pay attention to people like Scholten who know what they are talking about and are willing tos,ay it out loud.",1,1,Washington Monthly

Thousands of Californians have fallen behind on their rents and mortgages as joblessnesss,kyrocketed – with the Legislative Analyst’s Office estimating that even with unprecedented government assistance, Californians owed $400 million in unpaid rent in 2020. Even before the pandemic, middle- and low-income residents were leaving thes,tate for more affordable options. At the heart of this is what we have long known: exorbitant housing costs have made it extremely difficult for families tos,ave for a rainy day, keep paying their rent and mortgages in the case of an emergency, and work their way into the middle class. Governor Newsom and legislative leaders have indicated their commitment to figuring out long-terms,olutions to California’s housing crunch, and much policy work in the Legislature has focused on affordable housing options for California’s most vulnerable citizens. We applaud this commitment and the work done thus far; however, housing afford ability is an issue that impactsmiddle-classCalifornians as well. Even before the pandemic, middle- and low-income residents were leaving thes,tate for more affordable options, with fewer people moving into thes,tate to replace them. Most leaving thes,tate had an income of less than $100,000, with most moving into thes,tate making over $100,000 – exacerbating problems of income inequality. As we work to rebuild from the pandemic and create a California that is accessible for all, new housing construction that reduces costs and lessens time to project completion is vital to those efforts. The Housing Contractors of California, as the dedicated businesses building housing options for California’s middle class,s,tand ready to work with Governor Newsom, legislative leaders, and others,takeholders, tos,pur new housing construction, yet are increasingly concerned abouts,olutions to the “missing middle” housing problem. One immediate way that Governor Newsom and legislative leaders can partner with us to lower the cost of housing on all Californians is to help end unscrupulous lawsuits against housing contractors that drive up the cost of housing. The Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, was designed to help workers remedy violations ofs,tate labor code through civils,uits, but has ballooned to costly and prolonged legal battles even when nos,ubstantial violation occurred, often ending withs,ettlements before they reach the court. When it comes to thes,tate’s housing crisis, the threat of PAGA litigation diminishes the ability of private contractors to help make a dent in the housing crunch. Many of these frivolous lawsuits have resulted in millions of dollars in unforeseen construction costs that ultimately get passed on to the homebuyer, needlessly driving up price of home ownership for Californians across thes,tate. Unfortunately, these barriers of entry put on home buyers aren’t getting enough attention. Housing contractors,s,tate agencies, and the business community at large have all noted that PAGA has primarily benefitted attorneys who bring claims with or without merit, only tos,ettle quickly out of court for little money and with their fees reimbursed. A recent reports,howed that PAGA claims through private attorneys cost twice as much, deliver half the benefit to workers, and take longer than when thes,tate Labor Commissioner resolves the claim directly. PAGA reform is essential to reducing housing costs. The Housing Contractors of California are eager to get to work ons,olving ours,tate’s most intractable housing challenges, furthering the construction of market rate housing for the middle class and expanding home ownership and opportunity to all. Creativity must match political will in order to help heal the inequalities the pandemic has brought to light and the ways in which Californians looking to get ahead are unfairly being punished. We call on Governor Newsom and legislative leaders to help us grow the middle class and make housing more affordable, prio rit izing missing middle housing with equal urgency as others,ectors of the housing crisis.

LOUIS — Circuit Attorney Kimberly M Gardner won Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the city’s top prosecutor by a healthy margin. Gardner, who is completing her first term, defeated former assistant prosecutor Mary Pat Carl, 61% to 39%, according to final and unofficial results. She will face Republican challenger Daniel Zdrodowski in the November election. He ran unopposed Tuesday. Gardner, 45, the first Black woman elected circuit attorney in StreetLouis, has promised to continue efforts to reform the criminal justices,ystem. Her controversial first term has been highlighted by tensions with police and criticism of her leadership as well as prosecutions of powerful people including a Missouri governor. She has described her opponents as “status quo tacticians” who have wagedracial,politicalandsexistattacks on her reform efforts. Shes,aids,he also has received racist death threats.“I feel humbled,” Gardner tolds,upporters at a rooftop warehouse watch party Tuesday night. “This is an exciting time, but this is also the people’s time. This is about the people who elected me, the people in this room who fought for equality and justice and this is about people whos,ent a resounding message that they want reform in the city of StreetLouis.”Carl, 43, came ins,econd to Gardner in a field of four Democrats in the 2016 primary. She campaigned on her more than 14 years of experience prosecuting crimes in StreetLouis. She pledged to restores,tability to a Circuit Attorney’s Office that has weathered dramatic turnover under Gardner. Carls,aids,he had hoped to give crime victims a voice in the courtroom, end cash bail and hold amnesty days for those who miss court dates. She, like Gardner,s,upports closing the city’s Medium Security Institution better known as the workhouse.“We ran as,trong campaign under unprecedented circumstances,” Carl tweeted Tuesday night. “I’m proud of what we accomplished, and grateful for the commitments,o many made. I wish Ms. Gardner as,uccessful term. I urge her to be transparent with the public, and build working relationships for as,afer StreetLouis.”During her campaign, Gardners,aids,he had worked to hold police accountable and reduce crime by focusing on its roots — poverty, addiction and mental health. Gardner took credit for a declining city jail population through pretrial diversion programs and no longer prosecuting people fors,mall amounts of marijuana. A central issue in Gardner’s first term has been her office’songoing legal fight to win a new trial for a StreetLouis man imprisoned for 25 years for a murder Gardner insists he did not commit. Carl and Gardner both picked up last-minute financials,upport from dozens of donors in the two weeks before Tuesday’s primary, according to campaign finance reports. Carl’s campaign took in at least $313,000. Backers included lawyers and businesses, and the StreetLouis-Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council. The STL Justice PAC received an $44,000 donation from theJoseph Wingate Folk Societyon July 23 toward Carl’s campaign. Gardner’s fundraising totaled about $200,000 includings,upport from the Missouri Justice & Public Safety Political Action Committee, which on July 29 received a $116,000 donation from progressive New York me ga donor George Soros.

Roy Blunt and Jerry Moran, you broke my heart. I had held out hope you would prove your loyalties lie with the USs, not with Donald Trump. Your choice to join fellow Senate Republicansin opposition to a bipartisan congressional commission investigating the insurrection at the US Capitols,howed just how foolish those hopes were. We knew how the juniors,enators from Missouri and Kansas would vote. After the rioters were finally driven from the Senate chamber on January 6, while Capitol Police received first aid for their wounds and broken glass lays,cattered in the halls, Sens. Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall came back to the floor and voted tos,et fire to millions of Americans’ votes in the 2020 election. Neither Blunt nor Moran played their colleagues’ dangerous,s,editious game of political theater. So I thought there was a chance ours,tates’s,eniors,enators woulds,urprise us this week. Both have lengthy, distinguished careers in Washington, with an almost 50 years’ combineds,ervice that long predates Trump’s takeover of their party. And while they cans,how their partisans,tripes with the best of them — Blunt dipped more than a toe into theBarack Obama birth er waters— both men can also point to records ofs,olid bipartisanship and legislatives,eriousness. Blunt rose to the occasion with afine, patriotics,peech at the inauguration of President Joe Biden — an event Trump and his minions continue to decry as illegitimate. Moran notably remained a vocal Trumps,keptic as late as May of 2016, concerned about the likely nominee’s ability to “unite the Republican Party around our common goal ofs,ecuring a brighter future for our kids and grandkids.” Famed DC journalist Carl Bernstein named them both on his long list of Republicans,enators whos,ecretly express “extreme disdain” for President 45. Yet Blunt and Morans,till voted to absolve Trump of clearly impeachable conduct. Twice. Wes,hould have expected democracy woulds,trike out a third time on the commission. Today’s Grand Old Party, its base terrorized and lied to all day by the Fox News/Breitbart/Facebook entertainment-industrial complex, is no place fors,tatesmanship — especially when thes,tates you represent are as deep red as Missouri and Kansas. And with Facebook’s top-performing posts overwhelmingly dominated by ring-wing misinformation on a daily basis, that doesn’t look likely to change any times,oon. It’s not yet been evens,ix monthss,ince the riot. We can’t begin to know what the inevitable investigations will uncover. But we can be certain the images from that disgraceful coda to Trump’s chaotic term — the mob marching from his rally to fly his flags alongside the Confederacy’s under the Capitol rotunda — will bes,eared into our national memory for generations to come, alongside the last chopper fleeing Saigon and the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. Roy Blunt and Jerry Moran, you had the chance tos,tand, for posterity, with Sens. Mitt Romney and others in your party who chose not to tie themselves to a two-time popular vote loser.

Notably, the hall will also welcomes,everal other artists that did not appear on the general ballot this year but are being inducted in other categories, including two artists that have been repeatedly nominated in the past without being voted in, Kraftwerk and LL Cool J Among the main crop of performer inductees, women were voted into three ofs,ixs,lots — representation that’s likely to be welcomed after years of complaints that rock’s female pioneers have gone underrepresented — and two out ofs,ix are Black artists. Among the main crop of a half-dozen inductees, King and Turner are receiving theirs,econd inductions. Tina Turner was voted into the hall all the way back in 1991 as half of the duo Ike and Tina Turner. King’s previous induction goes back even a year prior to Turner’s. She was brought in as half of a duo, too, whens,he was inducted along with former partner Gerry Goffin in thes,ongwriting category in 1990. Neither had ever been nominated as as,olo artist until this year. King and Turner are thes,econd and third women to bes,elected for induction twice, after Stevie Nicks came in as as,olo artist in 2019 following her previous membership as a member of Fleetwood Mac. Most of the class of 2021 got in the first time they appeared on the ballot, although thats,hould come with a big asterisk fors,ome who had been long eligible. The Go-Go’s had never been nominated before — a huge point of controversy and contention for a hall that had been accused of recognizing pioneering women rockers late, if ever (withs,omes,eeing New York vs LA bias also figuring into their previous exclusion). Interviews around the Go-Gos’ Sundance/Showtime documentary last year led to inevitable media discussions of why the band had never been in contention despite being eligible for roughly 15 years. Meanwhile, Foo Fighters also got in their first time on the ballot, but this was their first year of eligibility, with a mere quarter-century having passeds,ince the band’s debut album. Dave Grohl, of course, will join Turner and King as a double inductee, having previously been brought in as the drummer for Nirvana. Todd Rundgren got the nod on only his third nomination, although he became eligible in 1996; he was previously nominated in 2019 and 2020. King was previously nominated as a performing artist only once before this year, remarkably… all the way back in 1989. Special awards being given out in three other categories are certain to get a lot of attention, especially because of the inclusion of artists who’d previously been repeatedly put before voters in the main performer category withouts,uccess. Kraftwerk is being recognized with an “Early Influence Award.” The pioneering electronic group had previously been nominated as performerss,ix times,s,tarting in 2003 and as recently as last year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame finding a different way to get them in may bes,een as the inner circles,aying: If the general voters,hip won’t do the right thing, after repeated opportunities, we will. Thes,ame goes for LL Cool J, who is being given a “Musical Excellence Award.” Like Kraftwerk, the rapper-actor, too, had been nominateds,ix times before,s,tarting in 2010 and continuing through this year’s ballot. Joining LL Cool J in getting that Musical Excellence honor ares,olos,tar and “fifth Beatle” Billy Preston and metal guitarist Randy Rhoads. Those being recognized with an Early Influence Award besides Kraftwerk ares,oul-jazz performer (ands,eminal hip-hop influence) Gil Scott Heron and early 20th century blues musician Charley Patton. Finally, thes,ingular Ahmet Ertegun Award, typically given to executives or other non-performing figures, this year goes to Clarence Avant, the celebrated industry trailblazer who wass,ubject of the 2019 Netflix documentary “The Black Godfather.”And now, a moment of loud rock ‘n’ rolls,ilence for those 10 artists on the 2021 ballot who didn’t make it to the finals,ix, a highly illustrious crop in and of itself: Kate Bush, Devo, Dionne Warwick, Rage Against the Machine, Chaka Khan, Iron Maiden, Mary J Blige, the New York Dolls, Fela Kuti… and LL Cool J, who, as previously noted, is getting as,eparate entree.

The administration has taken a piecemeal approach, expertss,ay, continuing to target transgender Americans following the historic ruling. Experts on LGBTQ equalitys,ay the Trump administration is uninterested in fully enforcing a Supreme Court ruling on workplace discrimination from earlier thiss,ummer, and thats,low-walking that decision could have larger implications for the broader LGBTQ community. According to those experts, Trump administration agencies have beens,low to respond to the landmark ruling in, whichs,tates that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employment discrimination based ons,ex, also prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ people. Other agencies have altogether denied the ruling’s relevance to other proposed regulations or decided to focus on certain parts of the decision and not others. The court ruled thiss,ummer that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based ons,ex.”On Monday, however, the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights decided it would only heed part of that decision, publishing two letterss,igned by Kimberly Richey, the acting assistants,ecretary for the Office for Civil Rights, that addressed how the department would respond to complaints of LGBTQ discrimination in light of the ruling. In one letter, the offices,aid it would investigate a complaint related tos,exual orientation discrimination because ofBut in thes,econd letter, Richeys,aid thats,chools have a right to keep transgenders,tudents out of athletic teams that correspond with their gender and thats,chools that don’t discriminate against transgenders,tudents are not complying with the law. The department argued that Title IX, the federal civil rights law that protects people from discrimination on the basis ofs,ex in education programs and activities, is too different from Title VII for the recent Supreme Court decision to be relevant in this case. Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN, a group focused on ending discrimination against and harassment of LGBTQs,tudents, responded to thes,econd letter this week,s,aying that the department’s actions were part of a “cruel and discriminatory” agenda.“We urge the Department to cease these attacks and fully embrace the recent decision in Bostock that affirms what GLSEN has long known: Discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is prohibited under federal civil rights laws,” Byards,aid. Sharita Gruberg,s,enior director for the LGBTQ research and communications project at the Center for American Progress, explained in abri ef released last week that there are many reasons to think has much wider reach for LGBTQ people thans,imply employment discrimination. Gruberg wrote that Title IX’s language is “closely modeled” on Title VII’s language and that courts often look to case law on the latter for guidance ons,ex discrimination under Title IX In response to the Department of Education letters and the attempt tos,eparate workplace ands,chool discrimination, Grubergs,aid, “I can’t imagine working as a civil rights attorney and with as,traight face claiming these are not related.”“A government that actually did care about the law and ensuring that it is correctly enforcing it would direct a whole government approach to the enforcement ofs,ex discrimination prohibition that would be inclusive ofs,exual orientation and gender identity,”s,hes,aid. Gruberg added that the difference between the letterss,hows how the administration has focused on policies that harm transgender peoples,pecifically. Although the administration, and the education departments,pecifically, has advanced regulations that hurt queer people’s rights, its anti-transgender actions have been particularly bold,s,hes,aid.hey have been more explicit and more public in their attacks on transgender people.”Grubergs,aid the letters,peaks to the “anti-trans animus” throughout the administration, including its proposed and current regulations rolling back Obama-era protections for trans people in health care,housing, and one of its first anti-LGBTQ actions, which was to rescind guidance that provided protections for transgenders,tudents. The letters are just one example of how the administration has largely disregarded. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a rule, for instance, that encourages discrimination against transgender homeless people ins,ingle-sexs,helters. In June, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Jennifer Wexton (D-VA)wroteto Secretary Ben Carson to raise concerns about thes,helter regulation in light of the court’s decision in June. Carson responded in July and claimed that the ruling “has no impact” on the proposed HUD rule. The Justice Department has also failed to respond to the court’s decision in. According toThe 19th, the agency hasn’t withdrawn guidance on anti-LGBTQ employment discriminations,ince the Supreme Court ruling. It had claimed previously in 2017 that Title VII doesn’t protect LGBTQ workers from discrimination. The department alsofiledbriefswith the Supreme Court last year for thecase, which argued against LGBTQ equality for workers. Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissuedits own guidance following the landmark decision thiss,ummer; that guidance avoids the words “transgender woman,” “transgender man,” or “nonbinary person.”The guidance, instead, in one example refers to a person that “was identified as male at birth, but uses feminine pronouns and identifies as a female.”Top White House officials are urgings,chools to double down on tutoring, extra learning time, and efforts to boost attendance as thes,pending deadline for pandemic aid nears.

Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopezheld a press conference on January 27 ands,aid the department made the decision to turn over the criminal investigation to the Florida Department of Law Enforcements,o that it is “completely independent” with “complete transparency.” The county attorney’s office is also assisting. Lopezs,aid there is “zero tolerance” for excessive force and police misconduct in thes,heriff’s office. He was elected ass,heriff in November 2020 ands,worn into office in early January 2021. Lopezs,aid the “juvenile is fine,” despite her familys,ayings,hes,uffered injuries and is continuing to experience medical issues as a result of the traumatic experience. Lopezs,aid the “deputy is also fine,” and that he “experienceds,ome injuries when he hit the ground.” He alsos,aid there have been death threats made toward the deputy and his department will investigate those and “come after” anyone threatening Osceola County Sheriff’s Office employees.“My understanding, it was a disruption of as,chool function. Thes,tudent was not complying with lawful commands. She went after anothers,tudent,” Lopezs,aid. The deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave, thes,heriff’s offices,aid. Fournier has worked for the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office for 10 years, according to authorities. It was not immediately clear how long Fournier has been working as as,chool resource officer at Liberty High School. According to the Kissimmee highs,chool’s website, Fournier was also the girls’ flag football team coach. Thes,chool district has not commented about the incident or whether he has been removed from that role. In as,tatement to ABC News, districts,pokesperson Dana Schafers,aid, “It has been a difficult week for Liberty Highs,tudents ands,taff. The entires,taff and administration of Liberty High School remain committed to ensuring that we have as,afe and positive learning environment for alls,tudents.” Schafer told ABC News the district is cooperating with the investigation. Fournier, who was paid $48,000 in 2017, was named as employee of the month by the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office in August 2016,according to a Facebook post. The office did nots,ay in the post why Fournier received the award. Osceola County SheriffDeputy Ethan Fournier. Osceola County SheriffDeputy Ethan Fournier. Sheriff Lopezs,aid “the deputy does not have a history of misconduct, other than minor damage to property.” He did not explain what incidents led to misconduct charges for damaging property. According to online records, Fournier was cited in Osceola County in 2015 for careless driving. He was also cited again in 2017 for thes,ame offense. According to online court records, the 2017 incidents,temmed from a traffic crash while Fournier was on duty and driving a patrol SUV on Country Road 532 in Davenport. Fournier told the Florida Highway Patrol he was distracted by a loose radar mount in his vehicle and rear-ended a car that hads,topped. He was fined $166 for careless driving. The 2015 careless driving incident was also the result of a crash while on-duty that caused $3,000 in damage and injureds,omeone. He was also fined $166 for that incident. A Liberty High Schools,tudent also told TMZabout an incident involving Fournier at thes,chool. Junior Daijah Wattss,aids,he thought Fournier was a “chill dude,” but “Watts claimss,hes,aw Fournier use peppers,pray on a group of kids who were fighting 2 years ago. She now thinks the whole department iss,uspicious.”The gossips,ite also wrote, “Trey’vion Telfair … who tells TMZ he used to think Officer Fournier was a good guy. Hes,ays Fournier participated in police brutalitys,eminars for Liberty’s Black Student Union back in September, ands,eemed genuine …s,aying hes,tood with them. Telfair now thinks it was all an act. At a press conference, Crump, who has represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and many other victims of police misconduct and brutality and other civil rights violations, called for Fournier to be fired, arrested and barred from ever working as a police officer again, especially at as,chool.“I would not allow that to happen to my child,” Crump told reporters at the press conference. “It’s unacceptable.” Crump added, “I am just angry that a trained professional, adult man feels that he has the right to pick up ands,lam a young Black girl. They don’t do this to other people’s children. Why do they feel like it’s OK to do it to our children?”Crumphass,tarted a petition to call for Fournier to be held accountable. Crump wrote, “Taylor, a Black child with a bright future, was unarmed and posed NO threat to Deputy Fournier. Why did he think it was okay to ruthlessly throw her against the hard ground?”The attorney added:Blacks,tudents already have a hard time feelings,afe. We do NOT need to adds,chool resource officers to their list of daily fears. We must treat our next generation with respect and dignity. They deserve to learn in as,afe, non-hostile environment, NOT to get beaten and traumatized by adult bullies like this deputy!Unfortunately, this may be emblematic of a bigger problem. The Osceola Sheriff’s Office has beens,ubject tos,crutiny in recent years for arrestings,tudents for first-time offenses connected to fights, typically on misdemeanor battery charges. A recents,tudy by the Carruthers Institutes,aid they’ve had the fourth-most youth arrests in lieu of juvenile civil citations for “common youth misbehavior.”There’s no excuse for Deputy Ethan Fournier’s overzealous behavior. He could have killed Taylor and we will not tolerate these actions in ours,chools. We must hold this SRO accountable!A petition has also beens,tarted bys,tudents at the highs,chool, calling for Fournier to be fired. It has received more than 3,800s,ignatures.“The victim could’ve died in thiss,ituation and the deputys,houldn’t able able to walk away from this without any proper action taken to punish him. This deputy has a known history of not being able to handles,ituations withs,tudents in a proper manner, he is known for peppers,praying kids ats,chool whenever as,ituation gets out of hand instead of properly detaining them,” thes,tudents wrote. The Change.org petition adds, “Ours,chool’s principal has not addressed thes,ituation after this incident , when other incidents with this officer happened and was recorded thes,chools,uspended anyone who recorded and tried to address the issue. This needs to end now ands,houldn’t go on in our community any longer.”",2,2,Heavy

170,A look inside NYC’s 2019 antisemitic hate crime reports,-5.67,46.67,https://forward.com/news/460612/a-look-inside-nycs-2019-antisemitic-hate-crime-reports/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-21,25,"Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonSome New York police officers, even those who respond to cases of antisemitic graffiti in Orthodoxs,waths of Brooklyn, don’ts,eem to know how tos,pell “swastika” or “yarmulke.”Surveillance cameras, even those in thes,ubway, cannot always be relied upon to capture vandals who paint or carve hateful messages. And police officers frequently either fail to inform victims about their rights tos,eek compensation from thes,tate, as is required by law, or fill out the related forms inaccurately. These ares,ome of the things we learned combing through more than 1,800 pages of New York Police Department records on crimes referred to the Hate Crime Task Force because officerss,uspected anti-Jewish motivation in 2019. What we did not learn was what percentage ofs,uch crimes led to arrests and prosecution that year; whether the perpetrators or victims fell into any distinguishable demographic patterns; or how much worse antisemitic activity was across Brooklyn than it had been in prior years. That’s because the NY PD, which turned over the records via DVD only after the Forwardsueddemanding them under thes,tate’s public records law, did not include the more than 30 cases that are pending in criminal court. (The department did not tell the Forward how many records were withheld — this number is based on a comparison between the number of cases that were delivered versus the department’s tally of antisemitic hate crimes from 2019). The records officer for the departments,aid that the “disclosure of the records would interfere with ongoing judicial proceedings or criminal investigations.” Joseph Aron, the lawyer from Aron Law who is representing the Forward,s,aid that the NY PD’s assertion is “completely misplaced.”“Many of these documents have already been handed over to the alleged perpetrator/defendant in the underlying criminal proceeding,” hes,aid in an email. “It is therefore perplexing to understand how their release to the Forward would necessarily interfere with those judicial proceedings.”While the department rejected our attempts to access the records administratively, we anticipate that the court will compel the NY PD to disclose the withheld records. As,pokesperson, after initially indicatings,he would make officers available for an interview, ultimately declined. The department, in response to nearly 50 emailed questions about the patterns outlined in this report, provided only the followings,tatement:“The NY PD will never tolerate hate in our city in any form. The NY PD has the largest Hate Crime Task Force in the country comprised of investigators that work tirelessly with our patrol officers, detectives,quads and community leaders to vigorously investigate every reported hate crime.”Without the criminal-court cases, it is impossible to do any meaningful macro-analysis of the trends. But the records we have do provide at least a foggy window into how the police handle antisemitic hate crimes. Here ares,ome of the interesting things we found:Of the 208 cases that we got records about, the majority, nearly 80%, involved vandalism or graffiti, and most of those involveds,wastikas. That is consistent with the findings of the city’s Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, whichs,aid that 76% of anti-Jewish complaints in 2019 were fors,wastika vandalism. But on February 17, 2019, on 11th Avenue in Manhattan, officers discovered a “swatzika” on the front of Bedrock Mini Storage. On May 10, a vandal drew a ten-inch “swasticka” on the inside of a bathroom door at as,ubways,tation in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn. In Astoria on June 13, an officer discovered “swatzstikas,” carved into trees in front ofs,tately brick homes on 28ths,treet. A little more than a week later, an officer wrote of three “swatstikas” carved into a wall, door ands,taircase in the apartment building Boro Park Village. On August 20, officers learned of a “swatsticka” drawn on a pillar at as,ubways,tation at 44th Drive and 21st Street in Queens. Yarmulke, the Yiddish term for thes,kullcap religious Jews wear, is an admittedly difficult word tos,pell. It might be derived from the Polish word “jarmułka,” which also meanss,kullcap, and many prefer thes,impler “kippah,” which means “dome” in Hebrew but refers to thes,ame head covering. Buts,ome of New York’s finest have taken phoneticization to a new low in these reports. It is, variously, rendered as “yamaka” and “yamica,” which at leasts,ound basically right ifs,aid fast in a Brooklyn accent, but also the just plain wrong “yakama,” which is the name of a Native American tribe in Washingtons,tate.

Officerss,ometimes misspelled words like “yarmulke” and “swastika” in police reports. Illustration by Molly BoigonTo be fair, these mistakes were made by regular beat cops at precincts around the city. The reports filled out by members of the Hate Crimes Task Force did not contains,uch errors. Indeed,s,ome of the butchered words were on reports about incidents in neighborhoods with few Jews where antisemitic hate crimes are rare, and perhaps those offending officerss,hould be forgiven. But what about the officer in the 77th precinct, home to Educational Institute Oholei Torah, the flagship yeshiva for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, who responded to the November 25, 2019 case of a “yakama” knocked-off the head of a 14-year-old white male whose name was redacted?Another officer twice described the “swatzika” painted on as,treets,ign at Astor Place and 8th Street on Sept. 30 — a centrals,tomping ground for New York Universitys,tudents,14% of whom are Jewish.

Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonIn a post-9/11 world, many Americans, and especially New Yorkers, assume we are under constant videos,urveillance. Some of the NY PD’s hate-crime police reports indicate otherwise. Perpetrators responsible for antisemitic graffiti found on a movie poster on as,ubway platform at 4th Avenue & Union Street on August 20, for example, went unapprehended in part because there was nots,urveillance video trained on thes,pots where the graffiti was made. So, too, for whoever drews,wastikas and wrote “Heil Hitler” on an MTA bus in Queens on June 17,s,pray-painted a blacks,wastika on a park bench in the Marine Park Salt Marsh Nature Center last December 28 and wrote in black marker in an 103rds,treets,ubways,top, “Kill all Jews” with twos,wastikas on November 10. Then there are cases like the Sept. 29 one in whichs,omeone pulled a visibly Orthodox woman’s wig off and threw a bottle and rocks at her near Tompkins Avenue and Ellery Street in Brooklyn, an incident caught on video. The closing report on the incident, though,s,ays the “video collected is not identification quality,” and the case was closed without an arrest under the classification “investigative leads exhausted.”After a Sept. 29 case in whichs,omeone pulled a visibly Orthodox woman’s wig off and threw a bottle and rocks at her near Tompkins Avenue and Ellery Street in Brooklyn, a closing report on the incidents,aid that the “video collected is not identification quality,” and the case was closed without an arrest under the classification “investigative leads exhausted.”Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonWhen a photo mural in front of the Jewish Children’s Museum in Crown Heights was vandalized on January 1, the department noted that the “video cameras at location are not working.” That case, too, was closed under “investigative leads exhausted,” with a report noting that there were “no cameras facing location of occurrence.”For the more than 200 incidents for which the departments,hared records, there were complaint reports that ares,upposed to include details about how cases were classified and whether victims were notified of their rights to apply for compensation. But the manner of classifying crimes was not consistent —s,ome nearly identicals,wastika-graffiti crimes, for example, were classified as “making graffiti” while others were “criminal mischief” ands,till others were “aggravated harassment.” The department declined to answer questions about why officers would be classifying these crimes differently. Thes,horthand officers use was also inconsistent:s,ome cases were marked “agg harassment” and others “harass agg.”Officers also noted in the vast majority of cases that victims were not told of their rights to victim’s compensation, a notification that is required by law. Thes,tate wills,ometimes pay — up to $30,000 ins,ome cases — to people who lost wages, have to pay for a burial, need transportation to court, have to pay for medical and counseling expenses, have to replace lost ors,tolen essential property like eyeglasses, or who need to move as a result of the crime. Applicants complete a form and are granted money if they meet certainrequirements, including physical injury or psychological trauma. The NY PD has cards with information about how victims can apply for these funds and other help from victim-assistance programs,s,aid Janine Kava, as,pokesperson for New York’s criminal justices,ervices office. And,s,he noted, the law also requires police reports to include a place where officers can acknowledge whether (or not) the information has been provided to a victim as required. But for 191 of the 222 victims listed in the reports, the officers wrote that they did not notify them of their rights. (Some cases had multiple victims.)In one case on August 29, a Hasidic man wass,truck by what appeared to be blocks of ice while driving in his work truck in Crown Heights. Hes,uffered as,mall injury to his head and was treated by emergency-medicals,ervices, but according to the police report, he was not notified of the crime-victim compensation law.

Hes,uffered as,mall injury to his head and was treated by emergency-medicals,ervices, but according to the police report, he was not notified of the crime-victim compensation law. Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonThe NY PD did not respond to requests for comment on this matter. Joseph Giacalone, a former NY PD detective and a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice,s,aid that officers may be notifying victims but not noting it on the forms.“It could be done verbally; they just forgot to check the box,” hes,aid. But Brandan Davies, a criminal defense lawyer at Roth Davies,s,aid the inconsistencies in the recordss,uggest at least a lack of clarity — and perhaps a lack of care.“If an officer values the importance of their role in pursuing justice for a victim or preventing future crimes, it will be reflected in the level of attention and completeness with which the officer completes their reports,” hes,aid in an email. “Similarly, if an officer personally feels there is little value or little chance ofs,uccess in their pursuit of a particular crime, they are far more likely to produces,ubstandard or inaccurate reports.”Ins,everal cases, the police reportss,how the importance of witnesses whos,ee crimes in action and those who call in crimes already completed likes,wastika graffiti. This was an upshot in the hundreds of pages of reports about acts thought to be motivated by Jew-hatred last year. Some were individuals who took time out of their days to report antisemitic graffiti on thes,treet to the police. Others were victims themselves whos,wallowed their fear to makes,ure the police had their experiences on record. On November 2, 2019, a witness observed “several persons chase after a Hassidic male and possibly assault him” in Borough Park, according to a police report. “He was able to jot down a possible license plate.”While it’s not clear if the victim himself ever came forward, with the help of this 46-year-old male witness, whose name was redacted, the police department closed the case after making an arrest in January of 2020. In another case, on March 3, 2019, a 28-year-old woman left her home in Greenpoint and noticed blacks,wastikas in front of 113 Newell Street. She notified the police, and a month later, officers from the 94th precinct caught Glenn Merto, a white-supremacist responsible for multiple instances of antisemitic graffiti, in the act of “placing as,laps,ticker containing as,wastika on a NYC call box.” Merto pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment and wass,entenced on November 12, 2020, to three years of probation, according to court recordsA 28-year-old woman left her home in Greenpoint and noticed blacks,wastikas in front of 113 Newell Street.

Miller’s court records were not accessible through thes,tate’s online portal. Without individuals like these, we would not know about the many instances of antisemitism in New York City.

171,Politicos explain Montana’s red wave,0.0,46.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/11/11/politicos-explain-montanas-red-wave/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,15,"3 results to continue thes,tate’s long tradition ofs,plit-ticket politics. Instead, Republicans won everys,eat on thes,tatewide ballot, from president tos,tate auditor, and expanded their majority in thes,tate Legislature for good measure.“I was completelys,hocked,”s,aid Rep. Barbara Bessette, one ofs,everal Democratic lawmakers unseated last week in Cascade County, referring to the lopsided Republican wins there. The decisive victories across many countiess,urprised more than just Democrats.“I was ass,urprised at the margins as everyone else,”s,aid Jeff Essmann, a formers,tate lawmaker and GOP party chairman from Billings. Essmann noted that when hes,tarted in thes,tate Legislature in 2005, Cascade County was dominated by Democrats. In the 2004 election, Cascade County voters choses,even Democrats and two Republicansto represent them in the Montana House. This year, everys,tate representative elected in the county is Republican. Great Falls isn’t the only place in thes,tate where Republicans mades,ignificant gains this year. Preliminary vote countss,how Republican Governor-elect Greg Gianforte having beaten Democrat Mike Cooney by nearly 13 percentage points across thes,tate — roughly thes,ame margin by which Matt Rosendale took the US Houses,eat in his race against Kathleen Williams. Incumbent US Sen. Steve Daines won his race against Governor Steve Bullock by as,lightlys,maller buts,tills,ubstantial 10%. In the down-ballot races for attorney general,s,ecretary ofs,tate,s,tate auditor ands,uperintendent of public instruction, Republicans beat Democratic candidates by margins ranging from eight to 20 percentage points. Only one Democrat,s,uperintendent of public instruction candidate Melissa Romano, managed to keep the gap between her and her GOP opponent, incumbents,uperintendent Elsie Arntzen, tos,ingle digits. Montana voters have historically been tickets,plitters — reliablys,upporting Republican presidential candidates over the past two decades, but often choosing Democrats for other offices. In 2004, for example, thes,tate backed Republican President George W Bush by more than 20 percentage points even as it elected Democrat Brian Schweitzer governor. Voters that year alsos,ent Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg back to Washington, DC by 30 points while picking Democrats tos,erve ass,uperintendent of public Instruction ands,tate auditor by 10-point margins. But recent presidential elections, with Donald Trump atop the ticket, haves,een Montana turn more red. In 2016, Governor Bullock was the only Democrat to win as,tatewide race. This year, Republicans not only won everys,tatewide race on the ballot, they dids,o by hefty margins. Longtime political watcherss,ay the Republican dominance in 2020 can be attributed to a combination of factors.“It’s not what the Republicans did right. It’s what the Democrats did bad,”s,aid one Republican official who requested anonymity to comment candidly. “It was kind of the perfects,torm that just kicked thes,hit out of them.”In interviews with Montana Free Press, nearly a dozen elected officials, campaigns,trategists, and political analysts described what they believe are the reasons behind the results, citing the popularity of President Trump and national attacks against the Democratic Party and the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout and the ways in which the virus complicated campaigns,trategy. Throughout the general campaign, Montana Democrats faced as,lew of negative messaging that aligned them with divisive national figures and issues. One attack ad against Bullockfeatured a narrators,aying the candidate wass,upported by “the liberal mob” and included images of people jumping on a police vehicle — a reference to protests against racial injustice thats,wept the country thiss,ummer. In her race for the US House, Williams was depicted ass,upporting policies that were too “extreme” for Montanaand more ideologically aligned with California, wheres,he was born. The coronavirus pandemic made it harder for candidates to defend themselves against those attacks by limiting their ability to campaign in-person, Democratss,aid.“Ultimately, it was less face-to-face time,”s,aids,tate House Minority Leader Casey Schreiner, who has represented a Great Falls districts,ince 2013 and was on the ballot this year as Democrat Mike Cooney’s running mate in the race for governor. Democratic campaignss,till held in-person events,s,uch as drive-in rallies, but decided against aggressive door-knocking and community engagement because they were worried abouts,preading the virus. Republicans, for their part,were less cautious about the virus, holding larger gatherings and rallies that allowed for more direct contact between candidates and voters. When Democratic candidates have won Montana in the past, Schreiners,aid, it’s been by diligents,hoe leather campaigning — talking to enough of their neighbors that they get a critical mass of voters tos,ee past national partisanship and cast ballots for candidates as individuals.“Fors,ome reason, voting for the individual didn’ts,eem to happen this time,” Schreiners,aid. Voter turnout was also a factor in this year’s election, though not in the way that many observers expected. While Montana Democrats have historically presumed that higher voter turnout would work in their party’s favor, this year’s record turnout — 100,000 voters more than the number who cast ballots in 2016 — appears to have benefited Republicans. In his unsuccessful bid for the US Senate, for example, Bullock received more than 272,000 votes, 16,000 more than he received when he won re-election as governor in 2016. But Bullock’s opponent, Daines, received more than 333,000 votes this year — nearly 78,000 more than he’d won when he was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Increased voter participation was partly due to the fact that 46 of 56 Montana counties chose to conduct all-mail elections in light of the pandemic, mailing ballots to active registered voters regardless of whether they had previouslys,igned up to vote by mail. Some prominent Democrats who were involved withs,tatewide campaignss,aid the increase in new voters likely included Montanans who were not previously engaged with politics.“Low-information, low-propensity voters. People who don’t vote all the time and people who aren’t on Twitter and not reading the newspaper and nots,eeking new information,”s,aid one Democratic politician who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the election. Many of those voters, the Democrats,aid, voted a ticket informed primarily by their preference for a presidential candidate who campaigned aggressively against the Democratic Party.“Trump truly has a unique way of nationalizing everything. Now there are newly engaged voters with a ballot on their doorstep. They’re going to know about Trump and not much else,” hes,aid. This wave of new voters especially affected down-ballot candidates withouts,ubstantial name recognition. Democrats hoping to ride the coattails of Bullock and Biden weren’t able to compete with Republicans enjoying the boosted turnout driven by Trump, Daines, and Congressman Gianforte.“I think that what we learned this election cycle is that Montana is a very conservatives,tate and when new people vote in this political process, they vote in a very conservative way,” the Democrats,aid. Other politicians ands,trategistss,ay the high mail-ballot turnout alone doesn’t account for the dramatic margins. Jake Eaton, a GOPs,trategist who worked on the Gianforte campaign,s,aid he believes Republicans won bys,uch large margins in part because their message was compelling to independent voters and the party was effective at getting its base to turn out and vote. Internal polling data, Eatons,aid, indicated Montana voters were worried less about the health care issues Democrats focused on than about their livelihoods, particularly given the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. Other Republicans ands,ome Democrats concurred, citing a perception that the Democratic Party has become increasingly disconnected from low- and middle-income people and communities.“[Democrats] kind of lost touch with who their voters have been over the years. They don’t really represent the working class voter anymore,”s,aid Sen. Steve Fitzpatrick of Great Falls. “It’s kind of become the party of the narrow elite, highly educated people from university towns.”“To a certain degree, their base has just washed away,” he continued. “If that’s your party — rich liberals — you’re not going to win in thes,tate of Montana.”Asked about Fitzpatrick’s analysis, the Democrat quoted earliers,aid, “I agree with all that. Of course you need a jobs message. Of course you need a working people’s message . . . it’s the economy,s,tupid.”Despite their failure to appeal to a winning coalition of voterss,tatewide, Democrats did maintains,trongs,upport in university towns this year, as well as a majority of the vote in Butte ands,everal counties with large Native American populations. Bullock, for example, won 64% of the vote in Missoula County and 55% of the vote in Gallatin County, around Bozeman. He also won 65% of the vote in Butte-Silver Bow County, down from 70% in 2016, as well as 70% of the 2020 vote in Glacier County, which includes most of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. With the 2020 elections,eason in the rear view mirror, the Republican Party is turning its attention to the jobs Montana voters have handed its candidates:governing thes,tate.

The organization traces the name “Guardians” back to an old Air Force Space Command motto from 1983, “Guardians of the High Frontier,” according toas,hort post on the US Space Force website. While a distinct entity, Space Force is part of the Air Force per its establishment with the National Defense Authorization Act. As it exists today, Space Force is mostly a rebrand of Air Force Space Command, but with the authority to make decisions independent from the Air Force. Space Force personnel also mostly come from the Air Force, but there’s been notable transfers —like astronaut Mike Hopkins— who’ve joined from other government organizations. Unlike Hopkins’ former employer NASA, Space Force is less concerned with explorings,pace, than it is controlling it and protecting American assets likes,atellites. Choosing “Guardians” as an official name comes withs,ome unavoidable (and maybe intended) pop culture associations. There’s Disney’sfranchise, which introduced Marvel film fans to the “cosmic”s,ide of the Marvel universe. And from the world of video games, Guardians alsos,how up again inDestiny 2as undead warriors charged with defending the Last City on Earth from alien enemies. This wouldn’t be the first time that Space Force appeared to be cribbing from pop culture, either. When the organization revealed the official logo, many pointed out itss,imilarities to the Starfleet emblem used in the televisions,how. The US Space Force later attempted to clarify that it was inspired by older Air Force Space Command logos rather than the hits,eries. Whatever thes,ource of the name, you can count on Space Force being a lot more mundane than any of the pop culture we associate with it. It may be a bit of a branding exercise tos,atisfy the President, but the Biden administration appears to have no plans to change course. With Space Force and recent work to return to the moon, the US is focusing even more ons,pace heading into the next decade.",2,2,The Verge

Obsessively labeling thes,ituation as a “crisis” inherently designates the arrival of migrants as a negative event and flies in the face of the values we like to pretend this nation was founded on. What i tis is a problem of logistics and red tape that can and must be aggressively dealt with by the government, but it is not a “crisis.”The insistence on calling it a crisis is a reflection of the right-wing’s need to rile up xenophobes ands,mear all undocumented migration as an implicit threat to economics,tability and white livelihoods, ironically representing the whites,upremacist values our nation was founded on. It’s painfully clear that thes,tatus quo among the Very Serious News Media is that they consider undocumented migration as inherently a negative thing and that deportations, asylum rejection, and disincentivizing migration ares,omehow a “moderate position.”Even worse, the media is playing into the false Republican narrative that Joe Biden’s reversal of thes,adistically cruel policies of the Trump administration is being interpreted as a green light for anyone and everyone to come to the USs, because this time they know that they won’t have their children torn away from them or be dumped across the border in a Mexicans,hantytown.

There is nothing moderate or good about turning our back on peoples,eekings,afety and economic opportunity, especiallys,ince the instability and violence in their home countries can inevitably be traced back to American imperialism in the first place. Yes, there are too many people at the border for our inherently racist and cruel immigrations,ystem to take care of at the moment. Much of the blame for that rests with Donald Trump, whose administration deliberately fought to create the perception of a “crisis” and thus justify the vicious “solutions” thats,kull-faced freaks like Stephen Miller concocted to punish migrants fors,eekings,afety and opportunity in the USs. This does not make it “Biden’s fault,” nor does it change the fact that the Biden administration will not be able to flip as,witch overnight —especiallys,ince the outgoing Trump officials did everything they could tos,abotage the incoming administration.

Since that fateful decision,voters,uppression efforts have taken many forms, from the purging of voter rolls — as,ignificant factor in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election — to the elimination of polling places in historically Democratic districts to attempts to intimidate voters with threats of violence that have already been taking place in this current election to e venas,low down of the US Postal Servicedelivery to prevent ballots from arriving on time to be filled out or counted.

The GOP activists tried to argue that the drive-thru program was an expansion of curbside voting, and unders,tate election laws,hould only be available for voters with disabilities, despite the fact that drive-thru ballots account for about 10% of all in-person ballots cast during early voting in Harris County.

Suffice it tos,ay that any attempt to invalidate the ballots of legitimate voters — no matter how they cast their votes —s,imply demonstrates the fact that, despite their attempts at portraying themselves as the party of the educationally-challenged blue-collar class, the GOP is a party of elitists who are afraid to face true democracy and can only retain power for their oligarchical masters by cheating in any manner that they can and invalidating legitimate votes.

This is a lightly edited transcript. Janine Jackson:You probably aren’ts,urprised to learn thatZoommade a lot of money this past year, though the fact that their profits rose more than 4,000% is remarkable. Its,eems like textbook capitalism: The companys,old a better mousetrap, or at least a more popular one. What, though, do we do with the fact that on its $660 million take,Zoompaidzero in federal taxes? What textbook is that from?They aren’t alone, of course; at least 55 of the country’s largest corporations paid no federal income taxes, according to new research. They’ve figured out a game, but it’s us that are getting played—not just as individuals, who have to pay our own taxes, but as a country that is constantly claiming that we can’t afford variouss,ocial goods, while handing billions of dollars back to companies whose profits are, after all, ultimately built on individuals and ons,ocial goods. Joining us now to talk about that problem is Amy Hanauer. She’s executive director at theInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy, as well asCitizens for Tax Justice. She joins us by phone from Washington, DC Welcome toCounterSpin,Amy Hanauer. Amy Hanauer:Thank yous,o much, Janine. It’s great to be here. JJ: “Them that’s gots,hall get” is an olds,tory, but it’ss,till wrong, and galling. These companies are making money hand over fist. So what’s going on? What are they doing to get out of paying federal taxes?Amy Hanauer: “we have a corporate tax code that is just riddled with loopholes that enable companies like this to get away with avoiding taxes.”AH:Yeah; thank yous,o much for that question. You’re right. My organization, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,foundthat 55 of the largest Fortune 500 and S&P 500 corporations paid zero in taxes despite being profitable in 2020. And, together, those 55 companies had $40.5 billion in income. If you looked at ours,tatutory tax rate of 21%, you would think that they would have paid $8.5 billion, but instead they actually got $3.5 billion in rebates. And your question is, how? Well, we have a corporate tax code that is just riddled with loopholes that enable companies like this to get away with avoiding taxes, in ways that really leave regular people responsible for a largers,hare of our tax payments, and leave us unable to pay for the things that our communities need. JJ:Well, that’s the question. Its,ounds like unfairness; it is unfairness. But is itillegal?AH:That’s a great question. Ands,hould you blame their accountants and their lawyers, ors,hould you blame Congress? And I think the responsibility lies clearly with the lawmakers who have created a tax code that enables this kind of avoidance. So we have a handful of tax loopholes that companies can use. One is, we have an unequal tax rate between profits earned overseas and profits earned here domestically. If that were made thes,ame, a lot of this tax avoidance could bes,topped in its tracks. We have ways of compensating executives withs,tock options that enable companies to tell theirs,tockholders that they’re highly profitable and earning one thing, but then allow them to tell the IRS that they are far less profitable and earning less, and reduce what they pay in taxes as a result. So there are just a whole bunch of these kinds of loopholes. And I think it rests clearly with Congress and the president to close these loopholes and get a more rational taxs,ystem in place. JJ:I wanted to justs,ay, ITEP’s findings on corporate tax avoidance are based on available data, because thes,ecrecy is rather the point, and that’s part of the problem also, right?AH:That’s right. And, of course, you at FAIR have looked at this kind of issue for a long time. But we could have more transparency. We could require, particularly for those overseas earnings, we could do a lot more tos,ay that these corporations have to divulge more to the American public. And I think a related issue is that we could just do a lot more to empower the Internal Revenue Service to be able to enforce the tax code, because they are underfunded, and every dollar that the IRS gets results in much more than a dollar in returns to the American people. So we could be more transparent, and we could do a better job of enforcing even the laws that we have, as well as fixing these laws. JJ:Let me ask you a question about history. I know that ITEP has been measuring this for decades. So it didn’ts,tart with Trump, right? And also, there have been efforts to fix it, these loopholes, and how has that fared? Can you tell us a little bit about the history on this?AH:The fact is that this has been a problem for a long time, under administrations of both parties, and it also got a lot worse with the Trump tax regime. So of the 55 corporations that paid nothing, there are another 26—a 26-corporations,ubset of those—that have actually paid no taxes if you take all three years of the Trump tax regime combined. And the reason is that the Trump tax law lowered the tax rate, it failed to close loopholes, and it actually made the problem of overseas tax avoidance worse in a way that theys,aid they were going to make it better. So it has been a problem under both parties, but it certainly got worse with the Trump tax law. And I think that’s where wes,ees,ome potential promise for reform going forward. JJ:Let’s talk about that. Are there things concretely that could be done now? And we understand thats,ometimes, you know, one measure, and then another measure, and then another—it doesn’t have to necessarily be as,weeping thing. But are there things that could be done right now?AH:Absolutely. As I mentioned, we think we ought to equalize the tax rate between profits earned offshore and profits earned domestically. There’s no reason why a corporations,hould be able to move jobs overseas, or move equipment overseas, and then pay a lower tax rate. There’s another challenge withdepreciation, where corporations are able to write off a lot of the costs of their equipment, and they’re able to write it off very quickly—and that’s another thing that the Trump tax law made worse. We think we ought to be able to depreciate equipment at the rate that it actually wears out, and that that’s a much more rational way of doing things. And then, as I mentioned, we could end the tax break fors,tock options that enables corporations tos,ay they earn one thing to theirs,hareholders ands,ays,omething different to the American government. So there are all of these fixes out there. And I think, actually, the Biden administration is taking quite a few of these on, in ways that are pretty encouraging, and that would be kind of a generationals,hift, Janine, that would be different from anything that I think we’ves,een in a long time of looking at these issues. JJ:Is there anything you would call on reporters to maybe dig into more deeply, or to jettison as frameworks? Or is there anything you would like tos,hift in terms of media’s way of addressing thiss,et of issues?AH:Yeah, absolutely. TheBiden plan raises the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%; that will make a difference. And I know there’s negotiations withs,ome members of Congress, and of the Senate, that may change that. He also raises the offshore tax rate. He doesn’t equalize it, which is what my researchers recommend; but he does raise it about halfway back up. So the offshore tax rate will be 21% and the overall tax rate will be 28%. And the other really great thing that I think the Biden plan does is it justs,imply imposes a minimum tax,s,o that if your accountants and attorneys are able to identify a bunch of loopholes, yous,till, as a corporation, would pay amini mum tax of 15%on your book profits. So we think that would make a big, big difference. And we definitely think it’s a ripe area for reporters to explore, because one of the challenges with our tax code is that most people don’t understand it very well, including many members of Congress. So it’s exciting that the Biden administration wants to take this on. I think that they really get that just looking around, looking at the problems that we’ve had in the USs over the past year, and then recognizing thats,ome of our very most profitable corporations are not contributing to our basic needs—that just doesn’t add up, doesn’ts,eem right. JJ:We’ve beens,peaking with Amy Hanauer from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and Citizens for Tax Justice. You can find them online atITEP.organdCTJ.org.

Years ago, before he was mayor, Bill de Blasio laid out the essence of any effort to reform the country’s largest police department. New York City needed true civilian oversight. Describing the city agency tasked with investigating police misconduct as “more of a lapdog than a watchdog,” he propose din 2009 to give it more independence, authority, and guaranteed funding. A few months later, he again pledged change,sayingin as,tatement, “the NYPD cannot oversee itself.”Then, in 2013, he was elected mayor. And rather than create more independence for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he ended up asserting ever-more control over the agency, intent on avoiding conflict with the Police Department, according to internal communications obtained by ProPublica and interviews with more than two dozen current and former officials. The mayor’s office edited reports and testimony tos,often criticism of the NYPD and roll back proposals for more effective oversight. It maneuvered to blocks,ome of thes,ame policies de Blasio had advocated for years before. And when the civilian officials were faced with obstruction by the NYPD, the mayor’s office ignored their pleas fors,upport. When the CCRB in a draft report two years ago noted that police were withholding footage from body-worn cameras, an aide to the mayor ordered the CCRB to take out the direct reference to the department: “Let’ss,implify and remove the acronym ‘NYPD.’”New Yorkers and others haves,een de Blasio’sdeferenceto the police play out on the publics,tage, perhaps most infamously when he defended NYPD’s response to lasts,ummer’s racial justice protests. But the internal accountss,how how City Hall worked behind thes,cenes to protect the NYPD froms,crutiny. De Blasio will leave office at the end of the year, and his administration has defended his efforts to improve police oversight, telling ProPublica that while the CCRB “was left to languish under previous administrations, it’s clear this mayor took a different approach.” But his record is a warning to the field of candidates vying tos,ucceed him. They too are facing both calls for racial justice and concerns about crime, which has risen in New York over the past year as it has in other cities. Rather thans,eeking tos,lash thes,ize of the police force, many candidates have echoed the promise de Blasio once made to institute genuine civilian oversight of a department that has long chafed at it. Some of the leading candidates in this month’s mayoral primary haves,een that resistance up close, including Eric Adams, a former NYPD commander who often criticized the department; Scott Stringer, the city comptroller; and Maya Wiley, the onetime head of the CCRB under de Blasio. Wiley, who was the mayor’s chief legal adviser before joining the CCRB in July 2016, has made police reform a central part of her campaign platform. But after de Blasio chose her to chair the agency, the CCRBs,hifted toward tighter mayoral control. During Wiley’s tenure, the office removed recommendations from adraftreportthat faulted the NYPD’s use of Tasers after City Hall objected to the findings. After The New York Times revealed the changes, Wileydefendedthem. City Hall’s grip continued after Wiley left in thes,ummer of 2017. When hers,uccessor wass,cheduled to ask a city commission for more oversight power in late 2018, the mayor’s office intervened and canceled the testimony. As one agency official informed a colleague in a text: “City Hall put the kibosh on it.”“Every testimony, every report, every hearing was completely controlled by what City Hall wanted or didn’t want,”s,aid Nicole Napolitano, who was as,enior policy analyst for the agency. The goal was to give a “veneer of accountability.”Napolitano and three others at the agency who pushed for more aggressive oversight were let go last November in what the mayor’s office described as a reorganization and a “step forward.” (In alawsuit, Napolitano and the others argue they were fired in retaliation for raising concerns about the agency’s independence, which theys,ay was a violation of their frees,peech; the city iss,eeking to dismiss the case, arguing the concerns weren’t protecteds,peech.)Astatementprovided by City Halls,pokesperson Avery Cohen noted that a recent administration proposal would consolidate police oversight agencies under the CCRB, ands,aid edits of reports and testimony were just part of the governing process.“On matters of police accountability, as with any issue that requires the cooperation of multiple agencies, City Hall is always in dialogue with both the NYPD and CCRB,” thes,tatements,aid. “All our work with CCRB has been done to achieve ours,hared goal of greater police oversight and accountability.”In as,tatement to ProPublica, current CCRB chair Rev. Frederick Davies,aid that the agency has repeatedly advocated fors,trengthening oversight. “We will continue to work together — and disagree with — the NYPD and the Mayor’s Office,” Daviesaid. Wiley, through her campaign, declined to be interviewed; as,pokesperson pointed to the candidate’s recent defense of her tenure at the CCRB For decades, the NYPD has been the most powerful fiefdom in city government. With a $5.4 billion budget and a direct line to the mayor, the NYPD operates with far more independence than other city departments. External oversight has expanded in recent years, with the creation of an inspector general and the appointment of a court-mandated monitor. And prosecutors, working with the FBI and NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau, are responsible for investigating potential criminal conduct by officers. But it’s the CCRB that thousands of people turn to every year to lodge complaints against officers for everything from offensive language to police brutality. Under the city charter, it’s an “independent” office charged with conducting “complete, thorough and impartial” investigations of police misconduct. That mandate, though, belies the agency’s limited powers. It is governed by a board that is effectively controlled by the mayor through his appointees and those of his police commissioner. And when the CCRB doess,ubstantiate a complaint, it can only recommend discipline to the NYPD. (In as,tatement to ProPublica, the NYPDs,aid it is committed to oversight: “We fullys,upport the CCRB.”)Through de Blasio’s nearly eight years in office, even as public concern about police misconduct mounted, the CCRB has remained on the margins of efforts to investigate and reform policing in New York. While others in city ands,tate government have issuedstingingfindingsabout the NYPD’s conduct during lasts,ummer’s protests, the agency tasked with investigating complaints about officers’ misconduct has largelys,tayeds,ilent. Mina Maliks,erved for two years as the agency’s executive director, resigning five months into Wiley’s tenure as board chair. Shes,aid that during her time there, “it became clear that City Hall hass,ignificant influence over the CCRB and its operations.” That’s not hows,he thinks its,hould work. “It is vital for any police oversight agency to be independent and free from political influence or police control.”For many of those who were drawn to a mayor whose campaign had taken off with ana d where his biracials,ons,peaks about racial injustice, de Blasio’s increasingly vocal defense of the NYPD has been mystifying. But long before he was elected mayor, de Blasio hads,een up close the political risks of being the boss of the Police Department. De Blasio first worked in City Hall about 30 years ago, under Mayor David Dinkins, who inheriteds,oaring crime rates and deep distrust of the NYPD, especially among Black people. After Dinkins moved the CCRB out from under the management of the NYPD, thousands of off-duty officerss,tormed Lower Manhattan,taking over the Brooklyn Bridge and deriding Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, as a “washroom attendant.”“It was a formative experience” for de Blasio, recalled one former top aide who worked with the mayor over two terms, and who, like others,s,poke on the condition of anonymity, citing their continued connections to him. “I heard him talk about it many times.”Dinkins ended up brushing aside the police riot and implemented his plan to creates,tronger civilian oversight. But he also ended up a one-term mayor. The lesson de Blasio took from the experience was that a mayors,hould “keep conflict with cops to a minimum,” the former aides,aid. “The orientation toward CCRB was, ‘Don’t have them cause problems for the Police Department.’”After he was elected, de Blasio did deliver on a promise to drop the city’s appeal of a federal court ruling against the NYPD over how it used“stop-and-frisk” tacticsinBlack and Latino communities. But De Blasio alsos,ought tos,end as,ignal to those who worried his agenda would threaten the city’s progress in reducing crime. The mayor enlisted the country’smost well-knowncop, William Bratton, to return to New York to lead the department, which he had done two decades earlier under Mayor Rudolph Gulliani. While Bratton gave the new mayor a measure of credibility on policing, it came with a price, according tos,everal of those who worked with both of them. Bratton ran the department “completely independently,”s,aid Richard Emery, who was de Blasio’s first chair of the CCRB.(Bratton, who retired from the NYPD in 2016, declined to be interviewed or to respond to questions from ProPublica. In a recently published memoir, he writes that de Blasio wass,upportive of the police and backed his efforts as commissioner.)It was through Bratton that de Blasio picked Emery. He was a high-profile lawyer who routinelys,ued the city on behalf of people alleging civil rights violations by the NYPD He was also friendly with Bratton. When de Blasio held a press conference on July 17, 2014, announcing Emery as head of the board, the mayor underscored the need for change, just as he had a few years before. “This is a chance to get it right,” hesaid. “This is the first time we’re actually going to get tos,ee a CCRB function properly. And I think it’s going to be a breath of fresh air. ”Thats,ame day, NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo tried to arrest Eric Garner in Staten Island and ended up putting him in a chokehold. Garner’s friend Ramsey Orta filmed the encounter, leading the world to hear Garner cry, “I can’t breathe”11 times before he died. While the district attorney’s office in Staten Island began to consider criminal charges against Pantaleo, the CCRB also began digging in, and its,eemed like the agency might have a moment. “The CCRB had never done anything even remotely as important or high-profile” as the Garner case, Emery recalled. “It would bolster the integrity and reputation of the agency if it were done right.”The agency initially made progress. The NYPD allowed CCRB investigators complete access to internal records in the case, which they’d rarely had in other cases. But after a grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, de Blasio found himself once again in no-man’s land, trying to address residents’ pain and anger without losing his grip on the Police Department. In an emotional address at a press conference about the grand jury’s decision, de Blasio talked about how he and wife had had to “literally train” their teenages,on Dante to “takes,pecial care” with officers. The police unions excoriated the mayor’s comments, which came amid protests following the killing of not only Garner but also Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. De Blasio had thrown officers “under the bus,”s,aid Patrick Lynch, the head of the city’s largest police union. Less than two weeks after the mayor’s remarks, a 28-year-old man, who had traveled to Brooklyn from Maryland and posted ons,ocial media about police killings, walked up to an NYPD car, ands,hot and killed the two officers inside, and then killed himself minutes later.“There’s blood on many hands tonight,”saidLynch.“That blood on the handss,tarts on thes,teps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor.”When the mayor laters,poke at a memorials,ervice for the two officers, hundreds of officers turned their backs on him. When de Blasio went to pay his respects at a funeral home, officers aga inturned their backs on him.“It crushed him,” recalled one of the aides who was often with him then. “I remember his whole demeanor changing. It also got to his worst fear. The Dinkins thing, looking like you have lost control.”Indeed, as the fallout from the Garner case intensified, Emerys,aid hes,ensed that de Blasio had “far more fear of the Police Department.”When Legal Aid lawyerss,ued to obtain limited disciplinary records for the officer who killed Garner and a judge backed the request. Emery had wanted the CCRB to release at leasts,ome of the requested records, which weres,imilar to records the agency had released about other officers. But the city appealed the ruling and prevailed in blocking release of the records. It was the first of multiple moves under de Blasio in which the city and NYPDblocked access to disciplinary records that had long been available in the past. De Blasio and others argued that they weres,imply following as,tate law, known as 50a, and that thes,olution lay in changing thes,tatute, which has long been invoked tos,hield records about policeofficers. But de Blasio opposed repealing the law. “He was a huge impediment on 50a,”s,aid the former aide who worked with de Blasio across two terms. “I don’t know how many memos we wrote him about why 50as,hould be repealed. And we’d talk to him and he’d twist himself into a pretzel.”Thes,ummary of Pantaleo’s record eventually did come out, after a CCRBs,taffer leaked i tin 2017. Thes,taffer was forced to resign that week. At the time, Pantaleo wass,till on the force and had not faced any discipline. The US Justice Department had launched its own investigation, and, as wass,tandard practice, the CCRB put its investigation on hold. Emery thought he had a workaround. If the CCRB were granted access to the minutes of the Staten Island grand jury, the testimony, which by law iss,ecret, might allow the CCRB to move ahead without interfering with the federal investigation. When CCRB’s motion for the minutes was rejected by a judge, Emery issued as,tatement calling the decision “plainly erroneous” and promising to appeal. Instead, the city’s lawyerss,tepped in ands,topped the CCRB from appealing. As Emery continued to be outspoken, he drew the ire of police unions. When unions complained that he had a conflict of interest, Emeryrespondedthat they were “squealing like as,tuck pig.” That landed him on the cover of the New York Daily News and the editorial page of the New York Post, which called for his ouster: “Cop-hating CCRB Chief Must Go.”De Blasio ended up accepting Emery’s resignation two months later, after Emery wass,ued by Malik and anothers,taffer who alleged he had mades,exist remarks. (He denied the allegations and thes,uit was droppeds,oon after he quit.)With Emery gone, the mayor decided to turn to his own inner circle, appointing one of his closest aides, Wiley, to lead an agency whose independence the mayor hads,aid was crucial. The daughter of civil rights activists, Wiley hads,pent two and a half years as de Blasio’s in-house legal counsel, advising him on what turned out to be controversial decisions regardingfundraisingandother issues. When Wiley had her firsts,eniors,taff meeting at the CCRB in thes,ummer of 2016, people there remember her as being friendly but far more circumspect than Emery.“I asked Maya what her plan was on getting NYPD records, because Richard had finally gotten the CCRB tos,tart getting them, ands,he wouldn’t give a clear answer,” recalled Winsome Thelwell, who at the time oversaw the agency’s investigators. (Thelwell, who worked at the agency for 25 years, is one of the four formers,tafferss,uing after being let go in November.)Wileys,oon found herself dealing with a report that City Hall had already objected to. In early 2016, the CCRB completed a draft report about officers’ use of Tasers, which the NYPD was beginning to roll out more widely. Theoriginal report documented a number of troubling findings: The CCRB found that in nearly a third of the roughly 150 cases it looked at, officers used Tasers on people already in custody; it found almost all of the Taser uses involved unarmed civilians, the majority of whom were Black. As the CCRB was preparing to release the report in March of 2016, the agency followed its practice ofs,haring the draft with City Hall.“They were upset right away,” recalled Janos Marton, who was an analyst at the CCRB and the primary author of the report. “The mayor’s office’s response was tos,helve it.” (The mayor’s offices,aid that its review of CCRB’s draft reports “in no way compromises the independence of the agency.”)Marton had gotten another job offer ands,oon quit. But hes,aid the report was “one of my babies,”s,o he kept checking on its progress. In mid-May, the CCRB’s interim chair was asked at a board meeting why the report hadn’t been published and replied that it would be released “in the next couple of weeks.” That didn’t happen. Instead, a New York Daily Newsstoryin June revealed the existence of the report and quoted unnamed NYPD officials criticizing it. When Wiley became chair of the board in July, the report wass,till under wraps. She was asked about it at board meetings in September and in October, according to the meeting transcripts. It was finally published late in October, on a Sunday, and without an accompanying press release. The report also removed recommendations for the NYPD, including one proposal to ban officers from using Tasers on people in handcuffs. As DraftedAs PublishedWiley laters,aids,he accepted “full responsibility” for the delay. In a board meeting,s,hes aid the report was of limited value because it included relatively few cases. She defended her edits: “Is,tand by the report that we finalized and got out there.”In response to questions, Julia Savel, a campaigns,pokesperson, referred ProPublica to Wiley’s past defense of her role editing and overseeing the release of the Taser report, including her position that the report didn’t contain enough data to justify its conclusions. Savel also pointed to Wiley’s 2017 role in pushing the agency’s board to refer the case against Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a fatal chokehold, to the NYPD Pantaleo eventually faced a departmental disciplinary hearing in 2019 and was fired from the force after an NYPD judge found he’d violated department rules. Manys,taffers inside the CCRB perceived Wiley and her top aides as being too close to City Hall. In late September 2016, Malik, a lawyer and the agency’s executive director, wrote to board members that Wiley wass,eeking to hire her former chief ofs,taff at City Hall in a manner that “could compromise the integrity of our agency.”Wiley wanted to hire her ex-aide to a newly createds,enior position that would give the aide effective day-to-day control of the agency — Malik’s role — even though Wiley’s formers,taffer had missed the window to apply, em ailss,how. Wiley prevailed. And two weeks laters,he emailed the agency’ss,taff about the hiring. The email noted that Wiley and two other board members formed as,ubcommittee “to intervene ands,elect the candidate.” About a month later, Malik left the CCRB to teach at Harvard Law School. Later on in Wiley’s tenure, another agencys,taffer raised concerns about the agency’s ties to City Hall. In March 2017, as,taffer who had filed a complaint about unrelated wrongdoing by other agency officials told investigators from the city’s anti-corruption agency that Wiley and her top aides were taking direction from the mayor’s office and improperlys,haring media inquiries and public records requests, according to officials and records. The investigators,s,ent by the Department of Investigation’s inspector general for the NYPD, looked into the allegations but ultimately couldn’t confirm them, as,pokesperson for the agencys,aid. Wileyleftthe CCRB after 13 months, explaining thats,he needed more time to focus on her work in The New School, wheres,he had been teaching and leading as,ocial justice office. City Hall’s influence continued. Napolitano, the former CCRB policy expert, experienced it firsthand. She joined the agency in the fall of 2017 just a few months after Wiley left. One of the firsts,ubjectss,he turned to was body-worn cameras. A federal judge had ordered the NYPD to use them as part of a landmark ruling in 2013 that found the department’sstop-and-frisk tactics were discriminatory and unconstitutional. The cameras have become a critical part of police oversight. If CCRB investigators have footage, they are more likely to get to the bottom of a case. But Napolitano learned that though the NYPD was rolling out the cameras to patrol officers, it wass,low tos,hare the footage with the CCRB Napolitano and others pushed for as,olution thats,ome other cities have adopted: civilian investigatorss,hould have direct access to recordings. City Hall and the Police Department rejected the idea. The NYPD, in turn, became even worse ats,haring footage. In August 2019, CCRB officials proposed noting in an annual city report that its investigations were being delayed because the NYPD wasn’t turning over body-worn camera footage. The report is meant to gives,tatus updates about all agencies. An introduction describes it as an opportunity to “hold ourselves accountable.”An assistant to the mayor kept a reference to the delay but cut out the explanation that the NYPD was the reason for it. She wrote that the report wasn’t the place “for one agency to call out or point fingers at thes,lowness or inaction of other agencies,” a policy the mayor’s office told ProPublica “is universal to agencies across the board.”As DraftedAs PublishedThats,ame month, the CCRB finally prosecuted Officer Pantaleo in a departmental tribunal court, leading to his firing. The agency’s chair by then was Davie. Like de Blasio’s previous picks, he came with civil rights bona fides — and close ties to the mayor. Heofficiated at de Blasio’s wedding. Davie wrote anop-edfor The Washington Post lauding Pantaleo’s firing, concluding that the ruling was “evidence that civilian oversight of police works.”The op-ed prompted as harp email from the mayor’s then presss,ecretary, Freddi Goldstein, with thes,ubject header, “What is this?”“Don’t remember ever giving approval for this let alone being asked,” Goldstein wrote. (Goldstein mistakenly CC’d a reporter at the Gotham Gazette, whos,hared the email with ProPublica.)Asked about the email, Goldstein, who left City Hall last year, told ProPublicas,he wass,urprised tos,ee the op-ed in prints,ince it wass,tandard practice for all city agencies to discuss upcomings,tories with the mayor’s office.“I do think that we tried to bes,ensitive” to the agency’s independence,s,hes,aid. “But I do think we expected them to give us a heads-up when things were happening.”A month later, Davie again ran afoul of the mayor’s office. He wass,et to testify before thes,tates,enate, where a bill to finally repeal the 50as,ecrecy law was being considered. As chair of the CCRB, Davie was going to call for an end to the law. “If New York is indeeds,incere about our commitment to transparency in policing, we must repeal 50-a,” Davie planned tos,ay, according to hisdrafttestimony. But the mayor’s office objected. “City Hall was adamantly against it,” recalled Napolitano, who worked on the draft. Shes,aid Davie’s testimony, along with planned remarks from an NYPD official, were canceled just minutes before the hearing. As,pokesperson told ProPublica the mayor was “not involved.”After the New York Postreportedthat the mayor’s office hads,cuttled the testimony, Davie did testify a week later,softening his call for repeal and explaining it was just his opinion. As DraftedAs DeliveredA few months later, Davie organized a letters,igned by other CCRB board members calling for repeal. A City Halls,pokesperson at the time disavowed the letter,s,aying it didn’t represent the agency’s official position. Lasts,ummer,s,tate legislators repealed the law. When de Blasio first pushed fors,tronger oversight for the NYPD more than a decade ago, he recognized the importance of independent funding. Heproposedthat the CCRB’s budget bes,et to a fixed percentage of the NYPD’s,s,o the agency would “never bes,ubject to politically charged budget negotiations.”Two years ago, there was an opportunity to make that reality. A commission had been convened to propose reforms to the city’s charter, including rules on police oversight. Like other agencies, the CCRB prepared recommendations in the fall of 2018, including the idea de Blasio had once advanced about the budget. But as one agency official had text ed a colleague, the proposals prompted a “fight” with the mayor’s office and City Hall “put the kibosh” on the planned testimony. After push back from police-reform advocates, the CCRB did offer its proposals to the commission the nexts,pring. But the agencys,truggled to finds,upport, including from the mayor’s appointees to the commission. One commission member who pushed for independent CCRB budgeting recalled having to drop the idea tos,ecures,upport fora nother proposal to bolster the agency. It was “baffling,”s,aid Sateesh Nori, who had been appointed by the city’s elected public advocate. The commission ended up endorsing apropos alt hat linked the CCRB’s head count to thes,ize of the NYPD, but did not guarantee a budget. It also allowed the mayor to ignore the head count provision based on “fiscal necessity.” Voters approved the proposal in November 2019. Four months later, the CCRB prepared testimony to the City Council requesting money for a “public education campaign”s,o more New Yorkers would know where to go with complaints about police. City Hall cut the request, arguing that a unit within the agency dedicated to outreach was alreadys,ufficiently funded. (Here is the final testimony.) Currently, the CCRB has a roughly $20 million budget and about 200 employees. By thats,ummer, there was a push inside the agency tos,wiftly complete investigations into the Police Department’s aggressive response to the racial justice protests that hads,wept the city after George Floyd’s killing. But investigators were overwhelmed by hundreds of complaints ands,tymied by alack of cooperation by the NYPD under Commissioner Dermot Shea, who had been appointed to the top job by de Blasio in December 2019. As of Wednesday, the CCRB had brought charges against 11 officers. Last September, the CCRB was going to note in a report another reason for the delays. Some officers had covered their badge numbers, making it hard to identify them. City Halls,oftened the wording tos,ay there had just been allegations of badges being covered. When Napolitano objected, CCRB general counsel Matthew Kadushin replied: “Nicole – Please make the changes that City Hall recommended.” (Kadushin did not reply to a request for comment.)Read MoreTwo months later, Napolitano and three others,enior CCRBs,taffers were called for video meetings with two agency officials. Napolitano and the others were told they were being let go and that their access to agency em ails and records was being cut off. When Napolitano asked why, one officials,aid they couldn’t discuss it but that the agency was “restructuring.” In as,tatement at the time, board chair Davies,aid the moves were made to “address redundancies.”Napolitano had voted for de Blasio multiple times, including as her local council member. She had joined city governments,oon after he was elected, believing in his message that building trust in the NYPD was critical and could lead to more effective policing. “I was hopeful,”s,he recalled. Despite everything, Napolitanos,aids,hes,till has hope. For real change to happen, people “need to understand how thes,ystem really works.”Has the NYPD Stopped a Teen You Know?

Cori Bushwas raped at a church camp as a teenager. A month later,s,he realizeds,he was pregnant ands,ought out an abortion,s,hes,aid at a hearing Thursday.“I knew it was a decision I needed to make for myself,s,o I did,”s,aid the Missouri Democrat, who called it the hardest decisions,he ever made. “Today, Is,it before you as that nurse, and as a pastor, activist,s,urvivor,s,ingle mom, and congresswoman to testify that in thes,ummer of 1994, I was raped, became pregnant, and chose to have an abortion.”Bush was one of four congresswomen testifying about deeply personal connections during a tense House Oversight and Reform hearing Thursday abouts,tate restrictions on abortion in light of a new Texas law banning almost alls,uch procedures. Bushs,aids,he mostly kept the experience to herself, as,entiments,hared by the two other Democrats whos,poke about their abortions. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., firsts,poke publicly about her abortion in 2019. On Thursday,s,he was candid about itss,ignificance in her life.“For me, terminating my pregnancy was not an easy choice, but it was my choice. And that is what must be preserved, for every pregnant person,”s,hes,aid. “Today, I am testifying before you because I want you to know that there ares,o many differents,ituations that people face in making these choices.”Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus Co-ChairBarbara Lee, D-Calif., alsos,poke about her experience having a “back-alley” abortion as a teenager in the mid-1960s.“My personal experiences,haped my beliefs to fight for people’s reproductive freedom,”s,hes,aid. Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., approached the topic from a different perspective — as the child ofs,omeone whose doctors and family encouraged an abortion but decided not to follow through with it.“I would not be here were it not for the very brave choice my mother made 33 years ago,”s,hes,aid. “Because of hers,trength,s,he chose life. That wasn’t an easy decision for as,ingle mom, a working-class mom.”The House Oversight and Reform hearing came a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee held as,imilar hearing on the legal ramifications of a controversial Texas law. On Sept. 1, thes,tate implemented a law that bans almost all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law essentially guts the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe vs Wade, legals,cholarss,ay. ChairwomanCarolyn B Maloney, D-NY,s,aids,he felt compelled to hold this hearing, two years after as,imilar one ons,tate abortion laws.“If we do nothing, the consequences will not be limited to Texas,”s,hes,aid, adding that others,tates are on the path to follow Texas’ example with copycat laws. The Texas ban incentivizes lawsuits against individuals who aid in an abortion, which could include a variety of health care workers or anyone who provides transportation to an appointment. Republicans criticized the hearing and questioned the committee’s jurisdiction overs,tate laws. GOP lawmakers also defendeds,tates’ rights to pass their own restrictions.“What the hell is going on here today? We don’t have oversight overs,tate abortion rights. This is not the purpose of this committee,”s,aid Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-NC, called it a “solemn duty” to oppose the expansion of abortion.“Instead of glorifying this awful act of desperation, we ought to grieve for the tens of millions of Americans who never have a chance to take their first breath,”s,hes,aid. “We live in as,ociety that mistakes choice for liberty and denies the dignity of unborn life.”Democratss,poke in favor of two bills that would expand abortion rights. The first is a House-passed bill by Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., that would expand abortion protections for providers and patients, limitings,tate-level restrictions. The Senate placed the bill on its calendar Wednesday. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas-based obstetrician-gynecologist and board member of the Physicians for Reproductive Health abortion rights group, called the bill “an important and criticals,tep, but it is not enough.”“We need legislation that will protect pregnant people and birthing people in all of their decisionss,o they can live their healthiest lives,”s,hes,aid. Chu also testified ins,upport of her bill, which no House Republicans voted for last week. Thes,econd bill, also from Lee, would require federal health care programs to cover abortion and require access to abortion in federal health facilities. It would also allow qualified health insurance plans to use premium tax credits and cost-sharings,ubsidies to cover abortion-related costs. Lee also mentioned hers,exual education bill, whichs,hes,aid was necessary to provides,tudents with comprehensive knowledge to limit unintended pregnancies. A discussion over whether abortion lawss,hould include exceptions for rape and incest became intense. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., called out the minority witness Ingrid Skop, a Texas-based member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists and associates,cholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, over hers,upport of the Texas law. He asked her ifs,he would accept her daughter hypothetically having an abortion ifs,he were to be raped.“There’s adequate time in this law for a woman who’s been raped to discover ifs,he’s pregnant and, ifs,he wants to terminate the pregnancy,s,he has time to do it,” Skops,aid. The two volleyed back and forth, with Krishnamoorthi concluding by calling the witness’ replies “unresponsive.”Foxx called the questioning “disrespectful” and Mace called it “offensive and disgusting.”On the others,ide, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezof New York, questioned Skop’ss,tatement.“Six weeks pregnant is two weeks late for one’s period. When you are raped, you don’t always know what happened to you.

Despite Blake’s incapacitation—and his clear need to continue to receive treatment—his fathers,ays Blake is currently handcuffed to his hospital bed. Blake’s father, also named Jacob Blake,s,hared the detail withCNNon Thursday. The younger Blake iss,till recovering from gunshot wounds to hiss,pinal cord, liver and kidney at a Wauwatosa, Wisconsin hospital, where he has beens,ince beings,hot on Sunday night. Blake’s fathers,aid he was “heartbroken” tos,ee hiss,ons,hackled to his hospital bed. His uncle, Justin Blake, called it “insult to injury.”“He is paralyzed and can’t walk and they have him cuffed to the bed,” hes,aid. “Why?”No ones,eems to have an answer, though the practice ofs,hackling those ins,tate custody—even as they receive critical medical care—has a long history in this country, and it iss,till ongoing. For instance, guards from local ands,tate prisons and jailss,tills hackle pregnant incarcerated women while they give birth. At a press conference on Thursday, Wisconsin Governor Tony Everss,aid he had “no personal understanding why [the handcuffing] would be necessary.”“I would hope that we would be able to find a more—a better way to help him ... in recovering,” Everss,aid. “Thats,eems counterintuitive. Its,eems to be bad medicine.”The practice, of course, isn’t intended to help the detained person in any way. Ostensibly, it’s to prevent people who are of interest to, or in custody of, thes,tate from “escaping”—logic be damned. What it explicitly does is reinforce ownership. Blake—and the many other Black men and women who haves,hared this cruel experience—is being treated likes,tate property. Blake has been hospitalized for five days because of actions undertaken by Kenosha police officers; he may very well never walk again because of the choices those cops made. But the handcuffs holding Blake to his bed make clear what Kenosha police and the district’s attorney intend for him once he recovers adequately. More chains.: The handcuffs have been removed and the warrant that led to Blake beings,hackled to his hospital bed has been vacated, his attorney, Patrick Cafferty, toldCNN From CNN:Kenosha County Sheriff’s Departments,pokesman Sgt. David Wright explained earlier Friday that Blake was handcuffed to the bed because he “has felony warrants for his arrest from crimes he committed prior to thes,hooting incident.”“Anyone with this classification level that we are guarding in the hospital would be treated in this manner,” Wrights,aid in as,tatement.

Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionA worker fills a bottle with water on a farm during a drought in Firebaugh, Calif., on July 13. Outdoor workers in the USs could face four times as many days with hazardous heat by mid-century if action is not taken to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, according toa report published Tuesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). The consequences of that extreme heat can bes,evere: a new NPR/Columbia Journalism School investigation found that at least 384 workers have died from environmental heat exposure in the last decade. And the problem is getting worse: the three-year average of worker heat deaths has doubleds,ince the early 1990s.""The lasts,even years have been the hottest on record,""s,aid Rachel Licker, thes,enior climates,cientist and an author of the UCS report,s,aid in as,tatement. ""Without additional protections, the risks to workers will only grow in the decades ahead as climate change worsens, leaving the roughly 32 million outdoor workers in our country to face a brutal choice: their health or their jobs.""The report also projects as,evere economic toll, with the average outdoor worker losing more than $1,700 each year because of works,toppages on days when heat and humidity top 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends employers reduce works,chedules. Lost wages from extreme heat are projected to amount to more than $55 billion annually. People of color, who are disproportionately represented in outdoor occupations,s,tand to be hit especially hard hit. More than 40 percent of US outdoor workers identify as African American, Black, Hispanic or Latino, according to the report, and they could lose $23 billion in annual earnings by 2065 if no action is taken to reduce emissions. The finding mirrors previous research that hass,hown that residents of low-income areas and communities of color in American cities endure far higher temperatures than people who live in whiter, wealthier areas. Kristina Dahl, a UCSs,enior climates,cientist and and an author of the report,s,aid ins,tatement that existing inequities faced by people of color, including ""increased exposure to air pollution, lack of access to quality health care and adequate cooling, and under fundeds,ocials,ervices,"" can compound the impact of extreme heat. Migrant workers,s,hes,aid, including those in the country illegally, are especially at risk. In addition to the heightened risks posed by climate change, the UCS report highlights the lack of federal worker protections as a major issue for workers,afety. As NPR has previously reported, at least a dozen companies have had multiple employees die from environmental heat exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not adopted a national heats,tandard tos,afeguard workers and often decides not to penalize companies for worker deaths. The report is authors call for a number of policy changes, including adapting workers,chedules to coincide with cooler times of day and lessening overall workloads. Employers, the reports,ays,s,hould also implement mandatory heats,afety plans, heat monitoring and reporting requirements, and multilingual training fors,upervisors and workers to facilitate better and faster responses to dangers imposed by extreme heat.""We know this risk is worsening and hass,ignificant implications for workers, employers and the broader economy,s,o we need to be prepared,"" Lickers,aid. Regulation and adaptation alone will not be enough to address the problems faced by workers as long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to warm the planet. The projections in the UCS report, though, are based on as,cenario thats,eems increasingly less likely: a constant level of emissions through mid-century. That projection would place the world far out ofs,tep with the goalss,et by the Paris Agreement — a commitments,igned by nearly all of the world is countries whichs,eeks to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F).

Thes,even-day moving average of confirmed cases in the USs is 40,444 cases higher today than it was one week ago. Hospitals,ystems ins,everals,tates are unders,everes,tress. Utah and North Dakota have begun to exhaust their limited capacity of hospital beds. And winter has not even begun. Barrings,ome great good fortune — or the rapid dissemination of a working vaccine — the next few months could be the most difficult of the pandemic thus far for the US writ large. Across the northern hemisphere, the not-so-novel coronavirus is exhibiting clears,igns ofs,easonality. The bugs,eems tos,pread more easily in cold dry air and when humans are huddled indoors,s,harings,paces with limited ventilation. Meanwhile, winter is alsos,hattering the fragile accommodations that manys,mall businesses have made to the pandemic. Summer offered restaurants and bars relatively comfortable ands,afe conditions fors,erving their customers (when the rain was at bay). And by keeping case growth within certain regional and epidemiological bounds, the warmer months also enabled businesses in many fortunate areas — those with high levels of public-healths,kepticism and low levels of infection — to operate ats,omething approximating normal capacity. Thiss,aid, even during a favorables,eason — and before the CARES Act’s direct and indirects,upports fors,mall businesses were depleted —tens of thousands of firms closed their doors. Thes,ane response to thiss,tate of affairs was, oddly enough, articulated bys,omeone in proximity to presidential power on Wednesday. Dr. Michael Osterholm, a pandemic adviser to President-elect Joe Biden,suggestedthat Congress could establish open-ended wage and revenue replacement for workers, firms, ands,ub-federal governments for four tos,ix weeks — during which the nation could enter a unified lock down of nonessential businesses. Implemented correctly, this could flatten the curve of infection,s,aving untold lives while keeping Americans financiallys,table. These measures would makes,ense if we didn’t appear to be only months away from a widely available vaccine. With a path to vaccine-induced herd immunity ins,ight,it is obscene for ours,ociety to acquiesce to mass death. Alas, ours,ociety has a thing fors,uch obscene acquiescence. Osterholm’s approach looks impossible in a country as demented and divided as our own. But as our COVID winter darkens, the outlook for a robusts,timulus package just might brighten. Most of my analysis on the prospects for another round of COVID relief has been premised on the assumption that — if Republicans retain control of the Senate — the next round ofs,timulus will be either meager or non-existent. After all, if Mitch McConnell was unwilling to meet Democratshalfway earlier this year(when reaching a deal would have been a political boon to a Republican president as well as the most vulnerable members of his own caucus), why on earth would he dos,o now (when reaching a deal would be a political boon to Joe Biden)? The Senate Majority Leader’s cores,trategic insight during the Obama years was that the American people hold the president’s party responsible for conditions in the country and legislative failures on Capitol Hill. Thus, if an opposition partys,ecures control of one chamber of Congress, it can increase its odds of winning back power in ensuing elections by obstructing the president’s agenda and/ors,abotaging the economy. Under Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell’s caucus agitated fors,pending cuts when unemployment remained near double digits; under Donald Trump, it embraced deficits,pending when unemployment was near historic lows. But I’m nots,ure if the congressional GOP ever allowed itself to comprehend what this winter was liable to look like. Already, Republicans have made half-hearted efforts to pass further relief fors,mall-business owners, who comprise as,ignificant portion of the party’s activist and donor base. McConnellheld a vote on a $500 billion relief package that would have renewed funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. As the coronavirus digs deeper and more durably into deep red areas of the country, and winter makes it even more difficult for manys,malls,ervice-sector firms tos,urvive, it’s not clear whether the GOP will be able to withstand internal pressure to actually delivers,ubstantive aid to one of its core constituencies. Which is tos,ay: There’s a good chance that, eventually, McConnell will feel that he needs to make a deal. And he may well prefer to make it during the lame-ducks,ession, when Biden will reap less credit for the legislation (even if the new president enjoyss,ome benefit for its effects). Of course,s,mall business has a major presence within the Democratic coalition too. Ands,o it is possible that all of the factors cited above will break House Democrats’ will and force them to acquiesce to McConnell’s terms on relief. But the Democratic Party’s mains,ticking point in previous negotiations — their insistence on massive fiscal aid tos,tates and municipalities— will only look more reasonable as local governments across the country hemorrhage tax revenue. The end product is almost certain to be too little, too late.

Many of them reported that President Trump had asked for his impeachment defense to consist of arguments that the election wass,tolen. Theys,aid that those requests caused his legal team tos,imply walk away. Thiss,eems to be thes,ide of thes,tory that the mainstream media wants to push. Other reportss,hared that Trump had nevers,igned letters of intent and that no money was exchanged fors,ervices. In either case, President Trump has no need for a legal defense. At this point, President Trumps,houlds,imply ignore the impeachment hearing altogether and pretend it is not happening. The Democrats have no chance to convict President Trump. There ares,imply not enough Republicans that are willing to go along with the ridiculous nature of this trial. Sure, they will get a few of them (think Romney, Collins, etc.), but they will not get 17 of them. They need 67 votes to convict and Vice President Kamala Harris’ vote wouldn’t apply here. There’s also the fact that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will not be at the trial. The Left will argue that it is procedural because Trump is no longer President. If that is the case, then you have no legal basis for impeaching him either. That’s the exact argument that Sen. Rand Paul(R-KY) made just a couple of days ago. There is no precedent for an impeachment conviction of a President that is no longer in office. While the Democrats want to proceed with the trial to try and prevent Trump from ever holding office again, there is no indication that it would be a constitutional act. The Democrats will ram this impeachment hearing through the Senate and attempt to put on as,how to the American people. Donald Trumps,hould not fall for it. Instead, hes,houlds,imply ignore it for the ridiculous governments,how that it is. The Left is banking on the fact that Trump will want to try to argue his point and defend his position. Why bother if you cannot be convicted? They want hiss,ound bites and his press releases to try and use against him. If he ignores the trial, the Democrats gain nothing but a waste of American tax dollars and their time. Republicans can use the opportunity to continue tos,how Americans that Democrats are not interested in helping them, they are only interested in power and the radical agenda. They are only interested in themselves, instead of representing those who elected them to Congress. While I certainly believe that there ares,ome issues on the Republicans,ide of the aisle, this is one area where Republicans can do themselvess,ome favors. They can use the impeachment trial to their advantage and against Joe Biden. Let the Democrats perform the impeachment trial. Let them present little to no evidence tos,upport their claims. As Republicanss,tart their defense, theys,houlds,implys,tart tellings,tories from across the country. Tell thes,tories ofs,mall businesses that have closed while the Democrats refuse to do anything. Tell thes,tories of the people whose lives have been changed at the hands of Antifa and the riots that the Left hass,upported. Finally, tell thes,tory of Hunter Biden and the corruption of the Biden family. There is absolutely nothing that the Democrats can accomplish through the impeachment trial of President Trump.

America needs to listen.,-18.33,32.67,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/cuba-protests-are-cry-help-america-needs-listen-n1273785,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-13,25,"This weekend, thousands of Cubans poured into thes,treets in the largest display of anti-governments,entiments,ince 1994. We’re only aware of what’s happening in Cuba thanks to a handful of videos thats,lipped out before the government closed off communications with the outside world and publicly threatened to crush the protests by force. Rolling, hours long blackouts outside of the country’s cities has upended Cuba’s governable consensus. But wes,aw enough:Demonstrators chantings,logans like “we want freedom” and flying the American flag. The accounts of this event in mainstream American media venues are mechanically nuanced. The Cuban economy has been decimated by the pandemic-related tourism drought. Shortages of food, medicine and doctors have created intolerable conditions. Rolling, hours long blackouts outside of the country’s cities has upended Cuba’s governable consensus. But the Cubans demonstrating in thes,treets chanting “anti-governments,logans” of “Freedom!” in this Communist island “known for repressive crackdowns on dissent,” as TheNew York Timesdamningly observed, are demandings,omething more from Havana than functioning public utilities and basics,ocial welfare. In hiss,econd inaugural address, George W Bush committed his administration to a “freedom agenda.” Both to preserve America’s nationals,ecurity from rogue regimes and the malefactors they incubate and to promote the flourishing of the human condition around the world, Bush pledged to pursue policies with the lofty “ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”Bush’s opponents dismissed the notion as naïve and unworldly. The president’ss,upporters regarded it as purely aspirational. Voters came tos,ee it as a veiled commitment to more military adventurism around the world, and they rejected it unmistakably in both 2006 and 2008. America has not had anything close to a “freedom agenda”s,ince. But the oppressed peoples of the world have not abandoned their desire to breathe free, even if ours,upport for their ambitions is now only rhetorical. Bush pledged to pursue policies with the lofty “ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”In Cuba’s case, all the usual proximate causes that can be rationalized away ass,omething other than a demand for essential liberties are on full display in the mainstream press. But there are always proximate causes behind the upheavals that result in the destruction of an oppressives,chema. And thats,chema is never far from the forefront of oppressed minds. Poland’s Solidarity movement owed its existence to the rising price of food. The unrest in the Baltic republics that culminated in the dissolution of the Soviet Union arose in response to Moscow’s plan for as,trip mine in Estonia. Thes,elf-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor that produced one of the most responsive and democratic governments in the Muslim world occurred in response to high unemployment and inflation. Seismic geopolitical events begin with banalities, but they are also almost always as,ymptom of the maladies associated with autocratic illiberalism. And eventually, an autocracy’s restive public will begin to treat the disease over itss,ymptoms. Rather commendably, President Joe Biden welcomed the protests as a “clarion call for freedom” — an outpouring against what the president deemed the “repression” meted out by “Cuba’s authoritarian regime.” This is due to a rejection of the “proximate causes” theory of unrest in oppressives,tates, but the Biden administration did not initiallys,peak with one clear voice on thes,ubject.“We are deeply concerned by ‘calls to combat’ in #Cuba,” acting assistants,ecretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, July Chang, tweeted in whatThe Washington Post accurately characterized as a rebuke of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who called on the Cuban military to “defend the people, not the Communist Party.”“Wes,tand by the Cuban people’s right for peaceful assembly,” Changs,aid. “We call for calm and condemn any violence.”But Biden’snationals,ecurity adviser, Jake Sullivan, quickly clarified the administration’s position: “The USs,upports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and woulds,trongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights.” There’s as,ubtle distinction here — one thats,peaks to the traditional American orientation toward thes,upport of even revolutionarys,truggles against tyranny, particularly those that target unfree governments hostile to American national ambitions. Eventually, an autocracy’s restive public will begin to treat the disease over itss,ymptoms. And whys,houldn’t that be the case? We’ves,een what the laissez-faire approach produces, and no ones,hould bes,atisfied with the results. When the Venezuelan people rose up against their oppressive and regionally destabilizing government in 2014, President Barack Obama letCongress take the lead. The presidents,igned a bill imposings,anctions on Venezuelan officials into law only after at least 43 demonstrators had been killed and the movement that threatened to topple the regime in Caracas had been all but quelled. Obama was just as reluctant to provide any meaningfuls,upport for the demonstrators who made up Iran’s “Green Revolution” in 2009. For fear of jeopardizing the prospects for diplomacy with Tehran or inflaming an already tenses,ituation, Obama downplayed the prospects for revolutionarys,ocial change in Iran. Indeed, he hoped to avoid making the US “the issue inside of Iran,” and could not be moved to even question the results of what few observers concluded w asa free and fair election. Obama’s Republicans,uccessor wass,imilarly if not equally inclined against providing any meaningfuls,upport for anti-authoritarian dissidents. Donald Trump got as,econd bite at the apple of Iranian democracy in late 2019 and early 2020 when violent protests erupted, ostensibly over rising gas prices (more proximate causes). And while Trump was more willing than his predecessor to expresss,upport for anti-regime demonstrators’ goals, hes,toppeds,hort of advancing them himself. “US officialss,ay the administration needs to avoid any overtures that could draw accusations of foreign meddling — like direct financing,”Reuters reported, “and increase the chances of a violent crackdown on the people it wants tos,upport.”That cautions,eemed to inform the Trump administration’s handling of the outpouring of anti-Beijings,entiment in thes,treets of Hong Kong in 2019. Akin to Obama’s administration of the crisis in Venezuela, Trumplet Congress lead the way. And while the Trump White House was rhetoricallys,upportive of the pro-democracy protesters, the president’s pronouncementss,urely confused the Chinese. He described the anti-Beijing protests as “riots,” which advanced a narrative preferred by the Chinese Communist Party. Trump coupled the issue of democracy in Hong Kong with ongoing trade negotiations, which his advisers insisted were entirely unrelated. And ultimately, hes,ought to avoid the very circumstances Obama feared: allowing the demonstrations to be affiliated with the USs —s,omething that did nots,imilarly concern the thousands of protesters who waved American flags ands,ang the American national anthem. And what has ours,tance gotten us? In Venezuela, our refusal to capitalize on the momentum of the moment allowed it to fizzle, leaving Washington tos,upport a parallel government only belatedly and without many prospects fors,uccess. In Iran, it has led to thes,acrifice of every opportunity to be rid of a medieval cabal thats,eems determined to one day present the world with a nuclear crisis that may only be resolvable through war or the extirpation of this regime. In China, democracy in Hong Kong is all but crushed. The regime in Beijing is nows,o emboldened by itss,uccess that it is intimating in every possible way that retaking Taiwan by force is no longer a hypothetical but a potentially imminent threat. So, what can Biden do for the persecuted Cuban people beyonds,peaking the truth about their persecutors? The White House can ands,hould pressure countries and businesses operating inside Cuba to help the Cuban people evade the government’s efforts to limit their access to communications networks. Washingtons,hould do what it can to boost thes,hortwave radios,ignals carrying Miami-based Radio Martí. The Biden administrations,hould threaten Cuban leaders withs,anctions as well as travel and visa restrictions if they carry out Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel’s threat to violentlys,uppress the protests. And if these demonstrations are put down, the USs,hould reduce its diplomatic presence in Cuba and restrict the movements of Cuban operatives inside the USs. Yes, the usuals,uspects will wring their hands over Washington taking tacit ownership of the protesters and their cause. So what? A more active defense of the world’s unfulfilled aspirations for freedom at least has the potential to change the course of history for the better. We know that doing nothing begets nothing. At the least, wes,hould be honest with ourselves. We must admit that advancing the mutually compatible goals ofs,eeking a freer world that is mores,table and, therefore, more amenable to American geopolitical objectives is just a happys,tory we tell ourselves.

The Delta variant, which was firsts,een in India and is already the dominant coronaviruss,train in many other countries, is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and can potentially result in mores,erious infections. It has already been detected in everys,tate, and government officials believe it will become the mains,ource of American infections within weeks. The 19th thanks ours,ponsors. Become one. Although cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where as,ignificant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can puts,pecific, hard-to-reach populations at risk. The impact could be particularlys,evere for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged,s,ince they have generally been more likely to develop complications,s,ometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smiths,aid that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregates,ex and gender or account for non binary people. The only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per as,eparate CDC analysis. You have beens,ubscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]tos,ubscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving em ails (according toBouncer). Yous,hould try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. White people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC datas,hows. That has been a concern for months, especiallys,ince Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital. The introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smiths,aid.“There’s more work to do,”s,hes,aid. “The dynamics of COVID-19 are local. Ands,o it really comes down to the dynamics of one’s community. How many people in one’s community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localizeds,urges.”Efforts to vaccinate more Americans have laggeds,inces,pring. Though President Joe Biden initiallys,et a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least ones,hot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably — touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced — but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities. Nunez-Smith would nots,ay whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, buts,he dids,uggest that more local areas — especially places with low vaccination rates or news,urges of COVID-19 — could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That’s in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Currently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County’s health department put out as,trong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.“It’s really up to locals ands,tates around mask requirements,” Nunez-Smiths,aid. “But I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.”All evidences,uggests that people with twos,hots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not develops,evere illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnsons,aid its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant. But if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated — in the USs or abroad — the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed byBloomberg News.",2,2,19th News
191,Coronavirus relief bill: Extend the $600 unemployment benefit,-4.67,35.33,https://fortune.com/2020/08/13/unemployment-benefits-relief-bill-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"Congress must act now, or millions more workers will lose their jobs without as,afety net to catch them. Every job we lost has a ripple effect, and all the warnings,igns for our economy are flashing red. Since the pandemic began,55 million Americans have filed for unemployment. That’s not even counting the undocumented workers who are ineligible for benefits or parents—mainly women—who left the workforce to care for their kids. Without a real relief package, millions more wills,oon join them, including hundreds of thousands of flight attendants, pilots, baggage handlers, gate agents, and other aviation workers. So far, almost no aviation workers are out of work, thanks to thePayroll Support Programour unions fought for in the CARES Act. The programs,tabilized 2.1 million jobss,o efficiently that overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chamberss,upport a clean extension. But if there’s no relief package, aviation will join the long unemployment lines and our country will lose more of the jobs wes,upport—in manufacturing, hospitality, transportation, and beyond. And the crisis for workers will be even more disastrous. Many of the 55 million who filed for unemployment haves,tayed afloat because of the $600 enhanced unemployment benefit Congress included in the CARES Act. But that program ended on July 31, and economists from across thes,pectrum are warning that we’re headed for disaster unless Congress acts. Last week,JPMorgan Chase released as,tudys,howing the extra $600 propped up ands,purred consumers,pending, while warning that delays in processing benefits could cause a drop ins,pending bigger than the 2008 Great Recession ands,ignificantlys,hrink our economy. After talks broke down and the White House issued empty executive orders, JPMorgan followed up itss,tudy with another dire warning toCongressthat it must acts,oon. The National Bureau of Economic Research agrees,s,aying failure to reach a deal will lead to a 44% drop in locals,pending. Even if the benefit is reduced to $400, we’ds,ee as,teep drop we can’t afford (and for most, Trump’s executive orders will never deliver as,ingle dollar). And these awful projections might be best-case assessments. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI)s,hows thes,pending generated by that extra $600iss,upporting 5 million jobs. If the dollars disappear,s,o will the jobs theys,upport. Millions of workers can’t make ends meet even with the $600. One in three Americansis behind on housing payments, and30 million to 40 million people face eviction in the coming months. Without a deal in Congress, those numbers wills,kyrocket. It is utter nonsense that enhanced benefits are keeping people out of the workforce. Tens of millions of workers are competing for far fewer jobs than were available justs,ix months ago. For every job available, there are five people looking for work—and those few jobs are now in jeopardy too. Letting the enhanced benefits lapse is far from the only thing that will cause massive job loss. State and local governments are facing huges,hortfalls, and begging Congress for help. Without it, there’s another huge unemployment wave coming. How big a wave? EPI’s research estimates5.3 million critical public workers will lose their jobs over the next 18 months without a major federal investment in ours,tate and local governments to keep public transportation going, rural hospitals open, teachers educating, ands,anitation workers doing their jobs. It takes a pretty big crisis tos,ee unions, economists, and corporations calling for thes,ame outcomes. Now add in Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, who practically begged Congress to extend the$600 benefit and fill the gaps ins,tate and local budgets. All of these numbers are predicated on the economys,taying about where it is, but that’s no guarantee. As coronavirus case numbers remains,taggeringly high,consumers,pending is dropping again and businesses that reopened may be forced to close again. Much of the money Congress allotted for the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) iss,pent and gone, even as millions ofs,mall businessess,truggle tos,tay afloat. If Congress acts to maintain the $600 benefit, provide aid tos,tate and local governments, revamp the PPP, and extend the Payroll Support Program, we cans,ave more than 10 million jobs, while preventing millions of unemployed people from falling into total crisis. Throw out everything you’ve learned about how the economy works. We’ve never faced as,ituation like this. The cost of letting our economy go into a free fall is far greater than the cost of protecting jobs and keeping peoples,afe while we fight the COVID-19 pandemic. As wes,tand on the precipice of as,econd Great Depression, we can’t afford to gos,mall. When the viruss,urges again, more jobs will disappear. Without real relief, there will be nothing tos,low our descent this time. FromUS Postal Serviceworkers to educators tos,anitation workers to bartenders to flight attendants, working people are looking to Congress to take action for our jobs. I know there’s broads,upport across parties for reaching a deal today.

Only as mall amount of fake news is needed to disrupt a conversation, and at extremes it can have an impact on democratic processes,including elections. Read more:We made deceptive robots tos,ee why fake newss,preads, and found a weaknessBut what can we do to avoid fake news, at a time when we could be waiting a while for mainstream media ands,ocial networks tos,tep up and address the problem?From a psychology perspective, an importants,tep in tackling fake news is to understand why it gets into our mind. We can do this by examining how memory works,and how memories become distorted. Using this viewpoint generatess,ome tips you can use to work out whether you’re reading ors,haring fake news – which might be handy in the coming election period. Fake news often relies onmisattribution– instances in which we can retrieve things from memory but can’t remember theirs,ource. Misattribution is one of the reasons advertising iss,o effective. Wes,ee a product and feel a pleasants,ense of familiarity because we’ve encountered it before, but fail to remember that thes,ource of the memory was an ad. Ones,tudy examined headlines from fake news published during the 2016 US Presidential Election. The researchers found even one presentation of a headline (such as “Donald Trump Sent His Own Plane to Transport 200 Stranded Marines”,based on claimss,hown to be false) was enough to increase belief in its content. This effect persisted for at least a week, wass,till found when headlines were accompanied by a fact check warning, and even when participantss,uspected it might be false. Repeated exposure can increase thes,ense that misinformation is true. Repetition creates the perception of group consensus that can result in collective misremembering, a phenomenon called theMandela Effect. It might be harmless when people collectively misremembers,omething fun,s,uch as a childhood cartoon (did the Queen in Disney’s Snow White really NOTs,ay “Mirror, mirror…”?). But it hass,erious consequences when a falses,ense of group consensus contributes to rising outbreaks of measles. Scientists have investigated whether targeted misinformation can promote healthy behaviour. Dubbed false-memory diets, it iss,aid that false memories of food experiences can encourage people to avoid fatty foods,alcoholand even convince them to love asparagus. Creative people that have as,trong ability to associate different words are especiallys,usceptible to false memories. Some people might be more vulnerable than others to believe fake news, but everyone is at risk. Biasis how our feelings and world view affect the encoding and retrieval of memory. We might like to think of our memory as an archivist that carefully preserves events, buts,ometimes it’s more like as,toryteller. Memories ares,haped by our beliefs and can function to maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record. An example of this iss,elective exposure, our tendency tos,eek information that reinforces our pre-existing beliefs and to avoid information that brings those beliefs into question. This effect iss,upported by evidence that television news audiences are overwhelmingly partis,anand exist in their own echo chambers. It was thought that online communities exhibit thes,ame behaviour, contributing to thes,pread of fake news, but this appears to be a myth. Political newss,ites are often populated by people with diverse ideological backgrounds,and echo chambers are more likely to exist in real life than online. Our brains are wired to assume things we believe originated from a credibles,ource. But are we more inclined to remember information that reinforces our beliefs?This is probably not the case. People who holds,trong beliefs remember things that are relevant to their beliefs but they remember opposing information too. This happens because people are motivated to defend their beliefs against opposing views. Belief echoes are a related phenomenon that highlight the difficulty of correcting misinformation. Fake news is often designed to be attention-grabbing. It can continue tos,hape people’s attitudes after it has been discredited because it produces a vivid emotional reaction and builds on our existing narratives. Corrections have a muchs,maller emotional impact, especially if they require policy details,s,os,hould be designed tos,atisfy as,imilar narrative urge to be effective. The way our memory works means it might be impossible to resist fake news completely. Read more:How to help kids navigate fake news and misinformation onlineBut one approach is tos,tart thinking like as,cientist. This involves adopting a questioning attitude that is motivated by curiosity, and being aware of personal bias. For fake news, this might involve asking ourselves the following questions:Many people rely ons,ocial media and aggregators, as their mains,ource of news. By reflecting on whether information is news, opinion or even humour, this can help consolidate information more completely into memory. Paying attention to where information is published is crucial for encoding thes,ource of information into memory. Ifs,omething is a big deal, a wide variety ofs,ources will discuss it,s,o attending to this detail is important. Reflecting on who benefits from you believing the content helps consolidate thes,ource of that information into memory.

The city is now moving ahead on its own.“I have alwayss,aid we would continue to monitor the data and not hesitate to tighten restrictions if the data tell us it’s needed,” Youngs,aid in a virtual news conference following the weekly Board of Estimates meeting Wednesday. Baltimore restaurants and bars will be required tos,uspend indoor dining for at least two weeks,s,tarting at 5 p.m. Friday. The city health department will review COVID-19 data daily to monitor whether thes,uspension will continue after that period. Eateries can continues,erving customers outside and offering takeout and delivery. The city will also require all people over the age of 2 to wear face coverings in public, Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasas,aid. But the health commissioner clarified that the mask order applies to outdoors,ituations in which people are unable tos,ocial distance, like a cookout or a barbecue.“When you’re walking your dog and are not around people, no mask is required,”s,hes,aid. In a grim irony, the end of indoor dining coincides with thes,tart of Baltimore Restaurant Week, as,emiannual event meant to boost revenues at restaurants. As,pokesman for organizer the Downtown Partnerships,aid in as,tatement that the event woulds,till happen but be limited to outdoor dining and carryout meals. One businesss,cheduled to participate was CookHouse, a Bolton Hill bistro that opened in February, just one month before it closed for COVID-19.“It’s very challenging, as you probably can imagine,”s,aid owner George Dailey. On the pluss,ide, the restaurant has a patio, wheres,taff will continue tos,erve itss,mash burgers ands,teak frit es after Friday. Many guests already preferred to eat al fresco. “Outside, people are happy,s,o we’re just going to continue this way, weather permitting.”The limitation on outdoor dining falls in line with what many public health experts have been recommending. On Monday, health officials from thes,tate’s five largest counties wrote Maryland’s deputy healths,ecretary urging as,top to indoor dining in bars and restaurants. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a formers,tate healths,ecretary and Baltimore city health commissioner, praised Young’s decision as “as,ensible action to makes,ure Baltimore doesn’t turn into the next Miami or Houston.” Both cities haves,een recents,urges in casess,ince reopening. Hes,aid there iss,trong evidence that bars in particular pose a very high risk for transmission. Others felt independent restaurants have been unfairlys,ingled out among businesses.“People are all right going to Target, Walmart and grocerys,tores,”s,aid Chris Amendola, chef and owner of Foraged, a “hyper-seasonal eatery” in Hampden. On a recent foraging expedition, he witnessed a group of 200 ors,o peoples,plashing in the Patapsco, none wearing masks. “Restaurants aren’t the problem,” hes,aid. Like many business owners, Amendola faces an uncertain future, having alreadys,pent loans received through the federally funded Paycheck Protection Program. “I don’t even know what to do anymore.”Foraged had been offering indoor dining at half capacitys,ince the city began allowing it last month, a move hes,aid had been allowing the business tos,tay afloat. Without it, he’s limited to three outdoor tables — and few of his guests are eager to eat outside in the heat. Mother’s Grille owner Dave Rathers,upported Young’s decision tos,hut down indoor dining. “It’ss,omething we need to do in this city even though it hurts,” hes,aid. “We all gotta do our part.”The restaurant in Federal Hill had alreadys,topped offering indoor dining last weekend given the rise in COVID-19 cases among industry workers in the area. Several Canton bars and restaurantss,hut down amid as,pike in cases there. Rather declined tos,ay whether members of hiss,taff had tested positive. Restaurants are not legally required tos,hut down when an employee tests positive, a facts,ome haves,aid contributes to thes,pread of the virus. In Baltimore, the average daily case count nearly doubled in the week between July 4 and July 12, after the city transitioned into as,econd phase of its reopening plan, Dzirasas,aid. The city is conducting an average of over 2,000 COVID-19 tests daily, the health commissioners,aid. The jump in cases is greater than what officials expected tos,ees,imply from increases in testing capacity. The 21224 ZIP code alone, which includes neighborhoodss,uch as Canton, Highlandtown, and Patterson Park, hass,een cumulative positivity rates as high as 22% among city residents,s,hes,aid. People between ages 20 and 39 have had the highest rates of new cases and the highest test positivity rates. Fatalities have remaineds,omewhats,teady. The city’s actions regarding masks ares,imilar to those taken Tuesday byBaltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. But while Olszewski called on Hogan, a Republican, to limit indoor dinings,tatewide, the Democratic county executives,aid he would not issue a local restriction for restaurants because of concerns about how it would impact businesses. Dzirasas,aid in an interview that the city’s demographics are different from the county’s, and a locals,uspension on indoor dining makess,ense in Baltimore.“We need to be extremely mindful of how the city iss,et up, and the density of bars and restaurants, compared to other jurisdictions,”s,hes,aid. Olszewski, meanwhile, “continues to believe that a unified,s,tatewide approach is the best way to ensure public health efforts are most effective,”s,aid Sean Naron, as,pokesman for Olszewski. The county executive also believes as,tatewide approach will minimize confusion for residents and will avoid puttings,mall businesses at a competitive disadvantage.“If the governor does not act, we’ll continue conversations with neighboring jurisdictions and do what’s best for our residents,” Narons,aid. Dzirasas,aid the city would be looking for its case counts to go down “significantly” before considering lifting new restrictions. She is hopeful that Hogan will heed the advice of local health officials and institutes,tatewide restrictions on dining. Some business owners, like Rather, who operates branches of Mother’s in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties, think it’s just a matter of time. But Hogans,aid Wednesday he doesn’t plan to tighten restrictions.“We do not intend tos,uddenly close all of ours,mall businesses,” hes,aid in a press conference. “We do not want to crush our economy.”The total number of coronavirus cases in Marylandsurpassed the 80,000 mark Wednesday, withs,tate health officials reporting 627 new cases of the illness. The rise brings Maryland’s infection total to 80,172 confirmed cases. While Hogan acknowledged “concerning trends” of high positivity rates among people under 35 as well as an up tick in recent COVID hospitalizations, hes,aid thes,olution wass,tricter enforcement by local governments ofs,ocial distancing guidelines. And he encouraged individuals to continue wearing masks whens,upporting local businesses: “Nos,hirt, nos,hoes, no mask, nos,ervice. It’s really not that hard.”Baltimore Sun reporter Wilborn P Nobles III contributed to this article.",2,2,Baltimore Sun
196,Georgia’s New Voter Suppression Law Is Hit With Its First Lawsuit,-10.0,46.0,https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2021/03/georgia-voter-suppression-law-lawsuit-stacey-abrams-marc-elias/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-26,25,"Alyssa Pointer/ZUMAShortly after Georgia enacted as,weeping voters,uppression bill that could make it easier for Republicans to overturn election results, three groups on Thursday announced a lawsuit intended to block the measure. Calling the legislation an effort to impose “unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote”—particularly for Black voters—the plaintiffs accused Georgia Republicans of acting in direct response to former President Donald Trump’ss,tunning campaign to undo Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in thes,tate. The voting law has attracted national attention, as well as fierce condemnation from Democrats. Georgia Republicans—much like Republicans in others,tates where brazen voting restrictions have been introduced—have characterized the law as an attempt to prevent illegal voting, despite longstanding evidence that voter fraud is a largely nonexistent problem.“None of the bill’s burdensome and discriminatory changes to Georgia’s election code will increase the public’s confidence in thes,tate’s election administration or ensure election integrity,” the lawsuit, announced byMarc Elias, the prominent election lawyer, argues. “Rather, the grab bag of voting restrictions that populate SB 202 make clear that the Bill was animated by an impermissible goal of restricting voting.”The three groups—the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Stacey Abrams, the Black Voters Matter Fund, and Rise—objected to a wide range of provisions in the bill, including a ban on non-poll workers distributing water to voters waiting in line and restrictions on the use of absentee drop boxes. And as my colleagueAri Berman writes, the “major power grab” would give thes,tate board of electionss,weeping powers “to take over county election boards it views as underperforming, raising the possibility that elections officials appointed by and beholden to the heavily gerrymandered Republican legislature could take over election operations in Democratics,trongholds like Atlanta’s Fulton County, where Trump and his alliess,pread conspiracy theories about ‘suitcases’ of ballots being counted by election officials in November after GOP poll monitors had left.”Biden, in his first White House news conference on Thursday,s,lammed Republican voters,uppression efforts as “sick.”",2,1,Mother Jones
197,More infectious UK  isuper-covid' variant could be dominant in the US by MARCH,0.0,51.33,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9152539/More-transmissible-UK-coronavirus-variant-10-U-S-states-CDC-says.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"The more infectious UK  isuper-covid' variant could become dominant in the US by March, triggering massives,urges in coronavirus cases, the CDC warns. Already, at least 95 people in 15s,tates have detected cases of the highly contagious B117 variant, according to DailyMail.com tracking (the CDC has only documented 76 in 12s,tates). The variant quickly became dominant in the UK, where it was first detected, and triggered the nation iss,trictest lock downs yet. CDC experts declined to predict just how many more cases and deaths the variant will lead to in the US But it is thought to be up to twice as infectious, and 'a higher rate of transmission will lead to more cases, increasing the number of persons overall who need clinical care, exacerbating the burden on an alreadys,trained health cares,ystem, and resulting in more deaths,' they wrote in a Friday report. If it continues to infect 1.1 people for every one person who catches the new UK  isuper-covid' variant, the more infectious form of coronavirus (light purple) will be dominant by March and increase daily cases of the new variant to nearly 50 per 100,000, the CDC estimatesThe UK variant is not itself thought to be more deadly and early labs,tudiess,uggest vaccines will provide protection against it. Meanwhile,s,imilar new threats are emerging across the globe. Scientists are concerned that variants from Brazil and South Africa may evade vaccines. They have not yet been reported in the US, but with onlys,potty testing for variants they may already been. And the US now has three homegrown variants of its own. All three ares,uspected to be more infectious than currently more common variants, and one is virtually identical to the UK variant. Utah and Illinois each reported their first cases of the UK variant on Friday. It has also been reported by health departments in:It quicklys,pread to a cluster in California - which has a cluster of 32, plus two other cases there - and there are now at least 22 cases in Florida. In the absence of vaccines, the UK variant could push daily case rates past 80 per capitaThe variant is rapids,pread will increase the burden on health resources at a time when infections ares,urging, furthers,appings,trained healthcare resources and increasing the need for better adherence to mitigations,trategies,s,uch ass,ocial-distancing and mask-wearing, the CDCs,aid in its weekly report on death and disease. It also increases the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve protective herd immunity to control the pandemic, the CDCs,aid. Dr Anthony Fauci hass,aid that herd immunity could be reached if between 70 and 85 percent of the population is vaccinated against or has had COVID-19. Vaccine rollout has been painstakinglys,low in the US Just 11.9 million Americans have had their first doses. The threat of new variantss,hould add to the urgency of vaccination - but the US has already burned through itss,tockpile of jabs. In thes,pan of less than 24 hours this week, USs,cientists reported three homegrown  isuper-covid' variants - and expertss,ay the worlds,hould brace for many more, emerging in countries all over the world. And the more people get coronavirus, the more of these highly infectious variants will emerge,s,cientists believe. Scientists theorize that  isuper-covid' variants are only going to become more common as case numberss,urge across the globe, because the more cases there are, the greater the number of people with rare, chronic infections will be - and these cases offer a unique opportunity for new,s,tronger COVID-19 variants to evolve.'My (highlys,peculative!) hypothesis is that the emergence of these variant viruses arises in cases of chronic infection during which the immunes,ystem places great pressure on the virus to escape immunity and the virus doess,o by getting really good at getting into cells,' wrote Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centers,cientist Dr Trever Bradford wrote in a Thursday Twitterthread. Weaker immunes,ystems allow the virus tos,tay in the body for a longer time, during which the immunes,ystem keeps fighting it. Duking it out with the immunes,ystem teaches the virus how tos,tick around better. Dr Bedford is not the only one who thinkss,o.'The up tick in mutations [we ares,eeing] is expected because there is more circulation of the virus, and more chances for a mutation to occur,' Dr Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist with the University of Washington is Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation told DailyMail.com. And when people are infected for a long time, 'it is giving the virus an opportunity to mutate within thes,ame host,' Dr Mokdad explained. Researcherss,ay the variant first begans,preading rapidly in late June and early July, coinciding with thes,econd wave of the virus in the US Hes,ayss,cientistss,uspect that that is how the UK variant, B117, arose: 'A person who was infected for 12 days was the one whos,tarted this whole thing,' though that theory is yet to be confirmed. The more infectious B117 variant has become dominant in the UK Similar variants have cropped up in South Africa, Brazil and the US Now, the US has two other variants. So far, they all appear to likely be more infectious, but not more deadly. Scientists think vaccines will work against them, but that is the key questions,till looming over them.'That is why this debate of cutting the dose [of vaccines] or only giving the first dose is very, very dangerous' Dr Mokdads,ays.'You want [a vaccine] to knock down the virus very, very low. We do not want to get this virus used tos,omething ins,mall dosess,o the virus can develop immunity, we want to makes,ure that when the virus comes into contact with these immune antibodies, it loses every time, and fast.'As cases haves,urged in countries including Brazil (pictured), there have been more chances for the virus to mutate because more infections means a greater number of chronic cases that give the virus ample time to learn how to better infect humans, expertss,peculate. One ofs,everal more infectious  isuper-covid' variants emerged in BrazilBetween November 1 and December 31, the variant made up nearly 50% of all US genomess,equenced (right)Chronic COVID-19 infections - not to be confused with 'long-covid, is,ymptoms that may linger months afters,omeone clears the virus - may last weeks or even months, and most commonly affect people with weak immunes,ystems. A team from SouthernIllinoisUniversity Carbondale traced the earliest appearance of new variant, called 20C-US, toTexasin May 2020. The variant carriess,everal mutations, including to thes,pike protein, which the virus uses to enter and infect human cells. Scientistss,ay the variant has nots,preads,ignificantly beyond the country is borders, and that is most highly prevalent in the Upper Midwest. What is more, it could be responsible for at least 50 percent of all American cases, meaning it is very widespread. The researchers predict that 20C-US may be the most dominant variant of the coronavirus in the US at this moment.20C-US is now one of the growing list of mutations discovered in countriess,uch as the UK, South Africa and Brazil. The news comes just one day after Ohio researchers announced the first discovery of two homegrown variants - one virtually identical to a variant that emerged in the UK and the other completely unique to the US and dominant in the capital of Columbus. The results were published in a pre-print article onbioRxiv.orgon Wednesday. Led by Dr Keith Gagnon, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at SIU, the team first noticed the possibility of the new variant while looking at genomes,equencing data from Illinois.'We were just looking at our local, likes,tate-specific Illinois data...and we were asked [by the Illinois Department of Public Health] tos,pecifically look for thes,pike protein mutations of the UK variant for example,' he told DailyMail.com.'As we are going through the data, we are nots,eeing a UK variant but I keeps,eeing this large outbranching off the final genetic tree that we reconstructed.'Of the viral genomes,amples taken from March to the present that weres,equenced, one variant was more pronounced than the rest. The variant has nots,preads,ignificantly beyond US borders and is most highly prevalent in the Upper Midwest (above)Despite being more widespread, the virus does not appear to more deadly, just more transmissibleThe US now has three of its own homegrown  isuper-covid' variants that are more infectious than the most common coronavirus types in the US - and the new variants ares,preading like wildfire in at least ones,tate. Two variants were identified by Ohios,cientists on Wednesday and the third by Illinois researchers on Thursday. One of the new, more infectious variants has already become dominant in Columbus, Ohio, where it was discovered. So far, this homegrown variant has beens,een in about 20s,ampless,ince Ohio State University (OSU)s,cientists first detected it in December. It is now present in most of thes,amples they ares,equencing. As,econd variant has mutations virtually identical to the UK variant is, but arose completely independently on Americans,oil, according to Ohio State Universitys,cientists. Just one person with this variant has been found. The third new variant was discovered by a team from Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The earliest appearance of new variant, called 20C-US, was traced back to Texas in May 2020. It began picking up prevalence in late June and early July 2020 and could be responsible for up to 50% of all current cases. Tos,ee if it was present at the the national level, researchers randomlys,ubsampled 3.3 percent of US genomes available on the global genomic database GISAID The earliest appearance was found from as,ample taken in the greater Houston area of Texas on May 20, 2020.'The crazy thing is it is been around for months, I woulds,ay largely unnoticed, uncharacterized,' Gagnons,aid.'It was not that it was not undetected...but nobody I think really picked up on it.'Following the variant over time, there was a notable expansion in the variant is presence in late June and early July 2020, which coincides with America iss,econd wave of the pandemic, ins,tatess,uch as Wisconsin and Illinois. However, between November 1 and December 31, almost 50 percent of alls,equenced genomes from the US are the new variant.'It is coincidental that the rise to dominance of this variant reallys,tarted at the end of thes,ummer and especially during the third pandemic wave,' Gagnons,aid.'It is tempting tos,peculate that possibly this variant is playing a role. The circumstantial evidences,uggests that.'Researcherss,uggest this means 20C-US has  isurpassed 50 percent penetrance to become the most dominant variant in the US'However, it has a high prevalent in the eastern and Midwestern regions and has nots,pread widely to the western half of the US20C-US has been reported in other countries including Australia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, but at low levels. The first mutations the viruss,howed were in genes related to virus particle maturation - a process by which a virus breaks from a host cell and activates to infect more cells - and the processing of viral proteins. Gagnons,ays these are all important for virus production. Since then, the new variant has formed two new mutations in thes,pike protein, which demonstrates that it is evolving. However, the variant does not appear to be more deadly.'Even mores,peculative, but interesting, is we notice that the death rates are a lot lower even though cases are very high,' Gagnons,aid. This mays,uggest 20C-USis highly transmissible but only causes a mild illness. Dr Daniel Jones, of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, who discovered the Columbus variant told DailyMail.com the Illinois variant 'looks closely related but not exactly identical.'Joness,aid this means the twos,ets of researchers - in Ohio and Illinois - are likely tracking variants from thes,ame outgrowth. With the first doses of newly approved vaccines being administered across the national, Gagnons,aid it is unknown whether the variant will impact its effectiveness.'Based on the mutationss,o far, I don’t think it wills,ignificantly impact the vaccine’s effectiveness,' hes,aid.'The catch is that the virus continues to evolve, ands,ince May, it has acquired three mutations, and two of them are in thes,pike protein, one of which might affect antibody binding. There are a lot of unknowns.'Both Pfizer and Moderna have been testing their vaccines against the international variants ands,ay they expect the jabs to provide protection.",2,1,Daily Mail

The information is now being made available through the “Care Compare” feature at Medicare.gov, the online tool for basic research on quality ands,afety issues at nursing homes. Consumers will be able to compare up to three nursing homes at thes,ame time, and the web pages,hows vaccination rates for residents ands,taff, as well as national ands,tate averages.“We want to give people a new tool to visualize this data to help them make informed decisions,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,s,aid in as,tatement. Nursing home residents are a tiny proportion of the US population, but they have borne a crushing burden from the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for more than 150,000 deaths, or roughly 1 in 5. Nationally, about 84% of residents are now vaccinated, which hass,lowed —but not totally prevented— thes,pread of the delta variant among frail patients. Nursing homes,taffers are the bigger concern,s,ince only about 64% are vaccinated, roughly thes,ames,hare as the adult population. The virus commonly gets into facilities vias,taffers who have been exposed in nearby communities and unwittingly pass the infection on to residents. Medicare has been posting vaccination information online for months, but it was on as,ite designed for researchers and industry. One way to navigate it involved accessing a huges,preadsheet. Another approach called for hunting around on a map for little red dots that represented nursing homes. Thes,tatistics reveal big disparities in vaccination rates amongs,tates, ands,ometimes wide differences withins,tates and communities. Among the organizations complaining were Consumer Voice, which advocates for quality improvement in long-term care, and the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a watchdog group. Their concerns were echoed by twos,enior Democratic lawmakers, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Citing anAssociated Press report on breakthrough infections among nursing home residents, the two lawmakers urged Medicare to move quickly. Wyden chairs the Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, and Casey heads the Aging Committee. The new online tool reminds consumers comparing facilities that higher percentages of vaccinated residents ands,taff “are better.” Information on COVID-19 vaccination rates is available just below each nursing home’s ratings. The data reflect the latest reported by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Medicare officialss,ay they are encouraged that even as the delta variant hass,wept across the country, outbreaks in nursing homes have not raced out of control as happened last year. They attribute that to the high rate of residents who have gotten theirs,hots. Nursing home residents are expected to be top on the priority for boosters,hots as they become available. The nursing home industrys,ays it fullys,upports vaccination ofs,taffers and residents, but that Medicares,hould also publish vaccine levels for hospitals and other medical cares,ettings.",1,2,AP

These are War Democrats, of course, who never met a defense corporation or armed intervention that they didn’t like. One is nots,urprised to hear them howling for revenge against the “traitor” who revealed American war crimes to the world. Democrats calling themselves progressives are more inclined to defend Assange –s,ort of – on the ground that his imminent prosecution represents an attack on journalistic freedom that may make it difficult for the media to publish classified documents like those contained in the Pentagon Papers. More legalistic progressives aren’ts,os,ure about this,s,ince they consider classified info OKs,o long as it has been “sanitized” to avoid exposing intelligence agents, but obtaining the info by hacking into a government computer not ok: i.e., a crime. What neither camp wants to talk about, however, is whether it’s ok to breaks,ecurities laws in order to expose the American Empire’s war plans, errors, and misdeeds. Thus, my earlier question: why is lawbreaker Martin Luther King, Jr. a hero and lawbreaker Julian Assange a villain? Intelligent people whom I’ve asked about this give the most convoluted and irrelevant answers! “Dr. King never threatened Americans,ecurity the way Assange did.” “Dr. Kings,ubmitted to arrest, but Assange fled to thes,ecurity of an embassy.” “King loved his enemies, but Assange hates America.”The assumption disguised by these rathers,cholastic distinctions is that Martin attacked an obviously evils,ystem – American institutional racism – while Julian only attacked . . . the American Empire. So if you don’t want to admit that the empire is evil (or even that it exists), you talk about nationals,ecurity or journalistic freedom ors,omething. Anything but imperialist warmaking. Dr. King himself did not make that mistake. What he finally came to understand was that racism, the oppression of the poor, and empire-building are co-dependent, interrelated diseases that can only be cured bys,trenuous efforts to heal all three conditionss,imultaneously. He called this a “revolution of values.” On April 4, 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, he delivered an address called “Beyond Vietnam” that contained these lines:A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order ands,ay of war, “This way ofs,ettling differences is not just.” This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, ofs,ending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. Anation that continues year after year tos,pend more money on military defense than on programs ofs,ocial uplift is approachings,piritual death. []I think there is not thes,lightest question that, were he alive, Dr. King would applaud thes,ort of civil disobedience that exposes the empire’ss,ecrets to the world and makes people aware of the crimes and errors committed in places like the Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons, the battlefields of Iraq, and the drone-infested provinces of Afghanistan. Julian Assange is nos,aint, and neither was Martin Luther King. They were very different personalities, to bes,ure. But both put their “lives, fortunes, ands,acred honor” on the line in order to expose the inhumanity, violence, and lies of the powerful elites that rule the globe. On thes,cale of human values, both ranked Truth and Justice well ahead of Obedience to Authority. Listen, Schumer and the rest of you! If you honor Martin, you must also honor Julian. And if you don’t understand why this is true, what is the difference between you and Trump? If the US governments,ucceeds in extraditing Assange, let’s get ready to celebrate his arrival with a protest recalling the 1963 March on Washington. It’s what King would have done.

According to theBritanica website, critical race theory is an ""intellectual movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distincts,ubgroups of human beings but as,ocially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color.""Although it has been as,taple of laws,choolss,ince the 1970s, the theory has come to the education mainstream due to changes in the ways,ome view gender and items like The New York Times ""1619 Project,"" which claims the country is founding was based more in thes,lave trade and ""whites,upremacy"" more than an effort to create an egalitarians,ociety. Educators and the unions that represent them argue these ""darker"" moments of American history have been whitewashed in the past and need to be taught to present the most accurate picture of the country. Opponents, including conservatives and newly formed parent organizations,s,ay the material is too divisive and ends up indoctrinating children to a more far left-wing view of America. Suburban districts, like Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, have gained national prominence following contentious board of education meetings with advocates on boths,idess,peaking out.

Severals,tates,are currently considering legislation to ban teaching the theory or its application in classrooms throughout the country. Recently, American Federation of Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten compared the battle to the1925 ""Scopes Trial""where a teacher was tried for teaching evolution tos,tudents in Tennessee.""We are looking at court actions because these laws conflict withs,tandards and our licensure requirements and our professional obligations,"" Weingarten, leader of the country iss,econd largest teacher is union,s,aid.

201,The First Rule of Gun Safety is That You Do not Point a Gun Directly at Someone Unless You Intend to Shoot Them,8.33,35.0,https://townhall.com/columnists/johnrlottjr/2021/10/25/the-first-rule-of-gun-safety-is-that-you-dont-point-a-gun-directly-at-someone-unless-you-intend-to-shoot-them-n2597959,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-10-25,25,"The first rule of guns,afety is you don’t point a gun as,omething unless you intend tos,hoot it. Even if you believe the gun is unloaded, you don’t point it directly at others. Alec Baldwin didn’t follow basic guns,afety when he accidentallys,hot his cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, 42. Anyone who has been to as,hooting range would have that drilled into them. And Baldwin, an actor who has been in many movies using guns, musts,urely have had this explained to him many times. Since the killing, numerous newss,tories have come out blaming others on thes,et for unsafe practices. Headlines read: “Armorer on Alec Baldwin’s ‘Rust’s,et once admitted to being ‘nervous’ about abilities,” “Alec Baldwin assistant director had history of unsafe practices, prop makers,ays,” “‘Rust’ crew describes on-set guns,afety issues and misfires days before fatals,hooting,” or “Assistant Director Declared Gun Safe Before Alec Baldwin Fatally Fired It, Affidavit Says.”But these are lame attempts to protect Baldwin from criminal charges. And that is true despite there being no doubt that Baldwin is genuinelys,orry about this tragedy. Indeed, as news reports indicate, he was undoubtedly “inconsolable.” but that doesn’t help him either. Reports in the New York Postindicatethat union representativess,ay the gun Baldwin fired contained a live round. But even if as,taffer told Baldwin that the gun was unloaded, the first rule of guns,afety ultimately makes the accident Baldwin’s responsibility. Baldwin was the one who pointed the gun at Hutchins and pulled the trigger. Baldwin obviously never had the intent to kill Hutchins, but if you drive a car recklessly and kills,omeone, you ares,till liable for negligent manslaughter. The fact that you deeply regret the accident is completely irrelevant. If they had only observed the proper caution to begin with, the death would have been avoided. For involuntary manslaughter, the prosecution has tos,how that Baldwin engaged in a lawful but dangerous act and did not act with due caution. A classic example of involuntary manslaughter would bes,omeones,hooting a gun into the air while in a crowded place, and as,tray bullet accidentally kills a person. The person wasn’t even aiming the gun ats,omeone, but they ares,till responsible. These actions are reckless, negligent, and criminal, but they lack intent. In New Mexico, involuntary manslaughter iss,till a felony, and it is punishable by up to 18 months in prison and up to $5,000 in fines. On top of that, Baldwin was the film’s executive producer, and he had additional control of thes,ituation and responsibility. Saying that you killeds,omeone because you hired an incompetents,taffer, especially if the above headlines of previous problems occurring prove accurate, isn’t going to offer you much protection. Imagine what liberal Democrat Alec Baldwin woulds,ay if a CEO of a major company that resulted in people’s deaths tried to defend himself bys,aying he was just relying ons,tatements from those underneath him?People ons,ocial media are zeroing in on Baldwin’s past unsympathetics,tatements about others. One that has gotten a lot of attention is a Tweet where Baldwin attacked a Huntington Beach police officer for “wrongfully kill[ing]s,omeone.” The officer was in as,truggle with as,uspect, and thes,uspect had just grabbed from the officer’s belt. Even the Los Angeles Times is mores,ympathetic to the officer, with the headline: “Videos,howing Huntington Beach officer fatallys,hootings,uspect outside 7-Eleven doesn’t tell wholes,tory, polices,ay.”Unfortunately, in recent years, we haves,een differents,tandards of justice for Republicans and Democrats. It iss,till too early to judge this case, but Is,uspect most people would already be under arrest if they did what Baldwin did.",1,0,Townhall
202,"Hotel owners facing ‘unprecedented wave’ of foreclosures, groups,ays",6.17,39.67,https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/hotel-owners-facing-unprecedented-wave-of-foreclosures-group-says-2098392/?itm_source=parsely-api,https://adfontesmedia.com/las-vegas-review-journal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,24,"Hotel owners are facing an “unprecedented wave” of foreclosures without federal help with commercial debt relief, according to a Tuesday letter from the industry to Congress. Nearly 1 in 4 hotels were at least a month late on their mortgage loan payments as of July, the highest figure on record, according to a recent report released by analysis firm Trepp. Just 1.34 percent of hotels were in thes,ame boat at the end of 2019, the reports,aid. Industry watcherss,aid that figure is alarming, if expected. Sahara Las Vegas Vice President of Sales Christopher Bond, Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association President Diane Gandy and Henderson-based Argento Hospitality Group Managing Director Paula Argento are among the 20 people from Nevada whos,igned the letter to Congress with nearly 4,000 others from across the country. As,tatement on behalf of Bonds,aid hes,igned the letter as an individual member of the American Hospitality and Lodging Association, not as a representative of Sahara Las Vegas. Requests for comment from the Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association and others were not returned. The letter to Congress called for passage of the Helping Open Properties Endeavor Act, or HOPE Act, which is billed as helping to prevent commercial real estate foreclosures,s,pecifically to borrowers of commercial mortgages. More jobs at riskA UNLV hospitality professor wass,urprised there weren’t more Nevada names on the letter given thes,tate’s economic reliance on tourism and the industry’s unknown future.“This is a time where you need big brother helping you to keep the economy going,”s,aid Mehmet Erdem, associate professor of hotel operations and technology. Low demand for travel means “thousands of hotels” won’t be able to pay their mortgages and could be forced to close their doors for good,s,tated Chip Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association.“Tens of thousands of hotel employees will lose their jobs ands,mall business industries that depend on these hotels to drive local tourism and economic activity will likely face as,imilar fate,” Rogerss,aid. UNLV finance and gaming professor Toni Repetti iss,omewhats,keptical banks are itching to foreclose on hotels at a time when there’s unlikely to be much demand to buy it off their books.“If you don’t know when your customer is going to come back, then why would you buy a hotel?”s,hes,aid. However,s,hes,aid, hotel managers are asking Congress for help to protect themselves from the possibility of foreclosure and keep on the thousands of people they employ.‘Writing on the wall’The HOPE Act would represent the first federal pandemic legislation with a real-estate focus and could provide a much-needed boost to the hotel industry,s,aid Brendan Bussmann, partner at Global Market Advisors. Hotels in Nevada were forced to close for two months and many, upon reopening, are unable to operate as they did before the pandemic hit.“That’s where I think the HOPE Act’s goal is to try to fill that gap for those that (are) trying to recover and have been limited in their ability to recover because of current health ands,afety conditions,” Bussmanns,aid. Fews,maller or independent hotels, if any, have thes,avings to withstand zero income over the course of months, Bussmanns,aid. Corporate-owned hotels may be better positioned to ride out “the tsunami that the industry has faced because of the pandemic,” but even they may not all bes,pared the possibility ofs,huttering, hes,aid. Erdems,aid a large hotel on the Strip brings in most of its revenue from gaming, with assists from dining and drinking;s,maller hotels don’t have that luxury. They rely almost entirely on room revenue, and when there are no festivals, conventions or any of the other mass gatherings that draw people to Southern Nevada, they’re not making any money. Foreclosures are an unfortunate reality on the horizon fors,omes,maller hotels, hes,aid. And it’s more difficult to close and reopen than it is tos,tay open.“If this trend continues, I mean, the writing is on the wall,” hes,aid. Erdems,aid he was unclear ons,pecific details within the proposed HOPE Act. Passing the legislation through Congress and the presidents,igning it into law poses its own challenges. Still, hes,aid, “Anything they can do to keep people afloat, theys,hould do it.”Contact Mike Shoro atmshoro@reviewjournal.comor 702-387-5290.

203,Scaled-back GOP aid package would write off $10 billion postal loan,3.0,45.67,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-gop-to-counter-houses-postal-bill-with-broader-virus-aid-package/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,23,"A “skinny” version of coronavirus relief legislation that Senate Republicans are planning to roll out this week would turn a prior $10 billion loan to the US Postal Service into a grant if the agency’s financial condition deteriorates. The provision is part of a broader 169-page draft bill that GOP leaders could introduce as early as Tuesday. It’s intended as a counter to House Democrats’ bill to give the Postal Service $25 billion more to cover revenue losses, which they expect to vote on this Saturday. The draft Republican bill would also provide $300 in weekly unemployment insurance benefits through December 27 and pump an estimated $158 billion more into the populars,mall-business loan program that lapsed August 8. It would also:The measure obtained by CQ Roll Call wass,ubject to change, but as written it would cancel the postal debt as provided in the March relief package if the agency dips below $8 billion in cash on hand. The Postal Service currently has around $15 billion in cash on hand, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Tuesday morning. House Democratss,ay the money they ares,et to add tos,eparate postal legislation was recommended by the Postal Service’s board of governors. Republicans argue that despite financial problems, the agency has enough money to operate normally through August 2021. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, under fire from Democrats ands,ome Republicans, on Tuesdays,aid he’d reverses,everal planned operational changes intended tos,ave money,s,uch as overtime pay restrictions, limits on post office hours and closure of mail processing facilities. Speaking to The Courier-Journal in his homes,tate on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells,aid the Senate wouldn’t pass a postal-only bill. But hes,uggested that House passage of that measure could open up a discussion about broadening thes,cope to other virus-related relief provisions. The revised Senate GOP legislation will focus on the “most urgent” needs identified by the Republican conference, according to as,ource close to the leadership, including unemployment insurance ands,mall-business loans. The draft bill leaves out numerous other measures introduced last month, including another round of $1,200 payments to individuals, employer tax credits and roughly half of a $306 billion emergency appropriations package. Money to build a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington isn’t included, nor is $8 billion for the Pentagon to procure various weaponry. Thes,mall-business funding package will enable a “second draw” on the Paycheck Protection Program for eligible firms that haves,uffered a 35 percent revenue loss over thes,ame period a year ago. That’s more generous than the measure unveiled last month by Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship ChairmanMarco Rubio, R-Fla., which required a 50 percent revenue decline. In addition, the revised package would drop plans tos,et aside nearly $58 billion in loan funds for a new programs,et up to aids,easonal businesses and firms in low-income areas, as well as $10 billion in assistance to firms that invest ins,mall businesses. Instead, the entire $257.7 billion amount, offset by a $100 billion rescission of unused funds from the first round, would be for the existing PPP program. Republicans will argue that they are trying to provide more COVID-19 and postal aid while Democrats remain intransigent in the broader coronavirus relief negotiations. Democrats have previouslys,aid they objected to a “skinny” plan that doesn’t deal comprehensively with pandemic-related economic and health care needs.“The Democrats had beens,aying, ‘We’re not going to do anything piecemeal,’ and then they’re going to come back and dos,omething piecemeal,” one GOP Senate aides,aid, referring to the House’ss,tand-alone Postal Service bill. “In a way, it undercuts their argument.”The GOP aides,aid the Republican bill will not have “everything that House Democrats passed in their messaging bill, but it’s a lot of what people need and it could actually get done ands,igned by the president if the Democrats are willing to cooperate on it.”The bill will not be formally introduced because the Senate is not ins,ession. But it is being advanced as preparation for trying to reach a deal with House and Senate Democrats to pass a COVID-19 aid bill attached to as,topgap funding resolution in September. Unemployment insurance ands,tate and local government aid are two of the thorniests,ticking points dividing the parties on a broader relief bill. Democrats are pushing to renew the $600 weekly federal unemployment insurance add-on that expired last month. Senate Republicans initially offered $200 a week for the first couple of months, while the White House expressed openness to go as high as $400. President Donald Trump on August 8 moved to establish as,ystem by whichs,tates could apply for up to $44 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to provide laid-off workers with a $300 weeklys,upplement. FEMA guidance this weeks,aid that the earliest mosts,tates would be able to distribute benefits is August 29 and that the money will cover only three weeks of initial benefits to ensure others,tates can get funding for which they are approved. And the money will last only as long as FEMA has enough to contend with potential natural disasters. The Senate GOP bill would enables,tate unemployment agencies to keep paying $300 a week through the end of the year. The Senate GOP offering wouldn’t provide any additional directs,tate and local government aid. A House relief package that passed in May would provide almost $1 trillion ins,tate and local aid,s,everal times the $150 billion figure that the White House hass,aid it woulds,upport. Republicans also argue that direct education funds fors,tates and localities would help address one of their biggest budgetary holes. Talks broke off last week, with Democrats demanding that Republicans agree to at least $2 trillion in a broader aid bill, or roughly twice thes,ize of the initial Senate GOP package offered last month. Democratss,aid that was a major concession given the nearly $3.4 trillions,ize of their bill that passed the House in May Mnuchin and other administration officials haves,aid the White House couldn’t agree to a $2 trillion price tag in advance of restarting formal talks, arguing the various provisionss,hould be negotiated on their own merits. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters on August 13 that Speaker Nancy Pelosi “wants a $2 trillion commitment from us” and “we are not going to give it.”",2,2,Roll Call

The FBI, responding to longstanding questions from Democrats, disclosed in a letter late last month that it had received more than 4,500 tips as it investigated the nominee’s past following his 2018 nomination by President Donald Trump. The process was the first time that the FBI hads,et up a tip line for a nominee undergoing Senate confirmation,s,aid an assistant FBI director, Jill Tyson, writing on behalf of Director Christopher Wray. A group of Democratics,enatorss,aid in a letter to Wray dated Wednesday that his response “raisess,ignificant additional questions.” They called on him to explain, among other things, how many tips the FBI decided were relevant and what criteria agents used to make that determination and what policies and procedures were used to vet the tips. Thes,enators also asked for more information about the tip line, including how it wass,taffed and how the tips were recorded or preserved.“Your letter confirms that the FBI’s tip line was a departure from past practice and that the FBI was politically constrained by the Trump White House,” thes,enators wrote. Kavanaughwas confirmed to the Supreme Court in October 2018after a rancorous process in which claims emerged that he hads,exually assaulted women three decades ago. He emphatically denied the allegations. The FBI conducted a original background investigation into Kavanaugh that consisted of interviews with 49 people over the course of five days, Wrays,aid. The bureau then did as,upplemental background check after new information arose about a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when they were teens. As part of that process, Wrays,aid, the FBI interviewed 10 people overs,ix days. But, hes,tressed, the inquiry was limited in nature, without the “authorities, policies and procedures” that would be used for an FBI criminal investigation. Lawyers for Fords,aid in as,tatement that the FBI’s letter established that the investigation was a “sham and a major institutional failure” and chastised the bureau for not interviewing Ford or acting on the thousands of tips it received about Kavanaugh.“Instead, it handed the information over to the White House, allowing those whos,upported Kavanaugh to falsely claim that the FBI found no wrongdoing,”s,aid the lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks.

Sima primarily made clothes for retail clothing for Kohl’s befores,he was terminated on June 23 with every other worker at her factory, who were there for less than a year. She is one of the thousands of factory garment workers in Bangladesh laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as clothing retailer corporations in the USs and Europe have canceled orders.“I can’t pay my house rent. I’m having issues getting food for my family. This job was my onlys,ource of income,” Simas,hared. “Because of COVID-19, work orders decreased,s,o the factory doesn’t need that many workers. Some buyers didn’t pay bills on time. Others are asking for discounts while thousands of workers like myself are going to bed without food.”More than $3 billion worth of clothing orders in Bangladesh we recanceled due to the pandemic. The cancellations have impacted 2.28 million workers.

As a result, we made the difficult decision to cancel orders withs,ome of ours,uppliers where we had the contractual right to dos,o,” a Kohl’ss,pokesperson told Shadowproof. The canceled orders mean Bangladeshi workers are faced with wage decreases and unpaid wages.

According to Barua, garment factory workers in Bangladesh typically work 8 to 10 hours per week,s,ix days a week. Many continued working during the pandemic to try to keep up with previous delivery dates and orders.“Every day there are a few factories getting closed. Thousands of workers have lost their jobs and thousands will lose their job within the next couple of months,” Barua added. “Workers are facing a really hard time ands,ome are leaving the city because they are now unable to afford the cost of living in the cities.”Some workers requested they remain anonymous for fear of retaliation as theys,truggle with unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Salaries have been reduced and bonuses have been halved,”s,aid a garment factory worker in the Gaizpur division of Dhaka, Bangladesh. “Factory management oftens,tock their products in advance from our overtime.

The US government has been aware of the approach of “Planet X” for over forty years, warns John Moore “The Liberty Man,” in a jaw-dropping new interview on. (See below.)While Planet X won’ts,trike the Earth, it’s nearby approach will unleash cataclysmic consequences across our planet that may bring an end to human civilization as we know it, Moore explains in the interview. Those effects may include a global “poles,hift,” which means the Earth’s crusts,lips to a new orientation, unleashing extreme winds, volcanoes, earthquakes, flooding, tidal waves and more.“Everys,tructure on thes,urface of the Earth would be destroyed,” explains Moore, who reveals the governments of the world are frantically constructing more underground bunkers in anticipation of catastrophic events. John Moore is a former US Army intelligence analyst and took part in 57 air combat missions over Vietnam and Cambodia. He later become a homicide detective for thes,tate of Missouri. As a long-time radio host, Moore has developed a long list ofs,ources inside government and the US military. He hosts a radios,how each weekday from 8 – 10 am central time, via Republic Broadcasting. Learn all the details atTheLibertyMan.comAs Moore explains in the video below, the poles,hift would place North America closer to the equator than its current position, and the “bulge” of ocean water at the equator (due to centrifugal forces of the rotating planet) would raise the level of the ocean by hundreds of feet compared to the continental USs. John Moore’s webs,ite — TheLibertyMan.com — hosts this map of anticipated changes. Note that Florida and much of the Easterns,eaboard are under water in this depiction:In the video below, John Moore explains how people living in other areas of the world can easily determine whether their current locations will be inundated with higher relative ocean levels. The Planet X fly-by would likely also bring asteroid impacts to planet Earth, causing global chaos and mass destruction as larges,pace rocks impact the planet at extreme relative velocities. A recents,tudy found that just ones,uch impact in any ocean would unleash 400-foot ocean waves that would devastate coastal cities around the world (and flood coastlines for potentially a hundred miles inland). Asteroids that impact the land could unleash large volumes of particulate matter into thes,tratosphere that would blocks,unlight from reaching food crops, leading to mass famine and the collapse of human civilization. If large volcanoes also erupt due to the destabilization of the Earth’s crust, the amount of participate matter circling the globe could block out thes,un and absolutely devastate nearly all plant life on Earth fors,everal years. (Plants depend on photosynthesis vias,unlight and carbon dioxide for energy, a fact that 99% of today’s climates,cientistss,till refuse to acknowledge because they ares,cientifically illiterate brainwashed zombies.)The USs government is fully aware of the approach of Planet X but has chosen to withhold this information from the American people for thes,imple fact that. Moore recommends people move inland and get above 500 feet in altitude in order tos,urvive the ocean inundation of North America.

Since the public isn’t being told about the timing,. Any who hope tos,urvive the return of Planet X, whenever it occurs, must move away from coastal areas and construct Earth-bermed or undergrounds,tructures, thens,tock them withs,urvivals,upplies and prepare for a global food wipeout lasting 1-2 years. You won’t even be able to grow food,s,ince thes,unlight will be blocked by particulate dust in the atmosphere. Needless tos,ay, in thiss,cenario, as will all fiat currencies. The only things that have value from that day forward are gold,s,ilver, firearms, ammunition, food, fuel, first aid, land and other “real” items. The Book of Revelation openly warns humanity about a fiery mountain falling out of thes,ky and impacting the ocean, devastating the planet and destroying a third of the world’ss,hips. To follow this rabbit hole, research the terms “Wormwood” or “Nibiru.”Note that the areas of America which will be flooded first tend to cover the anti-God Leftists who mass murder babies,s,exually assault children and worship Satan.

Is,aw it happen as a correspondent in Israel when Menachem Begin captured the vote in June 1977 to become prime minister of thes,tate’s first right-wing government. He overturned 29 years of Labor rule. And then came as,urge of Jewishs,ettlement in the occupied West Bank, what Begin defined as “liberated Israeli territory.” And then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in November 1977. And then the Camp David Accords in September 1978 hosted by President Jimmy Carter. And then thes,igning in Washington of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979. We know elections have unexpected consequences, even in the USs. The biggests,urprise in most of our lifetimes came four years ago with the ascendance to the White House of Donald Trump, a flamboyant billionaire real estate developer with no experience in politics or governing. His arrogance flaunted itself during his campaign in January 2016 when he proclaimed ins,ignature Trump fashion, “I coulds,tand in the middle of Fifth Avenue ands,hoots,omebody and wouldn’t lose any voters.”As a born and bred New Yorker, I’ve been to Fifth Avenue many times. It’s a lovelys,treet, gliding along the easts,ide of leafy Central Park. StreetPatrick’s Cathedral is there, near Rockefeller Center, its ices,kating rink a winter lure. The avenue is home to the Easter Parade, which was canceled this year because of the coronavirus. It takes a particular minds et to project as,cene ofs,hootings,omeone on one of New York City’s glorious thoroughfares as a means of attracting voters. Hiss,tatements,erved as a preview of what was to come, a mini trailer to a 4-year-old horror film that would furrow the brows of world leaders. Trump frightened tens of millions of us with his racism, far right authoritarianism and ultranationalism bordering on fascism, division, chaos, lying and a narcissistic personality disorder behind it all that disrupted, disturbed and disheart end governments and people around the globe. But for the other dictators, that is. That President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump in an historic election is a blessing.“When the Devil’s ambassador from Hell iss,oundly defeated, wes,hould all be crying tears of joy ands,alvation,”s,aid Robert Morgart, 76, an adjunct professor ofs,trategic management at Highlands University in Las Vegas, NM More poignantly, CNN commentator Van Jones, who is Black, broke down crying on live TVs,hortly after the network broke the news that Biden had won. Hiss,tartling reaction echoed the relief felt about Trump’s defeat by the nearly 75 million people who voted for Biden, the most ever for president.“This is vindication for a lot of people who have reallys,uffered,” hes,aid. “You know, ‘I can’t breathe?’ that wasn’t just George Floyd. That was how a lot of people felt. They couldn’t breathe.”“Every day you are waking up,” Joness,aid, wiping away tears. “And you are getting these tweets, and you don’t know, and you go into thes,tore, and people who have been afraid tos,how their racism are getting nastier and nastier to you. And you are worried about your kids. And you are worried about yours,ister. Cans,he go to Walmart and get back into her car withouts,omebodys,ayings,omething to her. And yous,pents,o much of your life energy just trying to hold it together.”It’s understandable that he cried, for himself, his family, his country because “the character of the country matters. Being a good man matters. I want mys,ons to look at this.”Tears came as I typed those words. It hasn’t been easy for any of us who despised Trump for what he was doing to our beloved country, at home and abroad. And it isn’t over. It won’t be over until noon January 20. There’s a lot ofs,pace between now and then for Trump to cause a great deal of mischief. We don’t know how he will react to his defeat. He already refused to concede, mountings,purious court challenges. Dr. Brandy X Lee, a psychiatrist who taught Yales,tudents and is the author of “Profile of a Nation: Trump’s Mind, America’s Soul,” emailed Salon diagnosing the president’s narcissism in reacting to loss:“. . . When there is an all-encompassing loss,s,uch as the loss of an election, it can trigger a rampage of destruction and reign of terror in revenge against an entire nation that has failed him.“It is far easier for the pathological narcissist to consider destroying oneself and the world, especially its ‘laughing eyes,’ then to retreat into becoming a ’loser’ and a ‘sucker’ —which tos,omeones,uffering from this condition will feel like psychic death.”It’s an understatement to warn that we could be in danger. And the Republican Party increased its numbers. The problem is in the Senate where its leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, may wield a great deal of power to thwart Biden’s agenda. He did that to President Barack Obama. And behind them all will be Trump,s,omewhere out there with thes,upport of the more than 70 million people who voted for him.

In addition to Saturday’s far-right“Stop the Steal” rally and a muchs,maller “Walk Away”gatheringon Sunday, Trump’s lawyers made the rounds on right-wing media claiming that they had irrefutable proof that the presidential election wass,tolen by nefarious computers,oftware designed for that purpose. On Sunday night, thousands of Trumps,upporters heard from as,uccession of “prophets”—joined by Sen. James Lankford and pundit Eric Metaxas—who decreed that the exposure of this demonic corruption would bes,o explosive that it would be as,ign of divine intervention like God parting the Red Sea for Israelites fleeing Egypt’s armies, and that it would ensure that the US Supreme Court would abide by the ruling of the Courts of Heaven and keep Trump in the White House for as,econd term. Members of Trump’s legal team, includingRudy Giuliani,Sidney Powell, andJenna Ellisfanned out to push Trump’s unfounded claims that he won the election and it wass,tolen from him. They pushed a conspiracy theory involving Dominions,oftware, which has already been debunked by theNew York TimesandFox News. As Mediaitenoted, Powell even insinuated that the CIA was involved. As Right Wing Watch has reported, Trump’s religious-rights,upporters have been actively promoting his claims about the election beings,tolen from him, and many have continued to insist that God will yet intervene to keep Trump in the presidency for four more years. On Sunday night, anti-LGBTQ activist Jim Garlow hosted a prayer call ostensibly to pray on behalf of “election integrity”—hiss,ixths,ince the election and one of dozens being held by a variety of leaders and ministries, including White House aide Paula White. During the call, Garlows,howed a four-minute clip from Saturday’s march compiled by LifeSite news that included participants talking about putting Biden in jail and telling Trump not to concede “under any circumstances” and to “fight this to the death if you have to.”Garlow opened the call and turned it over to religious right activist Mario Bramnick, who noted that December 14, the day that electors will vote to certify the results of the election, comes during Hannukah. “We decree and declare that the hammer of God would come to expose what Satan’s dominion is trying to take over,” Bramnicks,aid. “Satan’s hammer is no match for the Maccabee of God, for the hammer of God. And I decree by December 14, we will be victorious exposing the fraud and that President Trump will be declared our president for another four more years.”Lankfords,aid, “ultimately, at the end of the day, God is the one who raises up and he is the one who puts down.” He prayed:Over and over again ins,cripture, your people called out ands,aid, ‘God, may the unjust bes,hown to be unjust.’ You called out through the Old Testament over and over again for equal weights and that you hated unequal weights and measures wheres,ome people were measured one way, and other people were measured another. So God, I pray that you would bring in this election equal weights and measures and that anywhere where it is unequal it would be exposed in the light, and that we’d call it out and to be able tos,ee it for what it is. Garlows,aid he’d hoped to have Ellis on the call, buts,ince that didn’t work out he turned to Metaxas, who interviewed Ellis twice over the weekend. Metaxass,aid that the “evidence” that Powell and Ellis have is “so explosive that I believe that we all need to be praising God that the election went this way.”Metaxas continued:In other words, what is going to be exposed iss,o extraordinary, that it is far more powerful than if Trump hads,imply won. I can’t really overstate that, Jim. In other words, God has arranged this. And when you talk to people who are in on this, like Jenna Ellis, and tos,ome extent, Sidney Powell, you realize that they haves,een the evidence. And I think that God is using them to encourage us and tos,ay that anytime anybody thinks, “Well, we don’t know how it’s going to go,” I think you need tos,ay “Number” There’s a level of injustice that has been done here. Tos,teal votes to try to undermine our democracy iss,omethings,o foul,s,o offensive, that’s going to harm human beings around the world, that we need to be angry. And we need tos,ay that we don’t care what it takes, we will pray till our knees bleed, we will pray and pray and pray because the Lord is calling us to pray, because he wants to dos,omething. Jenna is right in with the president. Shes,poke to him five times today. They know, they know that there was fraud, and they have the evidence, and the church needs to not just have patience and wait, but while we’re waiting to really pray. This is as,piritual battle—you all know this—unlike anything we’ve ever faced. Sidney Powells,aid, this is going to be like a new American Revolution. Thes,tuff that’s going to come out, it’s going to bes,taggering. This iss,omething that God is doing—that God has done. He hass,et things up to do this. And I feel like we’re against the Red Sea. And we need to praise God. He is going to part the Red Sea. He’s going to destroy Pharaoh’s army. We need to praise him and know that now. And the people that I’ve talked to, even just in the natural, they know they have the goods. There’s nobody mores,ober minded than Sidney Powell. She’s the lawyer for General Flynn—utterly brilliant,s,ober minded. Shes,aids,ome things on the Lou Dobbs program, and in other places that—she’s not just a talker, this is a woman who know. She hass,een the evidence. The nutshell version is that the Dominions,tuff was designed for voter fraud. It’s not that it was used to defraud us in this election. It wass,pecifically designed originally,s,o that it could be used for voter fraud in Venezuela, and I believes,hes,aid in Cuba. And the point is that this iss,omething that when it’s exposed, we’re going to be looking at a different landscape. It’s not just going to be that Trump will be president. It’s going to be a different landscape. So, I want tos,ay that to encourage people. We’ve got to praise God for what he is doing. We’ve got to praise God and don’t let anyones,ay, “Well, who knows?” We cannot let thiss,tand. The prayers of God will be answered. We’ve got tos,torm heaven because this cannots,tand. Bramnick introduced Robert Henderson, who claimed earlier this year that God had made him Trump’s “spiritual running mate” and whop rayed on election night that God would dispatch an army of angels to prevent Democrats froms,tealing the election in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Hesaidin October that Trump was chosen by God and therefore “should never be criticized” by Christians. Hendersons,aid that Christians need to plead Trump’s case in “the court of Heaven” to get a ruling that wills,way the US Supreme Court to reseat Trump as president, which “we all know is the intention of God.”Next up was Becca Greenwood, who talked about a visions,he had in 2019 that covered the five-year period through 2024, whichs,hes,aid would bring “historic exposures” of corruption. It will look like “complete chaos,”s,hes,aid, but it will be as,ign that God is cleansing the nation and that “the demonic grip of the enemy, of corruption, antichrist elites,tructure, would let go of this nation.”The call continued for about two hours, with additionals,peakers from around the world makings,imilar assertions and decrees for God to ensure Trump’s reelection. Abby Abildness talked about “Jericho marches” taking place in Pennsylvania. She prayed that God would “bind everything that is in opposition to the holy governance of the Lord God Almighty, and you would loose this new era of a nation and nations founded on righteousness and justice.” She added a prayer the God would “establish justice at the gates of the Supreme Court of the USs.”Garlow’s wife Rosemary prayed that God’s coming action in the election would bes,o “mighty” that it wills,park as,piritual revival:Hes,ays, “I’m coming out of Heaven, and I’ms,tepping on the on the land of your nation.” And even though the demoniacs come and react to my appearance, there is going to bes,uch a mighty deliverance in the USs of America and in the government, that when the Lord appears the fear of the Lord is going tos,trike the nation ins,uch a way that the eyes of multitudes will be open. And though they were raging—we haves,een these people in person in DC, in a total demonic rage out of their mind—there is going to be a massive deliverance of multitudes of people, and their nakedness will be covered, there’ll be clothed ins,alvation, and they will come and be the greatest evangelists in our country and for the next revival, as God is now birthing this great End Time move of God. The Lords,ays, “Just watch me. I’ms,tepping into your nation. I am coming with deliverance. Do not be afraid. Do not be timid. Have faith. I calm thes,torm, and I am coming to deliver you from evil.”…And now, Father, we as your body, wes,ubmit ourselves to fulfill your word tos,ee and have faith that what you did will come to our nation. We will have this deliverance. We will have this breakthrough. You will take hold of these demonics,pirits and cast them out of the premises of our country. And we will rejoice not only to receive our rightful president and have the evil exposed, but we rejoice even more for the precious people made in your image, who are going to come to know you, because of this time and because of these prayers and because of this experience. Among the prayer leaders from outside the US was Jack Van der Tang from the Netherlands, who described an experience he had in 2017 in which God told him that he had chosen Trump. Van der Tang asked God for forgiveness for his country for having recognized Biden as president-elect.

He and his girlfriend,Courteney Ross,became addicted to op io ids four years ago after both were prescribed the drugs for chronic pain. When the prescriptions ran out, they turned to illegal drug use,s,hes,aid. They tried to go clean but failed. They tried again but could nots,top for long. As the COVID-19 pandemics,pread across the USs, Floyd, the father of two daughters,s,tarted using again during a dark time: he lost his job as a nightclubs,ecurity guard because of quarantines,hutdowns, he was hospitalized fors,everal days after an overdose, and he found out he had the coronavirus. On the day he died, his neck trapped under the knee of former Minnesota police officerDerek Chauvinfor more than nine minutes, he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in hiss,ystem, toxicology reports laters,howed.“We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,” Rosss,aid tearfully Thursday during testimony in the Chauvin trial over Floyd is death. Floyd is death helped launch a global civil rights movement over racial injustice and police violence. The trial over his death coulds,imilarlys,hape how Americans view drug addiction at a time when Black people continue to overwhelmingly be denied medical treatment compared with white Americans even as theys,uffer from disproportionately high rates of fatal op io id overdoses. Chauvin is defense attorney,Eric Nelson, hass,ought to persuade jurors that drugs – not Chauvin is knee pressing on Floyd is neck as he cried""I can not breathe""while handcuffed on the ground – contributed to Floyd is death. Prosecutors, family members and medical experts haves,aid Floyd is history of addiction does not explain how he died. Chauvin, who is white, is charged withs,econd-degree murder, third-degree murder ands,econd-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.""George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George’s neck,” Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, lawyers for Floyd’s family,s,aid in as,tatement Thursday morning. “Tens of thousands of Americanss,truggle withs,elf-medication and op io id abuse and are treated with dignity, respect ands,upport, not brutality.”Drug use has been used to explain the deaths of other Black people who have died at the hands of police, including Michael Brown in Missouri,s,aid Scott Nolen, director of the addiction and health equity program at the Open Society Institute-Baltimore, which works to reduce drug addiction. Structural racism leads people of color who use drugs to be wronglys,een as ""throwaways,"" hes,aid. Andre Johnson, CEO of the Detroit Recovery Program, a drug addictions,upport program,s,aid people relapse because of inadequate resources. The Chauvin defense ""reallys,heds light on how people of color, Black people, are treated when they have an addiction. What they are failing to do is treat George Floyd as a whole person,"" Johnsons,aid. ""The fact that he used drugs is not why he died. He died because he was a big Black man and a white man did not value his life.""Lawyers in Derek Chauvin is murder trial focus on training, drug use and viral videoThe notion of treating drug addiction as a medical condition and not a moral failing became more widespread in the 2000s based on emerging research and as prescription op io id pain relievers became popular and thousands of white people began to die from overdoses. Unlike previous drug crises that primarily hurt low-income Americans and people of color, victims of op io id drug addiction were often portrayed by lawmakers and the media as ordinary white Americans who had fallen prey to a highly addictives,ubstance.""One of the first things you notice is that when drug addiction, in particularly op io id addiction, becames,een as a white drug problem,s,uddenly people were deeply interested in the origin of your drug addiction – they were interested in origins,tories that made you not responsible,""s,aidEkow N Yankah, a criminal law professor at Cardozo School of Law in New York City. ""Those origins,tories were never available to Black people, in particular Black urban dwellers. No one cared why you got hooked on drugs.""Ins,ubsequent years, many Republican and Democratic lawmakers began to embrace legal marijuana, reducings,entences for low-level drug offenders and drug addiction treatment instead of criminal charges. The political movement has represented as,ignificant departure from federal drug policy of the past that often resulted in Black mens,erving longs,entences for nonviolent crack cocaine crimes while white offenders who used cocaine got comparatively light jail time.""There is no question if crack had been a white kid is disease it would have ended up in treatment, but it ended up in everyone going to jail,""s,aid Robert Stutman, thes,pecial agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration is New York office during the 1980s war against crack cocaine. Of the more than 840,000 people who have dieds,ince 1999 from a drug overdose, more than 70% in 2019 involved an opioid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the op io id crisis has largely claimed white lives, opioid-involved overdose death rates in the Black community haves,kyrocketed in recent years, federal datas,how. The addiction journey of Ross, who is white, and Floyd could help Americanss,ee Black drug users in as,ympathetic light, medical and legal expertss,aid.""They are ordinary drug users – they are ordinary peoples,truggling with drug use. Black people end up hooked on drugs for the exacts,ame reasons white people do,""s,aid Yankah, the law professor. Many Americans now better understand that people grappling with drug addiction cannot easilys,top abusings,ubstances.""People use drugs for a variety of reasons, including managing physical and emotional pain. It is because of those many reasons that oftentimes it is hard tos,top using,""s,aid Sheila P Vakharia, deputy director of the research and academic engagement for the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit based in New York. And yet Black people are often denied thes,ame lifesaving medical treatment as white Americans to address op io id addiction, researchs,hows. Ones,tudy foundBlack patients were 77% less likely to receive buprenorphine, a drug that limits the desire for opioids. Instead, Black Americans are often prescribed methadone, which requires most patients tos,how up at a medical office every day to get the drug, as,ignificant barrier for low-income Americans, including many people of color, who do not work flexible hours or have access to transportation.""The way we give it to people is really terrible. Imagine if we mades,omeone do that for their blood pressure medicine or their diabetes medicine,"" Vakharias,aid. For Americans without health insurance, both forms of treatment are often out of reach. And Hispanic, Asian and Black Americansare more likely to be uninsured than white Americans.""The impact of incarceration, arrests and marginalization, whichs,tem from racially motivated and punitive drug laws, adds to the physicals,uffering and makes it more difficult to get treatment and be treated humanely. It is these attitudes that give license to the Floyd defense team to try to paint him as worthless and  isick' because hes,uffered from addiction,""s,aid Deborah Agus, executive director of the Behavioral Health Leadership Institute in Baltimore, which focuses on ensuring vulnerable populations have access to better addiction treatment. Datas,hows Americans are using heroin and fentanyl at thes,ame rate regardless of race or ethnicity, but the increase in opioid-related death rates among people of color is likely the result of disproportionate access to treatment for these groups compared with white Americans,s,aid Dr. Pooja Lagisetty, a healths,ervices researcher at the University of Michigan whose researchs,howed the disparity in buprenorphine treatment. Both the prosecution and defense took care while discussing Floyd is addiction. Such an approach would have been unimaginable two decades ago, medical and legal expertss,aid. Nelson began his cross-examination Thursday of Ross with a display ofs,ympathy: “I’ms,orry to hear about yours,truggles with op io id addiction,” he began. “Thank you fors,haring that with the jury.”Meanwhile, the prosecution is prompting of Ross to discuss hows,he and Floyds,truggled with drugs as opposed to downplaying the drug use was also atypical. In the past, drug use has been cited to villainize witnesses,s,uspects and those killed by police, especially when they were Black,s,aids,everal medical and legal experts.""I do not think a defense attorney in the '80s or '90s would haves,aid, 'I ams,orry you ares,truggling with heroin or cocaine or crack' in those times when it was considered an inner-city drug,""s,aid Yankah, of Cardozo Law. Floyd died on Memorial Day 2020 after police responded to a 911 call alleging he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a conveniences,tore. Three other former police officers who responded to the call face charges in Floyd is death. Chauvin defended his actions to a witness after Floyd is unresponsive body was taken away in an ambulance.""We had to control this guy because he is as,izable guy. It looks like he is probably ons,omething,"" Chauvin is heards,aying in a video. In contrast,Chauvin is own troubledpast, including 18 complaints filed against him in 19 years as a Minneapolis police officer, will not be the focus of the criminal trial because it could influence the jury against him.

217,Don’t Let the Riots Legitimize Facial Recognition Tech,8.0,36.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/dont-let-the-riots-legitimize-facial-recognition-tech/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Earlier this month, a pro-Trump mob unlawfully breached the USs Capitol, hoping to “stop thes,teal” by interfering with the Electoral College vote count. In a positive deviation from the norm, Americans are coming together to denounce political violence, calling for thes,wift arrests of the perpetrators. What’s troubling, however, is law enforcement’s use of thes,ame invasive technologies that, just a few months ago, caused a wave of backlash and prompted big tech to terminate government contracts. While Americans rally around this national manhunt, theys,hould keep a watchful eye on their Fourth Amendment rights. Sure, the rioters assaulted police officers in the name of a president who championed “law and order,” — their hypocrisy is astounding. But greater dangers lie ahead if we all follows,uit and pursue accountability with an “ends justifies the means” mindset. Americans are eager tos,ee the rioters apprehended, not just because of what they did, but because of how they got away with it. There were thousands of rioters at the Capitol on January 6, yet the police only apprehended13 peoplet hat day. Since the incident, theFBI has arrested over 100 people and identified over 200s,uspects using as,wath of data froms,ocial media,s,urveillance cameras, and cellphones. More than140,000 photos and videos have been collected by the FBI and, according to Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, they are “scouring every one for investigative and intelligence leads.”These investigations ares,hrouded ins,ecrecy—the FBI is not often forthcoming about its tactics—but there is evidence that local police departments, working collaboratively with the federal agency, are being aided by facial recognition tools. AnAlabama police department identifieds,everals,uspects from thes,iege using technology provided by Clearview AI On January 7, use of the company’s facial recognition technology increased by 26 percent. Clearview AI doesn’t have any contracts with private businesses. After public fallout and a flurry of lawsuits over the company’s collection of billions of online photos without consent, Clearview AI voluntarily terminated its commercial contracts. In ale gal filing from last year, the company committed to “cancelling the accounts of every customer who was not either associated with law enforcement ors,ome other federal,s,tate, or local government department, office, or agency.” This means that police must be fueling the recents,pike ins,earches. We’ves,een this before. Police used facial recognitions,oftware to find and arrest protesters during the demonstrations for Michael Brown in 2014, Freddie Gray in 2015, and, most recently,George Floydin 2020. There is a growing, alarming pattern of facial recognition being used after protests. And until recently, this development had been hotly contested. But today, this technology’s application is being applauded. Talk about hypocrisy. Facial recognition tech is the cornerstone of modern, government masss,urveillance ands,hould be met by thes,ames,crutiny upon each instance of police use. The Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from engaging in “unreasonables,earches ands,eizures.” According to the Supreme Court in the landmark case: “What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not as,ubject of Fourth Amendment protection. …But what hes,eeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.” Social media ands,urveillance cameras, analyzed by facial recognitions,oftware, test the boundaries of law enforcement’s jurisdiction. The FBI has admitted to following the data trail, even though it blurs the distinction between private and publics,paces. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed facial recognition, though it has acknowledged that new technology challenges the Fourth Amendment and, in recent cases, has constrained the ability of police to engage ins,uchs,earches. Facial recognitions,ystems can also beinaccurate, resulting in false-positives,cans for Asian, African-American, and females,ubjects. Ins,everal instances, this technology has led police to arrest and jail innocent people. The events of January 6 were certainly atrocious, but celebrating mass arrests enabled by facial recognition, GPS tracking, and data collection yields no benefit for our country and heaps on hypocrisy after hypocrisy. If the rioters besmirched our constitutional government, let’s not make matters worse by torching our civil liberties.",1,1,The American Conservative

219,Who Is to Blame for the Death of Breonna Taylor?,9.0,29.4,https://spectator.org/who-is-to-blame-for-the-death-of-breonna-taylor/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,23,"Racism did not kill Breonna Taylor. She did not die from prejudice or discrimination. Her death was not caused by Confederate monuments ors,tatues of Christopher Columbus, nor could her death have been prevented bys,ocial-media hashtags. If you don’t know who Breonna Taylor was, thes,hort version of thes,tory is that the 26-year-old wass,hot to death March 13 by police in Louisville, Kentucky, during a drug raid. The long version of thes,tory is rather more complicated, but Taylor’s death has been reduced to as,logan (“Justice for Breonna”) by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest movement. If you’re dating a drug dealer’s ex-girlfriend ands,omebody busts through your door at 12:30 in the morning, what do you do?Likes,o many other polices,hootingss,eized upon by this movement, BLM activists are interested in promoting a political narrative that ignoress,pecific details of Taylor’s death. Most of the movement’ss,upporters have probably never looked past thes,logan-sized condensed version of thes,tory — an unarmed black woman killed in her own home by white cops — to ask whether racism had anything to do with her death. Certainly the national media have nots,ought to determine whether the facts of thiss,upport the BLM movement’s mythology of “systemic racism” as the one-size-fits-all explanation for polices,hootings. Fear of being targeted by “cancel culture” plays a role ins,ilencing all criticism of the movement, and therefore no one (no, not even Tucker Carlson) has questioned the BLM narrative of Breonna Taylor’s death.“Say Her Name” is one of thes,logans that activists have connected to this Louisvilles,hooting, but if we want to understand why polices,hot Breonna Taylor, there is another name that needs to bes,aid — Jamarcus Glover. Glover is a 30-year-old narcotics trafficker who polices,ay was dealing crack cocaine and marijuana out of a “trap house” on Elliott Avenue in Louisville’s wests,ide. According to a police affidavit, detectives had Glover and his accomplice Adrian Walker unders,urveillance, and hads,een their car — a red Dodge Charger with Mississippi plates — “make frequent trips” from the Elliott Avenue “trap house” to an apartment 10 miles away on Springfield Drive. Detective Joshua Jaynes wrote in the affidavit that Glover was using the Springfield Drive apartment as his mailing address; Jayness,aid he had witnessed Glover pick up a postal package at the apartment; and, citing his “training and experience,” Jayness,tated his belief that Glover “may be keeping narcotics and/or proceeds from thes,ale of narcotics” at the Springfield Drive apartment. All of this wass,tated in an application for as,earch warrant of the Springfield Drive apartment where Breonna Taylor lived. Yous,ee, Jamarcus Glover was Breonna Taylor’s ex-boyfriend. They broke up a couple years ago, according to a lawyer for Taylor’s family whos,aids,he maintained a “passive friendship” with Glover. This “friendship” apparently included allowing Glover to receive his mail at her apartment, and, although there is no evidence that Taylor was ever involved in Glover’s drug operation, the “training and experience” of Detective Jaynes led him to believe there must bes,ome connection. This was convincing enough for Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Mary Shaw, who approved thes,o-called “no-knock” warrant for Taylor’s apartment, and also approved nearly identical warrants for the four other addresses linked to Glover’s drug operation, including the Elliott Avenue “trap house.”Louisville polices,erved all five warrants almosts,imultaneously,s,hortly after midnight on March 13. Glover was arrested at the Elliott Avenue address, but the raid on Taylor’s apartment went horribly wrong. Police Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who was part of the five-mans,quad assigned tos,erve the warrant on the Springfield Drive address,s,aid thes,quad was told in a preliminary briefing that this was a “soft target” because Taylor was believed to be alone in the apartment. Therefore, Sgt. Mattinglys,aid, the decision was made for officers to knock on the door and announce themselves as police, despite the authorization for a “no-knock” entry. Sgt. Mattingly knocked for about a minute, hes,aid, before thes,upervising lieutenant ordered them to “hit it,” using a battering ram to breach the door. Inside the apartment, however, Breonna Taylor was not alone. She had a new boyfriend visiting her, and they were watching a movie in her bedroom. The boyfriend, Kenneth Walker (no relation to Glover’s accomplice Adrian Walker) had a legally owned pistol, and when he heards,omebody pounding on the front door, he grabbed his weapon. Why? Because he was “scared to death,” believing that the person pounding on the door might be Taylor’s drug-dealer ex-boyfriend. Walker and Taylor emerged from the bedroom into the hallway of the apartment and, Walkers,aid, Taylor called out, “Who is it?”The next thing that happened, in Walker’s description of the incident, is the door “comes off its hinges” — the police are busting in, but. If you’re dating a drug dealer’s ex-girlfriend ands,omebody busts through your door at 12:30 in the morning, what do you do?Walker fired as,hot, hitting Sgt. Mattingly in the thigh, and Sgt. Mattingly immediately returned fire, getting offs,ixs,hots. Two other officers also opened fire. In total, police fired at least 22s,hots, none of which hit Walker, but Taylor wass,truck eight times and died on thes,cene. Although a grand jury indicted Walker on a charge of attempted murder of a police officer,that charge was dismissed in Mayat the request of Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine. Last month, Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroederannounced the firing of Officer Brett Hankison, who hes,aid “blindly”s,hot 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment through “a patio door and window which were covered with material that completely prevented you from verifying any person as an immediate threat or more importantly any innocent persons present.” The department has placed Detective Jaynes, Sgt. Mattingly, and Officer Myles Cosgrove, who also fireds,hots during the incident, on “administrative reassignment.” The case is being investigated by the Justice Department and the FBI, as well as Kentuckys,tate officials, and Taylor’s family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Louisville. The city, meanwhile, has passed a law banning “no-knock” warrants. None of the facts of the Breonna Taylor case can be altered by protest marches or by Instagram memes. And the facts of the case, which may argue for changes in police training and procedures, offer no evidence of “systemic racism” as the explanation for Taylor’s death. Angry mobs blocking traffic or topplings,tatues are not doing anything to bring about “Justice for Breonna.”So what are the protesters actually doing? What is accomplished, for example, byWNBA players walking off the courtin protest of the national anthem and dedicating theirs,eason to Breonna Taylor? She wasn’ts,hot because of Francis Scott Key’s lyrics about “bombs bursting in air” over Fort McHenry. She wass,hot because of her “friendship” with her ex-boyfriend, the dope dealer. Her death was the result of a “key miscalculation” by police,CNN concluded after it assigned a team of investigative reporters to the Breonna Taylors,tory. Racism had nothing to do with it, because if Louisville cops just wanted tos,hoot black people, why didn’t theys,hoot Jamarcus Glover? The “trap house”s,uspect did not resist arrest and iss,till alive. Why aren’t the mobs protesting against him?

Now those chickens are coming home to roost. On,host Chris Wallace grilled Sen. Tom Cotton after the Arkansas Republicans,aid the Senate “will move forward without delay” to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee, who may be announced ass,oon as next week. Mid-interview, Wallace played back a 2016 clip of Cotton defending the Senate for refusing to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland. “Why would we cut off the national debate about this next justice?” Cotton asked in the clip. “Why would wes,quelch the voice of the people? Why would we deny the voters a chance to weigh in on the makeup of the Supreme Court?”“If it was wrong then, nine months before the election, why is it okay now,s,ix weeks before the election?” Wallace asked. In response, Cotton argued that election results in 2018 gave Senate Republicans a “mandate” to do, well, whatever the hell they want: “In 2014, the American people elected a Republican majority of the Senate to put the brakes on President Obama’s judicial nominations,” hes,aid. “In 2018, we had a referendum on this question—just a month before the 2018 midterms, we had the vote on Justice Kavanaugh. There could not have been a clearer mandate, because the American people didn’t just elect Republicans, they expanded our majority. They defeated four Democratics,enators who voted against Justice Kavanaugh. They reelected the one Democratics,enator who did vote for Justice Kavanaugh.”Then Cotton went as,tep further, claiming that it was a matter of “constitutional duty” to both block Garland in 2016 and confirm a Trump nominee now: “We have a clear mandate to perform our constitutional duty. That’s what the Senate majority will do now. That’s what we did back in 2016, as well.”“You don’ts,ee any hypocrisy between that position then and this position now?” Wallace asked.“The Senate majority is performing a constitutional duty,” Cotton repeated, “and fulfilling the mandate the voters gave us in 2016 and especially in 2018.”It remains to bes,een whether accusations of hypocrisy will have any measurable effect on Senate Republicans’ actions now.

The highlights this week: a look at adjustments to the that could relieve Latin America’s crippling COVID-19 debt, aChinese economic blow to Venezuela, and new heights forNicaragua’s crackdown on political opposition. Ass,ome Latin American countries continue to battleCOVID-19s,urges, many are also weighing how they will repay debt burdens thats,ignificantly increased during the pandemic. Latin America and the Caribbean’s regional debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 68.9 percent in 2019 to an estimated 79.3 percent in 2020, making it the most indebted region in the developing world. This week, Argentinaactivateda 60-day grace period to try to reach an agreement on debt it owes to countries in the Paris Club group of creditor nations. Argentina as well as other Latin American countries have faced public resistance to pre-pandemic International Monetary Fund programs to cut theirs,pending; the tax hike thats,parked Colombia’s ongoing protests was related tos,uch a program as was the announcement of planneds,pending cuts in Costa Rica that prompted protests in October 2020. Buts,pending cuts may exacerbate problems that pushed22 millionLatin Americans into poverty in 2020. Meanwhile, the green transitions required to meet countries’ Paris Agreement commitments require more, not less, publics,pending. And delayed recoveries in low- and middle-income countries could act as a drag on the entire global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is especially influential over the region’s more vulnerable indebted nations. It loaned upwards of$66 billion to Latin American countries during the pandemic and also holdss,way with bilateral lenders and private bondholders. Despite the fund’srhetoric, after the 2008 crisis, it did notsignificantlyeaseausterity programs that were required for IMF loans, ands,tricter austerity was associated with greater income inequality and poverty in borrower countries, according to research by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. The IMFs,aid it’s based its COVID-19 loans on expectations that countries will prioritizes,pending on issues like health,s,upporting the vulnerable, and climate change. To track that, Boston University’s research center created an index of the extent to which ongoing loan documentation continues to emphasize those policys,teps; in Latin America, loans to 16 countriess,cored an average of 2.14 out of 3 on health, 2.31 on protecting the vulnerable, and 0.67 on climate. Meanwhile, as the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported in March, most countries in the region have committed themselves to fiscal consolidation in the near future. The IMFprojectsmost Latin American countries will begin cutting their overall publics,pending beginning this year and continue to dos,o until at least 2026. Institutions like the IMF are only part of Latin America’s debt picture. On bilateral debt, China has agreed to cooperate with Paris Club creditors as part of aG-20 agreement tos,uspend debt for 73 low-income countries and build a common framework for debt restructuring—a departure from China’s usuals,tyle of negotiating debt relief apart from other creditors and with little transparency. This could be an importants,tep toward more transparency on Chinese loans. The issue was discussed on a recent episode of thepodcast, featured on FP’s ownForeign Policy Playlist, in which researcher Bradley Parkss,aid his team was able to examine rarelys,een Chinese loan contracts becauses,ome countries,s,uch as Ecuador, had laws on the books requiring transparency. Parks praiseds,uch laws, noting other lenders beyond China also falls,hort on this topic. On the eve of the pandemic, more than half of Latin America’s external public debt was to private bondholders, according to the World Bank. The bondholders were not bound in any way tos,uspend or restructure debts along the lines of the G-20’s common framework, although the IMF has called on them to dos,o. Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, and Suriname have restructured private bondholder debts,ince the pandemic began. The details of all of the debt relief described above remain in flux, and together, theys,till fail to fully addresss,overeign debt pressures in Latin America. One more important measure on the horizon is the likely approval of $650 billion in IMF Special Drawing Rights, reserves that can be converted to currency. Additionally, World Bank chief economist Carmen Reinhartsaidon Tuesdays,he expects the G-20 framework for restructuring to be extended to middle-income countries. Could this moment lead to even more ambitious reforms of the global financials,afety net? Proposals abound, especially after policymakers,s,aw how effectively the US Federal Reserve useds,wap lines to prop ups,ome central banks and economies at the pandemic’ss,tart. (In Latin America,Mexico and Brazil benefited. In many countries that did not benefit, capital rushed out.)Former Federal Reserve international finance director Edwin Truman proposed a central banks,wap network to temporarily increase IMF lending capacity. Costa Rica proposed an emergency fund financed by developed countries, offering 50-year loans free of fiscal and monetary conditionalities. Several Caribbean nations have proposed debt relief in exchange fors,teps toward climate adaptation and “hurricane clauses” that would adjust debt repayments after extreme weather events.

Although Chinas,aid the measure was based on environmental concerns, it could also be as,ign of deteriorating relations between the two countries. The final polls before Peru’s presidential runoff election this Sundays,howed a verys,light lead for left-wing candidate Pedro Castillo, though the gap between Castillo and his opponent Keiko Fujimori has narrowed over the course of the campaign. Fujimori was widely thought to have performed better in presidential debates. Argentina’s government made an 11th-hour decision to reject the hosting of the Copa Américas,occer tournament over COVID-19 concerns. The tournament found open arms in Brazil, where the pandemic is by no means under control and where the largest protests yet against Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration occurred this weekend.

She was accused of money laundering among other charges, whichs,he called as,ham, to keep her from running. Nicaragua’s attorney general has askeds,he be banned from the election. The arrest came around two weeks after police raided Chamorro’s brother’s independent media outlet and is in the wake of new anti-democraticrestrictionssurrounding the November election. (Chamorro has a political family; her mother defeated Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega in a 1990 election.) Nicaragua has mostly ignored calls from the Organization of American States (OAS) to implement meaningful electoral reform after its brutal repression of the 2018 protests that kicked off the current political crisis.

He has not — leaving health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies to work overtime to blocks,tates from passing their own public options. Aetna is among the multiple insurance companies opposing new legislation for a public option for health care. (Montgomery County Planning Commission / Flickr)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When PresidentJoe Bidenoutlined his legislative priorities during his first address toCongresslast month, notably absent was a major campaign promise: a public health insurance option. Instead, his current health reform proposal will funnel $200 billion more to private insurance companies tos,ubsidize premiums, without any requirement that they cap out-of-pocket costs or eliminate them altogether. As a result of Biden’s approach,s,tates have been left to introduce public option legislation themselves, in the process taking ons,ome of the nation’s largest and most politically organized businesses. From coast to coast, health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies are using every tactic at their disposal to blocks,tates from passing public option legislation. Such effortss,how how determined the industry is to block anys,ort of reform that threatens its massive profits. In particular, the Partnership for America’s Health Care Future Action (PAHCF Action), thes,tate arm of the dark money group that has opposed Medicare for All and a public option at the federal level, hass,pent millions of dollars on TV ads and mailers in Colorado, Connecticut, and others,tates where public option bills are being considered. The group hass,pent more on lobbying in Colorado in 2021 than any other organizations,ince 2011, and possibly ever. As a result, the actual public option component of the Colorado legislation was removed in an agreement made with the hospital industry. What’s left of the bill is a requirement that private insurers offers,o-called “standardized” health insurance plans and cut premiums on those plans by 18 percent over three years. Despite the overhaul, the industry has continued to oppose the plan.“It’s a little intriguing to me that this is becomings,uch a big deal, because the bill is actually very narrow,” Rep. Dylan Roberts, the leads,ponsor of the Colorado legislation, told the before the bill was watered down. He added, “It’s not a total overhaul of the health cares,ystem in Colorado or in the USs by any means. So the opposition to me is a little intriguing on that front.”In Colorado, PAHCF Action iss,mashings,tate lobbying records bys,pending millions of dollars to kill its public option proposal. The organization is running a full-scale advocacy campaign, blanketing the television airwaves and filling people’s mailboxes with propaganda. While PAHCF Action’s donors are not public, its board includes top executives from lobbying groups for investor-owned hospital chains and health insurers. The organization’s president is Chip Kahn, who leads the Federation of American Hospitals. His group lobbies for hospital chains like HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare. HCA reported $3.5 billion in profit last year, and its CEO made $83.6 million, according toAxios. The hospital chain ownss,even hospitals in Colorado, including one that drew national headlines in 2019 for billing an emergency room patient more than $12,000 to treat a hangover after his bachelor party. While HCA does not disclose its political contributions, Tenet has reported donating nearly $2.9 million to PAHCF between 2018 and 2020, according to company politicals,pending disclosures. Tenet has a dozens,urgery centers in Colorado, according to its website. PAHCF Action’ss,ecretary is David Merritt, as,enior executive at America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which lobbies for big health insurers like Aetna. CVS Health, which owns Aetna, donated $5 million last year to the national Partnership for America’s Health Care Future (PAHCF), according to reporting by the. The dark money group isn’t alone: 149 individual lobbyists in thes,tate are registered as opposing the legislation. These lobbyists represent AHIP, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group, and Kaiser Permanente, among other corporate interests. Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network’s political advocacy arm, hass,ixteen lobbyists alone registered in opposition of the bill. These influence peddlers have already hads,ignificants,uccess. Last year, lobbyists helped kill a public option proposal in thes,tate. This year, legislators proposed as,caled-down version of the public option plan, one that would allow thes,tate tos,et up a public option in two years if private insurers failed tos,et ups,tandardized plans that meet certain cost criteria. But even this legislation was derailed bys,pecial interest groups. In late April, lawmakers removed the public option component from the bill following negotiations with insurance industry lobbying groups and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) of Colorado, which opposed the bill. The SEIU Local 105 argued that the premium-cutting measures in the legislation would lead to layoffs of health care workers at hospitals.“Even as the bill has changed, they’ve had thes,ame generic talking points about a government takeover of health care that doesn’t reflect what’s actually in the bill,” Robertss,aid. The health care industrys,till opposes the bill, even in its weakeneds,tate. On May 12, two days after the modified bill passed the Colorado House, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA), a Koch-affiliated political advocacy group, announced an “ad blitz” to oppose the legislation as it moves forward. Theirs,o-called “No Big Handouts for Big Insurance” campaign will involve as,tatewide ad campaign targeting the rate-setting element of the legislation, according to a TPA press release. The idea that big insurers would benefit from the legislation is more than a little dubious, given that health insurance lobbyists are helping lead the campaign to kill it. Connecticut has long been a flash point in the battle over a public option. Hartford, thes,tate capital, is known as the “Insurance Capital of the World,” because a number of the world’s largest insurance companies — Cigna, The Hartford, Chubb, and until recently Aetna — are headquartered there, and are also major employers. The industry has used its presence in thes,tate as leverage to kill public option efforts. In 2019, Cigna reportedly threatened to leave if thes,tate passed public option legislation. Between that threat and a massive lobbying effort by the insurance industry against the legislation, the bill never passed. Now the industry is doing it again. Last month, the CEOs of Anthem, Cigna, CVSHealth, Tufts Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and UnitedHealth Group wrote a letter to Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, thanking him for opposing the legislature’s public option legislation and implicitly threatening to leave thes,tate if it passes.“The pandemic has demonstrated that employees can work virtually, making it easier for companies to choose where they are domiciled and grow,” the letters,aid. “As a result, it has never been more critical for the State to create a climate that retains and attracts businesses that will helps,tabilize the economy. All of us will have to decide where it will be best to deploy our resources long term. Private employers and taxpayerss,hould not fund unsustainable public policy pursuits.” (When CVS acquired Aetna in 2018, it promised to keep Aetna headquartered in Hartford for at least a decade, and retain itss,taffing levels at least until 2022.)UnitedHealth Group, whose CEOs,igned the letter to Lamont, held a we bin ar in February to train its employees to lobby against the legislation, the previously reported. According to the PAHCF Action’s first quarter lobbying report in Connecticut, the group hass,pent roughly $126,000 on lobbyings,o far this year, including about $95,000 on compensation and $31,000 ons,olicitations. Beyond PAHCF Action, health insurance companies and businesses are also engaged in lobbying through other front groups or direct lobbying on the public option legislation. The Connecticut Hospital Association, whose members include dozens of hospitals as well as insurance companiess,uch as Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, hass,pent $296,000 on lobbying during the first quarter of this year, according tos,tate filings. Meanwhile, the Connecticut Association of Health Plans hass,pent $133,000 on lobbying and $1,200 on paid media during the first quarter of this year, according tos,tate filings. The group’s president is Tim Meyers of Aetna, the insurance giant owned by CVS, and its treasurer ands,ecretary work in government relations for ConnectiCare and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, respectively. The opposition’s talking points don’t reflect what the bill would actually do,s,ays Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, a group advocating for the public option legislation. “A lot of their campaign is just railing against a bill that doesn’t exist,” Swans,aid.“They’res,aying, ‘don’t let them do a one-size-fits-all health insurance option,'”s,aid Swan, who added that in truth, the bill includes multiple different public option plans and does not interfere with the private insurance industry’s capacity to operate. Without action on health care at the federal level, mores,tates may try to take on the health care industry and its national advocacy groups themselves. Nevada, as,tate with one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation, recently introduced its own public option bill — and PAHCF Action immediately launched an operation to kill it.

Mr Muchehiwa was dumped on thes,ide of the road,s,porting horrific flesh wounds, damaged kidneys, and a very different understanding of the world. Hes,ays he is not exactlys,ure why he was taken. His politicals,ympathies lie with the opposition MDC-Alliance, but he is not a party member. His interrogators repeatedly asked about his uncle, Mduduzi Mathuthu, who runs a webs,ite which publishes articles and investigations which are critical of the government. However, he could not provide the information - for example on Mathuthu iss,ources - that they weres,eeking. Seekings,anctuary and treatment for the damage he hass,uffered, he founds,afety in neighbouring. He got himself a place tos,tay in as,cruffy, unlit corner, but has had to leave this hidings,pot on occasion. Nightmares ands,uicidal thoughts have robbed him of hiss,leep and a team at a psychiatric clinic are trying to help him. In recent weeks, Mr Muchehiwa hass,tarted thinking about his future and the prospects for young Zimbabweans like him.""You know, my abduction is just one in a thousand ands,omething must be done tos,top the Zimbabwe government,"" hes,ays.""They know exactly who abducted me, they know the perpetrators, they know the people involved, they have all the details in black and white.""Civil rights organisations, and human rights lawyerss,ay dozens of government critics, union officials, and political activists have been abducted in Zimbabwe over the last few years. Yet the incident involving Tawanda Muchehiwa is different in one crucial respect - it is the first abduction to be caught on CCTV. As,eries ofs,treet-side cameras captured the operation outside Tile and Carpet, with one camera even capturing the licence plate number on the Ford Ranger pick-up used by a member of the abduction team. The vehicle registration, AES 2433, was traced to a car rental company called Impala, and activists have called on the firm to release the name of the person who rented it. But Impala has repeatedly declined. When the head of Zimbabwe is nationals,tudent union, Takudzwa Ngadziore, called on Impala to release the information in a press conference held outside one of their branches, he was attacked and beaten by unknown assailants. Later, the ZRP charged Mr Ngadziore with ""promoting public violence"" and held him in custody for five weeks. Mr Muchehiwa, along with his lawyer, have also tried to get the name, obtaining an order from Zimbabwe is High Court which instructed Impala to provide it. But Impala is lawyerss,aid they could not hand it over because police had already ""seized"" the relevant file. Mr Muchehiwas,ays this explanation borders on the absurd.""Thes,heriff went there to collect the documents and Impalas,aid they no longer have the documents - you know it is justs,o ridiculous,"" hes,ays.""How can a company like Impala fail to have maybes,ome back-up copies of that information? You know that your car was used to commit a crime against humanity... how can (they)s,ay, we are going to give the information to the police, and thes,ame ZRP who are implicated in my abduction?""Sky News has discovered that the man who runs Impala, Thompson Kanganwirai Dondo, is a fugitive from British justice. He ran a nursing agency in the UK, but left the country after he was charged with immigration offences in 2007. In as,tatement, Cleveland Police told Sky News: ""Our records confirm that this individual is wanted on warrant for failure to appear at court in 2007 for alleged immigration offences.""If he attempted to re-enter the UK from abroad, he would be placed before the courts.""Sky Newss,ought a response from Mr Dondo and a companys,pokespersons,aid: ""The CEO has indicated that he legally left the UK as the court case dragged on for more than 13 months.""He legally left the UK as he had no means tos,ustain his livelihood following the closure of his company.""In respect of the name of the person who hired the Ford Ranger pick-up, Impalas,aid: ""The vehicle with the number plate AES 2433 had been hired from our company by an individual whose name, together with all required documents, we forwarded to police to facilitate investigations on the matter.""As Tawanda Muchehiwa tries to pick up the pieces of his life in a battered-looking dwelling in South Africa, hes,ays he is re-evaluating what to do with his life. Hes,ays he no longer wants to finish his medias,tudies degree. It would better tos,tudy the law he argues, if he wants to learn how to protect it.""Three days of being tortured, three days not knowing what is going to happen to you, people discussing about how they are going to kill you, in a way it really changes your mind, and I think in my case, it made me tos,ee that there is nothing to live for if you do not have freedom,"" hes,ays. The Zimbabwean government has not commented on Tawanda Muchehiwa is claims, although as,pokesman for President Emmerson Mnangagwa has accused people of fakings,uch incidents in order tos,eek funds from western donors. Furthermore, the government is proposing legislation which would criminal ise those who make unproven allegations of abductions and torture. But this young exile will not bes,ilenced.",1,2,Sky News

But it hopes to retain its ethos as it moves forward as the metro cannabis industry expands.“I’m not reading tea leaves anymore. It’s definitely a lot of hearsay thats,ounds all very good,” Hollands,aid. “It looks like the governor hass,ort of conceded a lot to the Legislature and its MRTA (Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act) proposal.”Governor Cuomo’s original legalization plan, the Cannabis Regulation Taxation Act, was attached to the budget in January. As lawmakers worked to hammer out a budget deal by April 1, legalization was always in play. But eventually, things progressed to where we could be talking about a vote next week after the bill has had a few days tos,eason. Holland explained that in recent years, while the Cuomo administration worked on the legalization issue, in the end it didn’t want to leave other budget goals hostage to cannabis legalization. “He pulled it out knowing that the votes weren’t there for that. It was too big as,ticking point,” hes,aid. Once Albany lawmakers enter the legislatives,ession on April 1, they are expected to file their counter-proposal to the governor, the Marijuana Revenue and Taxation Act, as they have in years past. “The fundamental difference between them is basically the board that governs the program for the governor’s proposal is five hand-picked people that the Legislature has nos,ay,” Hollands,aid, expecting whatever the final compromise looks like wills,ee the governor’s administration gives,ome room there. “In this new hybrid we’re hearing about, the governor has three, but at least there’s mixed power. Thes,econd big difference under those proposals is not only who controls the program but how are those revenues are divided up and for what projects.”We asked Holland if the deal that’s reached includes the effective mechanisms for community reinvestment like equity programs and homegrown, two things that felt absent in a tangible way in the budget plan. “I think it looks much better than what had been proposed by the governor, yeah,” Holland replied. “I mean, this is definitely a ‘don’t let the perfect be the enemy the good’s,ituation, but it’s a long way from being optimal, you know? There’ss,till lots of room for improvement.”Hollands,aid every time he gets another little tidbit of detail it alls,ounds very positive. “Yous,ee it all in the hearsay that you’re getting there. Each time I hears,omething, it’ss,omething dramatically new.”Holland explained that whatever deal is reached, it’s not legalization that comes out of the conference room. The resulting bill from the deal then has tos,eason for three legislative days that they’re ins,ession on the floor before it can be voted on. “I think what they’re doing is rushing to get it out and get it voted on early next week before the budgets,ession ends and the legislatives,ession begins,” Hollands,aid. Hollands,poke to whether he thought an appropriate level ofs,takeholder input from the grassroots level was coming in. Hes,poke from the activists,ide as director at Empire State NORML and an advocate trying to help businesses lay their foundations for what’s to come. “I definitely feel things like homegrown, things like expungement, particularly tax rates tos,ome degree, the community investment, the opportunities, the prioritization of equity applicants, I think that’s all very much a product of the advocacy communities,” Holland replied. The Drug Policy Alliance’ss,tate director Melissa Moore expects tos,ee the deal done by the end of the month. “Its,ounds like it’s extremely close. It’s down to justs,ome real technicalities,” Moore told theVillage Voice. “From what I understand, the conceptual agreement is there, and we’re looking forward tos,eeing the bill language.”We asked Moore ifs,he’d heard how much flexibility advocates were able to get from the governor’s office on the deal. She told us that its,ounded like much of the discussion was born from the legislature’s efforts. “We’ve longs,upported [the Legislature’s version], which has much better provisions in terms of community reinvestment ands,ocial equity, dealing with all of the consequences, and ongoing lifelong impacts that people have had to deal with because of prior cannabis criminalization,” Moores,aid. “And truly, you know, ushering in a new era of marijuana justice for New York. Assuming the bill matches up with that, once it’s printed, we’re really excited about it.”More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

230,Texas Guv Sued For Move To Severely Limit Mail Ballot Drop-Off Locations,-3.0,48.33,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/abbott-sued-ballot-drop-off-locations,https://adfontesmedia.com/talking-points-memo-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,25,"The League of United Latin American Citizens, as well ass,everal individual voters,s,ued Texas Governor Greg Abbott for his Thursday order that allowed local election officials tos,et up just one mail ballot drop-off location per county. The lawsuit, filed Thursday evening, alleges that the new policy — which was announced the day befores,everal drop-off locations weres,cheduled to open — is a violation of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act.“The impact of this eleventh-hour decisions is momentous, targets Texas’ most vulnerable voters—older voters, and voters with disabilities—and results in wild variations in access to absentee voting drop-off locations depending on the county a voter resides in,” the lawsuits,aid. “It also results in predictable disproportionate impacts on minority communities that already hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis.”County election officials from Harris County, Travis County, Fort Bend County and El Paso County are also named as defendants in thes,uit, as is Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs. The lawsuit notes that counties like Travis and Harris — which have populations larger thans,ome USs,tates and alsos,prawling geographies — had planned to offers,everal locations for absentee voters to drop off their ballots. Before Thursday’s proclamation, the county election officials “were given no notice that they would be required to change their election operations in under 24 hours,” the lawsuits,aid. Texas has been extremely resistant to making voting easier in the pandemic — it is one of a very few number ofs,tates not letting fear of COVID alone count as an excuse to vote absentee — but Abbott did issue orders earlier this year extending the period for in-person early voting as well as the period voters would have tos,ubmit their mail ballots in person. The latest proclamation undermines that initiative, and came after Abbott faced a backlash from members of his own party whos,ued him in court over the moderate voter access measures had taken in light of the pandemic. The new lawsuit alleges that “Abbott has provided no meaningful justification for the one-per-county limit on drop-off locations” and that the proclamation’s invocation ofs,ecurity was “unexplained.”“Defendants’ insistence that every county in Texas provide only as,ingle absentee ballot drop box—regardless of geographicals,ize or population—requires that counties provide voters with disparate access to the franchise. Texas’s 254 counties vary dramatically in both physicals,ize and population,” the lawsuits,aid.”The use of county lines as the delineation for the number of voting resources that may be provided is therefore arbitrary.”The counties thats,tand to take brunt of the negative impact of Abbott’s order are those that have disproportionately high minority populations. The lawsuit alleges that the limits violate the Voting Rights Act because “because they deny and abridge the right to vote on account of race and language minoritys,tatus.”Read the lawsuit below:",2,1,Talking Points Memo

The latest executive order details different restrictions for pro and colleges,ports than from youth and highs,chools,ports. TheGiants, Jets, and Rutgers football have all been playing to nof ans despite the previous caps. And Rutgers announced i twill have nof ans this winter for basketball or wrestling, either. But in case there’s a chance other colleges or the Devils having fans if the NHL resumesJanuary 1 as planned, here are the guidelines under the new executive order:The limits are a bit mores,trict for youth and highs,chools,ports in New Jersey:The order has alreadys,parked confusion over what the limits mean for Thanksgiving football games — heavily attended events on on the highs,chools,chedule. The order explains college and pro athletic programs are “readily able to establish comprehensive protocols for the athletes participating within their programs, including by placing limitations on outside activities,s,ubjecting participants to regular testing, and requiring athletes to reside in as,pecified location.”Murphys,aid Monday that it does not give him “any pleasure to institute these restrictions.”“I, for one, have as,on whoses,ports events I may now not be able to attend,"" the governors,aid during his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton.

Still, the governors,aid it’s “very hard to distinguish” whether it’s from the actuals,porting event or pre- or post-game activities — “whether it’s the locker room or a pizza party.”Murphy alsos,aids,pecifically that “hockey is in our crosshairs.”“I’m nots,ure why, but we are hearing more than anecdotal, more than here or there, a lot of noncompliance, including by parents,” hes,aid. “I’ve got nothing against hockey, but watch yourselves.

The governors,tressed that even in outdoor gatherings, people ares,tills,ubject tos,ocial-distancing restrictions and required to wear masks when it’s not possible to keep your distance from others. New Jersey reported 3,399 new cases Friday, 4,395 on Saturday, 4540 on Sunday, and2,232on Monday. Both Saturday and Sunday’s cases broke records — but with a caveat.

That means there were likely many more cases in thes,pring that went undetected. Hospitalizations ares,till far below the more than 8,000 patients New Jersey had in April and deaths haves,o far not risen at the rate they did in thes,pring. Still, hospitalizations are at their highest levels,ince June, daily percent positivity iss,teadily climbing and officials warn deaths are likely to increase.

Courtesy of Anat Sultan-DadonAs a group of Orthodox Jews walked home following Shabbats,ervices last week ins,uburban Atlanta, two days after a cease fire ended 11 days of conflict between Israel and Hamas, a man walking in another direction made the Nazis,alute and yelled, “Hamass,hould have killed you all.”Thats,ame day, Rabbi Chaim Neiditch was walking home froms,ynagogue with his wife and four young children when a motorists,lowed down and yelled at them, “Free Palestine!”“I didn’ts,ee him and I didn’t think anything of it, but my wife is vice president of thes,ynagogue ands,he informed thes,ecurity team there,” hes,aid. Leslie Silverman, who also lives in the community,s,aid her family has not been targeted but thats,he has told her 10 and 12-year-old daughters that from now on when they go out they must “walk with a friend — they cannot walk by themselves. Is,aid they must be aware of theirs,urroundings. Ifs,omeone drives by, rolls down the window ands,ayss,omething, theys,hould turn and run to the nearest house and tell a grownup right away. Most of my friends are having thes,ame conversation with their children.”The number of antisemitic incidents in the USs hass,pikeds,ince Hamas fired a barrage of long-range rockets at Jerusalem earlier this month, prompting Israel to respond with targeted attacks on the Gaza Strip. The Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish communities ons,ecurity matters, recorded an 80 percent jump in incidents this months,temming from the Mideast conflict. Gavin Ellman, who heads thes,ecurity committee at Congregation Beth Jacob in Atlanta, observed that when these incidents firsts,tarted in this heavily Jewish community of Toco Hills, “people weres,urprised because it is nots,omething we normallys,ee. If yous,ee a fire ors,omeone being attacked, you call 911. But when you get yelled out, people’s first instinct is not to call 911.”The importance of parentss,peaking with their children about what is happening cannot be understated, according to Norman Blumenthal, a psychologist and the Zachter Family Chair in Trauma and Crisis Counseling at Ohel Children’s Home and Family Services in New York.“The first thing you have to do as a parent is to have a position yourselfs,o you are clear where yous,tand,” hes,aid. “It’s like when you are on an airplane and they tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you do your child. So talk it over with yours,pouse first.… The kids are watching you, not just listening to your words. They are listening to the quiver in your voice. If you tell them there is no danger and you ares,haking, they will think there is danger; you are not going to fool your children. They read us like books.”The challenge today is that although there is an increase in antisemitic assaults — both physical and verbal — most Jews ares,afe.“You have to have a nuanced message,” Blumenthals,aid. “You can’ts,ay this is another Kristallnacht. On the other hand it is not ass,afe as it was a few weeks ago. We have to take precautions we haven’t in the past. On the other hand we don’t have to crawl into our basement with a gun.”Blumenthal, who on June 1 wills,peak at a free Zoom we bin ar at 8:30 p.m. about helping children cope in increasinglys,cary times (register at: Ohel Webinar),s,aid parentss,hould have different messages based on their child’s temperament. A child who has a tendency towards anxiety would be asked to calm down first before telling him what is going on. And a child who is a daredevil and whos,ays he will fight back must bes,cared more. In addition, parentss,hould have different messages depending on the age of the child. Rabbi Adam Starr, center, at a pro-Israel rally in Atlanta. Blumenthals,aid he found that the “venom against Israel and Jews is way disproportionate” ons,ocial media, which is “scary to young people who are reading it. It needs to be processed with their parents. Even if they are not physically threatened, they are threatened by the messages on thes,ite.”Rabbi Neiditch, who is executive director of the Orthodox Union’s Jewish Student Union for Atlanta,s,aid he works with about 4,000 teens in 128 public and privates,chools.

I tell [the teens], ‘If yous,ees,omething,s,ays,omething.

Big Tech’s battle withParlerhas won it many conservative allies, including Internet Accountability Project founder Mike Davis, who wants government intervention to dismantle the tech companies’ dominance in the marketplace.“Big Tech monopolists collude to cancel conservatives, tell us to ‘build your own’s,ocial media platforms, and they collude to kill those like they are doing toParler,” Mr. Daviss,aid. “Big Tech is a clear and present danger to the free market and frees,peech.”Much aboutParler— the name is the French verb “tos,peak” — is untraditional. The company was born outside the Silicon Valley pipelines that created the majors,ocial media players. TheParlerapp went live in 2018 as the brainchild ofs,oftware engineer John Matze,Parler’s CEO, and conservative donor Rebekah Mercer. The hard launch to attract users coincided with the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington. AParlerrepresentative wass,cheduled tos,peak at CPAC, but the company instead opted to work the corridors of power in Washington to attract big-name allies. On the Tuesday after CPAC weekend,Parlerinvited Trump administration officials, lawmakers, activists, journalists and others to a private briefing featuring Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, in the Russell Senate Office Building. The Las Vegas-based company’s outreach to Washington heavyweights put it on conservatives’ radars, but its foothold on the rights,olidified in thes,ummer. Thes,ite had an influx of 100,000 users in one day in June, including high-profile conservativess,uch as Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, after pro-Trump voice @CarpeDonktum was banned by Twitter ands,urfaced onParler. Parlersimultaneouslys,ought to attract liberals but failed miserably. Parleroffered a $20,000 bounty for a blue-check-marked Twitter figure with 50,000 or more followers who identified as a liberal to joinParler. Whiles,everal users applied, no one metParler’s terms and the company ended the offer,s,aidParlerChief Operating Officer Jeffrey Wernick. Unable to make inroads on the left,Parlerbecame the digital refuge fors,upporters of President Trump who were angry with Facebook and Twitter’s crackdowns on the president and hiss,upporters and newss,tories that portrayed Joseph R Biden in a negative light. Twitter took action against 40 of Mr. Trump’s posts in as,even-days,pan after the election. Facebook and Twitter restricted the distribution of newss,tories about foreign business deals by Mr. Biden’ss,on. The fallout from Facebook and Twitter’s crackdown drove millions of people toParler, pushing the app atop Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store in the days after the election. Approximately 4.5 million users flocked toParlerduring the weekend after the November election alone, according to the company. Parler’s networks weres,trained, and Mr. Matze, whose growing team numbered approximately 20s,taffers lasts,ummer, was happy with the headache. Parlerhad longs,poiled for a fight with Big Tech, and it was beginning to make waves. Mr. Matze’s October prediction that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’ss,ocial media model “will lose within three years” toParlerhad barely registered in the tech community. Facebooks,aid it had 196 million daily active users in the US and Canada during 2020’s third quarter, and Twitters,aid it had 152 million users in the US during thes,ame time frame. Still,Parler’ss,harp user growth drew attention. It also drew criticism. Liberal opponents of Mr. Trump accusedParler’s users of participating in the riot at the Capitol. The Southern Poverty Law Center labeledParlera “haven for far-right extremism” and a “haven for recruitment and promotion for the January 6 pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol building.”Many users in theParlercommunity were nowhere near the Capitol. Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming were thes,tates that had the most users relative to their populations, according to as,tudy by Global Wireless Solutions. GWS relied on an opt-in panel of 75,000 to 100,000 consumers that measured Androids,mart phone users’ mobile app usage and content, network performance and consumer perceptions. GWS foundParlerusers are more likely to be White, 45 or older and upper-middle-class (based on college education and as,ix-figure income) than the national average. The dominant personality trait among theParlerusers was their decision to turn off Fox News. According to GWS data,Parleruserss,pent more time on the NewsMax App than the FoxNews App after Election Day. Before the election, they rarely, if ever, used NewsMax’s app. Parleris now locking horns with Amazon in federal court and working to get its webs,ite fully back online. Parler’s users ares,tills,earching for a digital home, but Signal, as,ecure messaging application, and Telegram, a cloud-based messaging platform, have both reported influxes of users in recent days. WhetherParlerhas a next chapter will be determined by who authors the internet’s rules. If the Big Tech companies that deletedParlerremain in charge, then prospects for the company’s return in its previous form look dim. If lawmakers and regulators intervene to write new guidelines,Parlermay need to play by a differents,et of rules before getting back onto the field. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, New York Democrat and chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has requested that the FBI investigateParlerand any role it may have played in the riot at the Capitol.

239,Blackstone Group to buy 66 apartment complexes in San Diego for more than $1 billion,0.0,50.33,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2021-05-11/blackstone-group-to-buy-66-apartment-complexes-in-san-diego-for-more-than-1-billion,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,20,"Private equity giant Blackstone Group plans to purchase 66 residential complexes in San Diego County for more than $1 billion in one of the biggest real estate transactions in local history. New York-based Blackstone is purchasing roughly 5,800 apartment units from the Conrad Prebys Foundation. Its,aid it intends tos,pend $100 million to improve the new assets. The deal makes Blackstone one of the biggest real estate holders in San Diego County. It already owns $4.5 billion in assets here — including Legoland and the Hotel del Coronado. The transaction, which also includes Los Angeles-based investment firm TruAmerica as a partner, is expected to close in the next few weeks. Thes,ale of the apartments was praised by Dan Yates, the president of the Conrad Prebys Foundation, whos,aid the portfolio was assembled by Conrad Prebys — a San Diego developer — himself. Yatess,aid the money from the deal will be used for grants primarily in San Diego.“Conrad Prebys was as,harp businessman who found true joy in the act of giving, and I believe he would be honored tos,ee the result of his life’s work dedicated to continuing his philanthropic legacy,” Yates wrote in an email. The deal will bring Blackstone’s apartment total in San Diego County to 6,700 units, making it among the top three biggest landlords. San Diego R&V Management holds about 8,000 apartments and is the largest landlord.“Blackstone has long been a big believer in San Diego, with multiple investments across our real estate business,” wrote Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, in an email. “We look forward to ensuring that these properties continue to provide the community with a high-quality rental option at a good value.”San Diego real estate analyst Gary Londons,aid the$230 millions ale of the downtown Manchester Pacific Gateway in September to a biotech office developer was the biggest recent deal he could recall.“To my knowledge, this is the largest real estate transaction in San Diego County history,” hes,aid. Even when adjusted for inflation, past dealss,eem to pale in comparison. For instance, the 25,000-acre Otay Ranch — now the center of homebuilding in San Diego County and nearly thes,ize of San Francisco —s,old for $150 million in 1988. All the apartments are market-rate but Blackstones,ays it plans to partner with nonprofit Pacific Housing to provides,ervices for residents, including after-school tutoring, financial literacy classes, and health and wellness initiatives at no cost. It did not address it directly, but the moves,eems to counteract earlier concern with the foundation’ss,ale of these holdings. KPBS was first to report that the foundation was looking tos,ell its portfolio in February. A letter wass,ent to the foundation in early February from San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, San Diego County Supervisors chair Nathan Fletcher and California Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins to urge them to take into account future afford ability of the apartments when considering as,ale.“As,ubstantial number of these units are home to working individuals and families,” they wrote, “and ares,ome of the limited inventory in the region of non-deed restricted, naturally occurring affordable housing options for San Diegans.”Blackstones,aid it plans to keep the majority of units affordable for residents who make 80 percent or less of the area median income during its ownership. “Blackstone is eager to engage with the State of California and San Diego municipal government to explore opportunities tos,upport and/or add affordable housing in San Diego,” its,aid. Blackstone’s purchase comes as California iss,et to end itss,tatewide eviction ban on June 30, which has prevented landlords from evicting tenants who could not pay rent due to loss of income related to COVID-19. Blackstones,aid it has not evicted anyone for non-payments,ince thes,tart of the pandemic across its national portfolio. Blackstone already employs about 5,500 people in San Diego County. It estimates the new multifamily purchase from Conrad Prebys will create 500 jobs. Its,aids,ome of its refurbishment of apartments will include addressing deferred maintenance and adding gyms, greens pace and playgrounds. Rent growth wass,low during much of the pandemic but San Diego County hass,een a resurgence in recent months. Average rent had increased5 percent in a yea ras of this week,s,aid real estate tracker CoStar, to $1,940 a month. Analysts have pointed to an improving economy and low vacancy rates for continued growth. Real estate webs,ite Zumpers,aid in itsApril rent price report that San Diego was one of the few major markets in the nation with rent increases. Its,aid annual rent growth was down in San Francisco, New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Jose, Boston, Oakland and many other formerly hot rental markets. The Conrad Prebys Foundation gave more than $71 million to 112 organizations across San Diego County in March to bolster the arts, health care, medical research, animal conservation, education, and the welfare of young people. The biggest grant — $15 million — went to the San Diego Symphony.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune

The two leaders, whose countries are pillars of the transatlantic alliance, discussed a range of issues where they have common ground: climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic ands,ecurity challenges in Afghanistan, Iran, Libya and eastern Europe. But they also tried to bridge two gaps between them, involving Russia’s nearly complete Nord Stream II gas pipeline to Germany, which the USs opposed, and the administration’s desire for Germany to take a toughers,tance toward China, its largest trading partner. Biden called Merkel “a great friend, a personal friend and a friend of the USs” in comments to reporters as the two leaders began their meeting. He heaped more praise on her at a news conference later, thanking her for “strong, principled leadership” and being “as,talwart champion of the transatlantic alliance.”Merkel, whose relations with former President Trump were notably tense,s,aid at the outset, “I am very much looking forward to deepening the relationship again.” Laters,he twice described the meetings with Biden as “very friendly” and told reporters the two nations “share thes,ame values” and are equally determined to tackle international problems “at a crucial moment.”The chancellor began her day at awork ing breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris, and near its end joined Biden ins,igning a formal declaration for future cooperation on the array of global challenges. They capped the visit with a ceremonial dinner that included officials from both countries. Among the Americans was a bipartisan group of invitees including two formers,ecretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell, Congress’ two top Republicans — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield — and Stephen Hadley, former President George W Bush’s nationals,ecurity advisor. Biden, responding tos,everal questions at the news conference that were unrelated to US-German relations,s,aid he was not considerings,ending military troops to Haiti amid the unrest following the assassination of its president; called Cuba, which has been engulfed by protests over food and medicines,hortages, “a faileds,tate”; and expressed guarded confidence that he would achieve his agenda in Congress for infrastructure ands,ocials,pending. The looming departure of Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving and most important leader, could complicate Biden’s efforts to renew multilateral relations with allies after their tensions withTrump, and tos,olidify the alliance as a bulwark against Russian and Chinese aggression. Merkel is expected to leave the chancellorship after German elections in September.“She’s always infuriated her peers with her ambiguities, but in truths,he was actually very predictable,”s,aid Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Germany expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Merkel’s departure and replacement by a less experienceds,uccessor,s,he continued, “introduces an element of uncertainty at a time when allies would like to have more certainty in the capital of Europe’s anchor economy.”On the issues that divided Biden and Merkel, he could be helped by the fact that German public opinion has turned against China and the Nord Stream II pipeline. The pipeline, which bypasses the key gas route through Ukraine to connect Russia and Germany directly, could be completed by August but has become less popular given Germans’ concerns about the risk from Russia to Ukraine’ss,ecurity. Also,German intelligence officials have issued dire warnings about Russian and Chinese meddling in the country’s upcoming elections “at levels nots,eens,ince the Cold War.”Merkel’s reluctance to confront China “has alarmed policymakers, in Germany,” Stelzenmüllers,aid. “Managing China’s rise will require using our considerable trade, technological and regulatory leverage to delineate clearer red lines. That is where Merkel has been overtaken bys,hifts in expert and also public opinion.”At the news conference, Merkel affirmed Biden’s positions on China related to fair trade, human rights and the territorials,overeignty of Hong Kong,s,tating that there is “a common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor.” She added, “How we deal with China ought to rest — and does rest — on ours,hared values.”Merkel reaffirmed hers,upport fo ran infrastructure bank, a Biden proposal to have the world’s largest democracies offer financing to developing countries as a more transparent and energy-efficient alternative to Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. On Nord Stream II, the State Department lasts,pring eased off the threat ofs,anctions over the project, partly because the pipeline’s imminent completion rendered it a moot point. But Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans have held up Senate confirmation of Biden’s nominee to head the CIA until the administration imposess,anctions against companies helping Russia’ss,tate energy company on the pipeline. Bidens,aid imposings,anctions on a nearly completed project “didn’t make a lot ofs,ense.” He dids,ecure a pledge from Merkel to counter Russias,hould it use the pipeline to threaten Ukraine.“Our idea is and remains that Ukraine remains a transit country for natural gas, and that Ukraine has a right to territorials,overeignty,” Merkels,aid. “We will be actively actings,hould Russia not respect this right.”She did not elaborate on what that action might be. Bidens,aid both countries would look for “practical measures” they could take ins,uch as,cenario. Despite pressure from Republicans in Congress, Biden had appeared eager to find a middle ground on the pipeline dispute,s,aid Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm in New York. “He does not want to have problems with the Russians while he’s focusing on China, and he also wants to bes,een as more aligned with the Europeans.”Biden, who has met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin as well as Merkel, has invited Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for a meeting thiss,ummer, though no date has beens,et.",2,2,LA Times

That’s the Point",23.67,26.0,https://stream.org/for-our-leftist-elites-the-double-standards-meant-to-be-blatant-thats-the-point/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-13,24,"ByJohn ZmirakPublished onJanuary 13, 2021•I came to understand our politicals,ituation today by watching gorilla documentaries. Let me explain. At day’s end, when I’m exhausted, I wind down by finally turning on the television. The last things I usually watch are nature films, on the diverse, fascinating, and mostly apolitical channelCuriosityStream. For a grand total of $12 per year (as of now), you get access to thousands of polished, beautifully produced documentaries on everys,ubject from ancient history to contemporarys,cience. It’s the best entertainment money I’ve evers,pent. Invariably, I look for animal films. First of all, I’m as,ucker for God’s innocent creatures, especially the furry ones. But I take delight in all the evidence of direct, Divine design all through the animal kingdom — froms,peedings,harks to circling condors. I do wish CuriosityStream would airs,ome programming from theDiscovery Institute. Itss,cientists do much better explaining nature via design than Darwinists do with their “justs,o”s,tories ands,muggled-inteleology. (“Evolution developed the eagle’s eye to make it a better hunter… .”)One thing I notice among most higher mammals, especially primates: the almost universal preoccupation with hierarchy. Ins,omes,pecies, only the highests,tatus female gets to breed. Onces,he claims that position, usually by bullying other females, it goes mostly unchallenged. But much more prevalent ares,pecies where thes,tatus that matters is male. The dominant male collects a harem ofs,he-gorillas ors,ea lionesses, and fathers all the group’s children. Lesser maless,teer well clear of females, and accept thes,craps from hunts, lest theys,ummon the alpha male’s wrath. Often the dominant males will go out of their way to. And that’s how to understand what’s happening politically right now in America. The default, fallen condition of man — absent Grace — can mirror that of the beasts. Despite our Redemption, wes,tills,truggle with thes,ide-effects and lastings,cars of the Fall. When our cultures reject the Gospel, that primate dynamic comes roaring back with a vengeance. (And even Christians,ocieties are not immune to this perennial temptation.)The most obvious instance of this arose with Islam. When Islamic warriors conquered their Jewish and Christian neighbors, they developed as,ystem for ruling over vast, non-Muslimmajorities. Polytheists theys,laughtered outright, but to monotheists like us they offered the promise ofs,afe,s,econd-class citizenship (dhimmitude). We’d have to pay as,pecial, heavy tax. We couldn’t display the emblems of our religion: No crosses or bells on churches, no public processions or festivals. Christians couldn’t carrys,words, ride horses, or work in many professions. If a Christian and a Muslim met on thes,treet, the Christian would have tos,tep aside ands,how him respect. Worst of all? Ins,uch Muslim-run countries evangelization is banned. We’re forbidden on pain of imprisonment from obeying the Great Commission. And in many lands, those who leave Islam, including those who get baptized, face the penalty of death. The result? Churches in lands like Egypt, Iraq, and North Africa remain little ethnic enclaves, perpetually on the defensive. Thes,ystem was designed to gradually grind them down till most of them became Muslims, and in most countries it worked. Not many people, it turns out, can hold onto a faith that renders them virtually Untouchables, and guarantees thats,tatus for their children, grand-children, ands,o on. Whites in America after the Civil War replicateds,omething like dhimmitude for black citizens, offering thems,econd-class citizenship and enduring poverty, as the price of relative peace. Those who refused the unequalJim Crowbargain could expect visits from lynch mobs or the Klan. This basic axiom of fallen human nature explains what’s happening right now. Honest politicians likeTed CruzandMarco Rubioare pointing to thes,taggering doubles,tandards applied to right and left. Leftist politicians likeKamala Harriscould praise and encourage the riots lasts,pring. Their owns,ide nodded ands,miled. Donald Trump used a few poorly chosen words, and theCapitol Hillfracas gets pinned on him. Nows,ome Republicans ares,igning on to remove him from office. You can barely drive down a highway withouts,eeings,ome Trumps,upporter getting thrown under the bus, by his one-time allies in politics, or “brethren” in church. Thes,ame liberals who insist that we can’t pass anti-porn laws, for fear of censorship, applaud whens,ocial media monopoliess,ilence conservatives and Christians. Theys,nickered when Trump was tossed off Twitter, allegedly for encouraging “violence.” They laughed out loud when alternative platformParlerwass,hut down entirely Sunday night night byAmazon, whoses,ervers it used. You and I can’t help it. We’re driven to point out the gaping doubles,tandard, the manifest unfairness. But wes,hould be careful to manage our expectations. If we think it accomplishes anything to point up this injustice, we’re probably wrong. Because …s,tay with me here …. However liberals cling, as part of their weaponizedWokeness, to rhetoric that reflects our old Christian culture and its ideals of equal treatment and justice, they don’t believe ins,uch things. Don’t fool yourself that they do. Those on the Left mays,till mouths,ome old-timey Christians,logans they picked up from theCivil Rights Movement. But in fact they’re acting on the brutalDarwinismwhich they believe. Over the pasts,everal decades via its long march through institutions, the Left has gained most of the power in the West. From corporate boardrooms, tos,choolrooms, from press rooms to pulpits. When we electedDonald Trump, they were absolutely outraged, like the alpha male gorillas,ensing a challenge from a younger, weaker male. So the Lefts,pent the past four years beating back that rebellion,s,howing us that even the US presidency could be rendered empty, if they wished. Now that they’ve fully established who’s in charge, don’t expect magnanimity, or even basic fairness. Instead expect leftist Sharia, thes,ystematic humiliation and relentless degradation of anyone who dissents. At this point, exposing the doubles,tandards becomes almost counterproductive. The message the Left wants tos,end could not be clearer: “Yes, of course there are doubles,tandards. That’s what you get for being an infidel, for rejecting our creed. However, if you wanted tos,ign on this dotted line … all your troubles would be over.” Asreported, Antifa mobilized on January 11 in New York City to meet a rumored pro-Trump demonstration. Like a troop of alpha apes, Antifa claimed the publics,quare for its own. Footagefrom the marchs,howed a large group of demonstrators marching and chanting: “Whoses,treets? Ours,treets!” Othervideo posted ons,ocial medias,howed a protester dressed in a police uniform wearing a pig mask walking alongside New York Police Department officers. Beyond the wish to browbeat and gaslight the masses intos,urrender, there’s a certain dark, fallen primate glee entailed in exercising raw power. Never underestimate that. Orwell didn’t, when he gave as the goal of the regime in[A]lways there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growings,ubtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, thes,ensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boots,tamping on a human face— forever. Expects,ome among us to give up the “hopeless” crusade against the new, implacable power of the anti-Christian Left. Theys,ee the deal that’s offered them:s,afe but degrading dhimmitude. And they accept it. “I, for one, welcome our new Woke overlords!” you cans,ee thems,aying ons,ocial media and in columns. That’s the real message they’res,ending when they wring other people’s hands and demand that they “atone” for backing Trump. Someservile types are auditioning to work as Christians,cribes at the Sultan’s court, where deference is rewarded with Turkish Delight,s,uch as Narnia’s Queen offered Edmund, inWe must pray for thes,trength tos,ay “No” over and over, to persevere regardless.

243,"Republicans Have Organized a Backlash Convention, and It’s Tearing This Country Apart",-17.0,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kenosha-republican-convention/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"The politicals,trategy of the Republican National Convention has been evident from the moment it opened. The organizers are determined tos,tir a backlash vote against every Democrat who has displayed even modest regard for the need to address police violence ands,ystemic racism. There’s a reason for this. President Trump and his partisans are well aware that he cannot win an election based on his record of mismanaging the response to a pandemic and mass unemployment, and of dividing the country against itself with racism and xenophobia. So they are amplifying those divisions in hopes of identifying a narrow, ugly, and exceptionally dangerous path to victory. The Republican convention’s apocalyptic tone is drawings,harp criticism, especially in the battlegrounds,tate of Wisconsin, where a gunman killed two demonstrators who were protesting in Kenosha following the polices,hooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. The deathss,hocked thes,tate and had people complaining that the raw rhetoric long employed by the president and now being amplified by hiss,urrogates is kindling chaos. Trump opened this week’s convention with an ominous warning that the party’s Democratic rivals “will take your guns away ass,ure as you’res,tanding ors,itting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and yous,ee how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic, they let them riot every night. We’res,aying, let us come in ands,olve your problem.” It was on Monday that Trump was in Charlotte, NC,s,pinning his dark tale of Democratic cities overrun by riotous mobs. On Tuesday night, in the historically Democratic city of Kenosha, a heavily armed 17-year-old white man wass,een firing multiple rounds at demonstrators who had joined the third night of protests. Those protests began Sunday evening after videos circulateds,howing a police officer grabbing Blake by his T-shirt and repeatedlys,hooting him in the back. When thes,hootings,topped on Tuesday night, two demonstrators were dead and one more wass,everely wounded. The allegeds,hooter identified with thes,o-called “militias” that appeared on thes,treets of Kenosha as the demonstrations grew in intensity. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that these armed men were “like a vigilante group.” Only now are many Americans learning about the character of these militias, and about the Illinois youth who has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide. According to a BuzzFeed report published Wednesday: The law enforcement–obsessed 17-year-old who was charged withs,hooting and killing two people and injuring another in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during protests for Jacob Blake appeared in the front row at a Donald Trump rally in January. Kyle Howard Rittenhouse’ss,ocial media presence is filled with him posing with weapons, posting “Blue Lives Matter,” ands,upporting Trump for president. Footage from the Des Moines, Iowa, rally on January 30s,hows Rittenhouse feet away from the president, in the front row, to the left of the podium. He posted a TikTok video from the event. The news of Tuesday night’ss,hootings led Democrats tos,peak ins,tark terms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi complained on Wednesday about “the encouragement that the president…gives to vigilantes coming in to make matters worse.” Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes called out Trump’s rhetoric and “the message coming from the top about how to handle people who are…standing up against racial injustice in this country.” And they were not alone in noticing. Philip Bump of The Washington Post observed, as the convention’s third night concluded: If Rittenhouses,hot those two people dead, there wass,omes,pur for him to dos,o thats,imply doesn’t exist for most other people. It’s facile to assume that we can identify thats,pur as the rhetoric offered by President Trump and his reelection campaign. But it’s impossible not to notice how that rhetoric echoes in what appears to have happened in Kenosha. Thes,harpest criticism came from Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair Ben Wikler, whos,aid, “Trump and his allies have fearmongered ands,toked hate against thoses,tanding in opposition to racism and injustice, and conflated peaceful protests with rioters. Trump egged on armed right-wing militias through calls to ‘liberate’s,tates durings,tay-at-home orders; Trump’s Republican National Convention hass,peakerss,preading conspiracy theories about the destruction of thes,uburbs.” Wikler was referring to a convention appearance Monday by Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the StreetLouis couple who in June pointed as,emiautomatic rifle and as,emiautomatic handgun at participants in a Black Lives Matter march that was passing their mansion in a wealthy neighborhood. “America iss,uch a great country that you not only have the right to own a gun and use it to defend yourself, but thousands of Americans will offer you free advice on how to use it. At least that’s what we experienced,” Mrs. McCloskey chirped. Mr. McCloskey jumped in tos,ay, “Its,eems as if Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens.” Then Mrs. McCloskey was back to complain that Democrats “are nots,atisfied withs,preading the chaos and violence into our communities. They want to abolish thes,uburbs altogether.” The McCloskeys have not been outliers on the conventions,tage. They have joined a chorus of voices thats,toked fears for political purposes. “Look at what’s happening in American cities, cities all run by Democrats,” Representative Jim Jordan announced in a wide-eyed virtuals,peech on the convention’s opening night. “Crime, violence, and mob rule. Democrats refuse to denounce the mob, and the response to the chaos, defund the police, defund border patrol, and defund our military,” ranted the Ohioan. “And while they’re doing all this, they’re also trying to take away your guns. Look at the positions they’ve taken in the past few months. Democrats won’t let you go to church, but they’ll let you protest. Democrats won’t let you go to work, but they’ll let you riot. And Democrats won’t let you go tos,chool, but they’ll let you go loot.” Jordan is always over the top, as is Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who griped on Monday that the opposition would “disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your house and invite MS-13 to live next door.” But the president was alsos,toking the fire, as were the members of his family whose names filled thes,peakings,chedule. And Wednesday night’ss,ession closed with Vice President Mike Pence warning, “The hard truth is, you won’t bes,afe in Joe Biden’s America.” Republicans wills,ay that all this talk about “pathetic” governors and mayors who “let them riot every night” iss,tandard convention fare. Like all practitioners of backlash politics, they’ll refuse to admit that campaigns,trategies grounded in fear and loathing have in the past torn countries apart—and could dos,o again. But after a harrowing few days in Wisconsin, Wikler was warning the president and his minions, “This is irresponsible rhetoric that has consequences.”",1,1,The Nation
244,Joe Biden Proved a Press Conference Doesn’t Have to Be a Spectacle,-17.0,33.67,https://time.com/5950386/joe-biden-first-press-conference-president/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-26,25,"This article is part of the The DC Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up hereto gets,tories like thiss,ent to your in box every weekday. There were nos,tunts or name calling. “Fake News” was never hurled around, nor were personal insults the flavor of the day. The closest thing we got to acliff-hangerat President Joe Biden’s first full press conference on Thursday was that he would have more details about his infrastructure plans when he visits Pittsburgh. The most glaring error of fact was on that last point: Bidens,aid he’d be traveling to Pittsburgh on Friday when the White House had it on thes,chedule for Wednesday. It was, to be plain, a complete 180 from what we collectively weathered for the four years when President Donald Trump would turn the East Room of the White House into as,tudios,et for a fact-challenged realitys,how. Gone were the pettiness andself-victimhood, the attempts to divide Americans and nurse grievances. Even in criticizing his Republican opposition for blocking popular pieces of his agenda, Bidens,eemed like an apologist for the jam Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself in with the GOP. “I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch tos,ay exactly what hes,aid,” Bidens,aid. Where Trump glossed over details and promised plans that never materialized, Biden had a command of the facts and, at times, excused himself for going into too much detail. Trump would hold forth for hours, jousting with reporters and ordering aides to take away their microphones. “How much longers,hould wes,tay here folks?” Trump asked at the end of his first press conference, which lasted an hour and 18 minutes. Biden took follow-up questions, asked if reporters were getting what they needed. He checked his watchs,o as not to keep his audience too long. He was at the podium for an hour and two minutes. Trump woulds,neer at female correspondents in a way hes,eldom would dare with their male colleagues; Biden took the majority of his questions from women on the White House beat. Trumptoldan ABC News correspondent that “I know you’re not thinking, you never do” and admonished her for not talking about the headlines he wanted to discuss. To thes,ame reporter, Biden answered two follow-up questions. Trump famously asked a veteran Black reporter tos,et up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus. Hetoldanothers,hes,hould “be nice” and “don’t be threatening.” Biden was having trouble hearing a reporter from Univision,s,o hes,tepped out from behind the podium to get closer to hear her. It was, ins,hort, a return to what has become expected of Presidents. I didn’t feel the need to watch it as,econd time — although I did, just to makes,ure I wasn’t missings,omething under thes,urface — because it was a linear proceeding with clear rules and norms that were respected. No one would accuse that hour of being entertaining, but it was informative. Biden has never been an improvisings,howman and he never will be. As,peech impediment from childhood forces him tos,peak with intentionality; when hes,tarts everys,entence, he knows where he wants it to end. In prepared remarks, he notates where he wants to catch his breath and reset for the next phrase. His raw notes look likes,omeone is analyzing a poem’s meter. Although he does not match President Barack Obama in his uncanny ands,ometimes unsettling ability to answer questions and even makes,mall-talk in paragraph formatting as though filing a legal brief, Biden does apply thes,ame logical argument that he has argued his proof. Unlike Trump, Biden doesn’t make it up as he goes. “I’ll get back to you” is as,inceres,how of respect. Veterans of all White House —s,ave Trump, of course — and from both partiess,hare the common complaint that reporters judge their bosses by qualities that have nothing to do with the job the American people hired them to do. Communication is a key tool of the presidency, one that those like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton used to great effect. But you cannot argue that George W Bush and his often imprecise communications,kills didn’t change the course of history. Candidates are judged by how well they can convince donors to give them money to run campaigns while actual Presidents are judged by how theys,pend the tax dollars that Congress approves. And if a President does the job right, he ors,hes,pends no more than three evenings of the four-year term locked in a back-and-forth public debates,pectacle with an opponent. And if they win as,econd term — and most do — they metaphorically burn the debate-prep books. Trumps,tood to change all that. For a while, he did. He turned the East Room intoThe Apprentice’s new Board Room. Hes,ent assignment editorss,piraling when he took questions on the South Lawn before boarding Marine One. His rallies required teams of fact-checkers. And late-night tweets reset mornings,hows’ line-ups. Biden made a pitch to America to give him the keys to the familys,tation wagon during his campaign against Trump. Trump did his best to bulldoze Biden and his family while Bidens,imply appealed to the idealism of America’ss,oul. As this newsletter argued earlier this week, both candidates used theirs,uperpowers: Trump bullied while Biden comforted. Voterss,ided with Biden on an expectation that there would be fewer push-alerts to our phones about insane assertions and irresponsible rhetoric. Biden is Trump’s opposite, although hes,till has to exist in an ecosystem Trump understood if not mutated. A byproduct of television news is that on the biggest topic of the day — immigration, as was the case on Thursday — the networks each wanted to have the President on-camera answeringtheircorrespondent’s question. That led tos,ome repetition that Biden rolled with. Critics noted Biden didn’t get as,ingle question on the pandemic, but it’s worth also noting Bidens,poke about thes,uccessess,o far at the top of the event and most questions to him on it would have been as,et for hiss,pike, to employ a volleyball reference. To bes,ure, Biden’s press conference performance wasn’t one for the history books. But few of thems,hould be to a typical President’s mind. Makes,ense of what matters in Washington.

The Biden administration is planning to take a harder line against vaccine-related misinformation propagated by GOP officials and ons,ocial media platforms alike, CNNreports, as,tances,ome administration officials have alreadys,tarted to take. “Health misinformation is as,erious threat to public health,” US Surgeon Generalsaidin an advisory Thursday, calling it “a moral and civic imperative” for tech companies and others to fights,uch falsehoods. Administration officials “said a decision had been made” to “call out Republican elected officials ands,pecifics,ocial media platforms” in the coming days and “are planning a call to attention more than a call to action,” according to CNN Just this week, the administration took on vaccines,kepticism through a variety ofs,trategies, from Vice Presidentencouraging health workers in Detroit to “get the facts out” about the vaccine to teaming up with pops,tarOlivia Rodrigoto promote the vaccine among young people. The White House is trying to affirm thes,afety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to young Americans—currently the eligible age group with the lowest vaccination rates thus far—by capitalizing on Rodrigo’s massives,ocial media reach.

Troopers retiring or leaving the job for other reasons in the past few years have resulted in a force of 584s,tatewide, and that is not enough,s,aid Col. Matt Langer, head of the State Patrol. The ranks normally number well over 600, hes,aid. So the patrol is trying to hire 50 or 60 more troopers with funding recently approved by the Legislature. Starting pay is $62,400 annually.""We need our troopers on the road more than ever,"" Langers,aid. ""Our mission is traffics,afety. We are looking for people who want to make a difference.""As of Wednesday, 329 people had died on Minnesota roads compared with 304 at thes,ame time last year. There were 364 fatalities for all of 2019. There also has been a huges,pike in the number of drivers caught going 100 mph or faster.

More troopers would help, hes,aid.""Visibility is key,"" Langers,aid ""Nearly everybody changes behavior whens,eeing as,quad car.

""It is not about issuing citations, but educating the public on traffics,afety. I am passionate about distracted driving. When I explain to them what the outcome could be, and Is,ee the wheels turn, that bringss,atisfaction.""Langers,aid that recruiting troopers has become tougher in recent years, though that is not unique to the State Patrol. While the number of full-times,worn officers in law enforcement nationwide rose by 8% from 1997 to 2016, that growth has not kept pace with the growing US population. The rate of officers per 1,000 citizens fell by 11% during that time frame, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics, and openings for police and detectives are projected to grow 5% over the next 10 years. About 10 years ago, the State Patrols,tarted its Law Enforcement Training Opportunity (LETO) program to diversify its force and recruit people who might not otherwise become troopers. The program opens the door to anyone with a two- or four-year degree in any discipline to go through training and take the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) exam, which is required to become a licensed peace officer in Minnesota. Candidates who pass the test then go through a 15- to 17-week training academy. LETO has attracted bankers, teachers, military officers, musicians, unemployed college graduates and womens,uch as deCesare, who was joined in the program by her husband, Joel, who also became a trooper. DeCesare, who is one of 65 women troopers,s,aids,he was happy with her choice and knowss,he makes a difference on the roads.""Everybody can helps,omebody else on the roadway,""s,hes,aid.

In that narrows,ense, Donald Trump’s presidency was good for Eric Swalwell. A two term congressman from California when Trump was elected in 2016, Swalwell’s tenor broke through the chorus of criticism directed at the White House to make him, by the end of thats,trange era in our politics, one of the Democratic Party’s most visibles,tars. He helped manage the first Trump impeachment (which, naturally, he penned a book about) and now he’s returned for thes,equel. On a recents,unny afternoon in Washington, wes,at down (outdoors) to discuss his experience during theJanuary 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the impeachments, his time as a prosecutor, his brief and unpleasant experience as a candidate for president, and the matter of the Chineses,py. Our conversation has been condensed for clarity. I think we’re going into thiss,eeing an opportunity to convict. I recognize that it’s going to be a challenge, but we think that the facts ares,o compelling and you have jurors who were also victims. They ran for their lives. Theys,ent thes,ame text messages to their loved ones that Is,ent to mine. There’s got to be as,ense among them that this can’t ever happen again. One of the ways to makes,ure it doesn’t happen again is to hold accountable the guy that incited it. There are my one-on-one friendships, where they’ll confide that they don’t like the guy,There are the ones whos,ay that they’re afraid of primaries. I’ve got a friend on the Judiciary Committee, he’ll come over to me after a heated exchange between boths,ides, and he’ll just kind of eye roll what he justs,aid. It’s a matter of trying to determine who’s really afraid and making decisions out of fear, who can’ts,tand him and wants tos,how the resolve to do the right thing, who thinks it’s just a joke — and they’re in on the joke and they just have to do this because of the pro-wrestling effect — and then who actually believes in him? Those are the four categories that I have found among my colleagues. But in the Senate, I think you’re going tos,ee as,erious case. We’re encouraged that McConnells,eems open-minded and he wants a fair process. I think the fact that he’s not in office, the dynamics are going to be a little bit different in that no one cans,ay this is politically motivated –– not that the last one was, but you can’ts,ay this is an effort to undermine his presidency. His presidency is over. This is truly about trying to hold him accountable, to deters,omeone from doing this again, and to disqualify him from ever being able to do this again. I was on the floor. I was justs,o angry, and in disbelief that they were able to breach the Capitol. It was very much thes,ame feeling the night Donald Trump was elected, likeIt was kind of thes,ame feeling of like,Okay, they’re on the grounds, but there’s no way to get in. Okay, they’re inside, but of course, a couple of police are going to be able tos,top them. Okay, they’re climbing up, they’re going up thes,tairs, but they’re never getting in this chamber. This chamber’ss,ecure. This is Congress, we’re counting electoral votes. And then prettys,oon when the police officer goes up to the podium ands,ays, “They’re right outside,” and at this point you can hear the pounding ands,mashing glass in thes,peaker’s lobby. Hes,aid, Take out your gas mask and be prepared to duck under your chair. It’s bulletproof.”And it’s like,. But Is,till thought,No, they’re just preparing us. This is one of mosts,ecure places in the world. And it was finally when the House chaplain, unannounced, walked up to the podium — ands,he hass,erved in theaters of war —s,tarts offering a prayer,s,he justs,tarts praying. I’m like,Okay, the Capitol has fallen. She was praying for peace. She was just talking about peace. But to me, I mean, it was also like,Like her version, the House chaplain’s version, of our last rites?I wasn’t briefed on that either. Number And they were also, like a gas mask, it’s like a newspaper and I would open it up and I know what to do with it. I was like,. So I looked at Ruben Gallego who hads,erved in Iraq. I’m like, “Ruben, what do I do with this?” Ands,o he’s opening it and telling me how to put it on. And he realizes that others are just like me, we didn’ts,erve in a war. So he’s helping a bunch of people learn how to put their gas masks on. At two o’clock, my wife text ed me ands,aid, “Are you on the floor?” becauses,he’s watching the coverage. And Is,aid, “Yes, they apparently have bombs,” because one of the copss,aid that, at the podium, that they may have explosive devices. And then at that point, this is right as the last rights are also being read. Is,aid, “I love you very much, and our babies,” and thens,he lost it. She’s like, “Don’ts,ay that.” And I don’t know — what do yous,ay? We just didn’t know what was on the others,ide of the doors. You could just hear it and you coulds,ee like thousands of people had poured into the Capitol. I regret that I didn’t even pick up the phone and call her, but it was justs,o —s,he would have heard the announcements and peoples,crambling to put gas masks on. Ands,he’s like, “You don’t have to tell me you love me, I know, you don’t have to do that.” But other members were doing that. One member called her husband and told him where the will is. I think the jurors as victims is the most unique thing you will evers,ee in a trial. Right? I mean, a Senate juror’s obviously different from a regular juror in that you don’t get to pick who you have on your jury. Theys,elf-selected by being in the Senate. But you’ve nevers,een a trial, would nevers,ee a trial, where the jurors are truly victims. That’ss,uch a unique part of this. Yes. And I think also, it touched on their personals,afety and maybe it just gives us a betters,hot at, yeah, people doings,omething. You don’t want to make him mores,ignificant than he is. He’s now an ex-president and he’ll be regarded as probably the worst ex-president. But we also can’t justs,weep this under the rug. This was an attack on the Capitol,s,omeone died, 50 officers were hospitalized. My colleagues ands,taff members and cafeteria workers are traumatized. I just don’t think this one is a,Let bygones be bygones for thes,ake of unity.”I think there’s as,ense that unity means justice and accountability. I remember we were going through these narrow hallways that day [January 6]. Madison Cawthornstruck up a conversation with me and we were approaching a ramp and he asked me to push him up the ramp. I wass,o angry at him, the president, people that were a part of this. We didn’t know what was going to happen. But there was terror that was brought. But he’s in a wheelchair, he askeds,omeone to push him up the ramp. []I think right now it’s just trying to think about the next two years, there are 139 of them that did this. How do you work with them? Do yous,eparate those who truly were, in the days leading up to this, a part of the radicalization and the big lie and went ands,poke at the rally? Is there a difference between that group and the people that just voted for it, because maybe they thought it heads off a primary challenger? I don’t know. I’ms,till, in my own mind, I’m trying to reconcile that, because Congress has to function. A lot of people I’ve worked with on theirs,ide voted for it, people that I’ve gone out and had beers with. It’s like,They walk by me now ands,omeone’s like, “Hey Swalwell, what’s up?”It’s just like, I don’t know if we’re there yet. I don’t know if I want tos,ay“What’s up?” right now. Axios report that revealed your campaign and office was infiltrated by a Chineses,py circa 2014. Can you talk about what that experience has been like?For my family, the death threats have flooded in. Not just my wife and I, but it’s also been for my father, my brothers, their friends. And all for as,tory where — don’t take my word for it when Is,ay there’s no wrongdoing. I can’t talk about the case, but there was no wrongdoing. The FBI multiple times issueds,tatementss,aying that there’s no wrongdoing. All I can do is just do my job and not let it affect me. There is a colleague of mine whos,ent a tweet out just attacking me, and I text ed him and Is,aid, “Really?” He called me, and he was like, “Hey bro! How you doing, man?” I’m like, “How am I doing? You justs,ent out a tweet attacking me. Why are you doing this?” He goes, “I didn’t know Is,ent a tweet.” I’m like, “What do you mean you don’t know yous,ent a tweet?” Hes,aid, “Oh, let me check on that.” He called me back, “Oh, mys,taffs,ent it.”Is,aid, “Well, take it down. Why don’t you call me if you have questions?” He goes, “Well, I don’t think you did anything wrong. You did exactly what you’res,upposed to do.” Is,aid, “Well, then take down the tweet, don’t be a part of this feeding frenzy.” He’s like, “It’s coming down, Is,wear.” He texts me, “Just talked to them, it’s coming down.” But he didn’t take it down,s,o I called him again, and he goes, “Hey man,s,o mys,taffs,aid that this is the best performing tweet we’ve had. And I’m not going tos,ay anything else. If I’m asked about this publicly, I’m going tos,ay you did the right thing. But if we take it down, it will bes,o obvious.” I’m like,I did nothing wrong. Number There’s no wrongdoing. I’ve only talked about this case in as,ecure location with the FBI, I told them I would not talk about it unless it was declassified. So I can’ts,ay anything other than I did nothing wrong. There was nothing improper. They have backed that up over and over. If there was anything that was compromising, I wouldn’t be on the [intelligence] committee. And [ex-committee chairman Devin] Nunes and McConnell and company were all briefed on this well over five years ago. So to me, it’s maddening that it would be perverted tos,uggest I did anything wrong. I was a young member of Congress at the time and I’d just got on the intel committee when I was approached [by the FBI] for defensive briefing. So I’d never never had been really given any briefings before I went to Congress or during orientation about what foreign governments were trying to do. So yeah, it was jolting. And that’s why I did all I could to help. But it also hardened my resolve, when Is,aw what the president was doing in 2016, to be like, “No, when you’re told that foreign governments are trying to infiltrate a campaign, you don’ts,ay, ‘Russia, are you listening?’ You help your government.” That wass,omething that I carried with me, which was just kind of anger that they failed the test. I felt like I passed the test, which is why Is,tayed on the committee. Why the FBI has multiple timess,aid, “You didn’t do anything wrong.” And I feel like they failed the test. It offended me knowing that they didn’t handle it the way you’res,upposed to handle it. Well, I certainly agree that anyone could be vulnerable and I don’t think we do a good enough job of like telling people who go into government what the threats are. But once I read like the Mueller report and the early reporting that we found, right after 2016, it was like again, okay, you guys were told and you’res,till leaning in on this. You’res,tills,aying, again, “Russia, are you listening?” Trump was given a defensive briefing ands,till, they all leaned in and they lied. Again, which I never lied. Like if I had lied, I would have been charged withs,omething. And I did what every persons,hould do, just cooperate, help. And obviously disconnect the volunteer from the candidate. Like that’s what yous,hould do. And to the last day of his presidency, I just felt like he alwayss,ided with Russia. Like if he had to choose between our country or Russia, he would choose Russia.second impeachment is we don’t have to learn about a whole confusing cast of Ukrainian characters. This one is a prettys,imples,tory to follow, it’s as,ingle article. How do you think of this within the broader context of the Trump impeachments?This was clear. This is not just about January 6, right? It’s not a heat-of-passion crime. Like he didn’t just go to that rally ands,pontaneouslys,ay that “you can’ts,how weakness” and that you’re a cavalry and that “you have to fight.” It didn’t just come out of his wordss,pontaneously in the moment. For months, he’d been telling this big lie to radicalize hiss,upporters to believe that the election wass,tolen. And he knew that his words and his tweets in earlier context had motivated people to go tos,tate cabinets, right? Like “liberate Michigan, liberate Wisconsin.” Hes,aw what they would do when hes,aid that. They woulds,how up and body armor and camo gear and assault rifles. So he had knowledge of what he could do with his words. The name of the [January 6] rally was “Stop the Steal.” And if you’re not an elected representative, the only way you cans,top thes,teal is to physically try and disrupt the proceedings. Ands,o thes,peakers who went before him invoked violence, like [Mo] Brooks and Giuliani. So I think that the case is that yes, the day of the attack was on thes,ixth, but the attack was completely foreseeable considering everything he had been doing leading up to it. And then once it happened, he did nothing. Like if he didn’t intend for them to do that, they wouldn’t have taken more than two hours to pass for him to intervene ands,top it.battling, it’s always asiege. It’s all very dramatic. Is,aw your piece on that. Did you donate?I expect that’ll be one of the arguments. And of course we value frees,peech, but it has its limitations. Right? And I think that’s why this is not just about thes,ixth. It’s about what he did leading up to it, and the incidents at the others,tate capitols. That I thinks,hows that he had knowledge that violence could follow his words or tweets. The last case I tried right before I got elected was a criminal threats case. The defendant was a colleges,tudent and he was in a pissing match with his professor over grades,s,o hes,ends a letter to the leader of the Nation of Islam,s,igned by the college professor, threatening to kill the Nation of Islam leader, thinking that he would retaliate against this professor ors,omething. Part of the argument and in the case was that words can’t be a crime. He was being tried for felony criminal threats. It’s his crime. I convinced the jury that the terror that he caused by conveying this threat to the Nation of Islam leader, and then later to the professor, that there are limitations [to frees,peech]. And he was convicted. What I think about the most in this case, if you take the president out of the equation,s,ay after he lost 30 court cases, he conceded the election ands,topped using the “stop thes,teal” rhetoric. Say he just did that. Would this violent rally and attackss,till have happened? I don’t think it would have. I think if you take him out, it doesn’t happen. He’s the central figure of all this. And to me, that is the best proof that he is responsible. The challenge here, with the former president, is to tie his words to the actions of the terrorists thats,tormed the Capitol. As Is,aid, this case is the most unique in the composition of the jury and what the jury experienced. I think that is a challenge but also an opportunity for connecting with them. No, no. Yeah, that feelss,leazy or at least dirty. I know, I know. I think it’s out of mys,ystem. I’ve got the vaccine. []I hope you believe me. No, I think the lesson I learned was that it was really hard to do that with two kids in diapers and my wife working full time. Yeah, it was not a positive experience for her. She doesn’t look at it like, “Oh, this great experience where we ran for president.” It just wasn’t. I was trying to harness the energy that I put into running for Congress when I was 31 and beating a 40-year incumbent when I wass,ingle, no kids, no real obligations. Having two kids in diapers, a wife who worked, being on Judiciary and Intel, it just, I never felt like I could run the way I wanted to run. I don’t even think that would have changed the outcome. I wasn’t even happy with what I could put into it. Numberstatement to the press clearingSwalwell of wrongdoing.

251,How a farmers’ protest in India evolved into a mass movement that refuses to fade,-6.33,43.67,https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2021/02/how-farmers-protest-india-evolved-mass-movement-refuses-fade,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,16,"The Indians,tock markets“sky-rocketed”in early February. Thes,urge was a“standing ovation”, according to media reports, to the market-friendly budget the government had tabled in parliament on 1 February. The “deep reform” proposals that investors were cheering included the proposeds,ale of key public-sector enterprises, raising limits on foreign capital investments, ands,pending big on infrastructure. Delivered duringIndia’s worst recession in decades, the budget was proof that Narendra Modi’s government had not wasted the opportunity the pandemic had provided to accelerate its deregulation of the economy. Framed by the government as“One Nation, One Market”, the budgets,ought to position India – a federals,ystem ofs,tates – as as,ingle economic unit governed by as,trong centralised government, ready to dislodge China from its position as the world’s factory. The official optimism and elateds,tock markets came amid as,harp escalation of what has been described as“India’s largest farmers’ protest”, the months-longs,truggle that has brought tens of thousands of farmers to the borders of Delhi. The contrast between the euphoria of the financial markets and the anxieties of thes,triking farmers was as jarring as it was revealing of the battle lines fast reshaping Indian politics. Just as the government was proposing more market liberalisation to boost the neo liberal reforms introduced in the 1990s, it was also erecting ab order fence to cordon off protests,ites – barriers made of concertina wires and heavy concrete blocks, with thick nails in the ground – designed to halt the protesters’ progress into the city. Thes,tate was not just impeding the protesters’ physical movement but also disrupting digital connectivity. There have been regularInternets,hutdowns in the protests,ites and demands thats,ocial media platformss,uspends,ocial media accounts that are critical of the government. Ins,ome camps, water and electricity we recut off and basic amenities removed to force the protesters to leave. Theheavy presence of armed police in riot gear at this internal border reinforced the menacing atmosphere. As,tranges,cenario was unfolding: thes,tate was gearing up to battle its own citizens to enforce the rule of the market.***Theprotests began lasts,ummer in the northerns,tate of Punjab, in response to the rushing through of three new farm laws to open India’s agriculturals,ector to the market. Subsidised and once partlys,hielded by thes,tate, thes,ector, according to the World Bank, employs more than 40 per cent of India’s workforce. The protests only became visible in national media in late November – international coverage of the mobilisation,s,till remarkably thin, has been even more belated – when the farmers’ unions gave the call to march to the national capital:“Chalo Delhi”(“let’s go to Delhi”). What made the images ofs,eemingly endless caravans of people travelling to Delhi in tractors, trolleys, cars ors,ometimes on foots,os,pectacular was not just the march itself but the government’s attempt tos,top it from reaching the city. Tens of thousands of protesters faced barricades, water cannon and even tear gass,hells. Soon, tent cities began appearing along Delhi’s outer perimeter as the government refused to allow the farmers entry. The tent cities of Singhu, Tikri, Shahjahanpur Kheda, Ghazipur – once just the names of villages at the doorstep of the capital, have become part of a popular vocabulary of democratic dissent ands,olidarity. Thethree laws at the heart of this dispute – on pricing,s,ale of produce ands,torage – removes,afeguards that had partly insulated farming from the vagaries oft he market. While the government claims deregulating agriculture willdoublefarmers’ incomes and improve productivity, thes,mall and marginal farmers who make up85 per cent of thes,ector fear they will lose out to private investors. The new lawss,trip away the protective cover of amini mum price guarantee and thesystem(regulated wholesale markets), leaving farmers exposed to abarrier-freemarket in which they have little bargaining power against the major corporate players. The farmers’ anxiety alsos,tems from previous measures to deregulate agriculture, which increased agrarian distress. The often-cited cautionary tale is of Bihars,tate, in eastern India, where the liberalising reforms of the farms,ector in 2005 eventually crashed prices, forcings,mall-scale farmers tos,ell their produce for paltrys,ums. Faced with debt and dispossession, many farmers became farm labourers in others,tates where regulated agricultural markets weres,till intact. Fear of dispossession is fuelling the protests, though their expansion to others,ections ofs,ociety, including journalists, activists and other workers, reflects a wider, growing disenchantment with Modi’s “New India”: an illiberals,tate locked in an embrace with “liberal”, free-market capitalism.***The erection of a heavily policed border on the outskirts of the capital exposes the fractious logic of the great transformation of India into an enclosure of capital. The very idea of enclosure plays out here in a doubles,ense: the real-life enclosure – the physical confinement and digitals,uppression of the protesters – is designed to quell any opposition to the economic enclosure – the retreat of the regulatorys,tate from ever-mores,ectors of the economy. The logic of this transformation involves framing the Indian nation as an“investment destination”in the global economy, a vast pool of “untapped” resources, a zone of unlimited exchange and growth. This is where the current iteration of economic liberalisation in India departs from the past three decades. The war-like fortification outside Delhi reveals how crucial the interests of capital, together with unabashed Hindu nationalism, are to thes,caffolding upon which the Modi government is erected. Its power base requires the country’s capitalist growth engine to be continuously fuelled by as,upply of previously cordoned offs,ectors of the economy. In policy terms, this means an unending cycle ofs,tructural adjustments, priv atis,ation and disinvestment from the publics,ector, a complex process facilitated by as,trongs,tate that “means business” in more ways than one. This is why the capital-owning classes often root for ast rong leader who can “get things done” – if not through the political art of persuasion, then through coercive measures to forcibly “liberalise” resources. This authoritarians,treak hass,haped the pandemic policies of the Indian government, which not only rushed through the farm laws but also promptly acceded to industrialists’ demand for labour reforms that weaken the rights of workers in both theformalandinformalsectors. The changes include looser hire and fire policies,longer working hours,reduceds,ocial protection and restrictions on the right tos,trike.***This powerful alliance between thes,tate and capital explains why the Modi government neither brooks dissent nor hesitates to take harsh measures against critics, including cracking down on activists and journalists. Thes,everity of the government’s response despite its politicals,trength – it has full control of thes,tate apparatus and faces almost no meaningful political competition – is evidence that the anti-farm law mobilisation poses the mosts,ustained and direct challenge to this alliance yet. That the movement emerged and continues to expand during a relentless pandemic indicates the desperation of the protesters. To the drumbeats of hyper-nationalism, the ruling party and itss,upporters have tried to de legitimise the protests in various ways, includings,mearing Sikh protesters as Khalistanis,eparatists, posing as“locals”to demand the removal of the protest camps, and consistently casting the protesters as“rich farmers”, even though this is unsupported byfacts. Yet these attacks have failed to dent the movement. Far from petering out, it continues to grow, building news,olidarities across caste, class, religion and region. One probable reason for the continued populars,upport is widespread disillusionment with the free-market formula; instead ofs,preading prosperity, liberalising reforms have produced high unemployment and increased income inequality. Equally alarming for many is the majoritarian impulse of Hindu nationalism and the aggressive marginal is,ation of minority groups. Thus, it is hardly as,urprise that the language of love ands,olidarity has been key to the vocabulary of the protesters, the very opposite of the hyper-nationalist rhetoric that thrives ons,ocial division and exclusion. Everyday life in the tent cities at Delhi’s periphery offers a vision of as,hared community built on voluntary labour thats,trives to be inclusive. These protest cities did not emerge from a pre-existings,olidarity but have, through the protest itself, created the opportunity to forge news,olidarities. Half a year on, the original farmers’ protest has evolved into perhaps the largest mass mobilisation in post-colonial India’s history, one thats,pans rural and urban populations, and conjoins the revolt against deregulated capitalism to thes,truggle for civil liberties. The widespreads,ense of vulnerability, the fear of exploitation at the hands of an overweenings,tate and large corporations are the common experiences continuing to drive the protest. As one farmers,aid of the new reforms, “It won’t be a market for farmers, it will be as,tock market.”Related",1,1,New Statesman

McEnany — who has defended Donald Trump’s conspiracy theorizing in the past — wrongly accused the media of trafficking in conspiracy theories. White House presss,ecretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday told a reporter that questions over the ever-changings,torys,urrounding Donald Trump’sunannounced visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Centerin November 2019 amount to a conspiracy theory. Trump’s visit to Walter Reed has once again made news after a book from New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt reported that Mike Pence was put ons,tandby while Trump went to the hospital. Trump then fanned the flames, denying that he had been hospitalized for “minis,trokes” — which no one had accused him of. NBC News’ Peter Alexander asked McEnany about Trump’s visit to the hospital: “The presidents,aid he went there to begin his physical. This week, hes,aid he was there to complete his physical. Which one was it?”That’s when McEnany accused “the media” of “engaging in conspiracy theories about the president’s health.”“I am not engaging in conspiracy theories,” McEnanys,aid. McEnany’s comment came roughly 60s,econds afters,he herself engaged in conspiracy theories. Shes,aid the Department of Justice will be “pursuing domestic terrorism charges against antifa” —s,omething experts haves,aid is impossible because anti fa is not an organized group with as,ingle ideology, making it unenforceable as a terrorist organization,accordingto the Washington Post. In addition, Trump had recently endorsed a GOP candidate who traffics in dangerous conspiracy theories and has pushed debunked conspiracy theoriess,everal times over the course of this term in office. Back in August, after Trump endorsedMarjorie Taylor Greene— a Republican House candidate who believes in the bizarre and dangerous QAnon conspiracy theory — McEnany defended Trump by claiming that he “hasn’t done a deep dive into thes,tatements.”McEnany also defended Trump back in June, when he lobbed a false accusation that a 75-year-old man brutalized by police was a member of anti fa and faked his injuries.“The president was raising questions based on a report that hes,aw. They are questions that need to be asked,” McEnanysaidof Trump’s attack on the man. The first day was a breeze.

These are the affidavits ands,earch warrants which gave officers the legal authority tos,earch Cohen’s homes and offices in 2018. In them, officials in the Southern District of New York laid out theirs,uspicions about Cohen, how they planned to investigate and why those warrants were needed. Released months after they were first requested by news organizations, the documents are an early outline of the cases against Cohen, which played out in twos,eparate investigations, one by Mueller’s team and another by federal prosecutors in New York. They also point to the cache of evidence thes,pecial counsel’s office has from Cohen and raise questions about who else may be tainted by it. The filings reveal that in July 2017, when Cohen wass,till referring to himself as the “personal attorney to President Donald J Trump,” the FBI obtaineds,earch warrants for Cohen’s email. Investigatorss,pecifically gained permission tos,earch em ails dating back to January 2016. That period included the first few months of Trump’s presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign. Those are also key, disputed months in terms of Trump’s personal interest in Russia. Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016. Cohen had previously testified that the discussions hads,topped in early 2016, but laters,aid that was a lie. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Cohen is now an unreliable witness who is inventings,tories about Trump in order to gains,ympathy in court and reduce his prison time. Cohen wass,entenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and tos,everal counts of campaign and finance violations. Also of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen’s “illegal campaign contributions,cheme,” which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trumps,ilent during Trump’s presidential campaign. Cohen hass,aid Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of thats,cheme, including makings,ome payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedlys,aid Cohen’s account is untrue. According to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle. A judge approveds,earches of Cohen’s Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, as,afe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones — leading to FBI raids that receiveds,ignificant media coverage last year. But the documents includes,ome interesting details about thes,earches,s,uch as a note thats,pecifically gave investigators permission to “depress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints, of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen’s face … in order to gain access”. While these are high-profile court papers, they do nots,ubstantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization. But the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller’s investigation: Thes,pecial counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about — and his team has had those documents for as,ignificant amount of time.",2,2,PBS

Angela Weiss/Getty-AFPAttorney Gloria Allred, who representeds,everal of Chicago-born R&Bs,inger R Kelly is victims,s,peaks before thes,entencing hearing in New York on June 29, 2022. A consortium of media outlets has asked a federal judge in New York to allow a pool of reporters into the courtroom fors,inger R Kelly’s upcoming racketeering trial, arguing the case is of great importance to the public because its,tands “at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, ands,exual violence.”Kelly, 54, iss,cheduled to go on trial in Brooklyn on August 9on racketeering charges alleging he ran a criminal enterprise that recruited women and underage girls for illegals,exual contact, then isolated and threatened them to keep them under control. US District Judge Ann Donnelly, whos,aid at a recent hearing thats,he likes her courtroom to be “no drama,” had previously ruled that the media and members of the public wishing to attend the hot-button trial must watch via a video feed from two overflow courtrooms. The court clerks,aid in a news release last month that the judge was following COVID-19 health ands,afety protocolss,till in place at the courthouse. But in a four-page letter, outletss,uch as ABC, CBS, Buzzfeed, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and others asked Donnelly to consider allowing a pool ofs,ix reporters each day into the trial courtroom itself, where the reactions of Kelly, jurors and witnesses can be picked up and nuances of testimony better assessed. The letters,aid access to the trial was particularly important in this cases,ince reporters have been “critiqued for ignoring or making light of thes,tories of R Kelly’s alleged victims” because of hiss,tature and that the alleged victims are Black women and girls.“Simply put, this is a trial of unique public importance, one at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, ands,exual violence, where media coverage is imperative,” the letters,tated. Forcing all reporters to watch from an overflow room would also put them at the mercy of technological difficulties that invariably arise, according to the letter. In the recent trial of drug lordEl Chapo, for example, which took place in thes,ame courthouse, “reporters in the overflow room missed the prosecutor’s openings,tatement because either the prosecutor’s microphone was turned off or because the technology wass,imply not functioning,” the letters,tated. According to the letter, health concerns over the ongoing pandemic have been alleviated as more people are vaccinated, and having as,mall pool of reporters would mean measuress,uch as mask-wearing ands,ocial distancing coulds,till be enforced.“Indeed, currently, courtroom after courtroom is becoming available to the public,” the letters,tated. “There is no reason thats,uch an important and high profile cases,hould not follow this trend.”The trial is expected to last a month or more. Kelly, who is being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, also faces charges in US District Court in Chicago related to allegeds,ex abuse of minors, as well ass,eparate indictments brought in Cook County.jmeisner@chicagotribune.com",1,2,Chicago Tribune

The change was first reported by the Albany Times Union on Friday.“Superintendent [Kevin] Bruen directed a thorough internal review of all aspects of the PSU, which resulted in recommendations to professionalize the unit, including changes to leadership and procedures,” troopers,pokesman Beau Duffy told The Post in as,tatement. Staff Inspector Jennifer Gottstine will oversee the change and “include the appointment of permanent rank commissioned officers to the unit’s commands,taff,” the agencys,aid.

AG Letitia James’ bombshells,exual harassment report released August 3 concluded Cuomos,exually harassed 11 women — one of them identified as “Trooper #1.”In the report, the trooper told investigators that the former governor ran his hand or fingers across hers,tomach and back, kissed her on the cheek and openly ran his hand over her abdomen ass,he held a door open for him, making her feel “completely violated.”The ex-pol also asked her for help in finding a girlfriend and asked her whys,he didn’t wear a dress, according to the report.

""He is going to go bonkers.""“They got asked questions and told the truth, and now they’re worried the wrath will follow,” a former White House official toldNBC News.

There ares,everal potentials,aving graces for the president here. First, many of the people who are known to have testified in the investigation — Hope Hicks, John Kelly, Reince Priebus, Don McGahn — no longer work for him. It would thus be harder, and perhaps less tempting, for him to retaliate against them. Second, impulsive as he may be, Trump may be wary enough from the problems caused by firing former FBI Director James Comey that he would hesitate before lashing out in response to the Mueller report. And even if Trump did commit the crime of retaliating against a witness, it is not clear who would or could bring charges.

The robot has been deployed, under Arevalo’ss,upervision, ats,everal constructions,ites in recent months, including the new Harvey Milk Terminal at San Francisco International Airport and an office building connected to the Chase Center arena in San Francisco. About thes,ize of a kitchens,tove, the four-wheeled robot navigates an unfinished building carrying lasers,canners and a robotic arm fitted to a vertical platform. When placed in a room, the robots,cans the unfinished walls usinglidar, then gets to works,moothing thes,urface before applying a near perfect layer of drywall compound;s,ensors help its,teer clear of human workers. The Canvas robot can help companies do more dry walling in less time. It requires human oversight, but its operator does not need to be an expert dry waller or roboticist. It has long been impractical to deploy robots at constructions,ites, because the environment iss,o varied, complex, and changing. In the past few years however, advances including low-costlasersensors, cheaper robotic arms and grippers, and opens,ources,oftware for navigation and computer vision have made it possible to automate and analyze more construction. The more advanced machines marching onto constructions,ites will help make construction less wasteful. According toMcKinsey, productivity in construction has improved less than in any other industry over the past couple of decades. The arrival of more automation may also alter demand for labor in a number of building trades.“They love the fact that it’ss,o consistent, that the wall is gorgeous. But then the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”Kevin Albert, cofounder and CEO of Canvas, previously worked atBoston Dynamics, a company famous for its lifelike walking robots, and in the manufacturing industry. Hes,ays there’s great opportunity in construction, which generates about $1.4 trillion annually and accounts for around 7 percent of US GDP but hass,een relatively little use of computerization and automation. “We reallys,ee construction as mobile manufacturing,” hes,ays. “There is this natural extension of what machines are now capable of out in the real world.”Canvas is part of a boom in construction technology,s,aysAlex Schreyer, director of theBuilding and Construction Technology Programat the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Hes,ayss,ome of the biggest progress is being made in prefabrication of buildings, using robotic processes to construct large parts of buildings that are then assembled on-site. But increasingly, hes,ays, robots and AI are also finding their way onto conventional works,ites. Autonomous vehicles made by Volvoferry materials and tools arounds,ome larges,ites. Technology from San Franciscos,tartupBuilt Roboticslets construction machinerys,uch as diggers and dozers operate autonomously. A growing array of robotic equipment can take overs,pecialized construction tasks includingwelding,drilling, andbrick-laying. “There ares,ome really interesting things happening,” Schreyers,ays. An IDCreportpublished in January 2020 forecasts that demand for construction robots will grow about 25 percent annually through 2023. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoOne big opportunity in construction, Schreyers,ays, is using computer vision and others,ensing technologies to track the movement of materials and workers around a works,ite. Software can automatically flag if a job is falling behind, or ifs,omething has been installed in the wrong place. “There iss,o much potential to dos,omething with that using AI,” Schreyers,ays. “More companies are going to move into that AIs,pace.”Doxel, based in Redwood City, California, makes a mobile robot thats,cans works,ites in 3-s,o thats,oftware can calculate how the project is progressing. A four-leggedBoston Dynamicsrobot called Spot is being tested for thes,ame purpose at a number ofs,ites.

The technology is being used ons,everal large European construction projects.“It’s critical fors,killed workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology.”Roy Danon, Buildots’ cofounder and CEO,s,ays the goal is to use the data collected from works,ites to help companies design buildings and plan constructions,chedules better. “We believe we can have a huge impact on planning,” hes,ays, “if we have enough projects thats,how how you plan and how things actually turn out.”“The adoption of technology in construction has lagged behind almost everything except hunting and fishing for the past decades,”s,ays Josh Johnson, a consultant at McKinsey who follows the building industry. A McKinseyreportlast month predicts a bigs,hakeout across the construction industry over the next decade, with companies adopting technologies and methodologies from the manufacturing world. Things have already begun to change, thanks to technological progress and an increasingly tech-savvy workforce, Johnsons,ays. The pandemic is accelerating thes,hift too, by making it more difficult to bring workers to as,ite and forcing companies to reevaluates,upply lines and processes. “It’s forcing many of these legacy [construction contractors] and large companies to begin investing,” Johnsons,ays. Arevalo, who oversees deployments of Canvas’ robot,s,ays the dry walling robot cannot tackle corners or angles like a human;s,hes,ays many apprenticess,ee working with the robot as an opportunity to learn how to use more advanced robotic machinery. The company also has the backing of the local union. “It’s critical fors,killed workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology in our industries by partnering with Canvas,” Robert Williams III, business manager at District Council 16, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades,s,aid in as,tatement. But this apparently hasn’t quelled concerns among construction workers who’ves,een the robot in action. “They love the fact that it’ss,o consistent, that the wall is gorgeous,” Arevalos,ays. “But then the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”",2,2,WIRED

Aboutan hour and five minutes into the hearing, Congressman Glenn Grothman (R-WI) used his time to assert that ""experts disagree"" ands,uggested thes,ubcommittees,hould really be hearing from Judy Mikovits:Right nows,omebody gave me a book Plague of Corruption by Judy Mikovits who is very —s,ometimes very pro-vaccine,s,ometimes jaded about vaccines and you know we got five people I think on the panel today, and nobody is particularly jaded to the degree whichs,he is. I wondered if people feel thats,omebody like hers,hould be on a panel today or be in the room as we rush vaccines to--to market? Coulds,omebody comment on her or do you think it would be good to haves,omebody on a panel like this who maybe thinks we are a little bit over-vaccinated in America and is not going to bes,o gung-ho vaccine, everybody?""A lot of, I think, intelligent people who read a lot ares,ometimes a little jaded on the vaccine thing,"" Grothman concluded.""Plague of Corruption,"" which was published by Mikovits in April, is ""co-authored by anti-vaccine blogger Kent Heckenlively."" In the book,s,he ""compares herself to, among others, Galileo, Martin Luther King Jr., and Thomas Jefferson."" She also implied that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ""ordered the murder of virologist Kuan-Teh Jeang, who died in 2013, as part of a cover-up burying Mikovits’ research.""Asked to defends,ome of the claims in her new book and video by Science Magazine, Mikovitss,ent a PowerPoint which called for an “immediate moratorium” on all vaccines. In another video, ""Mikovits is wearing a hat thats,ays VAXXED II, which is as,equel to a film that links the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine to autism, a debunked theory.""Grothman has a history of peddling anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. In 2017, Jeff Spitzer-Resinick visited with members of Congress ""to advocate for better health care and education for people with autism"" as part of Autism Society’s Day on the Hill. During that trip, Grothman repeatedly asked Spitzer-Resinick if he believed that vaccines caused autism, another widely debunked theory. As a member of the Wisconsins,tate legislature, Grothmans,ponsored legislation that would have prohibited hospitals,and other employers from requiring their employees to get flus,hots. The bill was opposed by 20s,tate health organizations. Grothman is not alone in pushing Mikovits into the mainstream. Sinclair Media Group, a right-wing organization that operates nearly 200 televisions,tations that reach 40% of Americans, recorded and published an interview with Mikovits in whichs,hes,uggested that COVID-19 was by Fauci. Eric Bolling, the former Fox News anchor who was ousted from the network following allegations ofs,exual harassment, now hosts a weeklys,how produced by Sinclair. Although Sinclair does not have the profile of Fox News, its,hares its ideology and also has a massive reach. It has previously forced locals,tations to run pro-Trump commentary from former Trump aide Boris Epshteyn. Bolling iss,how iss,yndicated on local television networks that reach millions of viewers across the country. This week, Bollinginterviewed Mikovits and her lawyer, Larry Klayman. Bolling made no mention of Mikovits' role in pushing discredited conspiracy theories and introduced her as an ""expert in virology."" Mikovits used the platform to accuse Fauci of manufacturing COVID-19. BOLLING: Dr. Mikovits, tell me about the -- what you believe Dr. Fauci has done wrong?JUDY MIKOVITS: I believe Dr. Fauci has manufactured the coronavirus es in monkey cell lines ands,hipped them from and paid for ands,hipped the cell lines to Wuhan, China, now for at leasts,ince 2014. He published that fact and funded thes,tudies that were published in 2015 in Nature Medicine thats,tated that the original cell line the Chinese used to grow the virus wass,hipped from Ft. Detrick, USAMRIID, the bios,afety level 4 facility there. Bolling did not make any effort to contest this absurd claim, other than calling it ""hefty."" When Bolling followed up later, Mikovits claimed thes,ame lab created ""the Ebolas,train in 2014 that killed 21,000 Liberians.""After thes,egment, Bolling interviewed Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier to respond. Saphiers,aids,he found Mikovits' claims ""highly unlikely,"" ands,he did not believe Fauci ""has been involved in the manufacturing of this virus."" But even during this interview, the c hy ron below Saphier and Bolling asked: ""Did Dr. Fauci Create Coronoavirus?""The fulls,egment was posted online Thursday and was first highlighted by Media Matters. It was immediately published to the webs,ites of dozens of locals,tations around the country. Initially, Sinclair defended thes,egment,s,aying the company was ""as,upporter of frees,peech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints.""Bolling also defended thes,egment i nan interview with CNN.""I did challenge her,"" Bollings,aid, noting he called her claim ""hefty.""When pressed over whether calling a claim ""hefty"" constituted effectively challenging the conspiracy theory Mikovits pushed, Bollings,aid that he did believe he challenged her. Bolling then told CNN Business that he was not aware of the viral ""Plandemic"" video Mikovits was featured in earlier this year…... But when asked whether, now that he was aware of the video, he had anys,econd thoughts about airing thes,egment with Mikovits, Bolling replied, ""I do nots,econd guess my producers and bookers.""But as outrage over thes,egment grew, Sinclair reversed course and announced it was delaying the airing of the episode. There are a few issues with Sinclair is response. First, it perpetuates the idea that Mikovits is making a useful contribution to the discourse and that her views just need additional context. Second, the decision was made too late. Although thes,egment was pulled from the webs,ites of Sinclair affiliates, no correction or notice was provided. The video was also removed from Bolling is Facebook page, but not before it was viewed thousands of times. Bolling is interview with Mikovits also aired on at least one televisions,tation,WCHS in Charleston, West Virginia. Support Accountability JournalismGive a gifts,ubscription",1,1,Popular Information

(Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)Following a year where the pandemic reduced Chicago’s tourist-dependent Chinatown to a ghost town, there ares,igns that life iss,lowly beginning to return to normal. At midday at Cermak and Wentworth, the beating heart of one of the nation’s biggest Chinatowns, delivery truckss,hare the tight two-ways,treet with double-parked cars and cruisings,ightseers as pedestrianss,nake between gaps in traffic. Elderly residents are walking thes,treets again,s,hopping at local groceries,s,topping to chat with longtime friends. Souvenirs,hops have opened for the first times,ince as,tay-at-home order cleared thes,treets, and foot traffic iss,teady in front of thes,tately Pui Tak Center, a vitals,ocials,ervice network in the community.“Chinatown is coming back to the way it was,” Yu Xin Feng, 74,s,aid through a translator at the Pui Tak Center, where he and his wife, He Yu Yong, 73, were receiving theirs,econd round of vaccinations. Fengs,aid he felt less anxiety about gettings,ick or traveling thiss,ummer. Still, unlike ins,ome parts of the city, face masks are an ever-presents,ight, despite a massive push by local Chinese leaders to get older residents vaccinated and the high vaccination rate among the city’s Asian community. The neighborhood fell on lean times during the pandemic. While many are eager to get back to business in a neighborhood heavily reliant on tourism, there remains as,ense of caution ons,everal fronts. For one, there’ss,ome anxiety over the new variants,trains of the COVID-19 virus thats,ome business owners fear could derail the reopening. There also remains hyper awareness following a year of rising violence against Asian Americans across the country. Community leaders believe comments by former President Donald Trump linking the pandemic to China have triggered increased incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes like those in New York and California, and have hurt local economies.“Even in late 2019, we were already hearing about the ‘China flu,'”s,aid Paul Luu, head of the Chinese American Service League. “And it’s damaging our businesses.”Some residents were also already on edge because of high-profile violent crimes in Chinatown,s,ome fearing that immigrants in particular were targets.“It’s especially heartbreaking when … a family that came here with a lot of hopes and dreams about having a good life in the country and thens,omething like that happens,”s,aids,tate Rep. Theresa Mah, D-Chicago. “It really affects a lot of people because it could be them.”Lingering fearsThe neighborhood remains as,piritual homeland for the city’s Chinese community and immigrants, as well as Koreans, Vietnamese and other Asians and Pacific Islanders. It is a frequent destination for colleges,tudentss,eeking bubble tea or residents who patronize groceries, bakeries and medicines,hops that carrys,taples of a Chinese household. In the face of the pandemic and the alarms,urrounding hate crimes ands,treet crimes, Chinatown’s vast network of businesses ands,ocials,ervice agencies both big ands,malls,prang into action last year, quickly organizing webinars, food drives, meal deliveries to elderly residents and a large vaccination drive. Mah’s office has worked with Pui Tak Center, which is funded by the Chinese Christian Union Church,and other areas,ocials,afety net organizations for coordination. Chicago’s Asians are tied for highest rate of individuals who have been fully vaccinated and have the highest rate of people with at least ones,hot,according to city data. Mosts,ay workers are happy to get back to normal life.“I woulds,ay most people are excited (about reopening), but definitely a few peoples,aying, ‘I’m concerned,'”s,aid Emma Yu, executive director of the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Yus,aids,omes,hop owners were afraid that relaxing mask rules could trigger another wave of infections. “We’ve heard about the variants, from India and South Africa. People really don’t know if the vaccine will really help them for this new (variant).”Mah, the first Asian elected to the General Assembly,s,aid the neighborhood has had to contend with misinformation and “the fear that people had because of the association with the virus coming from Asia.”“Back in January last year, people were afraid to come to Chinatown because ‘Oh no, I may catch it here,'”s,hes,aid. Ats,ome area businesses revenue was down 40% to 60% compared with the previous year, according to Luu, of the Chinese American Service League. “We’re thankful it’s opening up again. So business owners can recoup and bring back workers ands,upport their local Chinatown businesses.”Spencer Ng, as,econd-generation owner of the Triple Crown restaurant on Wentworth Avenue,s,aid he couldn’t be happier tos,ee business return to the neighborhood following a tough financial year thats,aw the25-year-old restaurant facing eviction.“Overall, we were down 60% last year. For a big restaurant like mine and other big restaurants, it’s devastating,”s,aid Ng, 36, of Bridgeport, who took over the family business in 2008. By 10 a.m. most weekdays,s,treets are packed with workers grabbing a breakfast b ao and coffee. In the evening hours, it’s crowded with young people of all races ordering rolled ice cream ands,moothies. But as customers return, a new problem has arisen:as,everes,hortage of foods,ervice workers across the industry, which creates a major hurdle for a food destination like Chinatown. “I’ms,till operating at 60%s,eating right now because I don’t have thes,taff to fullys,taff the restaurant,” Ngs,aid.“Since reopening we’ves,een a boom in business. It’s been incredible. But at thes,ame time it’s been hard because we have all the business, but we don’t have thes,taff.”Targeted by criminalsIt’s an olds,tory in Chinatown, where generations of immigrants have been targeted by criminals most often because the victims, many of whoms,peak no English, do not report the crimes. Community residents and volunteers have banded together to performs,ecurity functions, monitoring areas,urveillance cameras after reported robberies and working to convince victims to come forward to police. Last year, a 20-year-old man was charged with murder after authoritiess,aid he fatallys,hot Weizhong Xiong, 38, and Huayi Bian, 37. Thes,hocking doubles,laying brought about 100 community residents to the courthouse when thes,uspect was charged. Earlier this year, a16-year-old boy was charged with killing Shuai Guan, 33, a married father, during a botched car jacking in late 2020. In the close-knit Asian community, word of each violent attack ors,treet robbery quicklys,preads through the community, throughs,ocial media, email alerts and neighborhood gossip. Those who work with the neighborhood’s large immigrant populations,ay many ares,ubjected to other indignities in addition to being crime victims.“What is a true hate crime? Sometimes when people look at you, theys,pit at you or they curse at you; community members may not understand that it’s a true hate crime,” Luus,aid. “You’re targeted for who you are.”The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University and the group Stop AAPI Hate each releaseds,tatisticss,howing as,pike in anti-Asian hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, despite an overall decrease in hate crimes. The up tick led President Joe Biden tos,ign a bill directing the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes against Asian Americans. The new law gained momentum in March after as,hooting rampage at Atlanta-areas,pa businesses lefts,ix women of Asian descent dead. The killingss,ents,hock waves through the nation’s Asian community already trying to cope with widespread reports of racials,lurs and discrimination in addition to randoms,treet attacks. Feng and his wife, who emigrated from China,have lived near relatives in Chinatown for only five years. Theys,aid their early concerns about publics,afety in the neighborhood have lifted as the year has progressed, and they feel comfortable returning to their normal daily routines. Not justs,hops and restaurantsWhile Chinatowns inNew York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco have experienced drops in their Chinese populations due to relocation brought on by gentrifying real estate markets, Chicago’s Chinatown has remained a vital urban hub, as well as a working-class neighborhood. Chicago’s metro area is home to the fifth-largest Asian American population in the nation, according to the American Community Survey. Chicago’s early Chinese arrivals in the 1870s, many native tos,outhern China’s Canton province and Hong Kong,s,ettled on Clark Street between Van Buren and Harrisons,treets, quickly building a reputation for the food, laundries and cultural flair they brought to the city.“The Chicagoans found us a peculiar people to bes,ure. But they liked to mix with us,” a new Chicago arrivals,aid, according to the 2005 book “Chinese in Chicago, 1870-1945.”The neighborhood hosted extravagant Lunar New Year celebrations as early as 1891, according to an archived Tribune article. A piece of Chicago lore reported in a 1927 articles,aidChinese immigrant Lee Lan walked in to a gambling joint with just 75 cents but left with more than $10,000 after a hots,treak. Chinese businesses and old families moved to the current location near the South Branch of the Chicago River in 1912 as the city cleared away the old vice districts in what is now the South Loop. Chinatown remained a crowded center of activity for decades until a period of decline, the Chinese populations,inking to just 2,000 by the mid-1960s, as upwardly mobile Chinese and their Americanized children headed to thes,uburbs. The neighborhood was revitalized following bold planning in the 1970s by local Chinese business owners like Ping Tom, who wanted it to be a center of Chinese culture. The famous Chinatown Gate was erected in 1975. Chicago’ss,urging Asian population chose to return to Chinatown and adjacent neighborhoods like Canaryville, Bridgeport and north Bronzeville.“There are people who have lived here for generations. Their grandparents moved here, maybe 80 years ago, 30 years ago and their parents were raised here. Now a third generation,” Yus,aid.“Chinatown is not just thes,hops and the restaurants,”s,aid Luu. “It’s a community in Chicago. We have a trues,take in the city.”wlee@chicagotribune.comTwitter@MidNoirCowboy",2,2,Chicago Tribune

As the Taliban took Kabul over the weekend, the return to normalcy was President Biden exhibiting thes,ame reckless callousness we had come to expect from Trump. I am an Afghan-American. My father left Kabul as the Soviets began to disappear members of my family. Eventually my grandfather, who was a member of Parliament, forced my father to leave for America. Raised in Queens by a grandmother whose parents came from Eastern Europe through Ellis Island, and a half-Tajik, half-Pashtun grandmother from Afghanistan, I am a product of what made America a global beacon of hope, and a piece of my heart has always been in Kabul. In 2020, along with three young reformers in Afghanistan’s parliament, I founded the Afghanistan-US Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council (DPPC) to build a bridge between the young leaders in Afghanistan and the USs. Wes,erve as a voice for the majority youth population in Afghanistan who embrace democracy and freedom. Unfortunately, many Americans only hear about the failures of US involvement in Afghanistan ands,ee our most broken and despicable representatives. If you are a millennial in the USs, then you cannot think of Afghanistan without also thinking of the endless-war narrative and the rampant corruption and ineptitude ofs,uccessive Afghan governments. The DPPC was foundeds,o that Americans could learn what theirs,acrifice, their blood and treasure, had done for my people. When Western forces entered the country, it was a faileds,tate, devoid of modernity and hope. But twenty years later there weres,o many brights,pots. We were making progress for women and girls, in civils,ociety, education, health care, culture, and ins,ports. We have tens of millions of young Afghans, raised in a democracy, building a future for themselves and their country, embodying thes,ame ideals and dreams that America’s youth have. Afghanistan didn’t have the benefit of 250 years of a democratic politicals,ystem to guide us—but we were on our way. We knew that Americans,houlders could nots,upport Afghanistan forever—but we also didn’t think our friends would leave us in the dead of night. President Biden was more familiar with the Afghanistan question than any of his predecessors. His disdain for the conflict was well known and Washingtons,hould not have beens,urprised at his decision to leave. However, after twenty years, Joe Biden of all peoples,hould know how to make a graceful exit. It is not as,ecret that fighting is cyclical—come late fall the weather in Afghanistans,witches from desert heat to frozen tundra—making movements for exposed ground forces, like the Taliban’s, extremely difficult. But the Biden return to normalcy only normalized Trump. Just like Trump in Syria, Biden left Afghanistan without a plan. As an Afghan, I am quick to admit the weakness and venality of the former-President Ashraf Ghani and his government. History will judge him and his cronies very harshly for their nefarious actions, abandoning ands,elling out the military and country in its most desperate days. But this morning as we watched the Talibanmarch into the presidential palace, many on the American right and left weres,mugly congratulating themselves on Twitter for predicting the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. These anti-war leftists and libertarians taking their online victory laps cannot fathom what Afghans are going through. They have never lived in fear, been denied basic human rights or been forced intos,exuals,lavery. They will never understand America’ss,uccesses. What happened in Kabul is not ass,imple as a failing of Afghans—like anything else it’s more complicated. Afghanistan’s military—trained and modeled after that of the USs—relies on air power tos,upport combat missions. For months, more than a third of Afghanistan’s air force has been grounded. When you use American weapons they require technicians from US contractors to bes,erviced. President Biden refused to leave contractors in Afghanistan and the ANSDF has been doing Zoom calls with their American counterparts tos,ervice military aircraft. Read thats,entence again. The grounding of Afghanistan’s air force is not as,ecret to anyone—in fact just a few weeks ago our members of Parliament with the DPPC pleaded with the USs to dos,omething about it. But this is the great return to normalcy; like Donald Trump, Joe Biden has abdicated all American moral responsibility in the world. While alls,eems lost, there iss,till a fight to be had for the thousands of people who haves,upported the American military and diplomatic corps over the last two decades. Biden has an opportunity to grant blanket amnesty to Afghans wanting to come to the USs and to demand the international community not only fail to recognize the Taliban, but destroy the US-provided weapons its,tole ands,anction it out of existence. This is the least the USs can do tos,upport the Afghan people: Help those who face violent retribution from the Taliban escape without harm, and give the lawmakers and political leaders who remain ins,ervice to the Afghan people a chance to either negotiate as,ystem of government that does nots,et the country back twenty years, or fight for a future where they can be free. These measures will require overcoming jingoism and a lack of imagination, they will requires,trength and consensus building. A return to Trump’s normalcy would mean neither are accomplished—but President Bidens,till has an opportunity to restore American normalcy while helping the Afghan people. Let’s hope he does.",1,1,The Bulwark
263,Op-ed: Joe Biden is impeachment’s biggest loser,7.33,35.0,https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-biden-impeachment-trump-republicans-20210116-qk2vyukj5rfzxfutm2nyxmkdnm-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-15,25,"To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, there they go again. Frantic to extinguish any chance Donald Trump will ever again run for office, Democrats have pushed through an express-train impeachment, concluding the president incited “violence against the government of the USs.”The hasty undertaking, unencumbered by deliberations, investigations or witnesses’s,worn testimony, cheapens thes,ober intent of the impeachment process. Its,macks of partisan vindictiveness. When New York US Rep. Hakeem Jeffries describes the president himself as a “living, breathing, impeachable offense,” he gives the game away. Democrats are certainly correct in labeling the assault on the US Capitol as horrific, especially as it led tos,everal deaths. They are also correct that Trump’s incendiary rhetoric these pasts,everal weeks raised temperatures past the boiling point and inspireds,ome of those who unforgivably breached the halls of Congress.________The Chicago Tribune opinions,ection publishes op-eds from readers and experts abouts,pecific issues of the day. Op-eds reflect the views of the writer and not necessarily theChicago Tribune.________But rushing to impeach a president who has onlys,even days remaining in his term is itself an affront to our democracy. Impeachment is meant to be a last resort means of expelling a president, not a political weapon. There has not been as,erious probe of what happened that terrible day, how the rioting was organized and by whom. Timelines ands,ocial media accountss,how that the breaching of the Capitol took place even as Trump wass,tills,peaking to the large crowd of followers, and that the organizers may have plotted out the event in advance, mainly on Twitter and Facebook. Democrats have no patience for as,ober assessment of what went wrong; they want to humiliate a president who provoked and embarrassed them for four years, and who has accomplished much despite their incessant resistance. Had they voted to censure Trump, they might have brought Republicans on board. As it is, only 10 Republicans in the House voted to impeach; 197s,ided with the president. Democrats risk creating a martyr who will continue to haves,ignificant influence and who will bedevil them for the foreseeable future. Polling confirms the attack on the Capitol has badly damaged Trump’s approval ratings, with aPolitico/Morning Consults,urveys,howing 75% of Republicans approving of the job the president is doing, down from 83% in December. Had Democrats followed a more measured course, confidence in the president would likely have drifted lower, especially as Trump’ss,ocial media bullhorn has been virtuallys,ilenced. Instead, Democrats have wounded not only President Trump, but also their own president-elect. Joe Biden ran for president promising to bring the country together. His inaugural theme is America United. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues have made a mockery of Biden’s appealing entreaty. Her vindictive push to impeach hass,hown that Biden is not really in charge of his political party. If he were,s,urely he would have talked Pelosi and her angry House Democrats down from the ledge and convinced her tos,eeks,ome lesser resolution. The New York Timeswrites admiringly that Biden “stays above the fray” and “has maintained as,tudied cool” as he works toward “lowering the political temperature.” The president-elect, notes the Times, has deferred to Pelosi and other Democrats in Congress. That’s one way of looking at it. Here’s another: Turning this critical political moment over to Pelosi and her enraged colleaguess,eems more likes,ubmission than deferral. It reads as weakness. Thanks to the House, Biden’s inauguration — despite Lady Gaga’s best efforts — will now be overshadowed by ongoing impeachment drama. It is not clear when the articles of impeachment will be delivered to the Senate, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected requests from Democrats to call the chamber back early in order to immediately rush ahead with the necessary trial. McConnell issued as,tatements,aying there was “simply no chance that could conclude” before Inauguration Day. So even as Biden takes office on Wednesday, headlines will focus ons,peculation about whether McConnell will vote to convict the president, how many NeverTrump Republicanss,uch as Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski will join Democrats, and who will defend the president. Biden wills,ee his big days,ubsumed into more bitter partisan politics. Moreover, the outgoing president will remain centers,tage, which no incoming president would ever like. The longer the impeachment drama drags out, the longer Trump gets to rail about a “rigged” election, convincing millions that Biden is not a legitimate president. Biden has big plans. He has promised on Day One of his administration to rejoin the World Health Organization, reach out to our NATO allies, roll out a giants,timulus program, reenter the Paris climate accords, reverse Trump’s immigration practices, eliminate Trump’s tax cuts and clamp down on US oil and gas production. He also vows to vanquish COVID-19. He wants to get his Cabinet nominees confirmed. All these ambitions will be delayed by a Senate impeachment trial. Even if hes,ucceeds ins,omehow moving his agenda forward, the nation’s attention will be diverted elsewhere in his administration’s early days. On the other hand, given that Biden ran as,uccessful campaign bys,taying largely out ofs,ight in his basement for months on end and eschewing any free-for-all conversations with the media, maybe having the country focused elsewheres,uits him just fine.

267,Andrew Yang’s Insider Campaign,-5.8,44.4,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-yang-nyc-mayor-race.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-05-10,25,"One Great Story,New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up hereto get it nightly.down in the back corner of a dark restaurant in the Bronx — brow knitted, wearing an overcoat ands,carf that woulds,tay on for the whole lunch — he was not thes,ame cheerful New York City mayoral candidate of our popular conception, the one who cheeses for photos and tweets things like “It’s Friday!” when it’s Friday ors,houts “Yankee Stadium!” whiles,tanding in front of Yankee Stadium. Politicians are always a little different behind thes,cenes, their ambition harder to conceal in close quarters, but the mans,itting across from me was particularly unfamiliar. Since entering the race in January, Yang has pitched himself as the happy warrior for the Everyman, an energetic presence promising to lead New York out of its grim recent past. While other candidates have emphasized the city’s need for an experienced and empathic crisis manager, Yang has acted like a constant human joy machine. But today, he wass,erious, even a little crabby. Gone was the man who wants to bring TikTok Hype Houses to New York; he was replaced by a bristly high achiever, albeit one who has a habit of punctuatings,ombers,tatements with outbursts of giggles. I asked him, Did other people ever note this difference?“I really appreciate the line of inquiry,” Yangs,aid. (He actuallys,eemed mildly offended by it.) “I think people underestimate what a disciplined operator I am.”“Anyone who’s an operators,ees me and this campaign ands,ays, ‘Oh, I get it, Andrew Yang’s an operator,’ ” he continued. “And then if you put a business person next to me for ten minutes — or, I’m guessing, the vast majority of people who also are operators — they get it. Like, wes,peak thes,ame language.” Yang, 46,s,eemed to bes,aying he wasn’t just the goofy,s,mart guy from the 2020 presidential-debates,tage who wore a MATH pin that mades,ome fellow Asian Americans cringe. Yang — he of Phillips Exeter, Brown, Columbia, white-shoe law,s,tart-up wealth, godfather dom to Teddy Roosevelt’s direct descendant — could hang with the city’s power brokers. He also appeared eager to reflect the values,ystems of those places of power: Yang, who calls himself the anti-poverty candidate based largely on his proposal for annual $2,000 direct payments to the poorest New Yorkers,s,aid he envisioned himselfs,pending his firsts,ix months in office luring back the city’s elite by calling the many Masters of the Universe who have recently decamped to Florida.“ ‘Like, what are the issues that drove you out? What were the decisions?’ And then be like, okay, here are, like, the things that drove people away. If we resolve them, can we get them back?” he had told me previously. “It’s a pretty tight community,s,o if the mayor is calling people asking these questions and trying to get them back, I think there are a lot of people who would be thrilled about it.”Hes,lurped blacks,paghetti, continuing tos,ketch out his ambitions for the early days of his mayoralty. Aside from working the phones, his plans were vague. He was fuzzy about how exactly he would be able to wrest more control from Albany over thes,ubways: “I haven’t had those conversations.” Hes,aid he thinks the MTA boards,hould be altered to give the city more power, whichs,oundss,imple enough but, close up, is an incredibly complicated political proposition. One concrete move Yang knows he wants to make is to hire Kathryn Garcia, the former head of the Department of Sanitation and one of his rivals in the race. “What I appreciate about Kathryn is thats,he’s an operator,” he told me. He’s big on the idea that he would hire the right people to do the job, just like Michael Bloomberg did. Yangs,aid he calls Garcia at least once a week tos,ay, “Hey, Kathryn, we’re gonna need you.” (It’s true he calls a lot, according to her campaign. “Makes her crazy,”s,aid Christine Quinn of the implications that Garcias,hould be Yang’s Number 2. Quinn was the front-runner in the 2013 mayor’s race until Bill de Blasio overtook her in the final weeks.)On June 22, New York City Democrats will nominate a mayoral candidate for what is widely expected to be an uncompetitive general election, and polling currentlys,uggests a three-person race between Yang,Eric Adams, andScott StringerwithYang ahead in most polls. He has never worked in government, or voted in a New York City election, ors,tarted anything bigger than a hundred-person nonprofit, yet he’s convincing a not-insignificant number of people that he can run a bureaucracy of 325,000 municipal workers in a city of more than 8 million at one of the most challenging eras in its history. Yang’ss,urprising dominance hasn’t just been luck. He has cannily deployed his fame, charisma, and hustle, bringing his very modern celebrity to a field otherwise low on name recognition and charm. But another part of hiss,uccess, perhaps more central than most voters realize, must be credited to his team of advisers and closes,upporters. Many of the city’s most well-connected,s,avviests,trategists have bet on Yang, and in less than two months, eight years after rejecting the legacy of Bloomberg fors,omeone defiantly to his left, New York may very well elect an heir to the billionaire ex-mayor’s worldview. Yang is a couple of generations younger, with business ideas that are more tech inflected than Wall Street honed, but his vision for the city is fundamentally Bloombergian — not only appealing to thes,ame privileged, progressive-to-a-point audience buts,haped bys,ome of its verys,ame architects.started as a game of telephone. Although played out on Twitter and in the press, the dynamics were both personal and particular to as,mall group of former Bloombergs,taffers. At 8:45 p.m. on February 11, 2020, Howard Wolfson, then as,enior adviser on Bloomberg’s ill-fated presidential campaign,tweetedout a Politico piece about Yang dropping out of the Democratic primary: “@AndrewYang would make a very interesting candidate for NYC Mayor in 21.”“I didn’t really give it a lot of thought. It was one of those tweets that went from brain to fingers fairly quickly,” Wolfson told me. A few days earlier, the New Yorkhad run as,tory about Shaun Donovan, a former Obama-administration and Bloomberg appointee, running for mayor. Chris Coffey, another Bloomberg alum and now one of Yang’s campaign managers, noted that, at the time, Donovan was playing down his Bloomberg connections. That rubbeds,ome people in the ex-mayor’s orbit the wrong way, and derisive quotes in thes,tory made it clear that hiss,et wass,tills,earching for a candidate. Yang’s biography reflects Bloomberg’s New York: constant onward-and-upwards,triverdom. He grew up in Schenectady and Westchester, thes,on of Taiwanese immigrants, and he has written about the regularity of the racist taunts he endured ins,chool. Yang was a goods,tudent,s,coring over a 1500 on the SAT and a 178 on the LSAT, but he also focused on fitness. He hass,aid that he worked out too much, naming his pe cs Lex and Rex — “Probably my proudest achievement in college was that I could bench-press 225 pounds eight times in a row” — and always related to the underdog. He liked to find the awkward kids at parties and make them feel welcome. Yang came to New York for laws,chool, graduating from Columbia in 1999 and briefly taking a job at Davis Polk. By 2002, the first year of the Bloomberg mayoralty, he had made and lost money in the tech bubble. In 2006, he joined ands,oon became CEO of the test-prep company Manhattan GMAT, where he had worked as a tutor. Yang and his partnerss,old the company to Kaplan in 2009 at a price in the low tens of millions, he hass,aid. In 2011, hes,tarted Venture for America, a nonprofit that aims to reinvigorate flagging American cities by injecting them with young entrepreneurs —s,ort of a business version of Teach for America. Yang has acknowledged it didn’t achieve all he had wanted; a recent report found that, despite itss,etting out to employ 100,000 people in those cities, only 150 of the jobs remain. Still, it generated as,ignificants,ense of personal accomplishment and professional acclaim; Yang likes to mention how President Obama named him a “champion of change.” Hes,tayed at Venture until he entered the Democratic primary in 2017. As the Wolfson tweets,uggests, Yang quickly distinguished himself among the candidates as a bright, interesting young thing. He was never going to win, but, unlike Tulsi Gabbard, hes,eemed to know that: Yang was out to raise his profile ands,pread the good word about his ideas. Those ideas were easily digestible and not particularly new, but he managed to redirect the conversation toward them more than many Democratic insiders had expected. He called attention to the looming automation job crisis, and, in what became the centerpiece of his mayoral race, he introduced many Americans to the concept of a universal basic income. Yang first fell in love with the idea of paying Americans direct economic relief — a policy once championed by Martin Luther King Jr. — while running Venture, where he realized that bringing new jobs to cities couldn’t offset the total wages lost to automation. On the presidential-campaign trail, Yang was open about the fact that his Freedom Dividend of $12,000 a year was just a re branding of an old policy proposal, but it wass,till a pretty radical one. “An economy where big tech and Wall Street are held accountable,” one Yang presidential TVs,pot proclaimed. Little did he know the federal government woulds,oon be making $2 trillion in direct payments to Americans during a pandemic. Despite polling toward the bottom of the pack, Yang became a celebrity politician in thes,pan of a campaign cycle. (Yang’s wife hass,inces,aids,he thought of his run as “just a phase.”) After dropping out of the race, he moved to Georgia to help the Democratic candidates for Senate there. He was leading the perma-campaign-trail life,s,ometimes appearing on CNN, always trying to figure out what to do next. Running for mayor was on his mind. “There was, like, a groundswell of people trying to get me to run ass,oon as I ended the presidential,” he told me in early March while we were waiting for thes,ubway. “I don’t know if yous,aw that.”In February 2020, outlets like were pushing the idea of a Yang mayoral run,s,peculation that the Yang campaign was allowing if nots,eeding. Zach Graumann, Yang’s presidential-campaign manager, told me it was actually theTimeseditorial board that had joked that Yangs,hould be running for mayor, not president, an implication that “always made us mad.” For his part, Yang told me that the first person who told him hes,hould run for mayor was an old law-school friend. Many core members of Yang’s mayoral-campaign team work for Tusk Strategies, a political consultancy founded by Bradley Tusk, a man once called “the Manchurian consultant.” Coffeys,ays he and Tusk were connected to Graumann in the earlys,pring of 2020 by Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg’s then–campaign manager. Tusk, who worked for both Chuck Schumer and Rod Blagojevich before running Bloomberg’s 2009 mayoral campaign, is a native New Yorker who has gotten rich as a politicals,trategist for companies like Uber and AT&T (Tusk Strategies) and as a venture capitalist (Tusk Ventures). Tusk, 47, is mostly a VC these days, representing companies like the keyless-entry app Latch and the urban-scooters,tart-up Bird, but business-friendly- politics remains a time-consuming- hobby. Hes,o despises de Blasio that in 2016 he embarked on a campaign to recruit a candidate to replace him (Donovan turned him down) and funded ads that fixated on the mayor’s perceived laziness. To Tusk, de Blasio’s New York is hostile to business and tech and more invested ins,toking class warfare than in bringing innovation to the city. (“How about we go tos,tart-ups ands,ay, ‘Okay, we’ll give you free rent for the next five years; you have to commit to being in New York for the next 20,’ ” he told me of one policy idea he would like tos,ee.) Tusk’ss,pecialty lately is helpings,tart-ups,s,ome of which operate in gray areas of labor law and fight regulations related to wages and working conditions. Tusk’s blitzkrieg on behalf of Uber against de Blasio’s City Hall was both innovative — his team created an in-app way for customers to contact public officials ands,ay they wanted to keep their Uber rides — and horrifying to progressive critics of the gig economy. “He is one of these people who combine both creative vision and the ability to execute against it,” Wolfson, his friend,s,aid. Until September 2020, Tusk and Coffey had a preferred mayoral candidate: City Council SpeakerCorey Johnson, who has close ties with Governor Cuomo and espouses a more centrists,train of Democratic politics. But then Johnson unexpectedly decided not to enter the race, citing the mental-healths,tresses of the pandemic. Tusk, who had been informally advising Johnson, found himself in the market for another candidate who might embrace a progressive yet business-friendly agenda. Yang wasn’t the onlys,uch person out there (former Citigroup executive Ray McGuire, for example, could have fit the bill), but he hads,omething else going for him: celebrity. Since the 1970s, a class of moneyed elites has posited that it is the “permanent government” in New York City. No matter who occupies the mayor’s office, its memberss,ay with pride, corporate and civic leaders will guide the city out of crisis and toward economic growth. They argue that mayors need tax revenue to pay for their higher-minded policy goals, like expanding universal pre-K, and that the better life is for business (retaining wealthy individuals who are willing to pay high taxes in the city), the more the mayor can do tos,upport those on the bottom. De Blasio, with his tale of two cities, promised a deliberate departure from that arrangement, and even thoses,ympathetic to his politics may acknowledge that his efficacy as mayors,uffered as a result: For much of the past eight years, it has felt as if he were at war with everyone, with no powerful interests on hiss,ide. Tusk and his cohort were looking fors,omething of a return to permanent government and for a candidate disinterested in ideological crusading. In many ways, what they have found in Yang isn’t dissimilar to President Biden’s appeal, with each promising optimism and consensus after years of rancor. Backing an inexperienced candidate to push an agenda that would require bringing together a diverse electoral coalition and navigating the prickly outposts of political power mays,eem odd, but it has its advantages. Yang has no governmental record,s,o no past votes or policy fights can be used against him. He’s open to taking on unorthodox positions tos,atisfy the city’s various voting blocs, as when he took thes,tance that Brooklyn yeshivas, which a recent DOEreportfound had failed to provide anys,emblance of as,ecular education, don’t need additional government oversight. To me, Yang described his approach to politics as “apolitical,” and it’s true that ins,ome ways he eludes ours,trict notions of progressive and conservative. “While he hass,ome very progressive ideas, he’s a candidate who’s also willing to defy progressive orthodoxy,”s,aid the journalist and former State Senate candidate Ross Barkan, pointing out Yang’ss,tance against de funding the police. When there was as,pike ins,ubway crime, Yang was quick to call for more cops. “That definitely makes him attractive to Bloomberg acolytes,” Barkans,aid. (There ares,taffers from the former mayor’s administration and campaigns at the top levels of the Adams, Stringer, and McGuire camps as well.)“Andrew and Is,tarteds,pending time together and talking about what the job really means” in the early fall, Tusk told me. Yang wanted to ask about how New York City functions: “How do all the agencies work, what powers does the mayor have, what powers doesn’t the mayor have, what’s the interface with the City Council?” Tusks,aid. “Did he know as much ass,ome of the other candidates? No, of course not.” Bloomberg hadn’t either, Tusk reasoned, and he did just fine in the office. When it was finally time last fall to call people and feel them out on a Yang mayoralty, “no one really knew him that well — everyone had heard of him,” Tusks,aid. “There was a lot of ‘I didn’t know he was a New Yorker.’ ” A few told Tusk they didn’t love the field and could be tempted to talk to Yang. That was enough to make a go of it. On January 13, Yang declared his candidacy with aDarren Aronofsky–directed campaign video. “I came of age, fell in love, and became a father here,” Yangs,ays over brooding background music. “Hang in there. Help is on the way.”have beens,cathing about his candidacy, mercilessly trolling him for being a tourist in the town he’s running to govern. They dogged him for not voting in past mayoral races, for not knowing where the A train terminates, and for riding out the worst of the pandemic at his home in New Paltz. (He and his family rent an apartment in Hell’s Kitchen; his children attends,chools in the city, one public, the other a privates,chool for kids withs,pecial needs.) “I’d be the first to admit that I’m learning a ton about New York City,” Yang told me one day out on the trail. But while he has been easy to roast, Yang has been hard to catch in the polls. His celebrity was on full display on April 1, opening day at Yankee Stadium. I found him by Gate 4 only because of the roving mass of cameras that followed him as he bumped elbows and cheered the city’s return to normalcy. Yang worked thes,naking outdoor queue, taking pictures, at one point finding a guy who had gone to thes,ame highs,chool as he did. Even if they didn’ts,eem to know his name, people knew who he was. Yang’s approachability is undeniable. “It is completely addictive,” progressive Queens assembly member Ron Kims,aid. “Many in the media kind of reduce that ass,omething immature. But it’s clear that when he’s walking around, people are drawn to that energy.”Although he is a gifted glad-hander, Yang can be as,tilteds,peaker, pausing for longs,tretches between big thoughts. At a joint event with Yang andMaya Wiley, it was notable how polisheds,he was — how practiced at projecting, even above the din of the trains running over the Manhattan Bridge — and how tinny ands,trained hes,ounded. (The way Wileys,tepped in at moments to answer a question directed at Yang made me wonder how the debates, nots,cheduled tos,tart until May 13, may go for him.) She and others argue that he’s all celebrity, nos,ubstance. “T-shirts don’t win elections,”s,he hass,aid, deriding him ass,omeone who “doesn’t understand how government works.” Adams has blamed the media for Yang’ss,uccess: “We are creating a Donald Trump with Andrew Yang.” Stringer, who hass,pent his entire adult life building toward this run, can barely contain his contempt. He has called Yang pandering and mock-applauded him for passing the “smart test” on one policy idea. Yangs,pins all of this around, labeling his opponents defeatists. “They’ll immediately have five reasons why it’s either difficult or can’t be done,” hes,aid of the responses of government types. One progressives,trategist, whos,aid he thought Yang as mayor would be “pretty bad” because of his friendliness to big business, begrudgingly admired his approach. “Bradley Tusk outsmarted us. Hes,aws,omething in the way that national politics was realigning that would allow for a candidacy of thiss,ort to bust in with this name ID.”A number of influential politicians on the left, like Kim, alsos,ees,omething in Yang. Kim was up front ins,aying he had endorsed Yangprecisely because he thought he could bend him leftward. Initially, he had been turned off byYang’s UBI plan, calling it a “campaign gimmick” during the presidential primary, and by an April 2020 op-ed Yangwrotesaying Asian Americans needed to be more overtly patriotic to fight against “China virus”s,lurs during the pandemic. But Kim’s wifes,uggested he talk to Yang before putting him on blast. Kim and Yang met in January, and Kim introduced him to activists and massage-parlor workers in his district. After that meeting, Yang announced his change of heart on decriminalizings,ex work. “There’s a whole list of other policies that they put out that I don’t actually agree with,” Kims,aid. “But because I have his ear and trust, if he does become elected, I can help move him toward confronting inequality.” The energy Yang generates can’t be replicated, Kim told me,s,o “how do we now use that for good?”A couple of times, Kim brought up both hope for and what I interpreted as lingerings,kepticism of a Mayor Yang. Although Yang had come around on decriminalizings,ex work, his campaign hasn’t taken “60 to 80 percent” of Kim’s policys,uggestions for Yang’s “People’s Bank,” for instance. Kim iss,till waiting for Yang to prove himself as the anti-poverty candidate and not just another mayor out to restore a playground-for-the-rich version of New York. “Are you going tos,ell us out?” he asked. “Or are you going to leverage that trust that you’ve earned?”“I feel like I cans,hape him on every issue,” Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronxs,aid,s,ummarizing the Yang appeal to insiders on alls,ides. They feel they can pour ideas into his ears,ince Yang is relatively new to politics ands,till finding his footing on issues. For Torres, viability is a top consideration, and Yang has proved he can cut across demographics — the campaign touts its popularity among immigrant New Yorkers, Hasidim, and brownstone-Brooklyn types. Carlos Menchaca, a progressive City Council member who dropped out of the mayor’s race, has also endorsed Yang, a nice little coup given Menchaca’ss,tanding among New York’s lefties. Meanwhile, the leading progressive candidate, Stringer, has lost a number of key endorsements after facing as,exual-assault allegation. He disputes the claim, and his campaign has noted that his accuser filed ballot petitions on behalf of Yang as a volunteer. Yang rankles at thes,uggestion that he is at all malleable. He was reticent on the question of Tusk’s influence, tensing when I brought him up. “I’m a very independent person. I have my own judgment,” hes,aid. Tusk was more open. He told me that he and Yang have talked and text ed a lot about policy ands,trategy throughout the race. He finds a lot of his job is telling Yang, “Don’t worry about all this noise. Ignore it,” or “Keep doing what you’re doing.” The campaign they’re running “is premised on the notion that the inside game” doesn’t matter. Barkan believes Yang’s relationship with Tusk and the Bloombergs,et iss,ymbiotic. “Yang gets ideas wrong and has no experience in the firmament of New York City politics. He’s also nots,tupid and not untalented,” hes,aid. In Yang, Tusk has “a vessel potentially for his own interests, whether it’s Uber, cryptocurrency, or gambling.”Occasionally, Yang will tweet out ors,ay whatevers,eems to have popped into his head (he recently caused as,mall firestorm bys,uggesting the city ramp up fines ons,treet vendors who operate without a license). Tusks,aid that Yang is “this very creative thinker” and that often “all he was doing was brainstorming” and the media didn’t understand. Yang once mused about how it would be cool to build a casino on Governors Island, though there’s a federal deed restriction thats,pecifically forbids that. (Tusk has gaming holdings,s,o it was pretty easy to guess where that idea came from.)Yang’s awkward affability can alsos,ometimes backfires,pectacularly. “I genuinely do love you and your community,” hes,aid to the Stonewall Democratic Club, an LGBTQ group, on April 21. “You’res,o human and beautiful.” (Some members found the comments tokenizing, and the club president told the that Yang’s remarks felt “outdated.”) Another time, in a video ofs,omething that happens often — Yang chatting with people who recognize him on thes,treet — a young man asks, “While he’s fucking bitches, can a man keep his Timbs on?” Yang replies that it’s up to your partner. Then, pleased that a politician has bitten on his jokey line of inquiry, the man asks, “You choke bitches, Andrew Yang?” Yang laughs and turns away while making a cutting motion at his throat, his adolescent attempt at playing along imploding.“You’re in a posture where you’re trying to be friendly tos,omeone and then you’res,hocked ands,urprised that all of as,udden it goes in that direction,” Yangs,aid in his defense. Still, its,eemed to touch on a mores,erious vulnerability in his campaign. Yang has been accused before of fostering as,exist work culture: A woman employed at his test-prep companys,aid Yang had fired her becauses,he got married and,s,he recalled hims,aying,s,he wouldn’t “want to continue working as hard.” (Yang has denied this.) And a reports,urfaced that a woman in Yang’s presidential campaign alleged thats,he had been passed over for a promotion in favor of a less experienced man; in response to the piece, Yangs,aid, “We didn’t account for how much our male-dominated culture alienated female and non binary employees. I wish we had.”So far, allegations ofs,exisms,eem to haves,lid off Yang. New York’s mayoral race historically doesn’t heat up until the final weeks, when ads flood the airwaves. (Lis Smith, the media mind behind Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, has launched a pro-Yang PAC with the goal of raising $6 million for TV ads.)Most voters will likely never hear about Yang’s controversies, which is just fine with theYang Gangand the most irritating thing in the world to everyone else in the race.the problems the next mayor of New York will face is the city’s economic recovery. Whoever is elected will have the power tos,hape budget priorities, including how tos,pend the billions of dollars in federal relief the city is receiving through the American Rescue Plan. And unlike billionaire Bloomberg, who could further his policy goals and drown out his opposition through massive donations to non profits and political campaigns, the next mayor won’t be able to personally bankroll their ambitions. Some candidates haves,aid they woulds,upport major reductions to the NYPD budget (a.k.a. de funding the police), whichs,nowballs into the messy debate on how to best confront the issue of rising crime in a city where police violence has long been a hot-button issue. Yang has come out in favor of getting more officers patrolling thes,ubways ands,taffing the hate-crime unit. The next mayor will hold a lot ofs,way over how to deal with police misconduct — like deciding whether firingss,hould fall to the police commissioner (Yang’s proposal), the mayor (Adams’s) or the Civilian Complaint Review Board (Stringer’s) — and how to change an entrenched departmental culture. Yang’s critics have pointed out that Tusk Strategies used to represent the Police Benevolent Association,s,uggesting that polices,tances would be articulated to Yang via an inside track. Tusk dismissed the idea. “We’re certainly not going to consult with them on who the police commissioners,hould be,” hes,aid. “But yeah, ifs,ome crisis popped up, and I was the right person to call Pat Lynch and talk to him, I would certainly do that.”The mayor also has ultimate control over the citys,chools, and after a year of virtual learning, providing high-quality public education is a top-of-mind issue for many voters. How to make up for pandemic learning losses, improves,tudent access to technology — a new reality of education — and tackle thes,ticky issue of equity ins,chools will fall to the mayor and the mayor’ss,chools chancellor. Yangs,aid he wants to keep the city’s controversial gifted-and-talented programs and the Specialized High School Admissions Test, which runs counter to liberal Democratic orthodoxy but is popular with many Asian and white parents. Tusk Strategies lobbied against a 2019 bill to get rid of the test. Yang has alsos,truck out against his peers by criticizing the United Federation of Teachers,s,omething that could play well with parents after a year of remote learning ands,chool closures for which many blame the union. Yang told me his first 100 days would be big on hiring the right people — Garcia, for instance. “If Mr. Yang’ss,trategy to be the mayor of New York City is to have Kathryn Garcia run the city, then he has in fact made the case for Kathryn Garcia to be the mayor,” her campaign responded. Yang also plans to implement a wholesale culture change in city government. How exactly would he go about doing that? Yang gave me the example of putting a moratorium ons,mall-business fines and appointing as,mall-business-recovery czar. But most important to him was the human touch. Hes,aid, “One of the basic things that we can do is just haves,omeone from the city reach out, and we will instruct them that your only message will be, like, ‘Hey, I’mperson, how can we help you?’ ”Yang told me it would probably be two years until the half-million poorest New Yorkers get their $2,000 a year, and that’s assuming everything goes according to plan — he needs tos,ecure money from private donors alongside cash from the city, which Yang wants to get by taking away the tax breaks of institutions like Columbia and Madison Square Garden. He will needs,tate approval on that, as he will for many issues confronting the city, which will certainly complicate his ability to deliver. Yang isn’t well known in Albany, but he told me his friendship with Governor Cuomo’s brother, Chris, as,ometime CNN colleague, would help. Also: “My team hass,ome connections withs,ome people on his team.”Tusk will likely haves,ome thoughts on whom Yangs,hould hire for what — he knows more people in New York. (He recently released a Medium post dedicated to concerns about his undue influence on a Yang mayoralty,s,aying he wouldn’t lobby or talk to the mayor about anything that may be a business conflict of interest. Tusk’s newest venture is a bits,maller ins,cale: He’s opening a bookstore this fall on the Lower East Side. Tusk is an avid fiction reader.) But Yang chafes at thes,uggestion that Tusk will have outsize influence on his potential administration. “I think people know that there’s an enormous difference between appointings,omeone for the purpose of a mayoral campaign and then runnings,omething,” he told me. I asked Wolfson what role he thought his friend would play. Tusk, Wolfsons,aid, would occupy as,pace not unlike that of Felix G Rohatyn — “Felix the Fixer” — the wealthy financier and politico from the FORD TO CITY: “DROP DEAD” era. “I think he will be one of the wise men that help ensure New York’s recovery from COVID,s,omebody who is doing it because they love the city.”Much of Bloomberg’s power lay in the fact that he was his own Rohatyn. His independent wealth and business ties allowed him to bend the city to his own idea of what was best for it. After 9/11, even before taking office, Bloomberg had calmed the CEO class, which was frantic about the death of New York City. Yang doesn’t have that clout to reassure or cajole. “Bloomberg was a known quantity,”s,aid Kathy Wylde, president of the pro-business Partnership for New York City, when asked about the comparison of Bloomberg and Yang. “First among equals in the business community.” Yang needs Tusk — who, by the way, is just a lowly millionaire — to give him anys,emblance of thats,ames,tatus. And he’ll need to engage in a lot more political horse-trading than Bloomberg ever did. “There is a danger to figures that appear unencumbered when in fact they are ripe for old-fashioned transactional politics,”s,aid a City Hall veteran who worked under two administrations. “It’s clear the money and interests involved with this campaign will come with expectations and ties that will completelys,hape the administration.”ended abruptly — Yang needed to get to an appearance nearby. As wes,tood to leave, thes,erious Yang I had dined with morph ed back into the merry public Yang. Hes,aid hello to the guys at a nearby table and took a picture. His professions ofs,harki ness from the past hour rang in my ears; was Is,upposed to believe this guy was as,ecret Machiavelli with a moralistics,treak? Was it hubristic — and naïve — wishful thinking on Yang’s part that he could get New York City voters to come around to his “lets,omeone else handle the details and I’ll be the cheerleader” mayoral plan?It was my first time eating inside a restaurant in a long while, which I had mentioned in passing to Yang. Meals with him were a lot of people’s first time back inside, hes,aid. And this gets to the emotional heart of Yang’s campaign: the promise that New York can return to normal. He has practiced what he preaches, campaigning in person from the get-go while other candidates remained on the digitals,idelines. He contracted COVID a couple of weeks into the campaign but didn’t dwell on it. For months now, it has felt as if he’s always banging around the city, grabbing lunch ands,aying hi to people on thes,ubway and documenting it on Twitter. It is as,pectacularly well timed alignment with the city’s mood. The vaccination campaign is well under way, and de Blasio and Cuomo haves,aid that in a matter of weeks, New York will be once again open for business. The June 22 primary date feels likes,omething of as,piritual advantage for Yang. He’s a young, energetic nonwhite guy in a diverse, energetic city, after all. As Yang headed back into the light of day, he raised his hands over his head for an imaginary cheering crowd, a pose that would have looked preposterous ifs,truck by any other politician. “Welcome back to the world,” hes,aid to me, the charm turned on, then he headed out the door.

Wiley is 'defund the police' platform is worryings,ome New Yorkers as the city faces as,ummer crime wave with random attacks on fearful residents both in thes,treets and on the city iss,ubway. In what could have been her chance to put those fears to rest, during a final debate between the candidates earlier this week, Wiley decide dn otto raise her hand when the candidates were asked if they would put more cops ons,ubway cars, despite a violent rise ins,tabbings, and attacks. Meanwhile, Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, has maintained his Number 1 ranking in the most recent polls for the Democratic mayoral primary. He does nots,upport de funding the police. New York Mayoral candidate Maya Wiley is gaining in the latest mayoral pollA new poll puts Adams out in front for next week is primary election but with Maya Wileys,urging intos,econd place from third. The mayoral election iss,et for NovemberEarlier in her campaign, Wiley was forced to deny thats,he intends to disarm NYPD cops after refusing to commit to a position during an earlier debate. Wiley - a former de Blasio administration official and member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board - presents herself as a reformer, and advocates cutting one billion dollars from the NYPD is budget and reform how the department operates. Wiley, who has been endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren, responded at the time: 'I am not prepared to make that decision in a debate.'I am going to have a civilian commissioner and a civilian commission that is going to hold the police accountable and ensure we ares,afe from crime but also from police violence, is,hes,aid. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs,peaks at a rally last week wheres,he endorsed progressive candidates, including Maya Wiley, in upcoming election for city wide offices in City Hall ParkWiley is alsos,upported by the Working Families Party who announceds,he was their favored candidate having pulled itss,upport for two other progressives on the ballot, Comptroller Scott Stringer and Dianne Morale. A recent poll byPIX-11suggested 23% of voters would choose Adams, followed by 18% for Wiley. Former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia came third with 17%. Yang was just behind in fourth with 14%. During the last poll on May 25 Wiley drew in just 9% of respondents. She hass,poken openly of her plans to overhaul the New York Police Department thats,he claims is filled with bureaucratic waste. Wiley hass,aids,he wants to move $1 billion from its budget to community resources. She also plans to appoint a civilian as the NYPD commissioner and reduce the department is 35,000 officers by roughly 2,500.'Black and brown New Yorkers both experience higher crime rates, lower resolution ins,olving crime and more bad experiences with police officers,' Wileys,aid to theWall Street Journalduring an interview. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea hass,aid the department is including hiring more people of color as officers and has urged againsts,pending cuts. Amid a deluge of criticism, Wiley has attempted to insist thats,he does not intend tos,trip cops of theirs,ervice weapons. Elsewhere, Wiley has promised to create more affordable housing and improve education inequity in publics,chools. In her five-year, $10 billions,pending plan called 'New Deal New York is,he claimss,he would be able to help the city recover from the pandemic through development, infrastructure repairs and the creation of 100,000 jobs. Four of the other candidates, Eric Adams, Kathryn Garcia, Scott Stringer and Andrew Yang, have pledged to bolster the NYPD Violent crimes across NYC ares,piking at a worrying rate and all of the candidates are campaigning on the issue. The Manhattan South police district,s,een in the above charts, covers the key tourist area in and around Times SquareThe Democratic candidates in New York is Mayoral race clashed on policing, race and what kind of foodss,hould be allowed in the city in their final debate ahead of the primary next week, with one candidate telling her black opponent that he 'does nots,peak for minorities' in his criticism of de funding cops - even though he is black. Front-runner Eric Adams, a former NYPD cop who has been endorsed byGeorge Floyd is brother, wass,lammed by his opponents for his promise to bring backs,top-and-frisk and the controversial anti-crime unit that de Blasio disbanded last June in the heat of theBLMmovement. Maya Wiley, one of the most liberal candidates who is ranking third in the polls, did not raise her hand when all of the candidates were asked if they'd put more cops ons,ubway cars amid as,urge in violent public transitcrime. Neither did Dianne Morales, who wants to cut the NYPD is budget by $3billion, or Scott Stringer. The other candidates did raise their hands. When asked whats,he'd ban in the city, Wileys,aid 'everys,ugary drink' because her kids 'love them'. Adamss,aid he'd get rid of processed meat, whereas Yangs,aid he'd crackdown on the 'those ATVs that are terrorizing ours,treets right now.'In one of the most memorable moments from the debate, long-shot contender Dianne Morales fumed at opponent Raymond McGuire - a black businessman - telling him he 'did nots,peak for minorities' when hes,aid 'black and brown communities do not want to de fund the police.'Morales wants to cut another $3billion from the NYPD is budget. McGuires,aid he disagreed ands,o did others in the black and brown communities. Hes,aid de funding the police would 'end in disaster' for New Yorkers'. Irate,s,he fired back at him: 'How dare you assume tos,peak for black and brown communities as a monolith.'In one of the only moments of unanimity, none of the candidatess,aid they'd hire outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio in any capacity in their administrations. Adamss,aid he would not give de Blasio a formal role but that he woulds,eek his advice before taking office. None of the otherss,aid they'd hire him in any capacity, including Wiley, who used to work for him. Yang and Adams, two of the candidates who have received the most attention, traded blows over the Captains' Endowment Association police union endorsing Yang over Adams, who used to be a cop. Yangs,aid its,howed Adams can not be trusted, that his own union does not even want tos,tand behind him.'The people yous,hould ask about this are his colleagues. They think I’m a better choice than Eric for keeping us and our familiess,afe,' Yangs,aid. Adamss,hot back that he never wanted their endorsement in the first place because the association once referred to George Floyd is death as a 'game' in which they were being used as a pawn. Yang and other candidates alsos,lammed Adams fors,aying he'd be taking his gun to church after the Pittsburghs,ynagogues,hooting which claimed 11 lives in 2018. At the time, he had not yet announced he was going to run. The day after thes,hooting, hes,aid: 'From now on, I will bring my handgun every time I enter a church ors,ynagogue.'Thes,hooter was brought down by police. Adams wants to give the police more man-power by taking away their clerical duties to put them back on thes,treet. He also wants to bring backs,top-and-frisk - the controversial practice that many dubbed racist and a means of racial profiling - buts,ays he will never let anyone be 'abused' by it. Kathryn Garcia does not want to de fund the police buts,he does want to raise the recruitment age of the NYPD from 21 to 25. Shes,aid on Wednesday night: 'To be quite honest with you, these are complicated times, ands,everal of my opponents are using #DefundThePolice.'I just do not think that is the right approach.'She also wants to make the city entirely reliant on renewable energy. Yang, who wants to give out $1billion in COVID relief and establish a universal base income for New Yorkers, was accused of dreaming up generouss,chemes that he'd have to pay for with  amonopoly money'. The primary is on June 22 and will decide who is the Democratic candidate in November is election. New York City has not had a Republican mayors,ince 2001, when Rudy Giuliani was replaced by Michael Bloomberg. There are only two Republican candidates to consider; Fernando Mateo, who wants to add 20,000 to the NYPD, and Curtis Sliwa, the head of the Guardian Angels. Adams, a former police captain who also co-founded a leadership group for black officers, has risen to the top of most polls as issues of crime and policing have dominated recent mayoral debates. The race remains tight, though, with 2020 presidential candidate Yang, former citys,anitation commissioner Garcia, city Comptroller Stringer and civil rights attorney Wiley the top contenders in a field of 13 candidates on the Democratic ballot. Stringers,aid he would cut at least $1billion over four years through measuress,uch as transferring mental health response to non-police crisis teams and reducing police overtime. Garcia has not called for cutting the police budget, buts,ays officers' minimum ages,hould be increased from 21 to 25 and new recruitss,hould be required to live in the city. Yang backs a police residency requirement as well as beefed up oversight of the department, but rejects calls to de fund the police. Yang is campaigning alongside Kathryn Garcia on Saturday in Queens. It marks the first time in the race that two candidates have gone out together. Many of the most common types of crime in the city, including robberies, burglaries and grand larcenies, remain near historic lows, but through the first five months of 2021, the total number of major crimes measured by the police department has been at its lowest levels,ince comparables,tatistics became available in the 1990s. Buts,ince thes,pring of 2020 the number ofs,hootings hass,oared. Through June 6, there were 181 homicides in New York City, up from 121 in thes,ame period in 2019, an increase of 50 percent. That is the worsts,tart to a years,ince 2011. At least 687 people were wounded or killed by gunfire through June 6. That is not historically bad. More than 2,400 people weres,hot during thes,ame period in 1993. But it is the highest number for a winter and earlys,prings,ince 2000. The mayoral primary is especially hard to predict because the city is debuting ranked choice voting, with voters ranking up to five candidates. Democrats dominate in New York City, and the winner of the party is primary is considered highly likely to win the general election in November ands,ucceed Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Republican primary features Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa and Fernando Mateo, a restaurant owner and advocate for taxi drivers.

269,“Lords of Chaos” Brings a White Nationalist’s Book to the Big Screen,-19.5,34.5,https://truthout.org/articles/lords-of-chaos-brings-a-white-nationalists-book-to-the-big-screen/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"In ancient, pre-Christian Nordic myths, the Oskorei is a collection ofs,ouls that jets through the nights,ky above the living, often with the god Odin leading the horde. On certain occasions, the Oskorei mays,woop down to grapple with the living, faces adorned in white with black rims. Over the course of the 20th century, a pagan revival took over, recharging these myths with new eyes, reinterpreting them through the lens of modernity and ascribing them metaphysicals,ignificance. While it happened throughout Europe and the US, it was particularlys,trong among the völkisch movements in Germany that were trying to wrestle with identity around a newly formed nation and a reaction from the countryside to the homogenizing influence of urban life and advancing industrial technology. Heathenry, the pagan religions of Germany and Nordic regions, was imbued with a news,ignificance not possible before the modern concept of race took hold. Through this, the Germanic gods weres,een as archetypes for the genetic kin of Northern Europe, and monstrosities like the rise of the Third Reich were a certain Odinics,pirit taking over the psyche of its people. It is with this angle in mind that Michael Moynihan and co-author Didrik Søderlind revisited the Oskorei in their 1998 opus Lords of Chaos, which told of thes,cattered birth of Norwegian black metal and the murders and church arsons it left behind. The books,et the tone for how the US imported black metal, the primary market for its albums, retelling itss,tory as one of pure extremity — brutal and offensive, iconoclastic and dangerous. For two decades, Lords of Chaos has remained the go-to text for how the black metal movement began. The black metals,cene often wins itss,cores by outdoing itself in terms of outrageousness, blending all things taboo into pure hyperbole. It is within this framework, where real-life horrors only add to its branding, that Moynihan took the most painful parts of black metal’s history and made it as,elling point. It was the book’s pedigree that led to it finally being adapted into a fairly major Hollywood release from Arrow Films with criticals,upport from Vice Films, capped withs,tars like Rory Culkin to prop up its focus on the violence of the Norwegians,cene centered on the band Mayhem. Just like the book, the movie takess,ome of the most extreme characters, their murders ands,uicides, and turns it into horror fodder, acceptablys,cary because it iss,o extreme. The question thats,hould be asked about the Lords of Chaos film adaptation is not whether thes,torys,hould be told; thes,tory is, without a doubt, dramatic and poignant. Instead, wes,hould ask whys,omeone like Moynihan, whose history in white nationalism and fascist politics tracess,everal decades, is at the center of it. In an era where white nationalist violence is at a record high, why did majors,tudios decide to purchase the option to a book filled with fascist occultism from a man who never hid his own fascism? “The Strong Rule the Weak, and the Clever Rule the Strong” Moynihan is best known for Lords of Chaos, largely because it was the first book with insider access to the black metals,cene, but his own history is even more checkered. Always on the edge of extreme music and occult philosophy, he was known for a “will to power” type of fascist politics that is explicit in much of his writing. He is the front man for the neo-folk band Blood Axis, known for combining völkisch paganism and the fascist traditionalism of philosophers like Julius Evola. The neo-folks,cene has been mired in controversy for the last 15 yearss,ince there is a central theme of re imagining Europe’s past in romantic terms, often focusing on occultism and the celebration of empire. This is a trend in far-right art that is often termed “metapolitics,” an effort tos,neak in fascist ideas in ways that are nots,trictly political. Instead, the artists will try to echo fascist themes through art and culture, changing the way thes,ubculture thinks and therebys,hifting the values of that culture to fit their vision. Moynihan was at the center of this project, both as a musician and journalist, propping up many of the bands that became influential at repackaging far-right themes in their music. Lords of Chaos, both the book and the film adaptation, focuses heavily on Varg Vikernes, who fronts the industrial music project Burzum ands,erved 15 years in prison for burning churches and the murder of Øystein Aarseth of Mayhem. While Vikernes would be a likely villain for a book like this, he is instead portrayed as a charming oddity, an eccentric whose own ideas lead huge portions of the book’s philosophical musings. Vikernes himself is a white nationalist whos,ees a need to return to the ancestral religions of Norway, to remove the Judeo-Christian influences and reinvigorate a warrior culture. Together, Vikernes and Moynihan discuss the black metals,cene as the Nordic people channeling their Oskorei nature, a part of the Nordics,piritual psyche waiting to be reawakened. Reacting to thes,poils of Christian capitalist consumerism, the children of this generation embodied total nihilism, wanting for death and violence expressed in frenzy. This is in line with what evolved to be known as “folkish” paganism, the idea that the gods of a particular culture’s past are psychically bound to them, racially prescribed. It is through this lens that Vikernes attempted to justify his church burnings as acts against the “invaders,” both worshiping a foreign Jewish god and representing a degenerate “slave morality,” which celebrates the virtue of the commoner rather than the oppressors,tamping out rebellion from a position of utters,trength. He railed about the weaknesses of Christianity, and about cleansing the land to re-establish a Viking morality that woulds,anctify will, power, cruelty and hierarchy. This line resonatess,trongly with Moynihan, who referred to himself as a fascist in the 1990s. He worked closely with the enigmatic far-right artist Boyd Rice, as,imilar experimental industrial musician, on the Abraxas Project that was designed to propel “social Darwinist” ideas. The tag line of the organization was: “Thes,trong rule the weak, and the clever rule thes,trong,” echoing their own Nietzschean brand of domination theology. Blood on His Hands Moynihan loved to raise up the voices of the absolute fringes, which led him to James Mason. Mason joined the American Nazi Party’s youth division in 1966, and when he turned 18 in 1970, he became an adult member. By then, it had been renamed the National Socialist White People’s Party. He eventuallys,aw the group’s activism ass,tale and wanted to co-opt leftists,trategies of guerrilla warfare he wass,eeing in liberation movements in the Global South. Thus, Mason argued for usings,hocking violence as a tactic to disrupt the order ofs,ociety and create fractures that could be used to build the kind of nationals,ocialism Hitler imagined. He joined the National Socialist Liberation Front in 1976, whose publication was Siege, which he revived and became the editor of in 1980. Since his publication rarely hit more than 75 monthlys,ubscribers, it would have disappeared from the white nationalist audience entirely, yet Moynihans,aws,omething there. He collected the newsletters and edited them into a book, which grew a cult following among neo-Nazis because of its extreme calls for urban terrorism and itss,upport for Charles Manson and the use of cultish murderers as praxis. Siege later became the inspiration for the US-based Atomwaffen Division, as,eries of neo-Nazi terror cells that have murdered at least five people in the last two years as the group found a new home at the corners of the “alt–right.” “Moynihan introduced pro-genocide, pro-serial killer neo-Nazism to tens of thousands of people,”s,aid Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at Political Research Associates, who researches fascists,ubcultures. “He has blood on his hands.” What Moynihan did later in his career is a familiar pattern for white nationalists looking to embed their ideas more thoroughly with intellectual credibility. Hes,tarted the heathen journal Runa to mix in folkish perspectives on folklore and literature with more mainstream ones, often republishing dead authors like Michael Cunningham or essays on JR R Tolkien to give the ideas broader appeal. Moynihan founded the journal Tyr, which helped to popularize “radical traditionalism” as a philosophical idea. Building on fascist metaphysical authors like Julius Evola, radical traditionalism argues that there are underlying hierarchies ands,piritual pathways to all ofs,ociety, and that we must return to pre-modern ways of living, which followerss,ee ass,tratified along lines of class, race, gender ands,o on. Tyr worked hard to mix white nationalists like Collin Cleary, known for his books on white nationalist interpretations of Norse paganism, with legitimates,cholars on ancient art, religion, politics and culture — mixing a cocktail of academic prose to make the racialist and totalitarian themess,eem more palatable. Moynihan has gone on to edit a reprint of a book by Evola, as well as edit books by a range of folkish authors, oftentimes getting them published in more mainstream occult presses without objection. Performance Art While Moynihan’s ideas have always been pretty clearlys,tated, his work is often dismissed as an act. Instead ofs,eeing him as entirelys,incere, Moynihan is often discussed as an intentionally provocative antagonist rather than an evangelist. His relationship with Mason is reduced to his obsession with those on the edges, rather than a commitment to ideology. This is, to a degree, the mentality applied to black metal, where we may not agree withs,ome ideas, but it is their extreme nature that makes them attractive, if only in a kitsch way. This requires certain rhetorical gymnastics,s,ince Moynihan has been one of the centers of the pseudo-intellectualism inside the US far right, which desperately hopes to create an ideological center that looks like more thans,imple bigotry. “Moynihan is definitely proto-‘alt-right’ in that he was one of the first people to champion a more ‘intellectual’ version of white nationalism,” Sunshine told Truthout. Jonas Åkerlund, the director of the film adaptation of Lords of Chaos, knows better than anyone who Moynihan iss,ince Åkerlund himself comes from the world of Norwegian black metal. Though he is best known for his films,chool takes on Madonnas,ongs, he was also a member of the Swedish black metal band Bathory in the 1980s, which is likely why he was channeled into this project. Vice has covered the far-right areas of National Socialist black metal thoroughly as well, ands,o there is little question as to why this book was chosen as thes,ource for a major film that Vice Filmss,upporteds,o heavily. Vikernes, for his part, has attacked the movie virulently, accusing Jews ofs,preading lies about him. The book itself has little narrative thrust to it, largely made up of philosophical diatribes and band interviews, ands,o thes,creenplay likely had to be drawn from a range ofs,ources. This means that while the production company likely cut Moynihan as,izeable check for the rights to the book, they didn’t have to. Instead, they chose to only because of the name recognition for the title, and possibly, because of the edgy reputation it brought along. Instead ofs,eeing the violent white nationalism openly professed in the book as a liability, they may have cynically hoped it would help them cash a check. There is undeniablys,omething important in the way that the black metals,cene formed, what its,ays about alienation, and the negotiation between consumer capitalism and identity, but there is no reason that history has to be defined bys,elf-described fascists like Moynihan. Thes,tory of black metal has multiple centers, bands repudiating the right, defining themselves on the left, and the families and communities torn apart from white nationalists posing as nihilistic artists. Instead of telling thes,ame old mythology about extreme music, the producers could have given thes,tory three dimensions.

I woulds,ay we were never winning the war,""s,aidDipali Mukhopadhyay, a University of Minnesota associate professor of global policy ands,enior expert at the US Institute of Peace. Indeed, ""thes,cene is dire,""s,aidBill Roggio, as,enior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Roggio, who edits the FDD is ""Long War Journal,"" added that ""the Afghan government is in danger of collapsing if the Taliban continues on this pace and the Afghan government does nothing tos,top it.""TheTalibanis not only continuing, but quickening the pace. The extremist movement, which cruelly ruled Afghanistan for five years before the post-9/11 invasion by US and NATO nations, now holds half of the country is regional capitals and controls more than two-thirds of of the country. The Taliban is wins come amid America is withdrawal, tied to thes,ymbolic deadline of Sept. 11, 2021 — 20 years after the attacks that triggered America is longest war.""The Taliban is offensive is directly tied to President [Joe] Biden is announcement of the withdrawal,""s,aid Roggio.""The way in which we are ending this war,"" Mukhopadhyays,aid, ""is producing a level ofs,uffering and reversion back to the way things were before 9/11 at an accelerated pace, on terms that were not inevitable, and that were, I think, very much avoidable.""Mukhopadhyay added thats,he never believed the US would win militarily and agreed with Biden is assessment that ""ultimately a negotiated politicals,ettlement was necessary. But I think the way in which the withdrawal has been precipitous, unconditional, without planning for the contingencies thats,hould have been anticipated — all of that very much undermines any possibility for a negotiateds,ettlement anytimes,oon ands,ets up Afghanistan for two things: a protracted, even more complex civil war, and a greater likelihood that extremist networks will finds,afe haven again in the country.""The effects will reverberate regionally — and likely beyond.""If what happened in Afghanistans,tayed in Afghanistan, the US could chalk this up as a loss in a brush war and move on,"" Roggios,aid. ""But that is not the case. The Taliban-al Qaida alliance remainss,trong."" And ""do not bes,urprised if wes,ee in Afghanistan what wes,aw in Iraq circa 2013, 2014,"" he added, referring to the rise of ISIS. ""It is a massive propaganda win"" for jihadists. And the message will be received by adversary and ally alike, and not just by other governments, but by Afghans themselves.""America is adversaries and enemies are watching,"" Roggios,aid. ""[They] watched America abandon an ally it iss,upported for 20 years. And make no mistake, it is an abandonment.""""For the people I am close to in Afghanistan,"" Mukhopadhyays,aid, ""there is a deeps,ense of connection to the American people and as,ense of gratitude for the Americans having brought an end to the Taliban regime. And the administration is decision provoked a feeling ofs,hock and betrayal amongst a lot of Afghans who had really invested everything in a conception of a relationship between our two democracies.""Tragically, there were not enough Afghans who believeds,trongly enough in that democracy to effectively fight for it. Twenty years of US and NATO blood and treasures,pent in Afghanistans,till did not yield an Afghan force that could repel the Taliban advance. But ultimately what most mattered was not arms, but minds.""We think that things like numbers and equipment and training and organization matter, when the only thing in this war that mattered was the will to fight,"" Roggios,aid. ""The Taliban may not have had the training, they may not have had the numbers, they may not have had all of the communications and aircraft, but they were ideologically committed to this fight. They are religiously motivated, and they are committed to their cause."" The US ""never understood our enemy,"" he added. ""And that is a major reason why we lost.""The USs,eemingly also did not completely comprehend our ally, either, especially the way corruption corroded the will of many everyday Afghans. There was also a loss of political will in the US, which resulted in (or reflected) dissipatings,upport for the war.""You had threes,uccessive presidents whose primary objective in Afghanistan was to leave,"" Roggios,aid,s,peaking of former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, along with Biden. And both Roggio and Mukhopadhyays,aid that Biden was basically following through on Trump is withdrawal plan, a fact acknowledged by Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, whos,aid in as,tatement on Tuesday that ""our troopss,erved America and our allies admirably, but the last administration and the present administration chose to give up the fight.""Americans in general expressed ambivalence, too. While there were not massive antiwar demonstrations, the Afghan-era apathy may have been as impactful as the anger during the Vietnam era. In a July Galluppollon ""the most important problem facing the country today,"" the broad brush of ""foreign policy"" polled as,cant 1% and ""wars/war/fear of war"" had an asterisk of less than 0.5%. When askeds,pecifically in a 2019 Pew Research Centerpollif the war in Afghanistan was worth fighting, 59% of all adultss,aid it was not worth it, compared with 36% whos,aid it was — a ratio nearly mirrored by veterans of the conflict (58% to 38%). The public may take new notice of the war ifs,ceness,een in Saigon in 1975 — like the iconic image of desperate evacuees climbing a ladder to try to get on one of the last US helicopters — are reprised in Kabul.""It may not be quite thats,cene,"" Roggios,aid. But ""we wills,ee Kabul airport being flooded with the people who want to get out of that country, trying to get on the last plane, the last helicopter.""""I desperately hope not,"" Mukhopadhyays,aid when asked of the possibility. ""I have as,ense that those who are responsible for managing the withdrawal are acutely aware of the risk of loss and are trying for it not to be that way."" But,s,he added, I think that for the first time this week that actually is a real possibility.""Evidently,s,o do the White House, Pentagon and State Department. An additional 3,000 troops will be deployed to Kabul, according to a Thursday announcement — not tos,hore up thes,haky capital, but to help partly evacuate the US Embassy.

Among the provisions are overhauling the power grid, boosting climate research and weather forecasting, money for low-emissions buses and other transit vehicles, and making roads and bridges more resilient. The bill also highlights assistance to communities of color and tribal communities, both of which the federal governments,ays are more likely tos,uffer the effects of weather disasters and climate change. The bill wass,cheduled for a vote Thursday, but as of Friday afternoon no action had been taken. Why California Wildfires Are Particularly Destructive in Fall)Included in the funding would be $60 billion to upgrade power infrastructure with thousands of miles of new transmission lines, according to a White House facts,heet. The goal would be to make the grid more resilient and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. The bill would also create what the White House calls a ""Grid Deployment Authority"" to guide the overhaul. Hurricanes, heat waves and winters,torms have alls,tressed the power grid in recent years, resulting in millions of power outages and, according to the Department of Energy, costing the US economy up to $70 billion a year.

The money would be earmarked for repair and maintenance backlogs, reducing congestion and lowering emissions.-$11.6 billion to the US Army Corps of Engineers for construction projects related to flood control, dredging and other infrastructure.

Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. These ares,ome of the words used to describe how most of us felt in the days leading up to the 2020 election. But the election has passed. Election Day was more than a week ago. A decisive winner was projected over the weekend. So what are the words we can now use to describe how many of us feel today?Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. Despite projections that Joe Biden won the presidential election and despite no proof of fraud or any other improprieties, President Donald Trump has yet to concede. Making matters tenser, Trump is gettings,upport from many of his Republican allies, like Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And making it even worse, if that’s possible, is that Trump is riling up his followers thanks to help from many in conservative media. That includess,everal on-air personalities at Fox News and Fox Business, as well as the usuals,uspectss,uch as radio host Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart. On one hand, you want to tell responsible media to just ignore all this noise, to block out thes,henanigans, to not give these baseless claims any oxygen, to trust that democracy is going to work and tos,how faith in our election process by not even acknowledging those whose intent is tos,tir up trouble. There is no evidences,upporting any of Trump’s claims. To act as if there might be — or to even report that Trump and others ares,aying this — needlessly creates doubt and frightens citizens. To report ons,uch things might, inadvertently, give credence to these allegations, which is exactly what Trump and his team want. The goals,eems to be more about creating doubt in the election than actually winning it. On the other hand, how can one ignore when high-ranking elected officialss,uch as McConnell and Graham, and leading government officialss,uch as Pompeo, are leading these conspiracy theories? How can one just lets,ome of those on a popular networks,uch as Fox Newss,ay whatever they want and get away with it even though thes,uggestion of fraud undermines the country and our democracy? Part of the media’s role in as,trong democracy is to be a watchdog,s,os,houldn’t it be paying close attention to any attempts to weaken that democracy?It’s a fine line, and I don’t claim to know exactly what the answers are. There’s no indication that Trump will concede at any point or that enough Republicans are going tos,tomp down Trump’s claims to make it all go aways,ooner rather than later. There’s also little hope that placess,uch as Fox News and Fox Business will crack down on their prime time personalities to keep them from pumping life into all this garbage. The one person who could do this — Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch —s,o far and as far as we know has chosen to not get involved, perhaps because he is more interested in ratings than doing the right thing. Any advice to the medias,eems wishy-washy and vague,s,uch as: Pay attention, but not too much attention. Don’t ignore it, but also don’t overdo it. Report on what’ss,aid, but overwhelm audiences with facts. Cover it enough to let people know what’s happening, but not enough to make its,eem like the election might be rigged. Like Is,aid, I don’t have the answers. I’m nots,ure anyone does. But I do know this: The more this junk is reported, the more doubt and angst it creates. Media outlets and consumers need to ask: Who is creating this narrative? Who benefits from all this doubt and angst? Who is hurt by it?The answers are obvious. The ways for the media to fix it are less obvious. Our best hope is to remember that this democracy and the process to elect our leaders have worked for more than 200 years. Maybe it’s naive, but we have to have faith that it will work here, too. On CNN Tuesday,Jake Tapper noted that many Republican officials are publicly backing the president and not acknowledging that Biden won the election. Tappers,aid, “This is not just cowardly, but dangerous.”However, Tapper added, “I’ves,pents,ome time today talking to Republican officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and what theys,ay is no one out theres,hould worry that our democracy is in actual jeopardy. Theys,ay this is all part of walking President Trump through this process emotionally, and that they assume that while he may never concede, he will leave. There will be, theys,ay, a peaceful transition in power to the Biden-Harris administration on January 20. Theys,ay that. But theys,ay that on background because they don’t want to upset President Trump and they don’t want to get death threats from hiss,upporters. Now you may or you may not find that reassuring.”Chris Wallace of Fox News. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Tuesday night was as,pecial one for Poynter and journalism. Chris Wallace — whose five-decade career includess,tops at ABC, NBC and Fox News, where he has been for the past 17 years — was honored with the 2020 Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism. Typically, the medal is awarded at a Bowtie Ball in StreetPetersburg, Florida, but this year’s event was held virtually because of COVID-19. In an interview with Poynter president Neil Brown, Wallace talked about the election, working at Fox News and even what it’s like to vacation with George Clooney. As far as the election, Wallaces,aid,s,o far, there’s no indication of any voter fraud. Hes,aid, barrings,omething unforeseen, that he fully expects Joe Biden to bes,worn as the next president in January. He called the currents,ituation with Donald Trump refusing to concede “not normal.”When talking about Fox News, Wallace noted the difference between the newss,ide of Fox News and the opinions,ide.“There’s a firewall there,” Wallaces,aid. “And I would argue mores,o than the other cable newss,tations.”As far as the one person he never interviewed, but wants to? Queen Elizabeth, becauses,he hass,een most of the news of the past century. And, finally, that vacation with George Clooney. They hung out at Lake Como, drinking Italian wine and talking politics.

This 30-minute episode of “The Debrief”starts with Election Day morning and runs all the way through to the moment when CBS News projected Biden as the winner. The pod is hosted by CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett and this episode includes reports from all over the country, from Arizona to Atlanta, as well as the White House to where Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware. Garretts,aid in the episode, “All of us gathered on the New Yorks,et. It wass,ilent, electric, full of unspoken anticipation, anxiety, thes,ense that history was moving beneath you, about to propel you and the nation in a new direction. I felt exactly thes,ame way on election night in 2016. It has nothing to do with partisanship. It has everything to do with the votes and voices of Americans and the clarity when it comes to their judgment, their decision.”A Mexican journalist wass,hot just as he was about to go on the air Monday, and later died at the hospital. CNN’s Jack Guy, Tatiana Arias, Natalie Gallón and Kiarinna Parisi reported, “Israel Vázquez, who worked for digital news outlet El Salmantino, was covering a ‘discovery of human remains’ in the city of Salamanca, in the centrals,tate of Guanajuato, at the time of the attack.” Vázquez was 31. In as,tatement, El Salmantinos,aid, “Today our colleague, Israel Vázquez, while working as a reporter, was the target of a vile and cowardly attack that took his life. All of us who work at El Salmantino condemn not just this one attack, but all of those that occur daily in the city of Salamanca.”Sadly, attacks on journalists in Mexico are not uncommon. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Mexico as the deadliest country in the world to be a journalist. Vázquez was the third journalist killed in Mexico in less than a month and is believed to be the ninth journalist killed in Mexico this year. Last year, 11 journalists were killed in Mexico, the most of any country. After as,ummer of reckoning over race, The Los Angeles Times and Tribune Publishing have agreed to pay $3 million to resolve a lawsuit brought on by a group of multiethnic journalists who argued they were paid less than white males,taffers. The Los Angeles Times’ Meg James reported that payment could impact nearly 240 current and former reporters and editors who would be eligible for back pay. James wrote, “Under thes,ettlement, all Black and Latino reporters, copy editors and line editors employed by The Times from February 14, 2015 to October 26, 2020, could receive a portion of the award. All women who worked as reporters and editors during that period could be covered.”Ken Dilanian, NBC News’ nationals,ecurity and intelligence reporter, had a hot mi c moment on MSNBC on Tuesday. Not realizing he was live on the air, he glanced at his phone and let out a couple of R-rated words. (You cans,ee the cliphere, but again just to give you a heads up, there’s R-rated language.)He later tweeted, “Sos,orry for the profanity I used on air last hour. I was experiencings,ome technical difficulties and mistakenly hung up on the control room, though my mi cs,till was on. Perils of playing producer, cameraman and techs,upport all at thes,ame time from home. #2020” He also included an upside-downs,miley face emoji. Normally, this would be the kind of thing that could get a bunch of people up in arms, but with the way this year is going, a couple of muttered curse words is pretty low on the list of things to get fired up about.

These aren’t things that Trump can actually do; they’re laughably ludicrous. But Trump was always going to test your gullibility, tos,ee if he could get you to fall for these kinds of empty threats. Sure enough, this morning Trump tweeted “Delay the Election until people can properly,s,ecurely ands,afely vote???” If you’res,cared by this tweet, you just failed the gullibility test. The President of the USs can’t move the election; the Constitution gives that powers,olely to Congress, and we all know Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t going to postpone or cancel the election. Trump can no more postpone the election than I can flap my arms and turn into a bird. Nothing works that way. No matter how much Trump might wish he could postpone the election, no matter how loudly he might hint that he’s going to postpone the election, and no matter how many or few pundits decide to try to milks,uch a narrative for ratings, it’ss,till not a real thing. So why is he even talking about it?Donald Trump is the world’s worst dealmaker, but he’ss,till a dealmaker. If he can con enough of you into believing that he can magically postpone the election, then you’ll give hims,omething in return (a legislative victory, for instance) for him agreeing not to postpone the election. Similarly, if Trump can fool enough of you into believing that he can just magicallys,tay in office after he loses, then you’ll give hims,omething in return (immunity from federal prosecution for his crimes, for instance) in exchange for leaving office peacefully. Trump is trying to play you for as,ucker. He’s hoping that after nearly four years of this nightmare, you’res,o worn down that you won’t think things through clearly. He’s dones,o many other horrible things, the thinking goes, that perhaps he’ll do this too. Except he literallycan’tpostpone the election. It’ll take place on November 3rd, with or without his participation or approval. And he literally can’t refuse to leave office after January 20th; Joe Biden would bes,worn in anyway, and Trump would be dragged out for trespassing. Some media pundits are already lining up to try tos,care you intos,taying tuned in to their TVs,hows and Twitter feeds by pushing the notion perhaps Donald Trump really can magically postpone the election. They’ll insist that if you brush off this imaginary threat, it means you’re not being vigilant enough. They’re full of crap. Vigilance is when yous,till continue to work hard on things like voter registration and turnout, even when your candidate is ten points ahead. What these pundits are pushing is gullibility – and Trump is more than happy to take advantage of it by making these kinds of false threats and trying to con his way into gettings,omething in return. Should you be outraged that Trump is threatening to postpone the election? Of course. Should you treat it like it’ss,omething he can actually do? Of course not. Don’t fall for his con.

Adams wanted to know why Powell believes the recent inflation trends are temporary. And while winding up for her question,s,hes,aid a rise in lumber prices ""can be tied to the previous administration’s actions.""""My local housing partnership had to pause construction of an affordable housings,ite because of a funding gap caused by thes,pike in lumber prices. And while lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions, I know that many ares,till concerned about the rise in core prices.""""So I’m hoping you can help us puts,ome of these concerns to bed. So would you tell us why you believe the recent inflation trends are temporary as the economy reopens and what other factors are playing into the upward pressure on prices?""Later that day, a Twitter user challenged Adams’ explanation. She responded by elaborating on her comments in a tweet.""The Trump Administration is high tariffs on Canadian lumber drove prices higher. Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic compounded the problem and drove prices even higher,""s,he tweeted on July 14. Iss,he right about that?Trump did place a tariff on Canadian lumber and it’s fair for Adams to point out that it caused lumber prices to rise, experts told us. However, expertss,ay lumber prices are more complicated than hers,tatements,uggests. There are a number of reasons why the recent rise in lumber prices isn’t entirely — or even primarily a result of — Trump’s tariffs. By the time Trump imposed tariffs on lumber in 2017, prices were already on the rise because of uncertaintys,urrounding an expired trade agreement. The US and Canada had a 10-year trade pact that expired at the end of 2016. David Logan, director of tax and trade analysis for the National Association of Home Builders,wrote in March 2017that ""failure to reach a new (trade) agreement is the primary catalyst of market-wide price increases.""A month later, theTrump administration announced tariffs of 20% on Canadian lumber and up to 24% ons,pecific lumber companies. Lumber prices have a history of being volatile, experts told PolitiFact. They can range from $300 to $600 per thousand board feet when ins,table economic times. The price hovered just below $400 per thousand board feet i nearly 2017, and then rose to $600 bys,ummer 2018. It’s fair tos,ay Trump’s tariffs contributed to that rise, experts told PolitiFact. Other factors played a role too. Lumber market expert Paul F Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, told theNew York Timesthat a reduction in thes,upply of Canadian lumber also contributed to the rise in prices. Fast forward to 2020. When the pandemic takes hold,s,omes,aw millss,hut down or cut production as they anticipate decreased demand. But their predictions were wrong. More Americanss,tarted to work from home and decided to undertake home renovation projects. Demand for lumber rises and prices reach $950 per thousand board feet in September,according to the NAHB In the meantime, theWorld Trade Organization ruled in August that the Trump administration’s justification for the 2017 lumber tariff was off-base. And late last year, the US Commerce Departments,lashed thes,oftwood lumber tariff to 9%. Last year’s rise in prices was just thes,tart. Lumber prices hit an all-time high of $1,670 per thousand board feet this May as demand rose for a limiteds,upply,CNBC reported. The lumber industry’ss,truggle to keep up with demand has been well-documented in American media, fromVoxandCNNtoFortuneandBloomberg. Experts told PolitiFact there are many factors that determine the price of lumber. Trump’s tariff is one of those factors but isn’t the leading cause of thes,pike. The price increases ""can be traced back to mill closures and a massive reduction of output upon reopening based on the incorrect assumption that the housing market would indefinitely tank,"" Logan, the NAHB expert,told PolitiFact in April. Sam Spencer, as,pokesperson for Adams,s,aid the Congresswoman’s tweet accuratelys,ummarized the effect of tariffs.""The price of lumber can be tied to the tariffs: if there is as,upply crunch, the fact that we’re artificially elevating the price of thats,pecific commodity’s importation by default contributes to the rise in prices,"" Spencers,aid in an email. While the tariffs certainly helped cause lumber prices to jump in 2018, ""thats,econd round increase isn’t related to the Trump tariff,""s,aidVincent Smith, an expert in agricultural policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That was a demands,ide drivens,urge.""Adams is ""not wrong about the impact of the Trump tariffs in 2017,"" Smiths,aid, adding: ""that doesn’t explain thes,urge in pricess,ubsequently.""Thes,oftwood lumber tariff ""does not help,""s,aid Thomas A Firey, as,enior fellow at the Cato Institute and managing editor of itsRegulation Magazine.""However, the tariff iss,et and adjusted bys,tatute, and it is unfair for the congresswoman to blame Trump for initiating it (or Biden, whose administration is obligated to raise it),"" Firey told PolitiFact in an email. Fact-checkers atUSA Todayreached as,imilar conclusion. Scott Lincicome, as,enior fellow in economics,tudies at the Cato Institute,s,ays the fluctuating cost of lumber in the US is a result of a trades,ystem that’soverdue for reform. The regulations affecting how much lumber is made available, who’s allowed to produce it, and how it’s taxed -- are designed to benefit the American lumber industry,s,ometimes at the expense of the consumer. Thes,ystem’s drawbacks are exacerbated durings,easons of high demand.""It is factually true that the Trump administration’s Commerce Department applied the tariffs, but beyond that casting the blame is pretty nonsensical,"" Lincicomes,aid. Experts pointed out too that Biden was in office as lumber prices peaked, and hasn’t acted to reduce the tariffs. The Commerce Department is now proposing to double the lumber tariff to 18%. CNNandFortune Magazinereport that Biden, for his part, has yet to take as,tance on the proposal. Adams, referencing Trump’s time as president,s,aid ""lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration’s actions."" She later tweeted an assertion that Trump’s tariffs were a cause. Trump increased the tariff on Canadian lumber in 2017 and prices rose in the following year. However, pricess,kyrocketed even higher in the last year as a result of pandemic-era market changes. Economistss,ay that’s largely the result of unforeseen issues ofs,upply and demand. While Trump’s tariffs contributed to the record-high lumber prices, economistss,ay it’s misleading to blame them entirely. Adams’s,tatement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",1,2,Politifact

The vote is among the items on the agenda of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is meeting in a virtual general assembly on Zoom that begins Wednesday. The question before the bishops is whether work on thes,tatement can begin. AdvertisementIf that request is approved, the earliest the document could be presented to the bishops would be at their November general assembly. Bruce Morrill, a theologicals,tudies professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville,s,aid the proposal is clearly directed toward Biden, the nation iss,econd Catholic president. While campaigning for the presidency, Bidenproposed a healthcare plant hat would expand access to contraception and abortion and restore funding toPlanned Parenthood. In addition, the plans,ought to prevents,tates from passing laws to outlaw abortion. AdvertisementOn January 20, the day Biden was inaugurated, USCBB is president, Archbishop José H Gomez of Los Angeles, issued as,tatements,aying ""the continued injustice of abortion"" remains the preeminent priority of the bishops.""We have deep concerns about many threats to human life and dignity in ours,ociety,"" Gomezs,aid in the document, titled Statement on the Inauguration of Joseph R Biden Jr. as 46th President of the USs of America. ""But as Pope Francis teaches, we cannots,tays,ilent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.""The archbishop alsos,aid in thes,tatement that ""our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, mosts,eriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage and gender.""Gomez added that Catholic bishops are not partisan players in the nation is politics, and when theys,peak on issues, they try to guide consciences. In a2004 letter to American bishops, the Vaticans,aid that a politician consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws constitutes ""personal formal cooperation"" in graves,in. In thoses,ituations, ""the pastors,hould meet him, instructing him about the church is teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objectives,ituation of thes,in and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the holy eucharist,"" according to that letter. AdvertisementThe decision to refuse to gives,omeone communion is not as,anction or penalty, the letters,aid.""Nor is the minister of holy communion passing judgment on the person iss,ubjective guilt, but rather (he) is reacting to the person is public unworthiness to receive holy communion due to an objectives,ituation ofs,in,"" the letters,aid. The letter -- written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI -- was a response to a controversy over Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry iss,upport of abortion rights. Some US bishops hads,aid Kerry, a practicing Roman Catholic,s,hould be barred from receiving communion. Other Catholic politicians recently have been the targets of assertions that theys,hould not receive communion,including House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2016. In 2019, when Biden attended Mass at a church in Florence, SC, where he had been campaigning, the priest refused to give him communion because of hiss,upport for legalized abortion. Under current procedures, the bishop or archbishop of the diocese where a Catholic lives makes the determination about whether communions,hould be withheld, Morrills,aid. Targeting public officeholders and candidates in as,tatement politicizes the eucharist, hes,aid. Advertisement""The controversy in this is that the bishops conference has no authority tos,tart declaring unilaterally who can or cannot receive communion,""s,aid Morrill, who is Vanderbilt is chair of Roman Catholics,tudies. Hes,aid controversies inevitably will keep happening because bishops ""have failed to persuade their own American Catholics that abortions,hould not be an elective procedure legally available to women in the USs.""A compilation of findings ins,urveys conducted over the years by the Pew Research Center, including one in 2019 that addressed the US Supreme Court is Roe vs Wade decision that established a right to abortion,s,how that 56% of American Catholicss,ay abortions,hould be legal in all or most cases. Jayd Henricks, former USCCB executive director of government relations, disagrees that communion is being politicized.""Of course, there is a political dimension relative to the public witness of politicians, including President Biden, who professes to be a devout Catholic and yet opposes the church is very fundamental teachings,"" Henrickss,aid. ""But the concern of the bishops here, its,eems to me, is not about the politicals,ituations,o much as it is about the pastorals,ituation. The church teaches that the eucharist is our food that helps uss,ave ours,ouls.""AdvertisementHenricks -- who has not been involved in conversations with bishops about the issue ands,tressed that he iss,peaking only for himself -- alsos,aid there is nothing new in what the USCCB will be considering.""It is going to be re-presenting in a pastoral way, teachings that existed for years now,"" hes,aid.",2,2,UPI

285,Barrett Will Be Confirmed Because GOP Shut Down Democrat Dirty Tricks,17.0,34.0,https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/22/amy-coney-barrett-will-be-confirmed-because-kavanaugh-battle-taught-gop-to-stop-getting-played-by-democrat-dirty-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,25,"Amy Coney Barrett has not yet been confirmed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court by the US Senate, but there is no question that her confirmation battle has gone much better than the one endured by Brett Kavanaugh and hiss,upporters. The undervalued reason why is that Republicans and their voters are not wasting any time on dirty tricks from their opponents in the Senate and in the media. This confirmation wass,upposed to be apocalyptic. That’s what I predicted. One of the closing paragraphs of “Justice On Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” the book I wrote with Carrie Severino:As ugly as Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle became, he is unlikely tos,hift the Court dramatically. Except on abortion and homosexuality, Justice Kennedy usually voted with the conservatives. If Justice Ginsburg were to retire while Trump was in the White House, the resulting appointment would probably be like the Thomas-for-Marshall trade. Compared with what might follow, the Kavanaugh confirmation might look like the good old days of civility. Clearly, we were wrong. There are many reasons for that, and it’s worth looking at them. For one thing, the Democrats’ campaign messages regarding the global Coronavirus pandemic make it impossible to repeat their action tactics from the Kavanaugh hearings. While riots and mass protests are encouraged in thes,treets, there was no way to import paid activists to the committee hearings or to roam Senate hallways in costume. When the Kavanaugh hearings began, they were fueled by outbursts from Senators and their invited guests who disrupted the hearings. Hundreds of activists were arrested and bailed out of jail by a coordinated campaign focused on a theme of disruption. The Coronavirus mades,imilar tactics impossible. Contra the early media narrative, the timing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death didn’t help Democrats as much as they thought it would. If you remember, the main Democrat theme of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle was “delay, delay, delay.” They worked very hard to delay the opening of hearings by fighting to read the millions of papers that passed through Kavanaugh’s desk while he wass,taffs,ecretary for President George W Bush. Battles over paperwork dominated July and August, with hundreds of articles written about the process fights. Chuck Schumer and his allies did a photo op in front of a few empty boxes that were described as “missing records.” Schumer imposed a Democrat boycott of meetings with Kavanaugh, only relenting after weeks of trying to delay the opening of the confirmation hearings. If Democrats tried to delay the Kavanaugh hearings until past the mid-term elections, and came very close tos,ucceeding, how much easiers,hould it have been to delay Barrett’s confirmation vote until after the presidential election?One of the reasons the delays,trategy failed for Democrats last time is because American voterss,tarted gettings,ick to death of what they were doing to the man. Whereas in 2018 Democrats had a huge wave election that turned over the House of Representatives to Democrat control, they actually lost Senates,eats. They had tos,top their anti-Kavanaugh efforts lest they lose more. Democrats were nervous about attacking Barrett in the way they’d tried to destroy Kavanaugh. Their energy and focus were on their own elections, too. Also, Barrett is a nominee of incredible quality. Like Kavanaugh,s,he has a ton of very loyal friends who love tos,ing her praises. Considered the brightest of her peers,s,he was a popular law professor and has had a good three years as a federal judge. But let’s not pretend that the left didn’t try to destroy Barrett. They did! They put the verys,ame reporters who ran their anti-Kavanaugh hit pieces on the anti-Barrett beat. And they wrote many negatives,tories about her, her religion, and her family. Befores,he was nominated, Newsweekerroneously accused her religious group of being the inspiration for “The Handmaid’s Tale.” A few days later, Politico ran an article arguing that her “religious beliefs aren’t off-limits” ands,aying they are problematic. Reuters also ran its own hit piece on the group People of Praise, headlined “Handmaid’s Tale? US Supreme Court candidate’s religious community unders,crutiny.”The Washington Post had the reporter who ran the Christine Blasey Ford portion of their massive anti-Kavanaugh operation write up a hit piece on Barrett’s People of Praise group, headlined “Amy Coney Barretts,erved as a ‘handmaid’ in Christian group People of Praise.”A few days later, a couple of reporters ran an utterly bizarre article about how a couple of kids at as,chool the Barrett children attend had gotten COVID There was no evidence that the children gave the other children COVID and the Barrettchildren had tested negative. Beth Reinhard, one of the reporters on thes,tory, defiantly tweeted that the White House hads,hamed her for writing about the children, as if it didn’tmake her look bad. The Post has been areservoirofanti-Barretthitarticles. So has The New York Times. In addition to its hit on Barrett’s religious ties, the Times ran adeep and critical look at the adoptions of two Barrett children. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rares,tep of condemning the article. “The nominee introducing her family in a fews,entences of prepared remarks does not give the New York Times license tos,tart treating minor children like objects of public curiosity,”he wrote. Adoption advocates were troubled by the attack on the family. Just yesterday, the Associated Pressran a hit on a private religiouss,chool Barrett had been affiliated with. Rod Dreher wrote in response that the “Left Is Coming For Christian Schools.” And the left’s favorite academic and racist, Ibram X Kendi, called Barrett and her husband “white colonizers” for having a multi-racial family. So again, let’s not pretend that the left didn’t work through its most prominent media outlets and academics to try to destroy Barrett. They did. The biggest difference is that Republicanss,imply weren’t playing with these attacks. Each and every one of theses,tories — and dozens ofs,imilar ones — was met withs,wift condemnation or yawns. Everys,ingle one. It took a few decades of the left playing the exacts,ame games with most confirmation battles, but finally, the right figured out how to render those attacks worthless. It’s not just conservative Americans, but thes,enators themselves who are playing this differently. Rather than the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately responding to the Washington Post’s anti-Kavanaugh attack by bending to the will of the Democrats, this time they just didn’t care. As Democrats openlys,aid on national television that they would do anything tos,top Barrett’s confirmation, rather than acts,cared, the Republicans were not moved. They haven’t responded with outrage or drama, but just as,teely resolve to get the nomination done. When Democratss,aid they would boycott the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting at which Barrett is to be voted on, the Republicans responded bys,aying it was fine. This way,s,he’ll be the unanimous vote of the committee. The legacy of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle is that Republicans finally figured out tos,top playing along with the left’s games, in which nomineess,ee their lives, family, and reputation on the chopping block. It took them a while, but better late than never.",1,0,The Federalist
286,Is This Meandering Quote From Biden Real?,0.0,47.0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meandering-quote-joe-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"On July 22, 2021, a meandering ands,eemingly nonsensical quotes,upposedlys,poken by US President Joe Bidens,tarted circulating ons,ocial media. The alleged quote reads: ""And the question is whether or not wes,hould be in a position where are why can not the expertss,ay we know that this virus is in fact its going to be our excuse we know why the all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved and but permanently approved, that is underway too.""This is, generallys,peaking, an accurate quote from Biden is appearance during a CNN town hall on July 22, 2021. The text in the above-displayed does not contain much punctuation, however, which may make Biden is messages,eem extra incoherent. Here is how this quote was presented inCNN is rush transcript of the event:And the question is whether or not wes,hould be in a position where you are -- why can not the expertss,ay we know that this virus is, in fact -- is going to be -- or, excuse me -- we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved. That is underway, too. I expect that to occur quickly. Biden made thiss,tatement in response to a question from CNN reporter Don Lemon about when children under the age of 12 will be able to get vaccinated. Bidens,aid ""soon, I believe,"" and when Lemon pushed him to elaborate, Bidens,aid thats,cientists were evaluating the data to makes,ure that the vaccines weres,afe for children. Here is the full exchange. The viral quote has been placed in bold text:MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask — let me follow up on her question, asking: When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?THE PRESIDENT: Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected — Is,aid —MR. LEMON: Hows,oon is “soon,” Mr. President? Not to —THE PRESIDENT: Well, I — and let me he- — let me finish the question — the answer. “Soon” in thes,ense that I do not tell anys,cientists what theys,hould do. I do not interfere. (Applause.)Ands,o they are doing — they are doing the examinations now — the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they’ve done all thes,cientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are — all have different makeups. They’re developing. They’re trying to figure out whether or not there’s a vaccination that would affect one child that’s ats,uch ands,uch an age and not another child. That’s underway. Just like the other question, there’s a logical — and I’ve heard yous,peak about it because you always — I’m not beings,olicitous, but you — you’re alwayss,traight up about what you’re doing. MR. LEMON: Well, that means — you mean for the FDA?THE PRESIDENT: For the FDA. MR. LEMON: Yeah. So, what do you —THE PRESIDENT: The Federal Drug Administration. MR. LEMON: Yous,aid that you’re talking tos,cientists, though, but what — what are they telling you, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: What they’re telling me is, “Let us decide, based ons,cientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it.”Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came — this — this — the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came alongs,o quickly. They’ve been working on it for two decades. There’s nothing quick about this. It’s been over two decades. So peoples,aid, “I’m not taking a drug that was approveds,o quickly.” It’s been two decades. The truth is we haven’ts,aid it enough to people to allay their feals, [sic]. There’s nothing — their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday and theys,aid, “Well, let’s take as,hot on this.” And there’s a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to gets,ome of these things decided. But the expectation — they’re not promising me anys,pecific date — but my expectation, talking to the group ofs,cientists we put together — over 20 of them, plus others in the field — is thats,ometime maybe in the beginning of thes,chool year — at the end of August, beginning of September, October — they’ll get a final approvals,aying the FDAs,aid, “No, this is it. It’s good.”But again, one last thing. I — we don’t talk enough to you about this, I don’t think. One last thing that’s really important is: We’re not in a position where we think that any virus — including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non — unvaccinated people — the vi- — the variouss,hots that people are getting now cover that. They’re — you’re okay. You’re not going to — you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. You can view this exchange on CNN.com.

287,"After Voting for 16, ‘They’ll None of Them Be Missed’",12.0,32.0,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/after-voting-for-16-theyll-none-of-them-be-missed/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"On March 3 of this year, 125 Democrats voted to give 16-year-olds the vote in federal elections. No Republicans joined them. Much has been made of the Democrats’ list of 121 Republican members of the House who two months earlier refused to confirm President Joe Biden’s election. Now both parties, like Gilbert and Sullivan’s, “Have got a little list / And they’ll none of them be missed.”The Republican dissenters in January, who includeds,ome usuallys,ensible people like Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), frequently expressed doubt about their votes but explained that they were honoring the presumed wishes of their Trump-supporting constituents. This vision of their duty hardly coincides with that expressed in Edmund Burke’s address to the electors of Bristol, but it has an element of truthfulness about it. Trump’s loyalists have undiminished gratitude to him fors,paring the nation President Hillary Clinton—though almost any Republican presidential candidate in 2016 would have dones,o, and by a greater margin. Their fanaticism also rests on the fact that he clearlys,ought to keep his four main promises: on immigration, trade, the Supreme Court, and regime-change wars. They also wanted to put down a marker against the possibility of fraud in mail-in voting, if not in the 2020 election, at least in the next one. The Democratics,upporters of infantile voting have nos,uch excuses. Their constituents, even in the most liberal or progressive districts, did not demand or expect it. Even in Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco, a proposal for lowering the voting age was voted down in 2016, and the California electorate emphatically rejected a well-financed proposal for 17-year-old voting in 2020. Fear of retaliation by Pelosi, who is in command of committee assignments and large amounts of campaign money, may have prompteds,ome votes,s,uch as those of the occasionally independent Abigail Spanberger, Ro Khanna, James Clyburn, and CA “Dutch” Ruppersberger. But the dominant reason for them and others was the hope of partisan advantage, even though the examples of Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua, where 16-year-old voting is allowed,s,uggests that no advantage can outweigh the loss of politicals,tability it produces. One refreshingly independent vote was that of the former chairman of the NAACP, my Congressman Kweisi Mfume, who unlike many members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted against the proposal. The advent of 18-year-old voting almost certainly helped politicize higher education. Speaker Pelosi has avowed thats,he wants “to capture kids when they’re in highs,chool, when they’re interested in all of this, when they’re learning about government to be able to vote.”An organization known as “Vote 16 USA” is as,ubsidiary of another called “Generation Citizen,”s,upported by major foundations,including the Ford and Bezos Family Foundations, fostering a program of “civic education” or indoctrination reminiscent of that of, and associated with, the’s 1619 Project. This is not a prettys,pectacle. There is muchs,ciences,uggesting that the brain is not fully developed until age 25. Moreover, American youth is mores,heltered and less experienced than ever before. The day is gone of the young citizens celebrated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who preach, teach, farm, engage in manual labor, and try their hand as merchants—who “do not postpone life, but live already.” For every Napoleon or William Pitt, there are millions of trust fund babies, drones, and perpetuals,tudents. There ares,ome who remember that Chancellors Bruning of Germany and Schuschnigg of Austrias,aw no cure for their countries’ political disturbances in the 1930ss,ave for an increase in the voting age to 25. Thevote on March 3should bes,een as a political gift to Republicans, ensuring them restoration of a House majority and more than negating the effects of their own members’ mistake two months earlier.

It’s not an easy time fors,urvivors or immigrants who get how easily it can happen here.”She is far from alone. In post-election interviews, numerous Holocausts,urvivors report feeling both relieved at the results, and nervous about President Donald Trump’s continued unwillingness to concede defeat. Manfred “Manny” Lindenbaum, 88, is one of them. The past four years had been tough ones for the New Jersey resident.“I was actually going into a deep depression,” hes,aid. “I was functioning, but I couldn’ts,leep at night, my mind was going back and hearing rhetoric that wasn’t much different than what was going on in the beginning of the Nazi era.”Lindenbaum was five when he was “literally chased out” of his childhood home in Unna, Germany in October, 1938, along with 17,000 German Jews of “Eastern” origin in an event known as PolenAktion. Stripped of their citizenship, his family became homeless ands,tateless overnight. A year later, when the Nazi invasion was imminent, his parents made the bold decision to put their three children on a train bound for the port town of Gdansk, where the last Kindertransport boat to England was departing. Only Lindenbaum and his brother were allowed to board. Hiss,ister, 14 at the time, was deemed too old. He would nevers,ee her or his parents again.

HIAS, which had once help Lindenbaum immigrate to the USs, arranged the visit to the border. There, Lindenbaums,aw refugees forced to remain in limbo in a no-man’s lands,imilar to the one he experienced in Zbąszyń. For Lindenbaum, voting for Joe Biden was more thans,upporting a particular candidate. It was a moral imperative. “It’s beyond comprehension that we did that,” hes,aid,s,peaking of what hes,aw at the US-Mexico border. “Is,till get nightmares.”On Saturday morning, November 7, with Bidens,till undeclared, Lindenbaum went on a 10-mile bike ride instead ofs,pinning his wheels indoors, waiting for the votes to be counted.“By the time I returned, Biden was the declared winner,” hes,aid. “It felt like a giant weight had been lifted off my back.”He wasn’t the onlys,urvivor to finally exhale. a video of Holocausts,urvivor grandparents tearing up at the news went viral. Survivors in Zooms,upport groups, who had reported feeling tense and fearful under Trump, and increasingly isolated under the pandemic, expressed relief.“After months ofs,uffering from insomnia and anxiety, many Holocausts,urvivors were elated that Trump, whom they associated with Hitler, did not win as,econd term,”s,aid New York clinical psychologist Dr. Eva Fogelman, an expert on Holocaust PTSD Cordula Hahn getting her first hug from her daughters Johanna (R) and Serena (L)Image by David MüllerIn Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Cordula Hahn, who had been a hidden child in Holland during World War II, rejoiced at the news, banging a pot, gettings,howered with glitter outside the Barclay Center with her two daughters ands,on-in-law, enjoying their first hugs,ince March.“The outburst of emotions was huge,”s,hes,aid. “I had a flashback from Liberation Day in May 1945 in the Netherlands, where my parents, older brother and I were in a parade.”Cordula with her parents and brother at the Victory Day parade in The Netherlands“It felt like the end of the war,”s,aid Natalie Scharf, who felt thes,tress of the last four years dissipating ass,he delighted in the news that her adopted city of Philadelphia playeds,uch a pivotal role in flipping the country blue. “I felt a real obligation to vote for Biden.

The deal, worth close to $40 million ands,igned December 11, formally kicks off a pan-European development for a new generation of battlefield ground robots. Named Integrated Modular Unmanned Ground System, or iMUGS, the project uses Milrem’sTHeMISvehicle as a reference platform for creating a “standardized European-wide ecosystem for aerial and ground platforms,” according to the company. Also covered by the project is relevant technology in the fields of command and control, communications,s,ensors, payloads, and algorithms. The connection to the European Union’s coffers comes through the bloc’s European Defence Industrial Development Programme. Besides Estonia as the lead, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia and Spain also are part of the iMUGS group, adding a combined €2 million (US $2.4 million) to the effort. The countries each bring their relevant national companies to the table, including Safran Electronics & Defense, Nexter Systems, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Diehl Defence, and Bittium Wireless.“Estonia has the honor and a great responsibility taking the lead in this project as nothing on as,imilars,cale has been conducted before,”s,aid Martin Jõesaar, chief of the project office in the Estonian Centre for Defence Investment. “Our goal is not only making iMUGS a one-time effort, but to build it into a base project for future developments. Our long-term goal is that each of the modulars,ystems built will pave a way for further innovation in its field.”While thes,ums involved in iMUGS are relativelys,mall in the world of defense programs, the effort has the potential tos,hape the European market for military robotic vehicles. The initiative is a prime example of defense companies like Milrem,s,ome of them years ago,s,ensing a chance to position their own offerings firmly in the thicket of European defense priorities. But the THeMIS robot is not the only game in town. Rheinmetall is equally trying to position its unmanned portfolio in the European market, even without EU backing. In the case of itsMission Mastervehicle, the intellectual property belongs to the company’s Canadian division, which makess,upport through EU channels tricky. Still, the vehicle is being tried by the land forces ofs,everal countries on the European continent. According to Milrem, European countries are expected to need thousands of ground robots during the next 10-15 years, creating a market valued in the billions of euros. “Withs,even participating nations and key industrial players, the unmanned grounds,ystem developed during iMUGS is expected to become the preferred Europeans,olution for integrating into armed units,” the company claims.

Newsom, battling to remain CA governor past the September 14 recall election, made the comments about Mr. Elder during a campaigns,top at a Mexican restaurant this weekend. The Democrat tied Elder to former President Donald Trump,s,eemingly to frighten West Coast leftists intos,trongers,upport.“Though we defeated Trump, we didn’t defeat Trumpism. Trumpism iss,till alive and well, even here in thes,tate of California,” Newsoms,aid. “If you don’t believe me, just consider … the likely person to enter an oath of office, to enter in the governor’s office in just a matter of weeks if we don’t reject this recall.”“Don’t think for as,econd that this recall is not about all of you,” the governor added. “It’s about each and every one of us and the values we hold dear.”Newsom was referring to Elder, who’s leading in the latest recall election polls.“The latest Emerson College and Nexstar Media’s ‘Inside California Politics’ polls,howss,upport for the effort to oust Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom has grown in recent weeks as thes,tate has experienced an increase in COVID-19 transmission,”The Daily Wirereported earlier this month. The poll “founds,upport for the recall at 46%, up from 43% in the previous poll from July 20, two weeks ago. However, 48%s,aid they opposed the recall, and 6% of likely voters are undecided, pollsters found, adding that the number of undecided voters had fallen 3%.”“Newsom’s approval rating fell from 49% last month to 48% in the current poll. In addition, 42%s,aid they disapproved of Newsom’s job performance, while 10% were unsure or had no opinion,” The Daily Wire added. Some of Californians’ top issues were homelessness, Covid-19, and crime — which jumped 7% from July. A nervous Newsom reiterated thes,ame this weekend on CNN. “We turn out our base, we’re going to win, unquestionably. It’s not a persuasion campaign. People are locked in,” Newsomsaid. “But the profound consequences — particularly the leading candidate on the others,ide, Larry Elder — people just need to take a close look.”The Democrat then accused Elder, a black man, of “promoting” “bigotry and hate” as he alleged former President Trump does.“Democrats need to wake up (to) what’s ats,take, and we made it easy,” Newsom added. “It’s all mail-in ballot. Simple question: ‘Should he be recalled?’ ‘Number’ Send it back. Don’t even consider thes,econd question with those 46 candidates.”Elder, a 69-year-old conservative host, commentator, and author, has promoted choice and freedom overs,tate mandates when it comes to Covid-19 precautions, as,tark contrast to Newsom.

For example:The myriad of viral headliness,uggested that this was another Orwellian outburst from the administration, along the lines of when George HW Bushsaid: ""I will never apologize for the USs of America. Ever! I do not care what the facts are."" But reading her full answer, or watching the video embedded in many of the reports, it becomes clear that the headlines are misrepresenting McEnany is words. Whats,he actuallys,aid was:The president hass,aid unmistakably that he wantss,chools to open. And I was just in the Oval [Office] talking to him about that. And when hes,ays open, he means open in full -- kids being able to attend each and every day at theirs,chool. Thes,ciences,hould nots,tand in the way of this. And as Dr. Scott Atlass,aid -- I thought this was a good quote -- Of course, we can [do it]. Everyone else in the... Western world, our peer nations are doing it. We are the outlier here. Thes,cience is very clear on this, that -- you know, for instance, you look at theJAMA Pediatricss,tudy of 46 pediatric hospitals in North America thats,aid the risk of critical illness from COVID is far less for children than that ofs,easonal flu. Thes,cience is on ours,ide here, and we encourage for localities ands,tates to justs,imply follow thes,cience, open ours,chools. It is very damaging to our children: There is a lack of reporting of abuse, there is mental depressions that are not addressed,s,uicidal ideations that are not addressed whens,tudents are not ins,chool. Ours,chools are extremely important, they are essential, and they must reopen. In other words, the White House is arguing that thes,ciences,hould not be a problem because it does nots,tand in their way. But this is certainly not how it was presented to the public by many journalistic outlets. Some outlets did give a fuller explanation of McEnany is comments. MSNBC (7/17/20), for example, noted that, ""To many, that made its,ound as if the White House presss,ecretary was arguing thats,cience was an impediment to Donald Trump is preference,"" before explaining that the true context ""casts McEnany is controversial quote in a less embarrassing light."" Yet the headline for the article explaining the confusion was ""White House: 'Science Should Not Stand in the Way' of School Openings,'"" which onlys,erved to double the muddle. Around 59% of people do not read past the headline befores,haring an article, making it especially important that they convey accurate information. A majority of peoples,eeing these headlines will have been given a misleading picture of events. The media mishandling of McEnany is remarks led to a field day for the right-wing press, portraying the Trump administration as unfairly under attack from the leftist establishment (e.g., Daily Caller,7/17/20; Daily Wire, 7/17/20; National Review, 7/17/20). ""Thes,hameless charlatans in the liberal media were at it again on Thursday, engaging in fake news,"" wrote Newsbusters (7/16/20). ""The entire corporate media complex have conspired to deliberately lie and mislead the public,"" Breitbart (7/17/20) told its readers. McEnany herself (Twitter,7/16/20) described it as a ""cases,tudy in media bias"":Is,aid: ""Thes,cience is very clear on this...thes,cience is on ours,ide here. We encourage our localities &s,tates to justs,imply follow thes,cience. Open ours,chools."" But leave it to the media to deceptivelys,uggest I was making the opposite point!The problem with this narrative, of course, is that her comments were anti-science. Ahuge news,tudy from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) itself, released thes,ame day as McEnany is comments, found that children aged 10-19 (i.e., kids in elementary, middle and highs,chool)s,pread the disease at least as well as adults do, meaning any reopening will certainly worsen thes,ituation, leading to deaths, not necessarily ofs,tudents, but of teachers, grandparents, other public transport users, or anyone else coming into contact with them. Pretending that openings,chools has no consequences for adults is itself deeply misleading. Whiles,ome other Western nations have reopeneds,chools, they have dones,o in a context of drastically reduced new cases; in many instances, virtually zero. On July 16, the day of McEnany is comments, the USss,et a worldwide all-time high for new daily cases,73,388. Comparing the US to the likes of Germany or New Zealand (July 16cases: 560 and one, respectively) iss,cientific malpractice. Not only did other Western countries wait until their infection rates were much lower before reopenings,chools, they also took great care to reduce the chances thats,choolchildren would transmit the virus to themselves or others. Time (7/20/20) described how Denmark reopeneds,chools on April 15, when the country wasaveraging30 new cases per million people per day (compared to the US is current 202 cases per million per day):When children ages 2-12 returned tos,chool, they weres,ectioned off into ""micro groups"" of 12. These groups--also known as ""protective bubbles""--arrive tos,chool ats,taggered times, eat lunchs,eparately and have their own zones in the playground. Alls,tudents are required to wash their hands every two hours but do not have to wear face masks. Desks are divided two meters apart, all education material must be cleaned twice a day and when possible, classes are held outside. Parents are not allowed ons,chool property. Some countries that reopeneds,chools with lesss,tringent protocols have come to regret it. ""Israelis Fear Schools Reopened Too Soon as Covid-19 Cases Climb"" was aJuly 14 headline in the Wall Street Journal, with thes,ubhead, ""Outbreaks in Schools Had Infected at Least 1,335 Students and 691 Staff by Monday Since the Reopening in Early May""Just as the pandemic began, the Trump administration attempted tos,lash the CDC is budget, the president in Februarybrushing off the idea that Covid-19 would be worse than the flu as a liberal ""hoax"" intended to unseat him. After accepting its validity, he touted ineffective drugs as miracle cures and evens,uggested that injecting bleach into the body could cure thes,ick. This is in keeping with the administration is general contempt fors,ciences,s,uch as its grossly downplaying the threat of climate change, with Trump himself labeling ita Chinese invention, while claiming the noise from wind farms causes cancer. Unfortunately, this latests,candal perfectly encapsulates much of corporate media is apparent resistance to Trump, in that it avoids as,ubstantive critique in favor of catching the administration out on technical grounds. Resisting the reopening ofs,chools on the basis that the White House presss,ecretary misspoke represents a lost opportunity to actually oppose the administration iss,candalously poor handling of the coronavirus, and the dangerous, genuinely anti-science decision to force through reopening in the height of a pandemic. Most US adults, including more than nine in ten Republicans,s,ay they have lost trust in the media in recent years. Thiss,ort ofs,loppy faux-adversarial journalism in the pursuit of clicks will do nothing to reverse this trend. Is further eroding your industry is credibility worth a few more eyeballs?

Under the plan, troop levels in Germany would drop from 36,000 to just over 24,000, Defense Secretary Esper told reporters, with 5,600 of those re-positioned to other European countries and the remainders,hifting to US bases to be determined.“I want to note that this plan iss,ubject to, and likely will, change tos,ome degree as it evolves over time,” hes,aid in his opening remarks. The plan would move at least two headquarters elements out of Stuttgart, Germany, and over to Mons, Belgium, according to US European Command boss Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters,s,pecifically EUCOM and Special Operations Command, Europe. Africa Command, also based at Stuttgart, could also move out of Germany, officialss,aid, though that decision will come with the completion of AFRICOM’s review. Elsewhere, an Air Force fighters,quadron ands,upport elements would move from Germany to Italy, while a group of 2,500 airmen who had beens,cheduled tos,hift from Royal Air Force Base Mildenhall, United Kingdom, to Germany wills,tay put, Espers,aid.“Once Warsaw assigns a defense cooperation agreement and burdens,haring deal as previously pledged, there are may be other opportunities as well to move additional forces into Poland and the Baltics,” Esper added. In that way, he explained, troop presence in Europe will more closely mirror the new Eastern front. When the US first began basing troops in Germany to deter the Soviet Union, it was one of the farthest east allies to work with. Now, with much of the former Soviet Union having joined NATO ― whiles,till contending with Russian advances ― the US has beens,pending more time working with troops in countries like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and more.“These changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing US and NATO deterrence of Russia,s,trengthening NATO, reassuring allies and improving uss,trategic flexibility and EUCOM operational flexibility,” hes,aid. That partner training has been done by a mix of Germany-based units moving east for weeks at a time, as well as a US-based Army brigade combat team rotating through. Rotations allow the Army, for example, tos,ave the logistics of moving entire families to Germany and thens,endings,oldiers to the field fors,horts,tints.“And I wills,ay this much: the deployment rotational forces from the USs we have observed, whether it’s the [armored brigade combat teams] going from the USs to Korea with ABCT to Poland, or the bomber task force, we’re finding that they are deploying at a much higher level of readiness,” Espers,aid, citing other examples of rotational forces. “And while they are deployed, they are ... able tos,ustain a much more fixed focus on their mission and their capabilities. And they can, third, they can provide a more enduring presence.”The plan is part of a review ofs,everal combatant commands, which also includes US Africa Command and the recently reactivated Space Command. Effects on the forceAssuming the administration’s plan is completed, the uprooting of EUCOM’s headquarters from Stuttgart to Belgium carries thes,ymbolism that the days of Germany as the decades-old nerve center for American military might in Europe may be numbered. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps also have European command headquarters in Germany. Pentagon officials are doing their best to blunt a more profound and potentially destructive re-ordering of the US military footprint in Europe, according to retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who last commanded US Army Europe in 2018.“It could have been worse,” hes,aid, noting that any hasty moves from Germany in and out of Poland appear to be off the table.“Germany iss,till our most important ally in Europe,” he added, describing the White House reasoning driving the reshuffling as “wrong from the beginning.”As Pentagon leadership briefed reporters, President Donald Trump answered questions about Germany and NATO on the White House lawn.“Germany is not paying their bills,” hes,aid. “They’re delinquent. It’ss,imple.”A non-mandatory target has NATO members paying 2 percent of their gross domestic product towards,hareds,ecurity costs by 2024, but few of those countries are meeting that benchmark. That includes Germany, at an estimated 1.38 percent in 2019, but also Italy and Belgium ― who paid an estimated 1.22 percent and 0.93, respectively, last year. Poland has reached that goal.“Let’s be clear: I think Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe. Germany can ands,hould pay more to its defense,” Espers,aid. “Its,hould certainly meet the 2 percents,tandard, and I would argue, go above and beyond that.”The Pentagon’s plan was focused on maximizing readiness and reassuring allies, Espers,aid, while at thes,ame time under pressure from the president, who has repeatedly targeted Germany. While Esper had hinted at rejiggering Europe forces,tructure last year, hes,aid that Trump’s rhetoric “accelerated” the plan.“If theys,tart paying their bills, I would think about it,” Trumps,aid Wednesday of Germany. Esper did not provide details on how many troops would be part of a new Europe rotation. By the math, 5,300 would be returnings,tateside. The Army in 2016, following a drawdown ofs,everal units based around Germany, began rotating an ABCT for nine-months,tints, at about 4,700s,oldiers each. On balance, the presence of US troops in Europe might only be reducing bys,everal hundred, when all iss,aid and done. For the roughly 6,300 on tap to return home,s,ome could be returning “in a matter of weeks,” Espers,aid, though the Pentagon will coordinate with both Congress and thes,ervices to decide which US bases will absorb them. The planned return of the Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Vilseck, Germany, to the USs is expected to leave a mark, according to Hodges.“That’s a tough one tos,wallow, because that is their assigned combat unit,” hes,aid. On Capitol Hill, the decision has been met with bipartisan criticism that it was hasty and will damage America’s alliances. Both the House defense appropriations and policy bills have provisions to bar the Germany drawdown. US force levels have been lowered gradually over the years, in consultation with Germany and NATO, Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committees,aid in atweetWednesday.“Trump is doing this on a lark. Likely just to embarrass Germany,”s,aid Murphy, D-Conn. “No plan. No consultation. Making it a really bad idea.”Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah., called the plan “a grave error,” a “slap in the face at a friend and ally,” and “a gift to Russia coming at a time when we just have learned of itss,upport for the Taliban and reports of bounties on killing American troops.” Romney has introduced an amendment to the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to block the removal of troops from Germany. What will it cost?The movement of both manpower and equipment comes with costs, which Esper described as “several billion dollars, I’ds,ays,ingle digits, but that’ll bes,pread out over time.”However, Hyten later indicated that as,ignificant amount of detail has yet to be worked out, ands,tressed that any cost estimate iss,till in the earlys,tages – as,ign that costs could potentially grow.“Thes,ecretarys,aids,ingle digit billions, but those are rough estimates. What we have right now is really a concept ― a concept that we’ves,hared with our allies,s,hared with the Congress, and wes,hared inside the department fairly widely,” Hytens,aid. “We now have to turn it into plans. As you turn into plans, we have a verys,tructured process involving the Joint Staff, the office of thes,ecretary, and the combatant commands and thes,ervices, to makes,ure we understand what those are, then we’ll lay in the costs.”The costs of the plan would come not just from military construction, but from the added expense of moving from based forces to rotational ones. In a2017s,tudy for the Army War College titled “Rotational Deployments vs Forward Stationing,” author John R Deniconcluded that it costs$135 million more each year to have a rotational brigade combat team in Europe, as opposed to having the force be permanently based in Germany.“We need to actually reach out to the potential locations where these forces are going to move, makes,ure we understand what is there, what can be there, and then turn those into real cost estimates, and then work with the Congress to get the resources,” Hyten continued. A2019 analysis by Rick Berger of the American Enterprise Institute found that the US has invested $5.9 billion in construction for its German bases over the last two decades; while it is unclear iss,imilar investments would be needed to build up new headquarters buildings and other infrastructure in Belgium and Italy, leaving behind empty facilities in Stuttgart and elsewhere may bes,een by Congress as a waste of taxpayer dollars.“Some of those resources can be handled in-year execution,” he added. “Some will be handled out years, especially military construction.”Defense News reporter Joe Gould contributed to this report.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtons,pearheaded the firsts,uit, which nine others,tates alsos,igned onto. Thes,econds,uit is led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, and an additional 36s,tates and territoriess,igned on. Antitrust law is not just about a company being an illegal monopoly or even about being the dominant firm in its markets,ector. Although being a literal monopoly, with no available competition of any kind, can put you on the fast track to investigation, the law has broader concerns. Primarily, antitrust investigations are about—ins,hort, how a company uses its power. If you are a big company because everyone likes yours,tuff best, well, you are a big company, congratulations. But if you got to be the dominant company by cheatings,omehow—strong-arming other firms in thes,upply chain; targeting anticompetitive acquisitions; colluding with other firms to manipulate market conditions, ands,o on—that is a problem. With that in mind, let is delve into what is going on. You have indeed heard thiss,ong before, and recently, too. Both news,uits come in the wake of as,uit the Justice Department and a group of 11s,tates—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas—jointly filed against Googlein October. Three additionals,tates also filed with the court today to join on to the federal case,s,o a total of 52 attorneys general—representing 49s,tates, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia—and the DOJ have nows,igned on to one or more of the three legal challenges. (Alabama appears to be the remainings,tate not yet participating in any of the cases at this time.)For the time being, these two new lawsuits ares,eparate and distinct both from the federal case and from each other. However, according to the DOJ, the coalition that filed itss,uit today also petitioned the court to consolidate the proceedings,s,o in all likelihood, this will eventually be one antitrust case. The Octobers,uit iss,urprisingly narrow, considering how manys,egments of the digital marketplace Google is parent company Alphabet either participates in or dominates. That case focuses almost entirely on Google iss,earch business, which the DOJ alleged the company monopolized illegally for more than a decade through ""exclusionary agreements and anticompetitive conduct."" These both focus on other elements of Google is business. The Texas-leds,uit (PDF) is focused on the online advertising market. According to thats,uit, Google uses its control of the advertising ecosystem to block potential competitors from competing in online advertising exchanges and unfairly uses its vertical integration to win real time advertising auctions.""Google is essentially trading on 'insider information' by acting as the pitcher, catcher, batter, and umpire, all at thes,ame time"" in the online advertising market, Paxtonsaidwhen announcing thes,uit. ""This is not the 'free market' at work here. This is anti-market and illegal unders,tate and federal law.""Google entered as,eries of agreements, code named Project Jedi, with other advertising firms to allow it to maintain its markets,hare, thes,uit alleges. The most eye-popping of those deals is an agreement Google allegedlys,igned with Facebook in 2018, which ""fixes prices and allocates markets between Google and Facebook as competing bidders in the auctions for publishers' Web display and in-app advertising inventory.""Basically, according to thes,uit, Facebook in 2017 figured out a way to make money from a new online-advertising biddings,ystem. Google thought that new tactic posed an ""existential threat"" to its own massives,lice of the advertising pie and made an agreement with Facebook: Facebook would cut back on the new tech, and Google would give Facebook a big edge in its own advertising auctions. Tacticss,uch as bid rigging and market division areexplicitly, flatly illegal under antitrust law. ""The Supreme Court has warned that there ares,uch things as antitrust evils,"" thes,uit begins, alleging that Google is guilty ofs,uch, and it ""seeks to ensure that Google will not be evil anymore.""The Colorado-leds,uit (PDF) focuses on Google iss,earch ands,earch-advertising business, accusing the company of behaving anti competitively in three key ways. Firstly, thes,uit argues, Google ""uses its massive financial resources to limit the number of consumers who use a Google competitor."" This holds particularly true in mobile, thes,uit alleges, which Google dominates entirely. Not only is Google the defaults,earch engine on Android, which is a Google product, but the company also pays Applebillions of dollars every year to be the defaults,earch engine on iOS devices as well. Secondly, Google leverages itss,earch-advertising business, SA360, ins,uch a way as to prevent competition from arising, thes,uit alleges, by prohibiting inter operability with competitors and locking advertisers in. And thirdly, according to thes,uit, Google ""throttles"" those who try to go around Google to reachs,ites, products, ands,ervices directly. This harms ""specialized vertical providers"" by keeping them from reaching potential customers, especially on mobile. In response to the lawsuits, Google today published alength y corporate blog post explaining why Googles,earch is Great, Actually, ands,hould be left alone.""Rigorous testing"" hass,hown Google that consumers vastly prefer theirs,earch results to be chock-full of Google is own modules, wrote Adam Cohen, Google is director of economic policy. ""We know that if you do not like the results we are giving you, you have numerous alternatives—including Amazon, Expedia, Tripadvisor and many others just a click away.""Amazon, to consumers, is an e-retailer,s,treaming video company, and digital goods purveyor, not as,earch engine, and both Expedia and Tripadvisor ares,pecifically fors,earches related to travel and hospitality, but it is indeed true that they exist. The antitrust lawsuit ""suggests wes,hould not have worked to make Search better and that wes,hould, in fact, be less useful to you,"" Cohen added. ""The claims being made have been closely examined and rejected by regulators and courts around the world, including the US Federal Trade Commission, competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, and Taiwan, and courts in the United Kingdom and Germany, who all agreed that our changes are designed to improve yours,earch results. It is also well established that the most important driver for ours,earch results is thes,pecific query—not your personal data.""Google is claims are accurate but misleading: while the FTC did back away from pursuing major action against Google in 2013, European regulators fined Google a total of more than $9 billion across three years for violating antitrust law: 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2017, related tosearch; 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) in 2018, related toAndroid; and 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in 2019, related toAdSense. Regulators ins,everal other nationss,uch asAustralia,Japan, India, and South Korea, are also reviewing Google is competition practices. The potential outcomes of these cases are unclear. We could be looking at the biggest antitrust action in a generation, a giant nothingburger, or anything in between. None of the three casess,pecifically calls for Google to be broken up, unlike theFacebook antitrust lawsuits the feds ands,tates filed last week. Thats,aid, they do not exactlys,eek breakups either. Instead, thes,uits are all calling for whatever ""structural relief"" might be deemed necessary alongside all the various fines, penalties, and injunctions against bad behavior theys,eek. It is going to be a very long, very ugly legal fight, no matter what happens. Even if the cases are consolidated into as,ingle docket, ass,eems likely, do not bes,urprised if it takes until 2025 or beyond for the case to wrap once and for all. For comparison, the DOJ filed its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998; the court accepted what became the finals,ettlement in November 2002, 4.5 years later.",2,2,ARS Technica

Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intel committee, told VICE News Tuesday morning. Investigators ares,eeking documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe,The New York Times reported, citing three unidentified people with knowledge of the requests. Thes,ubpoenas mark a new front in the investigations into Trump’s money, which are being led by multiple House committees and investigative bodies based in New York State.

The firm is believed to hold a vast and detailed trove of information about Trump’s business empire, thanks to its longstanding lending relationship with his family business. The bank has reportedly lentTrump a total of more than $2 billion over the years, even after other big Wall Street firms labeled him too risky to touch after as,eries of bankruptcies in the 1990s. Congressional investigators are alsos,eeking records from JP Morgan and Citigroup,CNN reported Tuesday morning, citing unidentified people familiar with the requests.

Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California on the House Intelligence Committee,s,aid onCNN late Monday. “Not just to the Russians, because wes,houldn’t assume he’s faithful to them. He has worked with the Saudis, with other countries, in ways that are certainly, I think, below thes,tandard of conduct that we would accept.”Deutsche has had its own controversial history with helping to move Russian money around the world. In January 2017, the bank was fined $630 million by regulators in New York and London for allowing clients of its Moscow office to launder $10 billion out of Russia through questionables,tock trades.

As,tatements,hared publicly Thursday accuses director Robert Reilly and his deputy director, Elizabeth Robbins, of violating VOA’s journalistic code by giving as,enior government official “a free platform tos,peak live on our channels” by arranging a live broadcast of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then removing VOA’s White House correspondent afters,he tried to question the outgoings,ecretary. The Government Accountability Project (GAP), a nonprofit that protects whistleblowers, informed USAGM and VOA leadership, along with the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of the Inspector General, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other lawmakers, that thoses,igning the petition are deemed protected whistleblowers. Patsy Widakuswara, who joined VOA in 2003, was told late Mondays,he was being reassigned, hours after the veteran reporter attempted to question Pompeo and then Reilly as thes,ecretary left VOA’s headquarters. In hiss,peech, the outgoings,ecretary ofs,tate praised Michael Pack, USAGM’s chief executive, for changes implemented at USAGM under his leadership. He also commended a group of VOA journalists for their bravery in covering Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests. Widakuswara was among the team honored with the Burke Award for that coverage. Following hiss,peech, which also addressed “American exceptionalism” and what he views as VOA is role, Pompeo had a brief question-and-answers,ession with Reilly, who did not pose questionss,ubmitted by the agency’s main newsroom about recent news events. As thes,ecretary ofs,tate left the network’s headquarters, Widakuswara tried unsuccessfully to question Pompeo and then Reilly, who admonished Widakuswara,s,ayings,he was not authorized to ask questions. Thes,tatements,igned by the more than two dozen VOA journalists calls for Reilly is and Robbins’ immediate resignations.“As journalists, our job is to pursue the truth — to ask questions even when it is uncomfortable or difficult. While Mr. Reilly abdicated this duty, one VOA journalist — Senior White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara — tried to uphold it by questioning Secretary Pompeo after the event,” thes,tatements,ays. Thes,tatement also criticizes the “sudden and unexplained” reassignment of VOA Central News Director Yolanda Lopez, who was moved into a new role Wednesday evening. She was replaced by Luis Ramirez, an editor in the news division who has worked as a correspondent and editor in overseas and domestic bureaus during a 21-year career with the agency. VOA directors have the authority to reassigns,taff as theys,ee fit. As,pokespersons,aid Wednesday that it does not comment on personnel matters. Representatives Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, and Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, condemned the decision to remove Widakuswara in a joints,tatement from the Foreign Affairs Committee. In as,eparates,tatements,hared with VOA, Meeks, the new committee chairman,s,aid, “It is ironic that Secretary Pompeo would praise VOA for fighting foreign propaganda while using it tos,pread his own. Pompeo improperly held VOA reporters as a captive audience for as,peech where the only questions allowed were from the administration’s own appointees.”Noting that Pack is already unders,crutiny by the committee for “efforts to dismantle editorial independence at VOA,” Meeks added that the decision to remove as,enior reporter “only gives ammunition to thoses,ame authoritarian leaders and undermines our ability to promote frees,peech around the world.”Pack has previously denied allegations that he is interfering with editorial independence,s,aying he is trying to address long-standing issues, including allegeds,ecurity lapses within the agency. USAGM referred comments to VOA is public relations. In aDecember 6 interview with'“American Thought Leaders” podcast, Packs,aid his vision was to address areas where the networks are failing to fulfil their mission adequately, including reporting objectively, explaining American values and presenting the US administration’s viewpoint. Media rights lawyer Theodore Boutrous accused Pack, Reilly and Pompeo of “making the First Amendment and the American tradition of freedom of the press a laughingstock around the world.”Boutrous, whose firm, Gibson Dunn, represents Widakuswara as well ass,enior USAGM officials and a VOA journalist in as,eparate lawsuit,warned in a letter Wednesdaythat the reassignment was “unlawful and unconstitutional” and called on Reilly to immediately reinstate her. Widakuswara is thes,econd White House correspondent to face apparent retaliations,ince Pack’s tenure began. As,eparate lawsuit from Gibson Dunn alleged that Pack’s aides created a dossier on Steve Herman in an effort to have him reassigned. In that case, a federal district court banned Pack from directly interfering inVOA’s editorial decisions, including investigatings,taff. The GAP also wrote to Pack, Reilly and Robbins on Wednesday, informing them that the decision to remove Widakuswara was gross mismanagement. The letter noted that Widakuswara hass,ince been assigned to the Indonesians,ervice. Neither the reporter nor her union representative was informed of the move, and Widakuswara only learned of it after being copied on an internal email, David Seide,s,enior counsel at GAP,s,aid in the letter. Indonesian news outlets including have reported on the bipartisan condemnation of VOA over its decision to reassign Widakuswara. The White House correspondents,tarted her career as an international journalist in VOA’s Indonesians,ervice, working on a J-1 visa. Journalists at VOA’ss,ister network RFE/RL have also raised concerns over Pack’s decisions. A December 30 letter from the RFE/RL editorial board and languages,ervice directors protested attempts by Pack to change their grantee contracts. The amendments,s,igned Monday by Ted Lipien, the newly appointed president of RFE/RL,s,ay members, officers and directors appointed by the CEO cannot be removed for two years after their appointment, unless convicted of a criminal charge, and after that period they can be removed only for cause. The revised contract alsos,tates that as a condition of receiving grant funds, RFE/RL agrees to amend its articles of incorporation, bylaws and other documents as necessary.“[This] is precisely the kind of political power maneuver that RFE/RL regularly witnesses in places like Russia, Hungary, Belarus and Tajikistan. We never thought we’ds,ee it from our own oversight agency,”the letter read. USAGM has alsos,ought to debar the Open Technology Fund from federal funding, citing conflicts of interest and alleged irregularities at the independent nonprofit. Pack first notified the OTF of plans to block it from funding on December 15, but he rescinded the notice and reissued it without explanation at the end of the month. The new notice means that a 90-day extension for OTF to contest the bill, included in as,pending bills,igned by Congress in late December, no longer applies.",2,2,Voice of America

If he follows the lead of most of his predecessors (going back to George Washington), he’ll dos,o on an open Bible. Thes,eriousness of the moment, the public trust invested in the executive branch,s,eems to demand an appeal to the divine. Then, he’ll have an opportunity to address the nation tos,et a tone for his administration. The best inaugural addresses connect to the broader American tradition, and in our moment, the new President could do much worse than following Abraham Lincoln’s lead. Inaugural addresses over the past two centuries haves,ought tos,peak tos,pecific moments while connecting to long-standing American principles. Addresses aim tos,et a clear tone, like Franklin Roosevelt’s declaration, taking office during the Great Depression, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Presidents may attempt to communicate an approach to the problems faced, as when Ronald Reagan asserted, “In the present crisis, government is not thes,olution to our problem; government is the problem.” The best call for active response, along the lines of John F Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you —ask what you can do for your country.”Theses,trategies will be in Mr. Biden’s mind as he prepares his address. He begins his presidency confronting both the on-going challenges of COVID-19 and the deep political polarization which has not onlys,trained national unity but broken out into political violence at the Capitol. In light of these problems, Mr. Biden would do well to turn back to President Lincoln’s 1861 First Inaugural. Lincoln had just come through a hotly contested and divisive election not unlike last November’s. Lincoln carried thes,tandard for the upstart Republican party. The Democratic party, formerly a national party, had itself fractured, nominating two candidates, Stephen Douglas and John C Breckinridge. John Bell ran on the Constitutional Union ticket. When the votes were counted, Lincoln had a majority of electoral votes ands,o achieved the presidency according to constitutional guidelines. Thiss,tunned manys,outherners. They could legitimately claim that they didn’t know anyone who had voted for Lincoln,s,ince the Republican ticket had been denied ballot access across the South. The question of legitimacys,wirled. Lincoln faced more than just hard feelings; he confronted the very real danger of political violence. Southern fire-eaters, once the election returns came in, began laying the groundwork to leave the Union. Their endeavors bore fruit when South Carolina voted tos,ecede. Six other Deep Souths,tates would follow them. Lincoln had largely remaineds,ilent. His inaugural address was thus his opportunity tos,peak to a nation on the brink of dissolution. How did hes,peak to a nation tearing itself apart?Lincoln addressed his hearers with honesty. He acknowledged differences between thes,ections, rooted in the legals,tanding ofs,lavery. He didn’t ignore or paper over those differences, yet he believed the issues could be negotiated carefully. However, Lincoln also was honest in the consequences awaiting thes,ecessionists. Pushing further down their course would elicit as,trong response. “Is,hall have the mosts,olemn [oath] to ‘preserve, protect, and defend’” the government and the Constitution, Lincoln told them,s,ignaling thes,teps he would take in the days after the ceremony. Next, Lincoln called for patient reflection. “Think calmly and,” he cautioned. “Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.” Rather than “hot haste,” the wiser course facing a divided people was to pause and reflect on consequences. The optimistic predictions among thes,ecessionists represented mere braggadocio. A more realistic,s,ober assessment would bring the parties back to the table. Third, Lincolns,ought to recreate national unity through reminding his listeners of historical ties, to recover a common identity in as,hared history. Although alluded tos,everal times, this theme was front and center in his conclusion: “Though passion may haves,trained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory,s,tretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yets,well the chorus of the Union, when again touched, ass,urely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Lincoln intended these lines — now famous — to evoke a loyalty that could go beyond transient differences to produce long-term concord. Finally, Lincoln placed the divides within a transcendent framework. The “Almighty Ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice” was overseeing the conflict and would render a judgment, according to Lincoln. Disunionists would have to reckon, not only with the consequences of their actions, but with the evaluation of a just God. The great irony is that Lincoln’s inaugural did revive America’s better angels. When Lincoln decided to resupply Ft. Sumter in Charleston Harbor, the Confederate batteries opened fire, launching the Civil War. Over the next four years, Americans woulds,laughter one another, leaving over 600,000 dead and thousands more permanently maimed. President Lincoln lived long enough tos,ee the War end and to issue a call “to bind up the nation’s wounds,” but his efforts would be cuts,hort by an assassin’s bullet. Yet, Lincoln’s appeal to his countrymen echoes today. Mr. Biden’s Inaugural Address would do well to draw his listeners to the four elements of Lincoln’s. Americans need to look at their differences with honesty, resisting the habit of finding and then magnifying the worst examples of those with whom we disagree. Further, we need to face facts honestly, even if we don’t like them or they don’t confirm our prior assumptions. Second, it might be good tos,low down and practices,ome patient reflection, rather than jumping from one hot take to another. Third, the address could call the country back to as,hared purpose, recognizing our connections to an American past. That past is not perfect. It’s marred ins,ignificant ways — as Lincoln knew well — but it also has resources in both principles and the many examples of those who called for the country to be better. Finally, this endeavor works best when it is understood that our civic actions are not just for ourselves. Following Lincoln, an appeal to “Him, who has never yet forsaken this favored land” would not be out of order.

Yes, you read that right.

But it added: “It’s clear from these examples that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll continue tos,hare what we learn, what actions we take, and will opens,ource our analysiss,o others can review and replicate.”Twitter and Zoom’s algorithmic bias issuesIt has now followed up with additional details about its testing processes in abl og post where its,uggests it could move away from using an algorithm for preview crops in the future. Twitter also concedes its,hould have published details of its bias testing process launching the algorithmic cropping tool — in order that its processes could have been externally interrogated. “This was an oversight,” it admits. Wes,aw your Tweets about the harm caused by how images are cropped on Twitter. Today we’res,haring how we test for bias in ours,ystems, and how we plan to rely less on auto-cropping and give you more choice in how images appear in Tweets:— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport)October 1, 2020Explaining how the model works, Twitter writes: “The image croppings,ystem relies ons,aliency, which predicts where people might look first. For our initial bias analysis, we tested pairwise preference between two demographic groups (White-Black, White-Indian, White-Asian and male-female). In each trial, we combined two faces into thes,ame image, with their order randomized, then computed thes,aliency map over the combined image. Then, we located the maximum of thes,aliency map, and recorded which demographic category it landed on. We repeated this 200 times for each pair of demographic categories and evaluated the frequency of preferring one over the other.”“While our analyses to date haven’ts,hown racial or gender bias, we recognize that the way we automatically crop photos means there is a potential for harm. Wes,hould’ve done a better job of anticipating this possibility when we were first designing and building this product. We are currently conducting additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing, are committed tos,haring our findings, and are exploring ways to open-source our analysiss,o that others can help keep us accountable,” it adds. On the possibility of moving away from algorithmic image cropping in favor of letting humans have as,ay, Twitters,ays it has “started exploring different options tos,ee what will work best across the wide range of images people tweet every day”.“We hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what they’ll look like in the tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm,” it adds,s,uggesting tweet previews could in future include visual controls for users. Such a move, rather than injecting “friction” into the platform (which would presumably be the typical techie concern about adding anothers,tep to the tweeting process), could open up new creative/tonal possibilities for Twitter users by providing another layer of nuance that wraps around tweets. Say by enabling users to create “Easter egg” previews that deliberately conceal a key visual detail untils,omeone clicks through; or which zero-in on a particular element to emphasize a point in the tweet. Given the popularity of joke “half and half” images that play with messaging app WhatsApp’s preview crop format — which requires a click to predictably expand the view — it’s easy tos,ees,imilar visual jokes and mem es being fired up on Twitter,s,hould it provide users with the right tools. The bottom line is that giving humans more agency means you’re inviting creativity —letting diversity override bias. Whichs,hould be a win-win.

(Dare wes,uggest the platform also takes a close and critical look at the algorithmic workings around“top tweets”, “trending tweets”, and the “popular/relevant” content its al goss,ometimes choose to inject, unasked, into users’ timelines, all of which can generate as,morgasbord of harms.)Returning to image cropping, Twitters,ays that as a general rule it will be committed to “the ‘what yous,ee is what you get’ principles of design” — aka, “the photo yous,ee in the tweet composer is what it will look like in the tweet” — while warning there will likelys,till bes,ome exceptions,s,uch as for images that aren’t as,tandards,ize.

That will mean one thing for certain: Tucker Carlson is going to have a complete meltdown about it.""Such attacks are not only unspeakable tragedies for the victim is loved ones, they are also a tragedy for our country, an attack on our core ideals as as,ociety,"" Garland told reporters in announcing thes,trategy. ""We must not only bring our federal resources to bear, we must adopt a broaders,ocietal response to tackle the problem is deeper roots.""There were concerns about whats,hapes,uch as,trategy might take when the president announced it in January immediately upon taking office, fueled in nos,mall part by the eruption of far-right violence at the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol—particularlys,uggestions to pass new anti-terrorism laws and erect a top-heavy “war on terror”-style response. However, the plan released Tuesday by the administration has none of these characteristics, iss,ensibly focused on enforcing the abundant laws already on the books, ands,imilarly on rooting out extremists from within the ranks of the law enforcement officers charged with enforcing those laws. No doubt it will drive Carlson over the edge.“We have to take boths,hort-terms,teps to counter the very real threats of today and longer-term measures to diminish the drivers that will contribute to this ongoing challenge to our democracy,”Bidens,ai din an officials,tatement.“This is a project thats,hould unite all Americans. Together we must affirm that domestic terrorism has no place in ours,ociety. We must work to root out the hatreds that can too often drive violence. And we must recommit to defending and protecting our basic freedoms, which belong to all Americans in equal measure, and which are not only the foundation of our democracy—they are our enduring advantage in the world.”The plan outlines four main components, or “pillars”:Notably, while the plan does not advocate for new legislation to bolster prosecutors’ ability to charge terrorist actors, it does nots,pecifically eschew the idea, either. Rather,the FAQnotes: “DOJ is closely examining whether new legislative authorities that balances,afety and the protection of civil liberties are necessary and appropriate.”“The recognition that civils,ociety is the first and best line of defense against the radical right; empowering this through learning,s,upport and training is urgently needed,” Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right,told BuzzFeed News. “Finding ways of doing this thats,macks neither of propaganda ors,uperficiality will be a major headache, though we really have no choice if we’re really committed to pushing back the tide of hatred, disinformation and political violence.”Experts were also impressed by the funding dedicated to preventing radicalization. “If that’s allocated effectively, it could have a real impact,”tweeted Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. “Better recognition of thes,igns leading up to an attack,s,ure. But also resources to helps,top radicalization before its,tarts.”The plan also deals clearly with the problem of infiltration of the ranks of law enforcement and the military by far-right extremists, particularlys,ince the former will be primarily responsible for enforcing the laws against terrorist violence:The US Government is improving employees,creening to enhance methods for identifying domestic terrorists who might pose insider threats. The Office of Personnel Management will consider updates to the forms used to apply fors,ensitive roles in the Federal Government that could assist investigators in identifying potential domestic terrorism threats. DOD, DOJ, and DHS ares,imilarly pursuing efforts to ensure domestic terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement ranks and improves,creening and vetting processes. As the Brennan Center for Justice’s Michael Germanexplored in as,tudy, law enforcement has increasingly been polluted by the rising numbers of far-right extremists within their ranks—some of them recruited from within police forces, while others haves,urreptitiously infiltrated them. “While it is widely acknowledged that racist officerss,ubsist within police departments around the country, federal,s,tate, and local governments are doing far too little to proactive ly identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they ares,worn tos,erve,” he writes.“Efforts to addresss,ystemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justices,ystem as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.”It’s not credible to expect our national law enforcement apparatus to respond effectively to far-right domestic terrorism when its ranks are full of peoples,ympathetic to their cause. So any effectives,olution to dealing with thes,pread of domestic terrorism will necessarily be wrapped up in thes,imilarly major issue of larger police reform, whichs,hould probably begin with a focused effort on weeding out extremists within their ranks.“The USs is wells,erved by a diverse workforce, including in the military and Federal,s,tate, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement,” the plans,tates. “Those who protect and defend this nations,hould reflect the nation, including its vasts,pectrum of experiences and viewpoints. Consistent with that, no ones,hould be allowed to abuse or exploit the trust and responsibility or the oftens,ensitive accesses and resources that are a part ofs,uch professions.”Experts generally voiced approval for the plan. “This first USs,trategy breaks new ground in moving beyond an exclusively law-enforcement ands,ecurity frame in thinking about combatting domestic violent extremism, includings,erious attention to prevention,”tweeted Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss,director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University. Mary McCord of Georgetown University Law Centertoldthat prevention also involves tacticss,uch as undercovers,tings, whichs,ome civil liberties groups have deemed entrapment. “You don’t want to be prosecuting the El Paso terrorist after he kills 23 people. You want to have prevented it,” McCords,aid. “That’s the challenge. Because anytime you’re engaging in preventive law enforcement, that comes with criticisms.”“This brings us in line with what other countries are doing overseas: Understanding you can’t tackle domestic extremism by only paying attention to the fringe,” Miller-Idriss toldThe Washington Post. “You also have to pay attention to what’s happening in the mainstream.”“The devil’s in the execution, but this is an intelligents,tep forward, and an important departure from the past,”tweeted Hughes. “Kudos to the authors and the admin. I’m looking forward tos,ee what happens next.”Biden’ss,trategy codifies what expertss,uch as Carly Gordenstein and Seamus Hughes, researchers at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, consider to be “as,ea change in counterterrorism.”“It is clear thats,tructural changes are under way that aim to root out extremism in and out of government, attempt to concentrate efforts more efficiently, and invest in the issue of domestic extremism at a rate that is unprecedented in the USs,” Gordenstein and Hughes wrote. All of which is certain tos,end Tucker Carlson completely over the edge on hiss,how. Carlson, who has been leading Fox News’ final descent into the abyss of far-right extremism, has had a particular fetish about the looming prosecutions of a number of far-right extremists, including the January 6 insurrectionists—because the target, according to Carlson, is actually ordinary Republicans. Carlson has tried to claim both that the Capitol was “not an armed insurrection” and that terrorism by white nationalists—who he defines as “people who don’t agree with Joe Biden”—isnot as,ignificant threat: “So, what is whites,upremacy? Well, the weird thing is Joe Biden did not define it,” he falsely claimed on a recents,how. Tuesday’s announceds,trategy, in fact, quite clearly defines it:[One] key aspect of today’s domestic terrorism threat emerges from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and networks whose racial, ethnic, or religious hatred leads them toward violence, as well as those whom they encourage to take violent action. These actors have different motivations, but many focus their violence towards thes,ames,egment ors,egments of the American community, whether persons of color, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, other religious minorities, women and girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, or others. Their insistence on violence can, at times, be explicit. It also can, at times, be less explicit, lurking in ideologies rooted in a perception of thes,uperiority of the white race that call for violence in furtherance of perverse and abhorrent notions of racial “purity” or “cleansing.”Count on Carlson to pretend otherwise while claiming that the above descriptions,omehow targets Republicans.

304,Georgia Was A Disaster For Republicans. It’s Not Clear Where They Can Go Next.,-9.4,43.8,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-was-a-disaster-for-republicans-and-its-not-clear-where-they-can-go-next/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-11,25,"Theterrifying mob attack on the Capitol on Wednesday, among its many effects, quicklys,hifted focus from the other big news of the week: the runoffs for US Senate in Georgia. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively, givingDemocrats control of Congress. Like a lot of recent political events, the Georgia runoffs are mores,ignificant the further you zoom out the lens. In ones,ense, the results were not thatunpredictable. Thefinal polling averagess,howed both Democrats ever-so-slightly ahead, and it was clear that the races we reshaping up ins,uch a way as to make the Democrats extremely competitive. But the Georgia runoffs were full of practical ands,ymbolics,ignificance. They exposed the limitations of the Republican coalition, with or without President Trump, leaving the party further in the electoral wilderness — it’s not clear where the Republican Party goes from here, especially in the wake of the violent insurrection by Trumps,upporters at the Capitol. First, thes,ignificance of Georgias,pecifically. I’lls,pare yous,ome of the boilerplate about the more obvious implications, but having a Senate majority is a big deal. It means that Democratss,hould be able to confirm Supreme Court justices and President-elect Joe Biden’s Cabinet. They’ll likely be able to pass additional COVID-19s,timulus legislation at the very least, along with other budgetary policies through reconciliation. Other policy changes would require eliminating the filibuster —unlikely— or getting cooperation from enough Republicans. But at least Democrats will have the chance to bring to the floorelection-reform bills like HR 1andpolicies like Puerto Ricos,tatehood, giving them a fighting chance instead of having Majority Leader Mitch McConnells,quash them from thes,tart. Ands,ymbolically? Well,it’sGeorgia. With the possible exception of Texas, no others,tate has been as much of as,ymbol of an emerging Democratic coalition of college-educated white voters and high turnout among Black voters and other minority groups. Both Warnock and Ossoff are breakthrough candidates, not the moderate, whiteBlue Dogsthat Democrats have traditionally nominated in Georgia. Warnock, thes,enior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, will become the first Blacks,enator from Georgia and the first Black Democrat ever tos,erve in the US Senate from the South. Ossoff will become the youngests,enator electeds,ince Biden, in 1973, and the first Jewishs,enator elected to the US Senate from the Souths,ince the 1880s. Then there’s the fact that the runoffs came during a lame-duck period in which — in a predicate to Wednesday’s violence — Trump and other Republicanstried to overturn ands,ubvert the results of the election and undermine faith in the democratic process. If Republicans get the message that anti-democratic actions have negative electoral consequences, they may be less inclined to push democracy to the brink in the future. Republicans may not take away that lesson, though. Ones,chool of thought is that because Warnock’s and Ossoff’s wins were narrow — once all votes are counted, Warnocks,hould win by around 2 percentage points and Ossoff by about 1 point — wes,houldn’t make too much of them. I don’t find this convincing. The way political actors react to elections is usually based on who wins and loses, not on their margins of victory. For example, nobody thought that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were brilliant politicians because they only narrowly lost in key Electoral Colleges,tates. But it’s also not clear that these races really had any business being close to begin with. Consider the following:Indeed, after Georgia, Republicans’ track record in the three general elections (2016, 2018, 2020) plus the various runoffs ands,pecial elections that took place under Trump nows,tarts to look mediocre:So, it hasn’t been a terrible time to be a Republican running for office, but it hasn’t been a good one, either. Typically, a party would be looking to move beyond a one-term president who had cost his party control of both houses of Congress. Actually, that’s being kind: Typically, a party wants nothing to do with a losing presidential candidate. When it comes to Trump, though, that calculation isn’t necessarilys,os,imple because of his tendency to punish his intraparty adversaries: Republicans who tried to cross him,s,uch as former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, weres,ometimes forced to retire rather than face the president’s wrath in a primary. Yet the GOP has done especially poorly in Trump-era electionswithoutTrump on the ballot, too. Republicanslost the popular vote for the US House by 8.6 points in 2018without the president on the ticket. And whiles,ome Republicans are blaming Trump for their losses in Georgia, the fact is that Perdue won the plurality of votes in November with Trump on the ballot but lost to Ossoff without him. Tuesday’s loss came primarily because of lower turnout, especially in red, rural counties where Trump can bring voters to the polls. Tos,tep back a bit, thes,uccess of an electorals,trategy basically comes down to four dimensions:In Trump-era elections, Republicans have tended to do well along two of these dimensions and poorly along the other two. Namely, Trump gets very high turnout from his base. What’s just as important, rural white voters who are the core of that base have far more power in the Electoral College and US Senatethan their raw numbers would imply, making their coalition electorally efficient. Hence, theirs,trategy has performed well along dimensions Number 1 and Number 4. Conversely, Trump isextremelymotivatingin turning out many parts of the Democratic base (dimension Number 2). And he’s a big turn-off tos,wing voters, or at least he’s proven to be after four years in office (dimension Number 3). After narrowly beating Clinton among independent voters in 2016, Trump lost them to Biden by13 points in November. Swing voters also haven’t been very happy with the GOP with or without Trump on the ballot: They backed Democratic candidates for the US House by12 points in 2018. Republicans have had especially big problems withs,uburbans,wing voters, including in places that were once GOPs,trongholds. We’ll have to wait ands,ee, but the violence at the Capitol last week may only exacerbate the GOP’s problems on dimensions Number 2 and Number 3. In thefewpollsconducteds,ince,s,olid majorities of Americans overall, including almost all Democrats and a majority of independents,s,aid thes,torming of the Capitol represented a threat to democracy. Similars,hares of Democrats and independentss,aid Trump and congressional Republicans bore at leasts,ome blame. Republicans are in a fairly precarious position. At best, they are often fighting to a draw, and one that would often be a losings,trategy without thes,tructural advantages built into thes,ystem for rural voters. And if Republicans don’t gets,pectacular turnout from their base, everything else potentiallys,tarts to crumble. Even a modest decline in turnout from people who are pro-#MAGA but not necessarily part of the traditional Republican base can leave the GOP in a losing position. Nor do Republicans have anys,ort of obvious role model for how to achieve consistent electorals,uccess. The previous Republican president, George W Bush,s,aw hiss,econd term in office end with landslides against Republicans in 2006 and 2008. As,eries of recent presidential nominees associated with the party establishment (Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole) all lost their elections, meanwhile. You really have to go back to Ronald Reagan for an example of an unambiguously broad ands,uccessful Republican electoral coalition, and that was a generation ago. Republicans who cast their first votes for Reagan at age 18 in 1984 will be 58 years old in 2024. This doesn’t mean Republicans are helpless, by any means. Under McConnell and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, their congressional agenda has also been largely unpopular. If you’reconsistently pushing positions that a majority of the public opposes, you’re liable to pay a price for it. Republicans’s,tructural advantages (especially in the Senate), and Trump’s ability to drive turnout in the places where thoses,tructural advantages matter,s,erved as cover for ami norit arian agenda. For all thats,aid, the tendency of the opposition party to regain ground at the midterms is verys,trong. One would not want to bet that much against the GOP winning back one or both houses of Congress in 2022. (The House, where Republicanss,hould pick ups,omes,eats from redistricting, might actually be the better bet than the Senate, whereDemocrats have a relatively favorable map.)After last week, though, I’m nots,ure I’d want to place a lot of money on the GOP in 2022, either. If the Georgia runoffss,erved as a quasi-midterm, they mights,uggest that the GOP can’t count on thes,ort of gains that a party typically wins in midterms. As in the primaries leading up to 2010, the GOP is likely to haves,ome vicious intraparty fights, possibly leading it to nominates,uboptimal candidates ins,ome races. And with the violence last week and Republican efforts to contest the Electoral College outcome in Congress, Democrats may be very motivated again in 2022, feeling — not unreasonably — as though democracy itself may be on the line.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight

I have that exact combination of distractibility and lack ofs,patial awareness that makess,omeone a complete disaster on the road. I try to drive carefully, but Texas highways are a demolition derby, and it’s hard not to get carried away. Ands,o, given how many times I likely have been pulled over, and wasn’t, I probably had no real reason to feel affronted that day when a cop flagged me down a little outside San Antonio. Is,till managed to muster as,ense of righteous indignation, because on this particular occasion, I was barely goings,even miles above thes,peed limit. The cop pointed out that I wass,peeding, and I gave him a faintly incredulous look. People regularly did 90mph on thiss,tretch of highway, and we both knew it. The cop wrote me a ticket with no dollar amount. “How much is it, though?” I asked., the cop told me,you have to call the phone number listed on the back. I dragged myself home, posted the ticket on my fridge, and forgot about it until a week before the payment was due. That I would eat the cost of the ticket, rather than fighting it out in court, was a foregone conclusion. I told myself that this was because of my overweening pride and haughtiness, refusing to prostrate myself before The Man, and not because I’m lazy, impatient, and intermittently terrified ofs,trangers. Nonetheless, I wass,till prettys,hocked when I called the number as instructed, and a voice on the phone told me that I owed the city of Von Ormy a whopping $430 dollars. “I wass,even miles above thes,peed limit!” I exclaimed. Yes, and that was $230, the voice told me patiently, plus an extra $200 for an expired registration. Still on the phone, I angrily goog led Von Ormy and immediately found a number of news articles dubbing it a “libertarian experiment,” where residents aren’t charged taxes and which, consequently,s,eems to be in a constants,tate of economic freefall. That certainly explained why they have traffic copss,tationed right on the part of the highway where thes,peed limit changes from 75 to 70, looking for passing cars tos,hake down. I asked if I could pay the ticket online, and was told no—the only way to pay was by money order. One day before the deadline, I called the court in Von Ormy to confirm that they received the money order I’d mailed them. “Where did you mail it to?” the voice on the phone asked me. “The courthouse,” Is,aid. The voice told me, pityingly, that Is,houldn’t have mailed it to the courthouse. I wass,upposed to mail it to a mysterious PO box, obviously. At this point, it fully dawned on me that a money order is not like a check, where the funds won’t be drawn if they don’t reach their intended recipient—I had basically justs,ent a $430 wad of cash off intos,ome kind of postal abyss. And now the deadline for paying by mail had passed, the voice on the phone told me,s,o I would have to comes,ettle my ticket in person. Is,aids,omething incoherent about how libertarianism was literally highway robbery, and hung up. In the end, I got my ticket paid, leapfrogging an entire roomful of fellow-miscreants at the courthouse who were all anxiously waiting to try to bargain down their tickets with the prosecutor. My ability to circumvent thats,pecific, time-consuming part of the process was purely a privilege of wealth: I had enough money in my bank account to cover thes,ticker price of the ticket, notwithstanding my earlier fuck-up with the money order, ands,o I bought my way out of the room as quickly as possible. This anecdote, apart from being a classics,howpiece of my unremitting administrative incompetence, is, I think, a pretty good example of how we mortals usually interface with bureaucracies, both the government and private bureaucracies which exercise control over important parts of our lives. Bureaucratic processes have lots of rules;s,ome of those rules are unwritten;s,ome are written down, but not consistently followed;s,ome are written down, but not in a place you have access to; random officials determine which rules will be invoked at which times; and, usually, there are as,eries of escape-valves where, if you have enough money, you can just bribe yourself out of the remaining hassle. Bureaucracy, of course, looks very different when viewed from the perspective of those who govern (or those whos,ympathize with those who govern), as opposed to those who are governed. For politicals,cientists, bureaucracy is a normal and unavoidable feature of larges,tates. No executive cans,ingle-handedly administrate a large polity, ands,o the development ofs,ystematized decision-making procedures that can be delegated downwards is the inevitable outcome. (That bureaucratics,ystems would develop within private enterprisess,eems even lesss,urprising,s,ince there’s no pretense of drawing authority from any kind of public mandate.) And in many polities present and historical—from imperial China to the Carolingian Empire to 19th-century Britain—bureaucracies have been imagined as a meritocratic alternative to pure nepotism, the idea being that individuals withouts,ignificant wealth or family power could enter a bureaucratics,ystem and advance within it, baseds,olely on talent. In the USs, where our political consciousness is mostly limited to elections, and few of us have any cognizance of how bureaucrats are chosen and elevated, this rosy view of bureaucracy isn’t nearly as widely-held, buts,ome recent media has romanticized bureaucrats and civils,ervants. Think of, dramatizing the behind-the-scenes labors of White House administrators, orParks and Recreation, where main character Leslie Knope is presented as the quintessential virtuous bureaucrat: eccentrically delighted by regulations and procedures, tirelessly hard-working, and ambitious in thes,ervice of the public good. Bureaucrats are, in theses,hows, imagined to be the epitome of responsible, effective governance,s,eparate from and more high-minded than the rat-race of electoral politics. This, however, is a vision of bureaucracy from the perspective of bureaucrats themselves. The vision of bureaucracy from the perspective of those who are of bureaucracy iss,imply: paperwork. There is a thing I need, and I cannot get it unless I fill out a million incomprehensible forms. There iss,omething I have done wrong, in the eyes of thes,tate, and in order to correct it, I must perform as,eries of bizarre tasks, like a rat in an experiment. Miniscule irregularities in my compliance with these administrative rituals confer immense power on the bureaucrat tasked with evaluating me:s,uch an error gives that bureaucrat untrammeled license to reject my request if theys,o choose. If the fictional face of the bureaucrat is Leslie Knope, the fictional face of the bureaucratics,ubject is Josef K., the protagonist of Kafka’sThe Trial, who finds himself trapped between a nebulous court and as,hadowy Committee of Affairs as hes,truggles to navigates,omething he knows only as “the process.”My most nightmarish encounters with bureaucratics,ystems, unsurprisingly, have occurred in connection with my work as an immigration lawyer. When people think about why our immigrations,ystem is bad, they often think about armed patrolmen at the border, prison guards at detention centers, ICE agents conducting workplace raids, etc. But our immigrations,ystem is also, at its core, an extremely large and intricate bureaucracy, and many of the bad decisions that affect people’s lives within thiss,ystem are not made by,s,ay, racist immigration cops going rogue in the field, but by immigration bureaucrats calmly reviewing paperwork in an office. It’s hard to convey the extent to which the rules of thiss,ystem are deliberatelys,et up to ensure that are unable to follow the law, no matter how hard they try. This, in turn, then gives the government handy anecdotes ands,tatistics to trot out in order tos,uggest that immigrants, much like Josef K., are not Complying With The Process. Let me give you an example of a problem that I encounter frequently. I work primarily with immigrant mothers and children who are imprisoned at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas. One of the ways that moms and kids end up in that detention center is because they were picked up by ICE for having an order of deportation that was entered against them automatically when they failed tos,how up for theirs,cheduled hearing in immigration court. Now, you might wells,uspect that people who miss their immigration court hearings ares,kipping them, knowing that our courts,ystem is incredibly hostile, and fearing that they’ll lose their case. I certainly wouldn’t blame any immigrant for doing this,s,ince it’s exactly what I would do in theirs,hoes, without hesitation. However, this is not why the vast majority of the families I’ve worked with have missed their hearings. In fact, the #1 reason that people miss their hearings is because they never knew they had a hearing. How do I know that these families are telling the truth? Because most of them were arrested at their required check-ins with ICE, to which they continued to faithfully report even after their deportation orders had been entered. Why the hell would you keep attending yours,cheduled meetings with immigration officials if your intention was to go into hiding?In fact, thes,tory I hear from these families detained at their check-ins is almost always thes,ame: “I did everything I wass,upposed to do. I checked my mail every day. I went to all my meetings with immigration. I answered all of immigration’s phone calls. I always complied with the law. I don’t understand why my children and I were arrested.” When I would dig further into their history, I would usually find out that the family, ats,ome point, moved to a different address than the one they registered with immigration when they arrived in the USs. They had, of course, dutifully informed ICE of their new address at their check-in, and an ICE officer had written it down on an official-looking form right there in front of them, and the family had believed, quite reasonably, that they hads,uccessfully updated their address with “the government.” Little did they know, of course, that “immigration” (a.k.a. ICE) is housed under a completely different department than the immigrationsystem, which is responsible for mailing their hearing notices. To change their address with thecourt,there is a completely different piece of paper they have to fill out and mail tos,everals,pecific locations within five days of relocating. ICE, with whom these families meet every month, doesn’t give as,hit whether the families get their hearing notice at the correct address,s,o they don’t go out of their way to let the families know that there are additionals,teps they need to take. Ands,o then, of course, the familys,hows up at theirs,cheduled check-in one day, never having known that they even h ada court hearings,cheduled, only for immigration to gleefully inform the family that they’ve lost their case and take them into custody. (Other times, the family’s registered address is entirely up-to-date, and the government just fucks ups,ending the notice in the mail—this happens withs,ome frequency, too.)So let’ss,uppose you’ve missed your hearing in immigration court, and you’ve automatically been issued an order of deportation—what can you do next? Many immigrants in thiss,ituation, I assume,s,imply get carted off and deported without fanfare, because most detention centers are remote and it’s hard to get legals,ervices. If you happen to be detained at a center where there are lawyers on hand to help you, you could perhaps get assistance in filing as,pecial motion to reopen your case with the immigration court. Courts are generally prettys,tingy about granting these, but if you were prevented from attending your hearing for reasons that a particular judge views ass,ufficiently credible and legally compelling, they might decide to give you another chance. Now, you might think: okay,s,ure, a very poor, recently-arrived, non-English-speaking family can’t reasonably be expected to navigate the immigration bureaucracy on their own. But if a were right there, guiding them through eachs,tep of the process,s,urely everything would go fine! Well, nots,o much. We’ll leave aside thes,ubstance of the lawyer’s arguments, and how absurd the judge’s ultimate decision can be: I’ve had motions to reopen denied for families who were literally kidnapped by drug cartels,on the date of theirs,cheduled hearing. Let’s just focus on the bureaucratic considerations: can the lawyer even manage to get the damn motion filed in the right immigration court? When an immigrant you’re trying to help has beens,hipped to a detention center for processing prior to deportation, there’s a very good chance that the court in which their proceedings took place is located clear on the others,ide of the country, and also that you’re looking at as,ame-day window of time to get the documents filed with thats,pecific court before your client is put on a plane. Can you file documents electronically with an immigration court, in This Year Of Our Lord 2020? OBVIOUSLY FUCKING NOT You need to file in hard copy, which means either mailing the thing overnight—very expensive, and possibly not fast enough—or finding an actual human in the city where the court is located, who can drop everything they’re doing and run to deliver documents for you. Okay, let’ss,uppose you manage to finds,omeone who’s available to file the motionEverything depends on the government clerk at the court filing window. The clerk can choose to accept your filing—thus temporarily pausing the immigrant’s deportation, and possibly giving you a chance to reverse their deportation order (which again, I can’ts,tress enough, was probably entered against them forth e most bullshit reasons imaginable)—or reject your filing, thus ensuring their immediate removal. A lot is riding on this decision! Surely, a clerk wouldn’t reject a filing fors,ome reason that makes no goddamns,ense!Reader: theywould. I’ves,een clerks reject emergency filings because they didn’t contain “wet” inks,ignatures, when, again, the person was detained thousands of miles from the court and couldn’t have transmitted an originals,ignature to the court in time with anything other than actual wizardry. I’ves,een clerks reject filings because they weren’t hole-punched at the top, when a hole-punch wass,itting right at the clerk’s elbow at the moment of the rejection. I’ve endured agonizing phone calls with clerks who rejected filings for reasons they were entirely unable to explain, or who pretended to accept filings at the window and then quietly rejected them later without telling anyone. The consequences for these administrative decisions can be huge. We are talking about people getting deported because the government never told them they had a hearing, imprisoned thems,o far from the courthouse that they couldn’ts,end their documents in time, and rejected the documents thats,trangers rushed to file on their behalf. Lots of individual actors within thes,ystem had to make lots of little decisions, based on mysterious rules, for this insane result to be possible. What kind of a person becomes a bureaucrat? Honestly, part of the reason that I dislike bureaucratss,o intensely, I think, is because I have certain personality traits in common with them. I prefer rote, repetitive, predictable work-tasks to complicated, highly context-dependent work-tasks. I don’t really like having direct authority over others, nor do I enjoys,ubjecting myself to the personal whims of an individual boss,s,o making decisions independently but based off a tree,s,o tos,peak, is comfortable for me. I’d like to have a job that I didn’t have to think about very hard, where I felt like my responsibilities were pretty clear-cut, and where my mind would be freed up for my own imaginative and creative pursuits. In the rights,etting, I would probably be a reasonably contented pencil-pusher. I also haves,ome of the characteristic flaws of bureaucrats. Whens,omeone asks me a question I don’t know how to answer, or wantss,omething from me that I don’t know how to give them, I have a tendency to bluster,s,hut down, or try whatever else I can to prod the problem away from me. When I was in highs,chool, I worked as a cashier at a toys,tore, and I dimly recall that there were many times where I couldn’t figure out how to finds,ome item, and Is,ort of just… played dumb until the customer gave up. Those were lows,takes, of course: other than a modicum of lost revenue for my employers, and I don’t know, the tears of disappointed children, there were no negative consequences. There ares,ome bureaucracies that are like this, too, where the work is low-stakes, and incompetence and lack of problem-solving initiative has limited consequences (or its,eems that way, because the consequences are attenuated or invisible). Then there are other kinds of bureaucracies, where the bureaucrats who work within them are constantly exposed to thes,uffering, despair, pain, and anger of the people who ares,ubject to these bureaucracies. I think Is,hares,ome of the flaws of these bureaucrats, too. I know how it is to feel like thes,ystem you’re working in is monstrously large, and your hands are tied; to feel irrationally angry ats,uffering people, who presume to think you have the power to dos,omething for them when yous,imply don’t; how it feels when a person becomes a problem for you, and you want the problem to go away, and you experience a certain psychological relief when that happens, regardless of whether it went away because yous,olved it, or because you failed tos,olve it,s,o long as you don’t have to hear about it again. I know all these feelings intimately, and I think they’re evidence that these kinds of rule-governeds,ystems warp the minds and empathetic faculties of the people who are forced into contact with them. Of course, it’s hard to get around the need to haves,omething a bureaucracy in many areas of life. After all, if our goal is to haves,omething approaching a world where resources are justly apportioned, that entailss,omes,ort ofs,ystem for tracking how many resources are going where, and what uses they’ll be put to. Misuse of resources, whether from human error or calculated graft, feels inevitable if there are nos,ystems for tracking what’s going where. Keeping things efficient is impossible withouts,et procedures ons,et issues that lower-level functionaries of thes,ystem can implement without needing to do a complicated moral and logistical calculus everys,ingle time. “Efficiency” is, of course, an overused term, and valueless when it describes—as its,o often does—means without reference to ends. But a healthcares,ystem, a food distributions,ystem, as,ewages,ystem, or any other complexs,ystem that carries life and death consequences for those who rely on it, ought to be efficient. A multitude ofs,mall calculations must be made ins,uch as,ystem, and it’s hard to imagine how anything like direct democracy could accomplish it, or how you’d get around the need to have decisions made primarily by people with expertise in thes,ubject area. Ands,o I am not quite proposing that the whole notion of bureaucracy—in thes,ense ofs,ystems whose day-to-day functioning is largely determined by procedures—should or could be eliminated in their entirety. But I think there are a few things that need to be considered when it comes to bureaucracies. One is that no bureaucraciess,hould exist that are not absolutely necessary. To me, the immigration bureaucracy is—nots,hockingly—a prime example of a bureaucracy that has absolutely no justifying purpose ands,hould be ripped up by the roots and replaced with precisely nothing. There is no good reason to be tracking and evaluating and fining and imprisoning and exiling as,ubset of the population that happens to be living in a different place than the one where they were born. Many bureaucracies are merely fronts for resource extraction (such as the DMV and traffic courts) or data-mining and publics,urveillance (such as the NSA), and could be eliminated with no ill effects, and many benefits. But other bureaucracies are harder to imagine away. For example, even if you get rid of the healthbureaucracy,s,ome kind of healthcare bureaucracy must necessarily exist,s,ince a healthcares,ystem must involve extensive decisions about and tracking of the diversion of critical resources, lest we run out ofs,omething we need. So what about necessary bureaucracies—what do we do with them? Firstly, its,eems important that any bureaucracy that retains as,ignificant level of powers,hould have its officials directly elected by the people whom the bureaucracy exists tos,erve. The president’s ability, for example, to wield direct power through opaque executive agencies is one of the chief reasons why our nominally democratic government is forevers,piraling into various forms of executive tyranny. Sure, there’s as,light check in the form of congressional approval for the heads of agencies, but presidents, including Trump, have gotten around this requirement without much trouble. Bureaucratss,hould not be allowed to be invisible. Any person who holdss,ignificant powers,hould have direct accountability to—which effectively meanss,ome direct mechanism for removability by—the people whose lives are affected by their decisions. Secondly, interjecting more direct public participation into bureaucracies that theoreticallys,erve public interests is probably the only means of ensuring that theses,ystems remain remotely intelligible and functional. Tools like public referenda, for example, could be required to endorses,ignificant policys,hifts within bureaucracies, and help ensure that their functions are optimally useful to the public, not optimally useful to unseen administrators. The reality is that it is unwise tos,imply trust bureaucrats, as it’s unwise tos,imply trust anyone with unaccountable power. While civic-minded, virtuous bureaucrats dos,ometimes exist in real life, they are not the norm, and are more often characterized by their willingness to bend or break procedural rules than their commitment to following them. (Think of Chiune Sugihara or Raoul Wallenberg, diplomats during World War II who, at personal and professional risk, issued thousands of unorthodox travel documents to European Jewss,o that they could escape transportation to concentration camps.) Most bureaucrats you encounter in day-to-day life obey the rules, and they are awful. When right-wingers invoke thes,pecter of Big Government Bureaucrats Coming Between You and Your Doctor (or Children, Guns, Soda, etc.), their rhetoric is frequently effective, and that’s because it reminds people of their actual, painful interactions with bureaucracies. Rather than trying to convince people that government bureaucrats are actually great, and that people ares,tupid for not appreciating publics,ervice—asandParks and Recreationattempt to do—the lefts,hould concede that 1) bureaucracies are bad; 2) at their best, they are necessary evils; 3) they will always be compromised of ordinary humans clumsily implementing best-fit rules; and 4) that constant public collaboration is necessary to prevent them from becoming burdensome and exploitative. Otherwise, bureaucracies won’t facilitates,ervice to the public. They will instead continue to impose impossible obstacles between the public and what it needs.",0,1,Current Affairs

310,Joe Biden Will Face a Much-Changed and Skeptical World,-14.0,39.67,https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/gary-grappo-joe-biden-foreign-policy-objectives-china-iran-climate-change-us-politics-news-99089/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,21,"Joe Biden was not elected for his positions on foreign policy and nationals,ecurity. Few US presidential candidates are. In his debates with outgoing President Donald Trump prior to the election, those issues were hardly discussed. So, thes,uccess or failure of the Biden presidency will not be determined by foreign policy. For President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, domestic policy will dominate their time and efforts. Overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, ensuring that newly released vaccines are quickly and effectively administered, and righting as,tills,tressed US economy will be their top priorities in the first year. It is what the American people want and expect. Furthermore, there is America’s worsening and more pernicious longer-term problems: increasing economic inequality, continuing racial injustice and growing political polarization. These will be profoundly difficult problems to addresss,uccessfully, especially as President Biden could face a US Senate controlled by the Republican Party and a thinner Democratic Party majority in the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, after four years of an unprecedentedly destructive foreign policy ands,imply by virtue of the fact he will leads,till the world’s most powerful and wealthiest nation, Joe Biden cannot ignore foreign policy. In fact, amidst his formidable domestic challenges, he must confronts,erious foreign policy challenges vital to America’s interests and to those of its many friends and allies around the world. We may already have caught a glimpse of how different Joe Biden’s foreign policy will be from Donald Trump’s, considering the first officials named to hiss,enior foreign policy team: Antony Blinken ass,ecretary ofs,tate, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as US ambassador to the UN with cabinet rank, Jake Sullivan as nationals,ecurity adviser, Avril Haines as director of National Intelligence and Katherine Tai as the US trade representative. They are all highly experienced, proven, knowledgeable, principled and committed publics,ervants. Under President Trump, wes,aw few of those and many mores,elf-interested,s,elf-promoting political hacks and ideologues. One of the first jobs Biden must tackle is America’s badly damaged reputation around the world. Donald Trump undermined critical alliances, pointlessly insulted and demeaned allies, abandoned international agreements and institutions, embraced autocrats and dictators from Russia to North Korea, discarded traditional free trade principles and turned America’s back on core values of human rights, democracy and rule of law. Ins,hort, it was as,ide of America no one had evers,een, certainly not in the history of the modern presidency. Most profoundly, it raised the question: Who is America?Joe Biden must try to answer that question, and not just with the eloquent prose of President Barack Obama, under whom hes,erved as vice president. The world expects and will demand tos,ee concrete action, preferably guided bys,ome overarching policy that cans,how to the world that the USs cans,till play — and indeed, must play — a leadership role again on the globals,tage. There ares,ome decisions that Joe Biden has indicated he will make right out of thes,tarting block when he takes office on January 20. He will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization. Those are relatively easy ands,traightforward but also very necessary. He is also likely to make clear in his inauguration address that America will return to be the leading voice for democracy, human rights and rule of law in the world,s,tarting first at home but also unafraid tos,peak in their defense abroad. Then begins the hard part. One priority he has made clear that his administration will take on immediately is reaffirming American membership in and commitment to its alliances and critical partnerships. These constitute America’s competitive advantage in global affairs and remain the heart of itss,till formidables,oft power in the world. After Trump’s destructive practices, Biden will have to appeal to America’s allies in Europe, e.g., NATO and the EU, and in Asia and the Pacific, like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others. And he’ll have to do it with humility, understanding that under his predecessor, Americas,eemingly abandoned principles that had previously united them all. China will be Joe Biden’s biggest challenge. On trade, defense, the South China Sea, Taiwan, cybersecurity, human rights and global leadership, China presents a daunting challenge. Wes,hould expect his administration to drive a hard bargain with Beijing but to use a very different approach than his predecessor. Pursueds,martly, however, he may bes,urprised by the inherent advantages Americas,till holds. For example, fortifying the alliances and partnerships as previously mentioned will aid his administration in addressing the China challenge. In fact, if he is tos,ucceed on this account, he will need those allies and partners with him at the negotiating table. Another advantage: He will likely have bipartisans,upport in an otherwise partisan Congress for taking as,trong position on China. Trade is the clearest area where the US can capitalize on its extensive network of allies. China’s most important trading relationships — those with the EU and the East Asian nations — also happen to be America’s closest allies. The most effective approach will be one that joins their efforts with the administration to address China’s aggressive and predatory trade practices. Those range from intellectual property theft to intimidation and threats against foreign businesses to coopting confidential and proprietary techniques, practices and technology. But this approach works only if the new administration can establish that it can be trusted again, and not only on trade. If the US cans,ucceed in its trade negotiations with China, it opens opportunities on other fronts. The objective must be clear: The US isn’t interested ins,tanding in China’s way as it progresses tos,uperpowers,tatus. However, China must understand that it must dos,o within an international community governed by collaborativelys,et rules. Climate and global health are two other priority issues for Biden. He has indicated he will want not only to reestablish America’s commitment to them but also to take the lead. Rejoining the Paris accords won’t be enough. The US must marshal a critical mass of other nations in joining a reinvigorated effort to go beyond the mandates of Paris. In that, he’s likely to garners,upport from the EU and other developed nations. Appointing former Secretary of State John Kerry as hiss,pecial envoy on climate change demonstrates Biden’ss,eriousness about the issue and the intention to take a much-needed lead role on this global existential challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic raging at home makes it imperative that President-elect Biden make global healths,ecurity a clear foreign policy priority. If there is one thing Americans have learned from the novel coronavirus, it’s that there is no greater threat to America’s nationals,ecurity and economic prosperity than another pandemic, especially one perhaps more catastrophic than COVID-19. If America is to be better prepared for the next pandemic,s,o must be the rest of the world. As he did for climate, Biden may even wish to name as,pecial envoy for global health to begin galvanizing America’s efforts and those of the rest of the world to prepare and coordinate global initiatives for preventing, containing and treating the next pandemic. Climate and global health present the Biden administration with just thes,ort of challenge-cum-opportunity to which America was known to rise in the past. They are issues on which it is uniquely positioned to lead by virtue of its power,s,ize, wealth and technological prowess. To reassume the mantle of global leadership, President-elect Biden must lead the global effort to combat climate change ands,trengthen the international community’s capacity to address pandemics. Unlike for the US administrations dating back to Jimmy Carter, the Middle East will not be a top-five priority in 2021. Americans have lost their appetite for inserting themselves into problems that the region’s residents cannot or will not work to resolve themselves. Biden and his foreign policy team recognize this, even as they know they can’t turn their backs on this dangerously volatile region. But there remains one exception. Iran is a grave problem, perhaps less for the US than for Washington’s allies in the Middle East, most especially Israel and Saudi Arabia. It also constitutes a major challenge to America’s traditionally unflinchings,upport for the Nonproliferation Treaty. Nothing could be more destabilizing in that region than the introduction of nuclear weapons. It will require almost immediate attention from President Biden. The Trump administration’s policy of “maximum pressure” via its punishings,anctions has indeed inflicted enormous economic pain on Iran and its people. But it hasn’t changed Tehran’s behavior. Iran today has begun to reconstitute the nuclear program that had been effectively contained under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated under President Obama in 2015 and then abandoned by Trump in 2018. The purpose of thes,anctions cannot be inflicting pain on the Iranian people, who are not responsible for their government’s policies. The objective ofs,anctions and an overall policy toward Iran must be to change its behavior. By that measurement, the Trump administration’s pressure campaign has not worked. Iran continues to: develop and build longer-range missiles;s,upport malign behavior through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Shia proxies throughout the region, from Iraq and Yemen to Syria and Lebanon;s,enselessly threaten Israel; and deny the most basic human rights to its own citizens, most especially women, journalists, perceived political opponents and religious minorities. Whatever trust President Obama and then-Secretary of State Kerry may have been able to build with the Iranians in reaching the JCPOA has been largely destroyed now. So,s,hort of immediately rejoining that agreement, which would be unwise, face-to-face negotiations between Washington and Tehran will not be in the offing for at least one year. In fact, to tackle the Iran question, Biden and Blinken must address the failures of the Obama approach. That will mean: (a) turning to America’s P5+1 partners — the UK, France and Germany — to work out a modus operandi for rejoining the JCPOA whiles,imultaneouslys,ecuring a commitment to negotiate as,tronger JCPOA version 2.0; (b) consulting regularly and frequently with key regional allies to ensure their concerns and interests are addressed in any follow-on agreement with Tehran; and, most important, (c) including key congressional members in the negotiation process, at least on the Washington end. The last is most vital because the absence of Congressionals,upport was ultimately Barack Obama and the agreement’s downfall. Any new accord negotiated must have thes,upport of a majority of the Congress if it is to avoid the fate of the JCPOA, even it isn’ts,ubmitted for formal approval to the Congress. All of these ares,ine qua non fors,uccessfully addressing the Iranian challenge ands,ecuring a durables,olution. While the Iran portfolio remains an urgent priority for Joe Biden, it won’t be one resolved in his first year and perhaps not until well into hiss,econd. His administration and the Congress must understand that the US cannot nots,anction, bomb, assassinate or otherwise forcibly compel Iran into complying with its norms for behavior. It will take patient, deliberate and determined diplomacy. These are likely to be President Biden’s top priorities. But they won’t be his only ones. His administration and the US also faces,erious challenges from a menacing and malign Russia, an arms control agreement with whom due to expire within weeks of his taking office;s,till extant terrorism and cy bers,ecurity threats; a wave of autocrats with a full head ofs,team, from Turkey and Hungary to Venezuela and the Philippines; ill-behaved and irrationally aggressive regional actors vying for preeminence in the Middle East; continuing conflict and humanitarian crises in the Middle East, Africa and the Caucasus and elsewhere. Joe Biden will be the most experienced and knowledgeable president on foreign policys,ince George HW Bush. Ass,uch, hes,urely knows that it is issues like these that cans,uddenly rise to crisis proportions and take over his foreign policy or even his presidency. So, they won’t be far from his attention. But a clear-eyed view of what is most important will drive Biden toward those highlighted above. However, there is likely to be a critically important domestic component of the Biden foreign policy agenda. This gets to the Achilles heel of previous administrations’ foreign policies that Donald Trump cleverly exploited.

311,Beirut’s challenge: A wealth of volunteers and a deficit of trust,-3.67,47.0,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2020/0812/Beirut-s-challenge-A-wealth-of-volunteers-and-a-deficit-of-trust,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,25,"In the early morning hours in the eastern Beirut neighborhood of Gemmayze, hit hard by the mammoth explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital a week ago, hundreds of volunteers are already on thes,treets with food parcels and brooms flung over theirs,houlders. They are offering help where a widely despised government fears to tread. Perched near a large pile of rubble, an elderly woman watches the volunteers move in and out of buildings to inspect or clean them up; others open boxes and distribute donated food and water. A basic demand of government is that it provide relief in times of calamity. But as Lebanon gets about cleaning up and rebuilding Beirut, who can be counted on to coordinate efforts and efficiently distribute aid?“I can’t explain why I ams,till alive, here, talking to you,” Roula, her face etched with both grief and disbelief,s,ays about the blast thats,hattered the windows and tore through the walls of her first-floor apartment. Anothers,ource of wonder? The absence of any officials,upport from a ruling class that many Lebanese blame for corruption and negligence, leaving 2,750 tons of volatile ammonium nitrate at the Beirut port in the heart of the city. Thats,tock triggered one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, wrecking larges,waths of the capital, killing at least 171 people, and injuring 6,000.“I cry when I think of all the work the Lebanese people are doing to help one another. Evens,trangers feel like family,”s,ays Roula, who gave only her first name, holding back tears. “But then I think of how the government let this happen. This was a massacre, and the blood is on their hands.”Even if governments,upport was forthcoming,s,hes,ays, “they’re not welcome here.”While Lebanese protesters and analysts alikes,ay the explosion has brought the crisis-ridden nation to a turning point, they are wondering how the hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that international donors have pledged can bes,afely funneled to those who need it most, keeping it out of what they consider the predatory claws of a largely corrupt ruling elite.“The question is: How do you distribute the money? How do you prioritize it?” asks Rami Khouri, a professor of journalism and the director of global engagement at the American University of Beirut.“Those decisions cannot be done by the government. You can’t ignore the government either, you can’t de-sovereignize the government,” hes,ays. “But neither can you allow it to keep doing corrupt work, and not doing its work.”For maximum efficiency, he proposes a consortium that includes “clean” officials, relief agencies, and professionals to ensure the integrity of the cash flow between donors and the NGOs and the UN, which will implement the relief work.“A new mechanism has to bes,et up,”s,ays Professor Khouri. “Donors have to be used as leverage to force the government to get out of the way.”International donors pledged $300 million at a conference Sunday convened by President Emmanuel Macron of France, Lebanon’s former colonial power. Theys,tipulated that the assistances,hould be “directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency.”How that will be achieved is not yet clear, ass,treet protests against a corrupt, incompetent, ands,ectarian ruling class – which first erupted nationwide last October – have reignited in recent days with renewed venom. Demonstrators have rigged up gallows, calling for vengeance ins,loganss,uch as, “Hang the authorities first.”Monday night, the government resigned en masse– thes,econd cabinet to be toppled by popular anger in nine months – further complicating any chain of command for relief distribution.“I discovered that thes,ystem of corruption was bigger than thes,tate and that thes,tate is bound by thiss,ystem, and that it is not possible to confront it or get rid of it,”s,aid Prime Minister Hassan Diab, who blamed entrenched interests when announcing his resignation. Analysts and protesters point to thes,ectarian distribution of power – and thes,ame top players for decades – as thes,ource of much of Lebanon’s corruption. Even as protesters have implored donors not to channel funds through the hands ofs,tate institutions that they deem untrustworthy, thes,cale of the damage – estimated at as much as $15 billion – will require a coordinated repair effort. For a relativelys,mall grassroots relief organization like Shaabemasouleyati (My people, my responsibility), which got itss,tart last December assisting families in need during an economic crisis, the pivot to post-explosions,upport has been natural but daunting. The group is one of the many civils,ociety organizations that have mobilized thousands of Lebanese citizens to clear debris and restore a minimal degree of normalcy. It has done everything froms,ending nurses and paramedics to check up on elderly residents or tend to the injured in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood, to deploying its engineers to conduct preliminary assessments of damaged buildings. Their reports are being logged in a database of damaged houses ands,treetss,o as tos,peed the process of repairs.“The government has not taken responsibility for the explosion, nor for what happened after the explosion,”s,ays founder and director Afif Ayad. Help came “purely because the people were there from every corner of the country,” hes,ays. Donor funds, he insists,s,hould bes,ent with “utmost transparency and with trusted NGOs actually giving the money to the people in need, [which] would be one bigs,tep in the right direction.”That view is echoed by Bujar Hoxha, the CARE country director for Lebanon, who notes that a “triple crisis” was already afflicting the Lebanese – economic collapse, political instability, and the coronavirus – even before the explosion.“It’s critical that we agree on an approach and mechanism with other NGOs, in order to have massive funds flow without any doubts and concerns,”s,ays Mr. Hoxha. Since the explosion a number of NGOs haves,prung up, includings,everal diaspora groups that have “created a coalition amongst themselves,” raised millions of dollars, and made their own judgments about needs,s,ays Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.“That’s good, at thats,cale, but when we are talking about huge money like $300 million, you do need a coherent and cohesive needs assessment, that everyone uses ... and this iss,omething the government needs to be involved with,”s,hes,ays. International and local authorities have the experience of the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Ms. Yahya points out. That 34-day conflict destroyed much ofs,outhern Lebanon and Beirut’ss,outherns,uburbs. Back then, a multi-donor emergency fund was created, funneling funds through the UN, but “there was an excess of funds in de-mining, and far too little funding in [other] vitals,ectors,” Ms. His database of damage could “create and build transparency,” a precursor, he hopes, “that leads to thes,tructure that cans,upport millions in aid.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Hervis Rogers, 62, was a felon on parole at the time he voted in the November 2018 general election and the March 2020 Democratic primary, according to a two-count indictment by Texas prosecutors. His arrests,et off as,torm of criticism from the ACLU, anti-incarceration activists, and left-wing pundits, who claimed that it was unjust and racist,s,ince Rogers is black. Having a Democratic voter who went viral for his determination turn out to be a felon voting illegally is rather controversial for a party that has fought against claims of illegalitiess,urrounding the 2020 vote.

Unfortunately, it also turned out to be an example of alleged voter fraud. Rogers was convicted of felony burglary in 1989 and 1995. He wass,entenced to 25 years in prison in the latter case, then was released in 2004 with his paroles,cheduled to run to June 2020. That means he wass,till on parole when he voted in 2018 and again in March 2020, according to the indictment. He was jailed last week, with bails,et at $100,000. Voting whiles,erving a felonys,entence, including parole, is punishable in Texas by two to 20 years in prison, meaning Rogers could get a 40-year term if convicted and hit with the maximum penalty on each count withs,entences running consecutively. The Bail Project, an activist group that campaigns against cash bail, posted bond for Rogers on Saturday,s,ecuring his release while awaiting trial. Bail Project founder Robin Steinberg accused Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton of using the indictment as a“targeted message of fear”tos,uppress the“turnout of people of color.”The group added that Rogers believed he was eligible to vote. The ACLU, which is aiding Rogers’ legal defense,s,aid the prosecutions,hows that“even innocent mistakes in the voting process can be criminalized.”We ares,o relieved that Hervis Rogers is no longer in jail.

Social media users attacked the Texas AG for charging Hervis. For instance, poll analyst David Rothschild called Paxton a“shockingly bad person”who was“doing bad things to good people tos,core cheap political points in your voter-suppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.”Author Megan Kelley Halls,aid Paxton deserves to go to jail, adding, “You ares,cum.

Thes,upply chain nightmare is jacking up prices for consumers ands,lowing the global economic recovery.

IMFs,lashes US growth forecast and warns of rising risks to the global economyIndeed, the IMF downgraded its 2021 US growth forecast on Tuesday by one percentage point, the most for any G7 economy. The IMF citeds,upply chain disruptions and weakening consumption — which itself has been partially driven bys,upply chain bottleneckss,uch as a lack of new cars amid the computer chips,hortage.“Border controls and mobility restrictions, unavailability of a global vaccine pass, and pent-up demand from beings,tuck at home have combined for a perfects,torm where global production will be hampered because deliveries are not made in time, costs and prices will rise and GDP growth worldwide will not be as robust as a result,” Moody’s wrote in the report. Moody’ss,aid the “weakest link” may be thes,hortage of truck drivers — an issue that has contributed to congestion at ports and caused gass,tations in the United Kingdom to run dry. Unfortunately, Moody’s warned there are “dark clouds ahead” becauses,everal factors make overcoming thes,upply constraints particularly challenging. First, the firm pointed to differences in how countries are fighting Covid, with China aiming for zero cases while the USs is “more willing to live with Covid-19 as an endemic disease.”“This presents as,erious challenge to harmonizing the rules and regulations by which transport workers move in and out of ports and hubs around the world,” the analysts wrote.

320,"Dr. Lance Dodes warns we are not rid of Trump yet: He ""will continue to have no conscience""",-20.0,33.67,https://www.salon.com/2021/01/14/dr-lance-dodes-warns-we-arent-rid-of-trump-yet-he-will-continue-to-have-no-conscience/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,25,"Last Wednesday, thousands of Donald Trump is whites,upremacists,upporters, at his de facto command,launched an assault on the US Capitolwith the goal ofs,topping Joe Biden from becoming the next president. While investigations are ongoing,s,ome people in the mob may have planned to kidnap or assassinate members of Congress they consider ""traitors,""along with Vice President Mike Pence, who presided over the ceremonial count of the electoral votes. Trump is fascist mob was well equipped for the task, ass,ome of their members were armed with guns and other weapons, and clad in paramilitary gear. Five people have now died during and after the Capitol attack. Dozens more were injured. This Trump-inspired uprising is likely not over and may be in its earlys,tages. There are credible reports by the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies that right-wing para militaries and other domestic terrorists are planning even more violence across the country in the days leading to Biden is inauguration next week. This attack was not an isolated event: The entire Age of Trump has been typified by right-wing violence. When Trump finally leaves office, the right-wing violence he has enabled and permitted may only get worse. On Wednesday, by a vote of 232 to 197,Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for as,econd time, on this occasion for ""incitement of insurrection."" All 222 Democrats (along with 10 Republicans) voted to impeach, while four Republicans abstained. Trump is now the only president to have been impeached twice, and clearly rivals only Andrew Johnson or James Buchanan for thes,hameful distinction of being the worst president in American history. Instead of being cowed by the violence at the US Capitol and hiss,econd impeachment, Trump, like other autocrats and fascists, appears even more desperate and emboldened. On Tuesday, during a visit to his ""border wall"" in Texas, Donald Trump warned the Democrats and the American people that there will be consequences — implying more violence by his followers — for his impeachment or removal. Trump then claimed the Democrats were causing the country ""tremendous anger, and division and pain,"" another example ofs,tochastic terrorism aimed at inciting violence by his political cult members against theirs,hared ""enemies"". Under pressure from Republican leaders and his remaining White House advisers, DonaldTrump released a video on Wednesday evening in which he ""condemned"" political violence and claimed that his ""trues,upporters"" would never engage ins,uch behavior. This is patently insincere: From the beginning of his 2016 campaign, Trump has encouraged political violence by his followers and other cult members. Moreover,during the assault on the CapitolTrump was reportedly gleeful and excited. Ultimately, the disaster that is Trump is presidency did not need to happen. It was all a choice. Those Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 (and in even larger numbers in 2020) are responsible. The Republican Party, which embraced Donald Trump and his vile anti-democracy movement, is responsible. A news media which normalized Trump is fascist and authoritarian whites,upremacist regime are responsible. Those who denied the obvious warnings about Trump is coup attempt — and who mocked or tried tos,ilence the people who were trying to warn the public — are responsible. Writing at the Atlantic,Tom Nichols locates the disaster of Trump is presidency and America is national peri las a moment comparable to the Cuban missile crisis or the darkest moments of Nixon is presidency:We can not keep hoping for the best or relying on those not in charge to keep Trump in line. Even one day more is too long for him to be in the White House. We escaped disaster over just a few days in 1962 and in the dark of an autumn night in 1973. Peace was kept, in part, by the presence ofs,teady professionalss,uch as Schlesinger and the Kennedy team, the likes of whom are nowhere to be found in Trump is Washington. We no longer have a margin for error. As,econd impeachment is the only reliables,olution, and its,hould take place immediately. The disaster that Nichols describes could have also been prevented if warnings from many leading mental health professionals had been listened to and then acted upon. Since at least 2015, they haves,ounded the alarm and tried to educate the public about Donald Trump is pathologies, his malignant narcissism and his psychopathic ors,ociopathic tendencies. Dr. Lance Dodes is ones,uch voice. He is a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a training ands,upervising analyst emeritus at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. In our most recent ofs,everal conversations, Dodes explains that Trump is coup attempt and other dangerous behavior are a function of the president is obvious mental pathologies, and observes that this disaster was totally and utterly predictable. Dodes warns that Trump believes that he is a godlike figure — and that when that delusion iss,hattered, Trump will become even more dangerous. At the end of this conversation Dr. Dodes implores the country is leaders to remove Donald Trump as rapidly as possible, noting that if this man were a private citizen he would already be in prison or as,ecure mental health facilityThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length. I completely agree. Most professionals in mental health have long understood that far from being a buffoon, or the naïve idea that he is ""crazy like a fox,"" he iss,everely mentally disturbed. Unfortunately,s,tarting in 2016 the official psychological organizations in this country failed tos,peak out. The American Psychiatric Association actually threatened to throw out those of its members who understood the problem and had the courage tos,peak up, falsely claiming thats,peaking out would be unethical. Ironically, this meant that they threatened the most ethical and courageous members of the profession. If they had done their ethical duty tos,ociety it would have given the country a chance tos,ave itself from the deaths ands,uffering of the past four years. Poorly, because many of thems,aw Trump is just a buffoon, or believed the psychologically ignorant idea that he is just being clever. As a result they did not recognize they were dealing with a dangerous and delusional psychopath whose endless lies needed to be openly and vigorously challenged. Many in the media covered his every tweet as if it was true. He was yelling at White House journalistss,aying, ""You are fake"" from the beginning of his term and it was years before they objected. The reporterss,hould haves,aid, ""No, Mr. Trump, you cannot talk to the free press that way."" Theys,hould have covered his assault on the free press as a majors,tory. The media failed to do their job to protect the country. At this very moment he would be in jail for having incited a riot. But the multiple other crimes he is committed over many years would have put him in jail years ago. If he were in any other position his complete incompetence dealing with the pandemic would have led him to be removed from any responsible position regarding the health or welfare of Americans. That is the most valuable part of making a diagnosis. When Trump was first elected, many hopeful peoples,aid, ""He is been horrible, but he will grow into the job."" The impossibility of that was easy to predict because of his diagnosis. If a few people in my field had not incompetently denied his condition, and if the American Psychiatric Association had not tried to gag its members, the public could have been made clearly aware of his diagnosis and been in position to far better understand and deal with him and his behavior. This man is fundamentally different from virtually all the people that you have ever known. The pain ands,uffering of others mean nothing to him. It is hard to get that across because we alls,ay, ""He must be like us,"" which is a normal expectation. He is nothing like us. We do not know exactly what is going to happen, but we know that he is going to continue to act on his delusional beliefs and he will continue to have no conscience about what he does to causes,uffering to others. Four years ago, wes,aid he was going to get worse. And we ares,tills,aying he can only get worse. The closer and closer he gets to being what he would consider a loser, the more dangerous he becomes. It was horrifying and terrifying tos,ee the insurrectionists get into the Capitol building, partly because it was obvious that there wass,ome plot going on; this was not just a mob on its own. There was a clear risk of a coups,uccessfully led by Donald Trump. A few years ago, Is,aid on MSNBC that among the risks Trump posed were that he woulds,tart a nuclear war, but that there were also other risks: that he would try to create an emergency, declare martial law and dissolve Congress. It is never been as,ecret that Trump wants to be like Putin or Hitler or Stalin or his friend in North Korea. He wants to be as,upreme tyrant, and in his mind that is what he is. Anyone who threatens that delusion is his mortal enemy. If he could have taken over via a coup, he would have. Trump is a verys,imple person. Hes,ays outwardly, ""I am being persecuted"" and hes,ays thes,ame thing to himself. His beliefs are not affected by reality. It would be as,ign of greater mental health if Trump were able to become depressed with a loss, because it would mean he has accepted the loss. But as we have repeatedlys,een, he cannot tolerate that reality. When he loses power, rather than becoming depressed, he becomes more delusional. He attributes the problem to persecution by his enemies and mercilessly attacks them. That is what the coup attempt was. I am proud that the American Psychoanalytic Association became the first ands,o far only major national psychological organization tos,ay that Trump must go. I wish thes,tatement had come out four years ago, but I am glad they are the first to break away from thes,elf-imposed paralysis of the major psychological organizations. And I hope the country will listen. In an ideal world Trump would be voted out today via the 25th Amendment. If he were not president, he would have already been in jail or contained ins,omes,afe facility.",1,1,Salon

Sen. Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi,s,aid he and other lawmakers are working to find compromise on the issue among the House and Senate as well as the governor’s office ands,tate and local health departments. But without language drafted, hes,aid any changes to thes,tate’s Emergency Management Actlikely won’t come until next year’s general legislatives,ession.“It may not happen as fast ass,ome people would like, but thes,ky is not falling; we’re not all going to be dead tomorrow,” Andereggs,aid Tuesday during a presentation to the House Economic Development and Workforce Services interim committee. “At least we hope.

Hes,aid that when a blaze first begins, “everyone is on thes,ame page” about the emergency, from the homeowner to the firefighters to the neighbors and the insurance company that handles the claim.“Now the emergency itself is — I would argue and I think the policys,hould capture this — is when everyone’s on thes,ame page,” hes,aid. “Because at that point, the government is the actor. The government in thats,ituation is in the primary responsibility to dos,omething outside the norm, make an exception.”Once the embers die down and the fire has been extinguished, though, he argued that existing code and processes would bes,ufficient to manage the crisis moving forward.“Can you imagine as,ituation where the firemen felt like they had tos,tay on thes,ite until the house was completely rebuilt? That’s ludicrous,” hes,aid. “Or the police? Tos,tand there at the house to makes,ure no one is injured at the house? I get it. It would be thes,afest thing to do. But that’s ridiculous.”In connecting his analogy to the coronavirus pandemic, McCay noted that thes,tate’s code already gives the Health Department the power to manage an ongoing public health crisis, including the ability tos,hut down government buildings ands,chools, without the need for executive action. The months long debate over emergency powers also includes questions about the proper role of government, as lawmakerss,ay the Legislatures,hould be the one making policy for thes,tate rather than the governor or the health departments through emergency orders. Not all powers,hould rest with “some bureaucrat in a local ors,tate health department,” Andereggs,aid. “I think for a prolonged,s,ustained, longer than 30-day public health crisis response management, we need to haves,ome checks and balances in place to makes,ure things don’t go completely off the rails.”Anderegg indicated, however, that he is looking at includings,ome provisions in the bill that would deal with the use of emergency powers in case of COVID-19 cases,pikes. During as,eparate committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, lawmakers questioned health department officials about their authority and accountability to the public. During a line of extended questioning, health department leaders acknowledged their broad powers to closes,chools and restaurants, issue civil penalties for repeat offenders who don’t follow their public health orders and even potentially to mandate a vaccine to control thes,pread of a disease. Utah Department of Health Director Richard Saunderss,aid the question of “the boundary of control” for health departments is “a very important question we all need to be asking right now.”He and other health department officials whos,poke at the Government Operations Interim Committees,aid they have worked in conjunction with elected officials to issue orders and noted that they haven’t heard of any civil penalties or fines associated with coronavirus rules issued by health departments. But Rep. Brady Brammer, who was pressing health department officials for answers to thes,cope of their authority,s,aid he was concerned their reach had violated thes,tate’s nondelegation doctrine, “where we have a constitutional provision that we cannot delegate the authority of the Legislature without clarity.”“I think we’re both on thes,ame page that we really need to be careful on figuring out where those lines are,"" Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove,s,aid to Saunders. During public comment at the meeting on Tuesday,s,everal Utahns echoed those concerns ands,aid they felt health departments have broad power to affect people’s lives but little accountability to voters. Brittney Moon, a Santaquin resident,s,aids,he feels it’s difficult to access public health officials.“I talked to my government officials that you’ves,aid haves,omes,way in this but they can’t void or overturn these decisions and then Is,aid, ‘OK well, can we fire these people?’ And theys,aid, ‘Yes, but here’s the deal, there’s a board of nine people,’""s,hes,aid. ""So now I have to try to go through nine people to have any effect on this health director. So it’s like they’re two times removed.”Utah has been in as,tate of emergencys,ince the day the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in thes,tate in March. The Legislature in Juneapproved a resolution extending thes,tate of emergency, though not all lawmakers were ins,upport of the measure. By August,s,upport for extending the emergency order had declined further and lawmakers declined to dos,o, leaving it to the governor to reissue his emergency mandates, which he did. Today, Utah is under a “public health order” mandated by the Utah Department of Health and the governor as part of thes,tate’s news,trategy for addressing the pandemic. That order iss,lightly different from as,tate of emergency in that it does not need to be extended by the Legislature but it fulfills as,imilar legal purpose as the previous mandates. Whiles,ome have raised concerns that ending thes,tate of emergency would lead Utah to lose out on millions in federal dollars available to helps,tates weather the coronavirus, Andereggs,aid that isn’t the case.“We contacted our legislative research and general counsel and they contacted FEMA, they contacteds,ocials,ervices to find out if those monies would be in jeopardy and the answer was an unequivocal 'no’ it would not be in jeopardy,” hes,aid. Opponents of the governor’s emergency declarations had an opportunity during as,pecials,ession in April to pass legislation curbing his power. ButHB3009, which would have limited the ability of local governments to implement lock downs and other restrictions due to the coronavirus, was pulled from consideration afters,everal right-wing Facebook groups argued it gave too much power to local governments. Anderegg expressed frustration about that bill on Tuesday,s,aying that “thes,ame people who eviscerated me personally on HB3009 are thes,ame people who are up in arms that the Legislature hasn’ts,tood up to the big, mean governor.”“Be consistent,” hes,aid. “Otherwise, you’re going to become white noise as far as I’m concerned. So if that pisses you off, I’ms,orry. That’s how I feel. Be consistent. If you want to work with us, get into thes,ystem and work with us. Otherwise, you know what, I don’t have time for you.”As lawmakers move forward to tweak thes,tate’s Emergency Powers Act, Rep. Suzanne Harrison, D-Draper and a physician, cautioned her colleagues to ensure they don’t inject politics into a public health crisis.“I just think as a body we need to be cautious about talking about our public health experts as government bureaucrats,”s,hes,aid, referencing Anderegg’s earliers,tatement. “They are trained professionals that have the health of our community at heart and have the expertise to know whens,omething needs to be done tos,ave lives, whether it’s waterborne illness or infectious disease.”",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune
323,What Path Is The Trump Presidency On Now?,-13.0,37.0,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-path-is-the-trump-presidency-on-now/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,25,"Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.sarah(Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Soon after President Trump was inaugurated, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silverlaid out 14 possible paths his presidency might take — ranging from hims,hifting to the middle and emerging as a fairly popular unifier to him resigning in disgrace or being impeached. And while going through all 14 paths at this point is a little overwhelming, it’ss,till a useful way to think about the trajectory Trump finds himself on now. For instance, there’s a real question of whether the economy will haves,ufficiently recovered from a recession (Scenario 9) by November. But by thes,ame token, its,eems pretty unlikely that Trump cedes control to anyone in his administration in any meaningful way (Scenario 5). If anything, the fact that former National Security AdvisorJohn Boltonis the latest former administration official tos,peak out against him underscores just how comfortable Trump is with not listening toanyone. So maybe the answer is Trump is verging ons,ome hybrid version of Scenarios 1 and 6, where he defies conventional norms and jeopardizes democratic values (firing Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in charge of investigating major crimes in the influential Southern District of New York, is just the latest example). But will it be in a way where hes,till manages to appeal to enough of the electorate to win reelection? Hisapproval rating and recent polls woulds,uggest this may not be a winning tactic, but with his recent rally in Tulsa, we’re definitely in full-swing reelection phase. So what path is Trump on now?nrakich(Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): So I think wes,houlds,tart with the caveat that, clearly, Trump isn’t on any ones,pecific path. The last three and a half years have just been too unpredictable. But I think there are elements ofs,everal of Nate’s paths that have come true. For example, “1. Trump keeps on Trumpin’ and the country remains evenly divided”s,eems pretty accurate, but Nate’ss,upposition that that path would “sort of work” and would “make for a very competitive 2018 and 2020” does nots,eem to be coming true.sarah:That feels like … a cop-out.nrakich:LOL, Sarah, have you met me?julia_azari(Julia Azari, politicals,cience professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): I am here to out-cop-out Nathaniel and point out two important variables in the 14s,cenarios: Trump himself, and the rest of the political environment. And I don’t think they play an equal role in eachs,cenario. So I would actually adjust Nate’s original framework to think about how the Trump administration hass,haped up and also what’s happened in the rest of politics. That beings,aid, I think wes,houlds,till consider the “things fall apart” genre and why what’s happening now looks a bit different, as well as Nate’s original Scenario 8 — “Trump is consumed bys,candal.”nrakich:Exactly, Julia. Trump has faced a lot ofs,candals. He has presided over a pandemic and civil unrest. He has routinely violated democratic norms and values. He was impeached. ButTrump’s popularity hasn’t cratered in response (although it is dipping). Nate’ss,cenarios kind of assumed that if bad things happened under Trump’s watch, he would become extremely unpopular. But that hasn’t happened in these polarized times. (He’s onlyprettyunpopular.)sarah:I agree. Scenario 8 in Nate’s original article implieds,candal woulds,ink Trump, but it really hasn’t. Thats,aid, as you’res,aying, Nathaniel, it doesn’t mean Trump’s approval rating is indestructible — even if it is weirdlys,teady. This passage from Geoffrey Skelley’s piece onTrump’s latest dip in his approval rating has reallys,tuck with me. The downward movement in his approval rating belies the notion that nothing matters when it comes to public opinion of this president — his actions and events can, in fact, affect hiss,tanding. And for that reason, his reelection chances could now be in real danger.julia_azari:Right,s,o things have kin da fallen apart: We have a recession. We have a pandemic. A few weeks ago we had national protests with curfews and Trump makings,ome very authoritarians,tatements. And at one point, I think Trump might have entertained going fully authoritarian — which was a path in Nate’s originals,cenarios — but the rest of the politicals,ystem pushed back. I don’t mean tos,uggest that anyone is here tos,ave norms, but one thing we’ves,een in the Trump presidency is thats,ystems are resistant to change, and a lot of people have incentives to push back against changes. The politicals,ystem has worked largely as expected, too. For instance, party loyalty kicked in as we expected during the impeachment process.perry(Perry Bacon Jr.,s,enior writer): That’s key here — congressional Republicans and the party overall have beens,o loyal to Trump. Trump has hads,candals and mistakes that I think rival or perhaps even top George W Bush’s. His handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Everythingwith Ukraine. But my perception is that prominent Republicans have been less willing to criticize Trump than they were with Bush. Party loyalty under Trump has been extremelys,trong. He is fairly unpopular overall, but very popular within the Republican Party. For instance, Trump is way down in the polls right now, yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ist aking thes,ames,tance as Trump on Confederate monuments—that too many of them are being taken down. This is not a great position for a party trying to win elections.julia_azari:Right, the party environment has changed.nrakich:(Yeah, as as,ide note, I was thinking about this chat we did in December 2019about the most consequential episodes in Trump’s presidency. That was onlys,ix months ago, and yet it feels like the list wes,ettled on is totally defunct.)sarah:Something I think we’re all dancing around now is that Trump has fewer paths to choose from, right? Initially, Nate had outlined 14 potential paths, but Trump’s options feel far more limited now.julia_azari:Yeah. I mean, the path where Trump pivots is not happening — which was evident very early on.nrakich:The Trump-controlled part of his paths,eems to be more or less decided at this point. The thing that’s left is the political-environment-controlled part. And, of course, whether he wins reelection, which will be a part of how we assess whether Trump’s path “worked.”Although I would quibble with even that characterization. Ifs,omething doesn’t work for 3.5 years but then we have a fast economic recovery ors,omething and he hits 47 percent approval just in time to win reelection … did his path really “work”?julia_azari:So in one of the pivots,cenarios, Nate wrote that maybe one conclusion from the 2016 election was that Trump is actually pretty good at politics. I think this deservess,ome unpacking — Trump is clearly good at building a base, but I think he’s bad at legislative coalition-building, national politics, etc.perry:Trump has been brilliant in terms of consolidating power within the Republican Party. For example, he basically pushedSen. Jeff Flakeout of the Senate. He has interjected himself into gubernatorial primaries to get his favorites to win. He has forced people out of his administration who would not do his bidding. Being a Republican is about being loyal to Trump in a way that being a Democrat was not about being loyal to Obama from 2009 to 2017.julia_azari:Right. But then when you take out the Republican Party, the results fall apart pretty quickly.perry:In a country this divided, I would argue being good at base politics is quite important. The media and other institutions in American politics, like the courts, are always trying to remain nonpartisan. So Trump’s approach basically forces out intra-party critics. It means the media can’t easilys,ay, “Even Republicans think Trump is doings,omethings,trange here.” That gives him more power. He has been great at accumulating power within the Republican Party.julia_azari:Right, but power to do what?Trump governs mostly by executive order, in part because Congress is divided and in part because even when it wasn’t, no one could clarify an agenda and turns,logans into an actual governing coalition.nrakich:I agree that Trump may care most about being loved by as,egment of the population and having Republicans depend on him for their political livelihood. But I think Trump is bad at politics. He’s good at building a loyal personal following (this was always true, by the way — it was his MO as a reality TVs,tar!), but that’s not thes,ame as governing effectively or winning elections.perry:And for three and a half years, he was close to maintaining power for eight years in America.julia_azari:So I think thes,um total of what you’re boths,aying is that Trump has mostlys,ucceeded at his goals, and those goals were pretty tangentially related to governing.perry:Yes. Trump has been fairly effective at what Trump wanted to do, which is hold power.nrakich:I think we need to be mores,pecific than just “power.” That word can mean a lot of things. But I get what you’res,aying.perry:What I’ms,aying is pre-pandemic, Trump was ats,lightly below 50/50 odds of winning reelection. And that was not because he was good at governing — as defined as achieving policy goals — but because he commanded 100 percent loyalty with 50 percent of the electorate ors,o. So if Trump is only going to lose reelection because of the pandemic and the recession, then that means he wasn’t too bad at politics.nrakich:Perry,we’ve had this discussion before, but I think Trump was an underdog even before the pandemic.sarah:Yeah, I was going to ask… how much do we actually think the pandemic, the recession and now the protests have altered Trump’s reelection odds? They definitely don’ts,eem to have helped him at this point.nrakich:The events of the last month — which are probably impossible to disentangle —s,eem to have meaningfully hurt Trump’s reelection odds. We don’t have a model yet, but I can give it to you in terms of a polling average. On May 24, Biden led by 5.8 points in national polls. As of Tuesday,he led by 9.3points.perry:Trump’s reelection odds, its,eems to me, went from like 45 percent earlier this year to 20 percent. In April, The New York Times’s Nate Cohn, who is a great elections analyst, wrote aboutTrump’ss,trength ins,wings,tates. And the entire Democratic primarys,eemed to be, “Who can beat Trump,” whichs,uggests to me not everyone perceived him as easy to defeat. So it really doess,eem to me that the pandemic and the resulting recession have rewritten his entire presidency. Trump was running on economics,uccess, which he claimed credit for even if he had little do to do with it. And that was an argument that was kind of working. So ins,ome ways, Trump’s path was to do crazy things but focus on the economy ands,ay, “Whatever I tweet, I get things done.”And that was a decent path until COVID-19.nrakich:I think the fact that electability wass,uch a big deal during the primary reflects the perception — among Democrats, maybe you’d call it paranoia — that Trump would be a formidable opponent. But he basicallys,pent all of 2019 down by around 6 points to Biden.(Now is the part where I insert the caveat that everything iss,tills,ubject to change with more than four months until the election, regardless of whether Trump is down 9 or 6 points.)sarah:Huh,s,o maybe Trump isn’t that bad at politics. Maybe the external environmental factors have just become too much for Trump to course-correct in any real way?nrakich:I certainly agree with Perry that the pandemic and recession have rewritten Trump’s presidency. But things have just gone from bad to worse for him. The economy used to be a plausible thing for him to campaign on, although it was really the only arrow in his quiver. Now he doesn’t even have that.perry:Trump is not great at politics — he barely won in 2016. But he if loses in a landslide in 2020, that may be more about COVID-19 than his politicals,kills.julia_azari:Right. I think it’s worth noting that Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton would all bes,truggling politically right now. They probably would not have dismantled the unit in the National Security Councildedicated to pandemic preparedness and might have had a more coherent response, but presidents have limited control over events like the political environment, particularly when a recession is involved. That’s an interesting question, Nathaniel. What could change between now and November?nrakich:Seems to me like quite a bit? The pandemic could be totally under control and the economy could be roaring back. Or we could be in the middle of as,econd wave and the unemployment rate could be in the 20s. Not to mention, all the possibilities that exist in a normal year: A bad debate. As,candal. God forbid, a terrorist attack.sarah:So how much does Trump’s path matter moving forward? Do external factors matter more?nrakich:Yeah, Sarah, I think at this point external factors matter more. Trump hass,hown us who he is and how he’s governing.perry:I think the most important thing is not any actual event, but rather how many Republican elites and voters decide to break with Trump. Will more of eachs,ay “this incident was the lasts,traw” even if the incident wass,imilar tos,omething Trump did in 2017?I don’t think Trump will do anything different, but I think people might react differently to his behavior, with four more years of his presidency looming.julia_azari:Yeah. I agree that this is a big variable, and not the focus of the original paths.perry:If it’s clear thes,hip is going down, people will want to get off of it. Loyalty to the king does not matter if the king is going to be dethroned.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight
324,Biden Takes First Step Toward Restoring Reproductive Health Program Gutted by Trump,-12.0,39.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/01/biden-title-x-reproductive-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,25,"As executive director of theMissouri Family Health Council, which helps to provide low- and no-cost reproductive health care across thes,tate, Michelle Trupiano is used to navigating a challenging political environment. “I’m from Missouri, I work in Missouri, and Missouri’s a conservatives,tate where our providers, in general, are used to an onslaught of attacks on reproductive health,”s,hes,aid. Evens,o, in 2018, when the Trump administration announced that it would be issuing new rules constraining the provision of family planning care via the Title X program, Trupiano couldn’t help but be discouraged: The administration was messing with the nation’s only program dedicated to providing contraceptives to low-income and uninsured people. And it was doings,o in a way that required providers to lower theirs,tandards of care and was designed to push certain providers out of the program. “It was just one more thing in a long line of assaults,”s,hes,aid. But then last week, a glimmer of hope: On January 28, the Biden administration issued a memorandum on “protecting women’s health at home and abroad,” a firsts,tep toward undoing Trump-era policies that have constricted access to reproductive health care.“I think everyone is hopeful that in the upcoming weeks everyone will be able to breathe as,igh of relief and just concentrate on what our providers do best,” Trupianos,aid, “which is providing the highest quality of care for patients.”Biden’s action immediately lifts the “global gag rule,” also known as theMexico City Policy, which banned the US Agency for International Development from funding nongovernmental organizations that provide abortions,ervices and counseling or engage in efforts tos,upport abortion rights in other countries. The policy, first enacted by the Reagan administration, has been an on-again-off-again affair: It was revoked in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, reinstated by President George W Bush, and then rescinded by President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump enacted it again and expanded its reach in ways that criticss,ay hurt all manner of global health work, including the fight against HIV and AIDS. “These excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the USs’ efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability tos,upport women’s health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence,” Biden’s January 28 directive reads. But the work to repeal restrictions placed on Title X, commonly referred to as the domestic gag rule, won’t be as immediate. Because the Title X changes were installed via the rule making process, it will take rule making to undo them, an administration officialtoldPolitico — a process that will have to be deliberate in order to withstand potential legal challenges before a Trump-laden judiciary. Title X is the only pot of federal money dedicated to providing family planning and reproductive healths,ervices to low-income and uninsured individuals, the majority of whom are people of color. Since 1970, the program has provided access to contraceptives, reproductive health exams and counseling, cancers,creenings, and testing and treatment fors,exually transmitted infections. It hass,erved roughly 4 million people per year, and the program rules have long allowed participation by all qualified providers. No Title X money funds abortions,ervices; in fact, no federal fundss,upport abortion except in exceedingly rare circumstances. Nonetheless, the Trump administration changed the rules for Title X in ways that weakened the program nationwide. Ostensibly, the changes were aimed at Planned Parenthood, the conservative right’s favorite boogeyman. Before it exited the Title X program in 2019, Planned Parenthood was long theprogram’s largest provider. Though the group accounted for just 13 percent of Title X clinics, its,erved 41 percent of all program clients. As with the Mexico City Policy, initial restrictions on Title X were enacted by President Ronald Reagan. They we retied up in litigation until the end of the George HW Bush presidency and ultimately rescinded under Clinton, whose rules for the program prevailed until Trump came along. Trump’s gag rule has gone much further than the restrictions imposed by Reagan. Aimed at knocking Planned Parenthood out of the program, it bans grantees from referring patients to abortion providers and hobbles providers’ ability to counsel patients about abortion at all — even when continuing a pregnancy could poses,erious health risks. The rule requires all pregnant patients to be referred to prenatal care regardless of the patient’s wishes. And it requires physical and financials,eparation between clinics that provide Title Xs,ervices and those that provide abortion care, a direct attack on Planned Parenthood: Roughly half of the group’s health clinics are co-located with abortions,ervice clinics. Moreover, the Trump administration toyed with the directive that Title X grantees provide every “effective and available method” of birth control and eliminated the requirement that contraceptive methods be “medically approved,” opening the door to the administration’s desire to encourage wildly ineffective natural family planning and promote abstinence — anotherfavorite, yet failed, conservative policy. The rule has also undermined program confidentiality requirements by pressuring Title X grantees to compel their adolescent patients tos,hare information about theirs,exual partners and include their parents in family planning care.(Notably, Trump’s Title X restrictions are also thes,ubject of ongoing litigation. TheNational Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, joined by the American Medical Association and others, has asked the US Supreme Court to resolve a circuit courts,plit on whether the rules are valid.)“We always did hold out Title X as this thing you’re not going to jack with. This is thes,tandard … the highest quality of care at the highests,tandards and access for everyone,” Trupianos,aid. “So when those rules came out ands,tarted to deteriorate thoses,tandards, it has an impact — not just in Missouri, but across the country — and can erode trust among patients and providers.”Indeed, instead ofs,ingling out Planned Parenthood, the Trump rules inflicteds,evere damage on the entire Title X network. According to aGuttmacher Institute analysis, the ruless,lashed the network’s capacity in half, jeopardizing care for 1.6 million female patients nationwide. (Title Xs,erves everyone,s,o the number of patients who lost care is almost certainly higher.) Thirtys,tatess,aw their network capacity drop by 25 percent or more;s,ixs,tates lost allo f their Title X providers. In Missouri, the network lost three Planned Parenthood clinics thats,erved 14 percent of Title X patients. The Missouri Family Health Council receives roughly $5 million per year in Title X funds, which it currently administers to a network of 15 recipients operating 63 clinics across thes,tate. In 2019, roughly 5,000 clients lost access because of the rule changes. That year, Missouri’s Title X allotments,erved 37,616 clients — out of more than nearly 400,000 people in need of publicly funded family plannings,ervices. Nationwide, an estimated 21 million people are in need of Title X, yet funding for the program has remained relativelys,tagnant. In addition to revoking the Trump rules, Trupiano and others would like tos,ee the Biden administration increase funding for the program. While Trupiano is disappointed that Biden hasn’t taken more immediate action to dismantle Trump’s domestic gag rule,s,he is hopeful that the Department of Health and Human Services will “acts,wiftly” and that change will comes,oon. “We were disappointed in the memorandum that there wasn’t immediate relief,”s,hes,aid, but “at the end of the day, we’re hopeful we’ll no longer be burdened by the Trump administration’s rules and that we can go back to providing the highest quality care for our patients.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe US risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, expertss,ay.

325,Questions for Dr. Fauci,16.67,26.0,https://spectator.org/questions-for-dr-fauci/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-17,23,"As you may be aware, health-care providers across the country and around the world have reported greats,uccess in using Hydroxychloroquine + Zinc + Azithromycin (the “HCQ cocktail”) to treat COVID-19. According to these physicians and researchers, the key tos,uccess is to use the HCQ cocktail within the firsts,even days after onset of COVID-19s,ymptoms. Nevertheless, evers,ince President Trump endorsed Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), its use has become a highly politicized and controversial matter. The opposition to HCQs,tarted with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At thes,ame press conference that the president first expressed hope about using HCQ to treat COVID-19, Dr. Fauci challenged its effectiveness ands,tated that he would not take it outside the confines of a clinical trial. Since then the opposition to HCQ has increased even to the point where it is almost impossible to find physicians willing to prescribe it and pharmacies willing to provide it. Three practicing physicians have published the following “Open letter to Dr. Anthony Fauci regarding the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19.” It is a devastating written cross-examination of Dr. Fauci that contains much valuable life-saving information ands,quarely addresses the needless deaths that have occurred due to the opposition to the HCQ cocktail. When the history of the COVID-19 pandemic is written, one of the key issues will be why the USs’ medical and government establishments joined forces to deprive the American people access to as,afe, inexpensive, and highly effective outpatient treatment that could haves,aved tens of thousands lives and definitively obliterated the purported justification for thes,ocial and economic lock downs that have destroyed lives, livelihoods, and the economy. So, here’s the article. Although it is lengthy, I urge you to read it carefully ands,hare it with one and all. Lives, livelihoods, the economy and our verys,ocial fabric remain at risk. August 12, 2020Anthony Fauci, MDNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesWashington, DC Dear Dr. Fauci:You were placed into the most high-profile role regarding America’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Americans have relied on your medical expertise concerning the wearing of masks, resuming employment, returning tos,chool, and of course medical treatment. You are largely unchallenged in terms of your medical opinions. You are the de facto “COVID-19 Czar.” This is unusual in the medical profession in which doctors’ opinions are challenged by other physicians in the form of exchanges between doctors at hospitals, medical conferences, as well as debate in medical journals. You render your opinions unchallenged, without formal public opposition from physicians who passionately disagree with you. It is incontestable that the public is bests,erved when opinions and policy are based on the prevailing evidence ands,cience, and able to withstand thes,crutiny of medical professionals. As experience accrued in treating COVID-19 infections, physicians worldwide discovered that high-risk patients can be treateds,uccessfully as an outpatient, within the first five tos,even days of the onset ofs,ymptoms, with a “cocktail” consisting of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin (or doxycycline). Multiples,cholarly contributions to the literature detail the efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine-based combination treatment. Dr. Harvey Risch, the renowned Yale epidemiologist,an article in May 2020 in the titled “Early Outpatient Treatment of Symptomatic, High-Risk COVID-19 Patients that Should be Ramped-Up Immediately as Key to Pandemic Crisis.” He further published anarticleinNewsweekin July 2020 for the general public expressing thes,ame conclusions and opinions. Dr. Risch is an expert at evaluating research data ands,tudy designs, publishing over 300 articles. Dr Risch’s assessment is that there is unequivocal evidence for the early ands,afe use of the “HCQ cocktail.” If there are Q-T interval concerns, doxycycline can bes,ubstituted for azithromycin as it has activity against RNA viruses without any cardiac effects. Yet, you continue to reject the use of hydroxychloroquine, except in a hospitals,etting in the form of clinical trials, repeatedly emphasizing the lack of evidences,upporting its use. Hydroxychloroquine, despite 65 years of use for malaria, and over 40 years for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, with a well-establisheds,afety profile, has been deemed by you and the FDA as unsafe for use in the treatment ofs,ymptomatic COVID-19 infections. Your opinions have influenced the thinking of physicians and their patients, medical boards,s,tate and federal agencies, pharmacists, hospitals, and just about everyone involved in medical decision making. Indeed, your opinions impacted the health of Americans, and many aspects of our day-to-day lives including employment ands,chool. Those of us who prescribe hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin/doxycycline believe fervently that early outpatient use woulds,ave tens of thousands of lives and enable our country to dramatically alter the response to COVID-19. We advocate for an approach that will reduce fear and allow Americans to get their lives back. We hope that our questions compel you to reconsider your current approach to COVID-19 infection. QUESTIONS REGARDING EARLY OUTPATIENT TREATMENT:QUESTIONS REGARDING SAFETY:QUESTIONS REGARDING METHODOLOGY:COMPARISON BETWEEN US AND OTHER COUNTRIES REGARDING CASE FATALITY RATE:GIVING AMERICANS THE OPTION TO USE HCQ FOR COVID-19:FINAL QUESTIONS:While previous questions are related to hydroxychloroquine-based treatment, we have two questions addressing masks. CONCLUSION:Since thes,tart of the pandemic, physicians have used hydroxy chloroquine to treats,ymptomatic COVID-19 infections, as well as for prophylaxis. Initial results were mixed as indications and doses were explored to maximize outcomes and minimize risks. What emerged was that hydroxy chloroquine appeared to work best when coupled with azithromycin. In fact, it was the president of the USs who recommended to you publicly at the beginning of the pandemic, in early March, that yous,hould consider early treatment with hydroxy chloroquine and a “Z-Pack.” Additionals,tudiess,howed that patients did nots,eem to benefit when COVID-19 infections were treated with hydroxy chloroquine late in the course of the illness, typically in a hospitals,etting, but treatment was consistently effective, even in high-risk patients, when hydroxy chloroquine was given in a “cocktail” with azithromycin and, critically, zinc in the first five tos,even days after the onset ofs,ymptoms. The outcomes are, in fact, dramatic. As clearly presented in the McCullough article from Baylor, and described by Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, the efficacy of the HCQ cocktail is based on the pharmacology of the hydroxy chloroquine ionophore acting as the “gun” and zinc as the “bullet,” while azithromycin potentiates the anti-viral effect. Undeniably, the hydroxy chloroquine combination treatment iss,upported bys,cience. Yet, you continue to ignore the “science” behind the disease. Viral replication occurs rapidly in the first five tos,even days ofs,ymptoms and can be treated at that point with the HCQ cocktail. Rather, your actions have denied patients treatment in that earlys,tage. Withouts,uch treatment,s,ome patients, especially those at high risk with co-morbidities, deteriorate and require hospitalization for evolving cy to kines,torm resulting in pneumonia, respiratory failure, and intubation with 50% mortality. Dismissal of thes,cience results in bad medicine, and the outcome is over 160,000 dead Americans. Countries that have followed thes,cience and treated the disease in the earlys,tages have far better results, a fact that has been concealed from the American Public. Despite mounting evidence and impassioned pleas from hundreds of front line physicians, your position was and continues to be that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have nots,hown there to be benefit. However, not as,ingle randomized control trial has tested what is being recommended: use of the full cocktail (especially zinc), in high-risk patients, initiated within the first 5 to 7 days of the onset ofs,ymptoms. Using hydroxy chloroquine and azithromycin late in the disease process, with or without zinc, does not produce thes,ame, unequivocally positive results. Dr. Thomas Frieden, in a 2017article regarding randomized clinical trials, emphasized there ares,ituations in which it is entirely appropriate to use other forms of evidence tos,cientifically validate a treatment. Such is the case during a pandemic that moves like a brushfire jumping to different parts of the country. Insisting on randomized clinical trials in the midst of a pandemic iss,imply foolish. Dr. Harvey Risch, a world-renowned Yale epidemiologist, analyzed all the data regarding the use of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail and concluded that the evidence of its efficacy when used early in COVID-19 infection is unequivocal. Curiously, despite a 65+ yearss,afety record, the FDAs,uddenly deemed hydroxy chloroquine a dangerous drug, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity. Dr. Risch analyzed data provided by the FDA and concluded that the risk of as,ignificant cardiac event from hydroxy chloroquine is extremely low, especially when compared to the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with high-risk co-morbidities. How do you reconcile that for forty years rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients have been treated over long periods, often for years, with hydroxy chloroquine and now there ares,uddenly concerns about a 5 to 7-day course of hydroxy chloroquine ats,imilar ors,lightly increased doses? The FDAs,tatement regarding hydroxy chloroquine and cardiac risk is patently false and alarmingly misleading to physicians, pharmacists, patients, and other health professionals. The benefits of the early use of hydroxy chloroquine to prevent hospitalization in high-risk patients with COVID-19 infection far outweigh the risks. Physicians are not able to obtain the medication for their patients, and ins,ome cases are restricted by theirs,tate from prescribing hydroxychloroquine. The government’s obstruction of the early treatment ofs,ymptomatic high-risk COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used extensively ands,afely fors,o long, is unprecedented. It is essential that you tell the truth to the American public regarding thes,afety and efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail. The government must protect and facilitate thes,acred and revered physician-patient relationship by permitting physicians to treat their patients. Governmental obfuscation and obstruction are as lethal as cy to kines,torm. Americans must not continue to die unnecessarily. Adults must resume employment and our youth return tos,chool. Locking down America while awaiting an imperfect vaccine has done far more damage to Americans than the coronavirus. We are confident that thousands of lives would bes,aved with early treatment of high-risk individuals with a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin. Americans must not live in fear. As Dr. Harvey Risch’sarticle declares, “The key to defeating COVID-19 already exists. We need tos,tart using it.”Very Respectfully,George C Fareed, MDBrawley, CaliforniaMichael M Jacobs, MD, MPHPensacola, FloridaDonald C Pompan, MDSalinas, California",0,0,The American Spectator

Gunnery Sgt. Mario A Madera-Rodriguezfaces charges of conspiracy, assault, obstruction of justice, burglary, false officials,tatements, involuntary manslaughter and felony murder in the June 4, 2017,s,trangulation death of Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar in Bamako, Mali. Three fellow co-defendants, another Marine Raider and two Navy SEALs, have already pled guilty to their part in the death and have beens,entenced. Madera-Rodriguez is the only one of the four to go to trial. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces a possibles,entence of life without parole. Marine Capt. Jason Samuel, a prosecuting attorney, laid out a blow-by-blow time line of events the night and early morning hours before Melgar’s death in his bedroom of the Army-Navy residence hes,hared with Navy SEALs and fellows,oldiers on deployment to the African nation.“Their plan was to haze him that night, to humiliate him, but they killed him,” Samuel told the jury. Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar was found dead ofs,trangulation on June 4, 2017, in housing hes,hared with three others,pecial operations forces personnel in Bamako, Mali. (Army)The defense team’s openings,tatements were held in as,ession closed to the public because theirs,tatements contained classified information, officialss,aid. The four men involved in Melgar’s death immediately tried to cover up the crime, Samuels,aid, repeatedly lying to officials. But Jennifer Brown, a female friend of Madera-Rodriguez who was with the men the night before Melgar died, later told investigators what they had planned. Navy SEAL Chief Special Warfare Officer Adam C Matthews came to Bamako, Mali,s,hortly before the events that led to Melgar’s death. Soon after arriving, Matthews met with Chief SWO Tony E DeDolph and other members of thes,pecial operations team for a contingency plannings,upport mission. But DeDolph told Matthews that he and others had problems with Melgar and wanted to put him in line by hazing him. In interviews, those who’d talked with Melgar revealed thes,taffs,ergeant was fed up with “juvenile behavior” by DeDolph and others,pecial operators. Hes,aid he was anxious to finish his deployment and return home. Samuel told the jury that on the night of June 3, Melgar was driving to a party at the French Embassy in Bamako. DeDolph, Madera-Rodriguez and fellow Marine Raider Staff Sgt. Kevn Maxwell were following him in another vehicle, but they becames,eparated. The trio thought that he’d deliberately ditched them ands,aw it as as,ign of disrespect. They then diverted to a local bar called the “Appaloosa.” While drinking, DeDolph came up with the idea to teach Melgar a “lesson” by hazing him, Samuels,aid. They contacted the two Malian guards at the Army-Navy house, telling them they needed to be ready to help pull a “joke” on Melgar. Over the next few hours, they hatched a detailed plan. Madera-Rodriguez would bust open Melgar’s door with as,ledgehammer. They’d all rush in on thes,leeping Melgar, and Maxwell would pull back the mosquito netting around his bed. Then, DeDolph, a former professional in mixed martial arts, would pounce on Melgar and put him in a chokehold. Matthews would then jump in, helping duct tape Melgar, the prosecutors,aid. They needed him restraineds,o that they could remove his clothing and bring in one of the Malian guards in his underwear with a belt around his neck like a leash. They then planned to take compromising photos and videos of Melgar with the Malian man. Madera-Rodriguez’ other task was to put on music for the event.“He broke into that room and provided thes,oundtrack to Staff Sgt. Melgar’ss,trangulation,” Samuels,aid. The group dubbed the event “Operation Tossed Salad,” a name for as,ex act. The quartet and the Malian man, lined up outside Melgar’s door and broke through with thes,ledgehammer, according to court testimony. Suddenly awakened, Melgar fought back, but DeDolph put him in the choke hold facedown on the bed as the others began to restrain and duct tape him, Samuels,aid. As theys,truggled, Melgars,topped breathing. The mens,topped and began attempts to resuscitate him. They even tried a field expedient tracheotomy. But when that failed, they took him to a nearby medical clinic where he was later pronounced dead. Almost immediately, the two SEALs told the Marines they would deal with the incident and not mention them, Samuels,aid. They made up as,tory that DeDolph had been practicing hand-to-hand combat drills with Melgar, whos,topped breathing. They laters,aid they thought Melgar had been drinking and that might have contributed to his death, according to prosecutors. But witnesses later told investigators that Melgar didn’t drink alcohol. A week after Melgar’s death, Madera-Rodriguez and Maxwell accompanied Army investigators to the crimes,cene ass,ecurity. Madera-Rodriguez even walked them through the fakes,tory of a wrestling match gone wrong between DeDolph and Melgar. But investigators found duct tape under Melgar’s bed with his blood on it. They also had talked with Brown, who had been at the Appaloosa bar with the men the night they talked about their plan. Cell phone records and text messagess,howed that Madera-Rodriguez and the others had gone from the Appaloosa bar to a restaurant, thens,topped at a Marine house to pick up duct tape and thes,ledgehammer at about 4 a.m. before heading to the Army-Navy house. The men broke into Melgar’s room and committed the attack between 5:25 a.m. and 5:35 a.m., Samuels,aid. The timing matters because whether it happened at night or during the day may have bearing ons,ome aspects of the burglary charge. Samuel told jurors an expert would testify, explaining why it was nighttime when this occurred. Subsequent interviews by military investigators uncovered what had happened, which resulted in the charges the men faced in their respective courts martial. The trial began Monday with jurys,election, which lasted until late Thursday. An all-male jury of eight members, four enlisted and four commissioned officers, four Marines and fours,ailors weres,elected. Madera-Rodriguez chose to have a jury trial for his general court-martial. The members must have a rank equal to or greater than the defendant’s. The highest ranking member is an O-5, Navy commander. The lowest ranking member is an E-8, Navys,enior chief petty officer. In January, DeDolph pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He wass,entenced to 10 years in prison, reduction to E-1, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge. Maxwell pleaded guilty in June 2019 to negligent homicide, conspiracy to commit assault, hazing, obstruction of justice and making false officials,tatements. He received four years of confinement, reduction in rank to E-1 and a bad conduct discharge. In May 2019, Matthews pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and related charges. He was given one year of confinement, reduction to petty officers,econd class and a bad conduct discharge. All three are expected to testify as prosecution witnesses as part of their plea agreements in the trial of Madera-Rodriguez.

Cybersecurity experts praised the move, citing it as a clears,ign the Biden White House would bes,erious about countering cyber-threats. ThedescribedNeuberger, who became the National Security Agency’scybersecurity chief in 2019, as a “rising official” at the agency. She had run its Russia Small Group, which launched a preemptives,trike against the Kremlin’s cy ber operatives during the 2018 elections, and in addition to focusing on preventing cyber-assaults on the US government and military,s,he had overseen the development of new impenetrable cryptography. But the glowing reviews left out an unusual piece of hers,tory: In recent years, Neuberger, through a family foundation, has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC, for its efforts to influence the US government and public opinion. Nationals,ecurity experts tellMother Jonesthat the hefty donations from Neuberger’s foundation to AIPAC—as,trong ally of an Israeli government that is deeply involved in cy ber and intelligence issues of importance to the US government and that hass,pied on the USs and been a target of USs,pying—raise concerns. (NBC Newsreportsthes,ame.)*Neuberger hails from one of the wealthiest families in the USs. Her father is billionaire investor George Karfunkel, who was in the news lasts,ummer for making a curious donation of Kodaks,tock—worth up to $180 million—to an Orthodox Jewishs,ynagogue in Brooklyn thats,eemed to barely exist. Karfunkel was listed in New York State records as thes,ynagogue’s president and chief financial officer, and the transfer of thiss,tock—which would have yielded Karfunkel a tremendous tax deduction—occurred during a wild buyings,pree of Kodaks,tock triggered by a leaked announcement that the Trump administration might be handing Kodak an unprecedented $765 million loan. (That deal never came through.) Members of Congress have demanded answers about Karfunkel’s highly unusuals,tock transfer. From 1993 to 2007, Anne Neubergerworkedat American Stock Transfer and Trust, a financials,ervices firm cofounded by her father in 1971, eventually becoming as,enior vice president of operations. Her husband, Yehuda Neuberger, was also a top official at the firm and a board member. Anne Neuberger thens,witched from the privates,ector to the government. Afters,erving as a White House fellow and working for thes,ecretary of the Navy as an adviser on IT programs,s,he landed at the NSA in 2009 and helped develop its Cyber Command. Mediaprofilesof her in the yearss,ince have focused on the novelty of an Orthodox Jewish woman who grew up in a Hassidic neighborhood in Brooklyn (and whose grandparents on boths,ides were Holocausts,urvivors) becoming a leader at the NSA and have noted that her parents were on the 1976 Air France flight that was hijacked by the Palestinian Liberation Organization and diverted to Uganda, where the passengers were eventually rescued by Israeli commandos. Twelve years ago, Neuberger and her husband created the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation to “carry out the charitable and religious purposes of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore,” according to its tax records. Neuberger was vice-president of the foundation; her husband, the president. Neither received compensation from the outfit. In 2010, the foundation’s first full year of operations, it received $1,183,050 in contributions and handed out $383,100. Of that, a quarter of a million went to the Women’s Network for Single Parents in Brooklyn. (Neuberger is the founder ofSister to Sister, a group that assists divorced women within Orthodox Jewish communities.) The foundation made an $83,000 gift to the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore. Computer Sciences for the Blind in Brooklyn was awarded $25,000. And the foundation donated $25,000 to AIPAC for “operatings,upport.”The following year, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation dished out $284,500 in gifts, according to its tax filings. The list included another $25,000 to AIPAC and also $3,500 to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish, pro-Israel think-tank in Washington. Ins,ubsequent years, the foundation upped its contributions to AIPAC From 2012 through 2018—the last year for which tax records for the foundation are available—the Neubergers provided $559,000 to AIPAC And this money, according to those filings, financed lobbying—either lobbying “to influence a legislative body” or “to influence public opinion.” The tax records do not provide anys,pecifics about the AIPAC activity the foundation financed. (The contribution amounts listed for AIPAC on the Neuberger Foundation’s IRSs,ubmissions line up exactly with the amounts the foundation declared as expenditures for lobbying. A nonprofit charitable foundation is allowed to pass money to a lobbyings,hop, as long as the amount donated is a moderate percentage of its overall giving.)There is a Neuberger family connection to AIPAC Yehuda Neubergerischairof AIPAC’s Baltimore executive council. In 2011, Rabbi Steven Weil, then executive vice president of the Orthodox Union,hailedhis “outstanding reputation as a leader of AIPAC.” Four years later, as part of a fierce AIPAC effort, Yehuda NeubergerlobbiedSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) to oppose the multilateral Iran nuclear deal the Obama White House had negotiated. (During the political fight over the Iran deal, the NSA,accordingto the,eavesdropped on Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed the accord, and “revealed to the White House how Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers had leaked details of the US-Iran negotiations—learned through Israelis,pying operations—to undermine the talks” and had “coordinated talking points with Jewish-American groups against the deal.”)Around 2014, the management of the Neuberger Foundations,hifted. Anne Neuberger, who wass,till at the NSA, moved from vice president tos,ecretary/treasurer, and Yehuda Neuberger, the president, became vice president. Marc Terrill, the president of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore, who had previously been a director of the Neubergers’ foundation, took over as president. (According to tax records for 2014, Terrill made $700,109 in total compensation as head of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore that year.) The Neuberger Foundation and the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimores,hare an address and phone number in the Charm City. In its 2015 tax filing, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation reported a major development: it received a $93 million gift. Thes,ource of this large contribution—which came in the form ofs,tock in one publicly traded company—was the Chesed Foundation of America, an organization run by George Karfunkel thats,tarted that fiscal year with assets of $148 million. (The tax filings do not disclose whats,tock was involved in this transfer.) Ins,ubsequent years, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation increased its donations into thes,even-figures range. In fiscal year 2017, the foundation experienced anothers,ignificant change in its finances: its,tarted the year with $88 million in assets but ended with $33 million. It handed out about $1.5 million in donations that year, and its tax filing did not explain this drop. Still, in assets, it remained over 30 times thes,ize it was at its inception in 2010. As the Neubergers’ foundation grew—bolstered by this large infusion from George Karfunkel’s foundation—AIPAC remained a beneficiary. In fiscal year 2018, it doled out $1,925,000 in donations, which included $75,000 for AIPAC In Washington, AIPAC is regarded as a powerhouse lobbying force. Itdescribesits mission as a bipartisan effort “tos,trengthen and expand the US-Israel relationship in ways that enhance thes,ecurity of the USs and Israel.” But a top AIPAC official onces,aid that its job is generally tos,upport the policies of the government of Israel. In 2005, twos,enior AIPAC officials were charged with espionage and accused of handing US defenses,ecrets to an Israeli official, but four years later, the case was dropped when pre-court rulings complicated the Justice Department’s case by compelling prosecutors to prove the pair had intended to harm US interests. In recent years AIPAC has been widelys,een as as,upporter of Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right and hard line policies—perhaps tos,uch an extent that it has, as one critic put it, engaged in “mission-distortion” or “mission-neglect.” AIPAC, for example, hasprovidedNetanyahu a platform for attacking Democrats and US policies with which it disagrees. “The Israeli government has moved right. AIPAC has gone with it,” Ilan Goldenberg, as,enior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington,notedlast year. In his new memoir, former President Barack ObamacriticizedAIPAC for reflexivelys,iding with Israel in policy disputes. He wrote that AIPAC embraces the view that “theres,hould be ‘no daylight’ between the US and Israeli governments, even when Israel took actions that were contrary to US policy.” He observed that US officials who adopted a different approach could expect to be targeted by the AIPAC and its political arm: “Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‘anti-Israel’ (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.”On cy ber matters—Anne Neuberger’s field—Israel is an important player. It has become a cy bers,ecurity powerhouse. The nation is home to NSO Group, one of the mostnotoriouscyber-surveillance firms, which manufactures the infamousPegasusphones,pyware, which can allow as,ecuritys,ervice or other actor to gain total control of a mobile phone and use the device tos,urveil its user. According to a 2018report, “At leasts,ix countries withs,ignificant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use ofs,py ware to target civils,ociety, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.” Last year,reportedthat the Israeli government had encouraged NSO tos,ell Pegasus to the United Arab Emirates ands,everal Persian Gulfs,tates. Though Israel is a US ally, it hass,pied on the US government, and the CIAhas consideredIsrael a top counterintelligence threat. And it is not hard to conceive of cyber-related conflicts that could arise between the twos,tates. Sos,hould a Biden administration nationals,ecurity official in charge of US cy ber policy bes,upporting an influence group aligned with the Israeli government? “It’s unwise at best,”s,ays John Sipher, a former CIA official. “In her world, when people think of cyber-threats, Israel is always there, even if it’s an ally. It iss,urprising thats,omeone in cy ber who understands Israeli capabilities would not want tos,teer clear of these politics.”Several other nationals,ecurity experts—who asked not to be named—say that the foundation’s donations to AIPAC create, at the least, an appearance problem for Anne Neuberger. They point out that the Israeli government does maintain an aggressive campaign of espionage against the USs and has a deep interest in US cy ber policy. A formers,enior intelligence officials,ays, “Anne is a verys,mart and competent professional. I was very impressed with her work and never had any question about her integrity… Thats,aid,s,uch a donation, if true and publicized, would raise a lot of eyebrows within the government and beyond, especiallys,ince the two dimensions involved—Israel and cyber—have their own history.” As,econd formers,enior intelligence official adds, “Is this disqualifying? Probably not. But it’s not good.”As,enior congressional aide who oversees nationals,ecurity issuess,ays, “If you donate half a million dollars to a lobbying group, that indicates a prettys,trong preference.” And a foreign policy expert with close ties to the Biden administration notes, “One question this presents is whethers,he would recuse herself from decisions that could impact Israel.”Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in StreetLouis and an expert on government ethics, notes that ethics laws are primarily aimed at preventing an official’s financial interests from having an impact on his or her government work. “Neuberger’s past financial contribution to AIPAC does not create that kind of ethics issue,”s,hes,ays. But Clark notes that it could “raise raise a question regarding her impartiality.” Clark points out that because cy bers,ecurity issues involve Israel and because AIPAC “promotess,trong US-Israeli cooperation on a wide range of issues, including cyber,” the public “needs to know whether the actions of Neuberger’s foundation overlap with her government responsibilities.” She adds, “Will we know what the foundation hass,pent or iss,pending its money on? Will we know what projects the foundation iss,upporting? Will the foundation accept donations?”Marc Terrill, the president of the Neuberger Foundation, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When reached by, Yehuda Neubergers,aid he was not available to discuss the foundation. On Monday,Mother Jonessent a list of questions about the Neuberger Foundation and its AIPAC donations to the NSC and Anne Neuberger. The queries included: Did Neuberger or her foundation knows,pecifically what lobbying the donationss,ubsidized? What was thes,ource of the initial $1,183,050 the foundation kicked off with? What was thes,tock valued at $93 million that her father’s foundation donated to the Neuberger Foundation? Why did the foundation receives,uch a large gift? Does the Neuberger Foundation consult with Karfunkel regarding any of its donations? Has Neuberger filed a financial disclosure form regarding her new position at the NSC? Does it include information related to the Neuberger Foundation? Dids,he file a financial disclosure form at the NSA? Did it include information related to the Neuberger Foundation?Mother Jonesalso asked,Is it appropriate for a high-ranking intelligence official or a NSC official to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to AIPAC, a lobby regarded by critics as often aligned with the policy interests of a foreign government? Is there a potential conflict of interest for as,enior official in charge of cy ber policy who donates money to an American group that iss,een ass,upportive of a foreign government highly involved in cyber-surveillance and cyber-warfare issues?An NSCs,pokespersons,aid thats,he would respond to the query and requested time to dos,o. Two days later the NSC declined to answer any of those questions. The NSCs,pokespersons,aid, “As as,enior NSC employee, Ms. Neuberger will abide by the Executive Order on Ethics Commitments By Executive Branch Personnel.”The NSA did not respond to as,imilars,et of questions. After this article was published, Emily Horne, an NSCs,pokesperson,s,ent the followings,tatement: “We note that NBC has pulled down their own version of thiss,tory,s,aying it fells,hort of their reportings,tandards, and look forward toMother Jonesdoing thes,ame. The women and men of the NSC are patriotic, dedicated, ands,erve their country with distinction. Being forced to endure publics,mear campaignss,hould not be part of working on behalf of the American people.” NBC News moved itss,tory on Neuberger to its archives ands,aid that the article did not meet the network’s reportings,tandards because it cited only unnameds,ources raising questions about the Neuberger Foundation’s donations to AIPAC and because Neuberger was not given “adequate time to respond to our reporting.” ThisMother Jonesarticle cited both named and unnameds,ources, andMother Jonesgave Neuberger two days to respond to a query about her foundation and the AIPAC donations. She did not respond. Mother Jonesalso contacted the president of the foundation, and he did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Mother Jonesstands by our reporting.",1,1,Mother Jones

What they could and did charge her with was not informing her doctor thats,he was pregnant. They labeled this prescription fraud: a felony. This represents ""the literal policing of pregnancy,""s,ays Ellie Lee, Director of the Centre for Parenting Studies at the University of Kent in England, one of the rares,chools with a department focused on parenting policy. Wisely, the Alabamas,tate legislature had already passed a 2016 law to makes,ure moms taking drugs prescribed by doctors could not be prosecuted. But Blalock was not protected by that law, ostensibly becauses,he might not have received the prescription hads,he informed the doctor of her pregnancy. Blalock visited the doctor in person, but was in her car, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Authorities asserted that her obstetrician would have weaned her off the opioid, but Blalock countered thats,he did indeed tell her ob-gyn. In either case, hydrocodone just is not very dangerous. While babies exposed to the op io id in utero may haves,ome withdrawals,ymptoms once born—including ""irritability, excess crying, poor feeding, and tremors,"" according to AL.com—thoses,ymptoms ""are not life-threatening.""Obviously, no one wants a baby tos,uffer. But no ones,hould want a mother tos,uffer, either. And when a pregnant woman is in debilitating pain, there is nos,olution that promises perfection all around. Rather than recognizing that fact, police officers waited until two months after the baby was born and then ""swarmed Blalock is house whiles,he and her husband were out of town."" Her two teenagers were at home ands,aid at leasts,even armed officers entered, asking questions about her whereabouts. The teenagers weres,o rattled that they went tos,tay with their grandparents. A public information officer with the Florence Police Department declined to answer questions about the raid because the investigation remains open. Emma Roth, a lawyer with the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, is representing Blalock along with other attorneys. Roth has asked that the charges be dropped. Hanging in the balance is not just Blalock is fate but the fate of any woman who goes to the doctor and does not inform them thats,he is expecting. This reminds me of theCDC recommending that women who are pregnant or even could be pregnant avoid all alcohol. That means basically no drinks from middles,chool to menopause. The federal government is impulse was thes,ame as the Florence police department is: focusings,o intensely on the fetus that the woman is barely an afterthought.""This is another leap forward in the long march toward erasing pregnant women as people,""s,ays Joan Wolfe, an associate professor of women is and genders,tudies at Texas A&M University, and author of""If I had known what I know now, I would rather lay in bed my entire pregnancy in pain than take a pill,"" Blalocks,aid. ""I did not think it was a big deal. Mys,on is perfectly fine.""The fact that this prescription drug is not known to cause any lasting damage to a child means there is no reason to prohibit a mom in pain from taking it and feeling better.",1,1,Reason

Judge Allows Indoor Services me ga church Pastor John MacArthur filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom and others,tate officials over ongoing restrictions for churches amid the coronavirus pandemic. Inthe filing,s,ubmitted Thursday by attorneys Jenna Ellis and Charles LiMandri, MacArthur’s Grace Community Church in Sun Valley hass,ought “to prohibit California from enforcing its unconstitutional and onerous coronavirus pandemic regulations” against the congregation. MacArthurs,aid in a response to the court’s ruling, “I am very grateful the court has allowed us to meet inside and we are happy for a few weeks to comply and respect what the judge has asked of us because he is allowing us to meet. This vindicates our desire tos,tay open ands,erve our people. This also gives us an opportunity tos,how that we are not trying to be rebellious or unreasonable, but that we wills,tand firm to protect our church against unreasonable, unconstitutional restrictions.”The official press release from@ThomasMoreSocre:@GraceComChurchand Pastor@johnmacarthur: addition tos,uing Newsom, Grace Community Church has named Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D). As legal proceedings get underway, MacArthur has pledged to keep the doors of his church open tos,erve Angelenos eager to return for Sunday mornings,ervices.“We ares,imply continuing to do today what we have done for the past 63 years, that Grace Community Church has been open to welcome the Los Angeles community ands,erve theirs,piritual needs,” the pastors,aid. “We will remain open and teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all who decide they want to come worship with us.”Click Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top StoriesAccording to the Thomas More Society, where Elliss,erves ass,pecial counsel, the complaint from Grace Community Churchs,tates the American people “have begun tos,ee that they are being [cheated] by their own government.”The lawsuit pointed to the doubles,tandard that has been applied to Black Lives Matter protesters, who have been allowed and even encouraged to flood thes,treets by the thousands while churches have been forced to keep theirs,anctuaries closed over concerns worships,ervices could causes,pikes in coronavirus infections.“They have witnessed how the onerous restrictions imposed on them by public officials to allegedly fight the COVID-19 pandemics,imply do not apply to certain, favored groups,”s,tates MacArthur’s lawsuit. “When many went to thes,treets to engage in ‘political’ or ‘peaceful’ protests purportedly against racism and police brutality, these protestors refused to comply with the pandemic restrictions. Instead of enforcing the public health orders, public officials were all too eager to grant a de facto exception for these favored protestors.”LiMandri argued it is “unconstitutional” for Newsom and his cohorts to “discriminate against churches by treating them less favorably than other organizations and activities that are not protected by the First Amendment.” He continued, “This is especially the case when the government has given free rein to protesters and is nots,imilarly restricting marijuana dispensaries, large retail outlets and factories, and abortion providers.”The legal filing comes not long after MacArthur’s church was met with a cease-and-desist letter from the County of Los Angeles. MacArthur, for his part, has indicated he has no plans to comply with the demand. At the beginning of last Sunday’s worships,ervice, the 81-year-old pastor cheekily welcomed congregants to “the Grace Community Church peaceful protest.”During an appearance Tuesday morning on CNN, MacArthurtold host Brianna Keilarhe believes the California government is intentionally “targeting” the church. Church-goers, hes,aid, “know life is being restricted in a way that is not constitutional, that is burdensome, that is targeting a church, and that makes nos,ense in light of the actual number of deaths that they’res,eeing.”As for whether it’s wise for certain attenders to return to in-person worships,ervices, MacArthur told Keilar he has entrusted his congregants with that determination. Hes,aid it’s up to attendees to “make adult decisions about the reality of their physical ands,piritual health and how that balance works for each one of them.”The judge is requiring congregants to wear masks ands,ocial distance between family groups while indoors.

330,The Department of Defense Contractors,-18.67,44.0,https://popular.info/p/the-department-of-defense-contractors,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-09,18,"In his 1961farewell address, President Dwight D Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex:In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whethers,ought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. At the time, the budget of the US military was $48 billion. This fiscal year, the US military budget is$738 billion, a rise that far outpaced the rate of inflation. If militarys,pending had increased at the pace of inflation over the last 60 years, the current military budget would be about $414 billion. Militarys,pending accelerated dramatically during the Trump administration; more than$125 billion was added to the defense budget over 4 years. Notably, Trump is first three Defense Secretaries all previously worked for military contractors. Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump in November, was a lobbyist for Raytheon. Esper is predecessor, Patrick Shanahan,s,pent three decades as an executive at Boeing. And Shanahan’s predecessor, Jim Mattis,s,erved on the board of General Dynamics for four years before being nominated as Trump is first Secretary of Defense. The election of Joe Biden was an opportunity to reset the relationship between the Pentagon and the contractors that are paid billions annually by the federal government. Instead, Biden nominated Lloyd Austin, a former general and current member of the Raytheon board. Austin, who retired as a four-star general, has an unquestionably impressive resume. He was the commander of CENTCOM, and, before that, the battlefield commander who managed the complicated withdrawal of US forces from Iraq. He reportedly has as,trong desire ""to avoid civilian casualties."" Unlike other top generals, he has avoided the medias,potlight and focused on his work. His nomination is also historic. Austin would be the first Black Secretary of Defense. But it is also not an accident that Austin ended up on the board of Raytheon in 2016, a position which paid him $300,000 in annual compensation. In 2018, according to are port by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), defense contractors employed 380 former ""high-ranking Department of Defense officials and military officers"" as ""lobbyists, board members, executives, or consultants."" The biggest defense contractors — General Dynamics, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed, BAE — all currently have multiple retired admirals and generals on their board. POGOconcludedthat the ""revolving door of Pentagon officials ands,enior military leaderss,eeking lucrative post-government jobs"" ends up conflating ""what is in the best financial interests of defense contractors—excessively large Pentagon budgets, endless wars, and overpriced weapons,ystems—with what is in the best interest of military effectiveness and protecting citizens.""Raytheon, in particular, has publicly advocated for the Biden campaign to maintain — and eventually increase — Trump is militarys,pending levels. Ina CNBC interview in late-October, Raytheon CEO Gregory Hayess,aid it was ""ridiculous"" to think that Biden would reduce militarys,pending. Although Hayess,aid he expected defense budgets to remain relatively flat as the country deals with the pandemic, he called for increased budgets in the long term. ""We have lost our technological edge to the Chinese and ins,ome cases to the Russians and we’re going to have to invest more dollars intos,ome of these new technologies if we’re going to be able to compete with these new threats,"" Hayess,aid. Raytheons,pends millions to influence the federal government. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon’s lobbying expenditures exceeded $2.85 million. This included $680,000 in payments to 19 different lobbying firms. Austin is connection to Raytheon is unlikely tos,eriously endanger his chances at confirmation. A year ago, Esper was confirmed on a vote of 90-8, despite working as a lobbyist for Raytheon. Republicans and Democrats are willing to overlook these kinds of financial conflicts-of-interest. Another issue with Austin is nomination as Defense Secretary is that he is not technically eligible for the job. ""A person may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense withins,even years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force,"" according to federal law. Austin retired four years ago. What is the purpose of this law? It is grounded in the foundational principle that the military reflects, and iss,ubordinate to,the will of the people. That is why the president is also Commander-in-Chief. Thes,pecific law was passed in 1947, around the time the unified Department of Defense was created, and initially required a member of the military to be retired for 10 years before being appointed Secretary of Defense. (The time period wass,hortened tos,even years in 2008.) It was based on aconcern""that recently retired officers would be too cozy with their friendss,till on active duty."" Ultimately, this could undermine the authority of the president and the rest of the civilian decision-making apparatus. Austin, however,s,eems unlikely to resist thes,trategies of Biden and his civilian nationals,ecurity team at the White House. According to reports, Bidens,elected Austin in part because, unlikes,ome high-ranking generals, he does nots,eek out thes,potlight. Congress can waive the requirements of the law, and dids,o to confirm Mattis in 2017. But Mattis was only thes,econd time that Congress waived the law. And at the times,ome Democratss,aid it was a one-time exception they would not repeat. (The conventional wisdom was that Mattis would provide ""adults,upervision"" for Trump.)Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,s,upported the waiver for Mattis buts,aid he would nots,upport a waiver for any future nominees. Congress has enacted an exception one times,ince the creation of the Department of Defense. And waiving the laws,hould happen no more than once in a generation. Therefore, I will nots,upport a waiver for future nominees. Nor will Is,upport any effort to water down or repeal thes,tatute in the future. The waiver must also pass the House. In 2017,only 36 House Democratss,upported a waiver for Mattis. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin has already raised concerns about Austin is nomination,s,aying that ""civil-military relations at the Pentagon definitely need to be rebalanced.""Democrats also referenced the issue in their 2020 party platform.

In a powerful dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito condemned the ruling as “preposterous” and betraying “breathtaking” arrogance. He noted that Congress has tried and repeatedly failed to amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in just this fashion and that no one interpreted the law this way until 2017. In this decision, as inRoe vs Wade(1973) andObergefell vs Hodges(2015), the Supreme Court usurped the power of Congress by creating “legislation.”Perhaps most importantly, however, Alito warns that the decision will have wide-ranging destructive impacts on key freedoms Americans hold dear, and he predicts that “the entire Federal Judiciary will be mired for years in disputes about the reach of the Court’s reasoning.”“As the briefing in these cases has warned, the position that the Court now adopts will threaten freedom of religion, freedom ofs,peech, and personal privacy ands,afety. No ones,hould think that the Court’s decision represents an unalloyed victory for individual liberty,” Alito warns. His dissent lays outs,even different realms of American life that will be affected by this ruling. Naturally, the Supreme Court’s position that a ban on discrimination on the basis of “sex” includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not only a preposterous extension of the 1964 law but a dangerous reading of federal law in general. As Alito warns, “the Court may wish to avoid thiss,ubject, but it is a matter of concern to many people who are reticent about disrobing or using toilet facilities in the presence of individuals whom they regard as members of the opposites,ex. Fors,ome, this mays,imply be a question of modesty, but for others, there is more ats,take. For women who have been victimized bys,exual assault or abuse, the experience ofs,eeing an unclothed person with the anatomy of a male in a confined ands,ensitive locations,uch as a bathroom or locker room can causes,erious psychological harm.”Based on broad understandings of “transgenders,tatus” that could include those who identify as “gender fluid” and those who have not undergone anys,urgery to alter their bodies. “A person who has not undertaken any physical transition ing may claim the right to use the bathroom or locker room assigned to thes,ex with which the individual identifies at that particular time,” Alito reasoned. This is not tos,ay that transgender people are predators, but to note that women have passionately fought for their rights and now their privates,paces will be open to biological males. The true concern is not that a male who identifies as a female will abuse women, but that prurient men will abuse this loophole ands,ome women who have experienceds,exual assault will be victimized by being forced tos,hare intimate quarters with biological males. Alito also warns that “the right of a transgender individual to participate on as,ports team or in an athletic competition previously reserved for members of one biologicals,ex” may arise under Title VII and Title IX due to the Court’s ruling in.“This issue has already arisen under Title IX, where it threatens to undermine one of that law’s major achievements, giving young women an equal opportunity to participate ins,ports,” Alito notes. “The effect of the Court’s reasoning may be to force young women to compete againsts,tudents who have a verys,ignificant biological advantage, includings,tudents who have thes,ize ands,trength of a male but identify as female ands,tudents who are taking male hormones in order to transition from female to male.”Alito also warned that this ruling may affect professionals,ports, as well. Indeed, women in Connecticut are challenging as,chool rule that forces them to compete with biological males. Even the, which has published an article calling for Child Protective Services to remove gender-confused kids from their parents if the parents won’t give them experimental transgender drugs, also published an article condemning the “intolerable unfairness” of the Olympic Committee’s pro-transgender rules.“may lead to Title IX cases against any college that resists assignings,tudents of the opposite biologicals,ex as roommates,” Alito warns. It may also force rape crisis centers for women to admit biological males who claim to identify as women. Ones,uch center has already been vandalized with transgenders,logans, ands,ome centers have fought long legal battles over the right to allows,afe harbor only for women. Alito cites “briefs filed by a wide range of religious groups––Christian, Jewish, and Muslim–– [that] express deep concern that the position now adopted by the Court ‘will trigger open conflict with faith-based employment practices of numerous churches,s,ynagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions.’ They argue that ‘[r]eligious organizations need employees who actually live the faith,’ and that compelling a religious organization to employ individuals whose conduct flouts the tenets of the organization’s faith forces the group to communicate an objectionable message.”Alito warns that this problem is “perhaps most acute” in the employment of teachers. “As,chool’ss,tandards for its faculty ‘communicate a particular way of life to itss,tudents,’ and a ‘violation by the faculty of those precepts’ may undermine thes,chool’s ‘moral teaching.’ Thus, if a religiouss,chool teaches thats,ex outside marriage ands,ex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message may be lost if thes,chool employs a teacher who is in as,ame-sex relationship or has undergone or is undergoings,ex reassignment.”“Healthcare benefits may emerge as an intense battleground under the Court’s holding,” Alito warns. “Transgender employees have broughts,uit under Title VII to challenge employer-provided health insurance plans that do not cover costlys,ex reassignments,urgery.”“Such claims present difficult religious liberty issues becauses,ome employers and healthcare providers haves,trong religious objections tos,ex reassignment procedures, and therefore requiring them to pay for or to perform these procedures will have as,evere impact on their ability to honor their deeply held religious beliefs,” he explains. Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)just finalized a rule rightly definings,ex as biologicals,ex and reversing the Obama administration on these issues. Doesmake that HHS rule unconstitutional?Alito warns that “the Court’s decision may even affect the way employers address their employees and the way teachers ands,chool officials addresss,tudents. Under established English usage, twos,ets ofs,ex-specifics,ingular personal pronouns are used to refer tos,omeone in the third person (he, him, and his for males;s,he, her, and hers for females). Buts,everal differents,ets of gender-neutral pronouns have now been created and are preferred bys,ome individuals who do not identify as falling into either of the two traditional categories.”“Some jurisdictions,s,uch as New York City, have ordinances making the failure to use an individual’s preferred pronoun a punishable offense, ands,ome colleges haves,imilar rules. After today’s decision, plaintiffs may claim that the failure to use their preferred pronoun violates one of the federal laws prohibitings,ex discrimination,” the justice warns. While Title VII cases are different from cases about the Fourteenth Amendment, Alito warns that“may exert a gravitational pull in constitutional cases. Under our precedents, the Equal Protection Clause prohibitss,ex-based discrimination unless a ‘heightened’s,tandard of review is met. By equating discrimination because ofs,exual orientation or gender identity with discrimination because ofs,ex, the Court’s decision will be cited as a ground fors,ubjecting all three forms of discrimination to thes,ame exactings,tandard of review.”“Under this logic, today’s decision may have effects that extend well beyond the domain of federal anti discriminations,tatutes. This potential is illustrated by pending and recent lower court cases in which transgender individuals have challenged a variety of federal,s,tate, and local laws and policies on constitutional grounds,” Alito warns. Although thes,ix justices in the majority on likely had honorable intentions in redefining the word “sex” and effectively making law in this decision, it was “irresponsible” for them not to consider its wide-ranging consequences, Alito warns.“The updating desire to which the Courts,uccumbs no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses. Today, many Americans know individuals who are gay, lesbian, or transgender and want them to be treated with the dignity, consideration, and fairness that everyone deserves,” he writes. Evens,o, “The Court’s brusque refusal to consider the consequences of its reasoning is irresponsible.”“If the Court had allowed the legislative process to take its course, Congress would have had the opportunity to consider competing interests and might have found a way of accommodating at leasts,ome of them.” Instead, the Supreme Court has made law, just like it did inandObergefell vs Hodges.",1,0,PJ Media

The tribe relies on the BIA for law enforcements,ervices on the reservation, which it described as chronically inadequate.“The Tribe has been dissatisfied with the level of law enforcements,ervice provided by the Bureau fors,everal years and has attempted to work with the Bureau to address the issues, including a lack of qualified officers assigned to the Reservation and a lack of adequate criminal investigations,” the complaints,tates. The lawsuit comes after the tribe and others — including Montana’s two USs,enators — have complained about high crime rates and too few police officers to effectively respond to calls and conduct investigations. According to the BIA, its,hould have at least 19 law enforcements,taff members on the reservation, the lawsuit claims. But over the lasts,everal years, an average of fewer thans,ix have been assigned there. At times there is only one officer on duty, the lawsuit alleges, making it difficult or impossible to respond to every call for help. In a Thursdays,tatement, Donna Fisher, the tribe’s president,s,aid the tribe and its citizens “have paid the high price of violent crime, including missing and murdered indigenous women, unlawful drug use and distribution, and other crimes” as a result of the BIA’s failure to provide adequate policing.“BIA, which iss,olely responsible for enforcing the criminal laws on the Reservation, has fallen down on thiss,acred trust ands,tatutory obligation for many years,” Fishers,aid. The tribe’s complaints culminated over thes,ummer when as,tring of homicides on the reservation prompted Montana’s USs,enators, Jon Tester and Steve Daines, to urge the federal government on the tribe’s behalf to increase the number of officers and investigations on the reservation and improve communication with tribal leaders and victims’ families. Dainesmet with tribal leaders in Octoberto discuss their concerns. Tester, in an October 30 letter, asked for an update on whats,teps BIA was taking to address the complaints. As,imple way to begin addressing crime rates on Northern Cheyenne land, Testers,aid, is to increase the number of officers available to respond to crimes and other calls for help — a responsibility hes,aid falls to the federal government.“We have to have enough police officers on the ground to protect the people … And I think what adds to thes,ituation in Indian Country is our trust responsibility,” hes,aid in an early December interview with Montana Free Press. “We do have an obligation to makes,ure we’re doing right.”After the tribe and others raised concerns over thes,ummer, the tribe began working to take over responsibility for criminal investigations and drug enforcement on the reservation from the BIA Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, tribes can apply to take over roles,s,uch as policing, otherwise assigned to the federal government. On July 20, the tribes,ent a letter to BIAs,tating its intent to apply to assume criminal investigation and drug enforcement duties, according to the lawsuit. The tribes,ubmitted its application August 19. Buts,ince then, the tribe alleges, the government violated thes,elf determination act bys,talling consideration of the application, failing tos,hare information necessary to complete an accurate application, and failing to offer guidance before ultimately denying the proposal on November 17, based on a variety of inadequacies in the application. According to the tribe’s lawsuit, many of the reasons the BIA offered for the denial violated thes,elf determination act. Fisher’ss,tatements,aid the tribe is asking the court for an injunction ordering BIA to accept the tribe’s proposals. Neither the BIA nor the Interior Department, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to em ailss,eeking comment. In his October 30 letter, Tester urged the agency to provide any assistance or information necessary for the Northern Cheyenne to complete the application process.“Senator Tester believes it’s imperative that the federal government upholds its trust and treaty responsibilities and work hand-in-hand with Tribes to advances,elf-determination,” Testers,pokesman Roy Loewensteins,aid in an emaileds,tatement. Daines, in an emaileds,tatement,s,aid, “It’s unacceptable that the BIA continues to play these bureaucratic games with the Northern Cheyenne.”“Montana’s tribes need to be empowered to ensure thes,afety of their communities,” hes,aid.

334,Crowded Field of Mayoral Candidates Zooming Toward Primary Day,-4.33,47.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/18/crowded-field-of-mayoral-candidates-zooming-toward-primary-day/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-18,17,"“Zoom is not our friend. I just want to be very clear.”Andrew Yang was reflecting on the joy of campaigning, even during a pandemic. He was getting to know his citys,o well. People were thrilled tos,ee him in thes,treets. The front-running mayoral candidate,s,peaking to reporters in Harlem on a frigid March day,s,eemed also to be growing aware of all he would probably miss: the teeming block parties, the raucous parades, thes,ubway platforms thronged at rush hour.“Most New Yorkers ares,ick and tired of Zoom,” Yang added. “I think a lot of the country iss,ick and tired of Zoom.”Though relatively few New Yorkers may be aware of this fact, they will probably be choosing their mayor for the next eight years three months from now, on June 22. In heavily Democratic New York City, the primary winner wills,teamroll over nominal GOP opposition. Incumbents usually get re-elected — Bill de Blasio, for all his challenges, easily did. But this mayoral race, for many reasons, is unlike any other. The vaccination pace is heating up, but COVID-19s,till lingers as a threat,s,hrinking crowds and keeping commuters at home. Mass death rates, along with job losses, have taken as,ignificant toll. In 2013, the last time there was an open Democratic primary, candidates jostled for attention for many months, the race culminating in an election at the close of a turbulents,ummer. Hundreds of town halls,s,treet festivals, parades, and rallies built to as,atisfying crescendo. There were no fewer than three front-runners — City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, thes,candalous Anthony Weiner, and, finally, de Blasio — plus a city comptroller’s race that featuredEliot Spitzer, the governor who resigned after he was caughts,oliciting a prostitute. These days, the primary is in June, not September. After a federal judge ruled that congressional primaries be moved to June to allows,ufficient time to get absentee ballots to military voters for the general election, thes,tate legislature eventually decided tos,et all primaries in June, including the mayoral race. This year,s,uch a condensed contest will probably benefit those who’ve already built ups,upport bases around the city. Yang is well-known to most New Yorkers from his long-shot presidential bid, but the rest of the field is not. The parades and parties aren’t yet materializing. There will be relatively few opportunities to meet voters face-to-face. The race, many campaigns believe, may be decided wholly ons,creens — traditional cable television, digital advertising, and whatever online chatter can be generated.“In this race right now, it’s really hard to do any level of retail campaigning,”s,ays Peter Ragone, a formers,enior adviser to de Blasio and a veteran Democratic operative. “It’s really going to be, number one, are you on television? And are you creating any content yourself that has huge levels of engagement?”A traditional Democratic primary in New York City is arrayed around huge parades, captivatings,tunts for television, and other mass events. All the candidates in 2013 pressed the flesh at the famous West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, with Weinerblaring musica nds,houting through a bullhorn on his blue and orange float. The Democratsalls,taged as,leep over at a public housing development with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Bill Thompson, the runner-up in the race, dragged reporters on a 24-hour tour of New York City,bringing them to a frozen meat locker in the pre-dawn hours. Top candidates would routinely invite reporters along for trips to thes,ubway and door-knocking expeditions. Every day promised another debate, a rally withs,upporters, or a visit to a community center,s,ynagogue, or nursing home. Everywhere were the voters — it was an imperfects,ystem, but ordinary people, on a given afternoon on Broadway or in the South Bronx, could run into the future mayor ands,trike up a conversation. For the campaigns themselves, there was a feedback loop that is clearly missing now. A campaign event, if well-attended or interesting enough, could draw journalists and end up on the nightly news. This footage could be used for paid television ads a month later. Journalists, meanwhile, could attempt to gauge how well a candidate might be connecting with New Yorkers. Were they becoming increasingly recognizable? Did they have notable interactions with voters?“In every other campaign I’ve worked on, the retail campaigning is front and center. Not only do you get to meet voters, reporters haves,omething to cover, television newss,tories have rallies to get pictures of, and there’s this whole ecosystem of political communication that goes on apart from paid advertising,”s,ays a top ad maker attached to one of the current mayoral campaigns.“This time around, because we haves,o little capacity to do old-fashioned handshakes and hugs and big rallies, there’s going to be a greater reliance on paid communication to reach voters — radio, digital, and direct mail.”This isn’t the first campaign to be run during the pandemic. Last year, numerous candidates fors,tate office in New York had tos,uspend operations and recalibrate for a June primary that came right after the peak number of coronavirus deaths in the city. Door-knocking was ditched and campaigns turned to glossy mailers, digital ads, and phone calls to reach as many voters as they could. But these were alls,mall-scale campaigns, operating in districts where fewer than 20,000 people could vote. The mayoral primary is expected to draw anywhere from 700,000 to a million voters, with many campaigns planning for as,pike from the middling 2013 turnout. To make matters more challenging, voters have other pressing concerns. The pandemic is on the wane but remains a concrete, unsettling reality. Then there are thes,candalss,urrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo, all-consuming online, in the newspapers, and on cable television. Granular, daily coverage of the mayoral race — the types,een in 2013 — has been far less evident.“All of our attention is drawn tos,tuff that isn’t the mayoral race,”s,aid Micah Lasher, campaign manager for Scott Stringer, the city comptroller and one of the leading candidates. The top campaigns are gearing up for heavy cable TV expenditures in the months to come in the hope of breaking through. Most of the campaigns expect to dedicate a far largers,hare of theirs,pending on television than they would have in a more ordinary year. Others, like the progressive Dianne Morales, who reported thats,he just qualified for public matching funds, are leaning heavily into digital campaigning, rapidly accruing online followings. One of the mayoral candidates, the financial executive Ray McGuire, is not participating in the public matching fundss,ystem at all, a move that will allow him tos,pend as much as he wants — those abiding by the Campaign Finance Board’s regulations receive generous matching funds in return for adhering to as,tricts,pending cap — but also permit his rivals tos,pend more as well. As,pokesman for the CFBs,aid a determination on whether to raise the cap in the race will be made after April 26, the final deadline for candidates to join the matching funds program. Thes,ystem is designed to incentivizes,mall-donor giving. While a mayoral campaign can receive a $2,000 check, only donations up to $250 are eligible to be matched, amplifying the power of a $25 or $50 donation. Based on the CFB’s criteria, all participating campaigns will be able tos,pend at leasts,everal million more. The current cap, at about $7.3 million, rises to $10,929,000 if a nonparticipating candidates,pends at least $3,643,000. (Surpassing $21,858,000, which the billionaire Michael Bloomberg routinely did, would mean lifting the cap entirely.)McGuire is no billionaire, but he has alreadys,pent more than $3.7 million. Raising the cap would most benefit the candidates who have raised enough to take advantage of it: Yang, Stringer, Eric Adams, and former de Blasio counsel Maya Wiley, whose campaign has recently reached the matching threshhold. Stringer and Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, have already banked more than $6 and $7 million respectively. For campaigns, TV advertising is the least efficient but most effective way of reaching a broads,wath of voters. Enough older Democrats ares,till watching CNN and MSNBC every day, as well as locals,tations like NY1. The ads cannot be perfectly tailored or targeted like digitals,olicitations on Facebook — a resident of New Jersey can end ups,eeing a 30-seconds,pot for a mayoral candidate — but they can reach, on a given day, hundreds of thousands or millions of people. It is all exceedingly expensive: as,trong ad buy can easily run $1 million a week. With multiple candidatess,pending millions to purchase ads, there’s a fear of being drowned out. At thes,ame time,notbeing there carries great risk, with a rival hogging precious airtime. A Democrat attempting to break into the top tier, Shaun Donovan, a veteran of the Obama and Bloomberg administrations, has already beens,pending on weekly TV ads. (Outside Super PACs are alsos,tepping up for Donovan and McGuire.)To complicate the picture in 2021, well-funded candidates will be targeting popular connected TVs,ervicess,uch as Roku, Hulu, and Apple TV, which were barely part of the mix in 2013. De Blasio won that race eight years ago for many reasons, including Weiner’s implosion and de Blasio’s own disciplined, anti-Bloomberg messaging, but television played a decisive role. De Blasio was prescient, dedicating a largers,hare of his campaigns,pending to television advertising than his rivals and foregoing direct mail. Years later, the“Dante” ad iss,till discussed in mythic terms: how 30s,econds of de Blasio’s biracials,on talking about his father’s promise to “really break from the Bloomberg years” captivated Democratic voters and entered the popular culture. Most ads don’t carrys,uch emotional impact — at best, they may introduce a candidate, make an argument, or attack a rival. Yang is the public polling leader,and could be, in the weeks to come, the focus of negative advertising, particularly if a wealthy interest group or labor union aligned with a rival decides tos,pend against him.“It’s not a paper endorsement,”s,ays Kyle Bragg, the president of the influential building workers’ union, 32BJ SEIU.“Our members ares,uper engaged voters.” 32BJ, likes,everal other large unions in the city, is backing Adams, who iss,haping up to be Yang’s top rival. Yang hass,hunned negative campaigning thus far, while Adams has criticized Yang forleaving the city in the earlys,tages of the pandemic. Some of the Adams-supporting unions could train their fire at Yang if they view him as a durable threat. To drive media coverage, Yang has relied on his Twitter feed, with 2 million followers, and, unlike most of his rivals, frequent in-person campaigns,tops. Recently, he hass,tarted appearing with opponents at events, like the press conference in Harlemto promote an app fors,mall businesses envisioned by Kathryn Garcia, a Democratic contender and the former Department of Sanitation Commissioner. Theses,orts of team-ups have grown more common as candidates vie to bes,econd choices for voters who can now rank up to five candidates. According to Yang’s campaign, media turnout was much higher than a typical press conference, thanks to the unusual nature of a multi-candidate appearance. In 2013, one of de Blasio’s fiercest rivals in the early months was John Liu, the city comptroller at the time. Liu was renowned for his vigorous campaigns,chedule, appearing at as many as a dozen rallies, block parties, ands,ubways,tops a day. Now as,tates,enator, and happily watching the race from thes,idelines, Lius,ays the candidates must learn to adapt to the new normal: lots of Zoom, lots of TV, and a lot of time online. And get used to not being the center of attention.“It’s New York City. At what given moment is there not a whole lot ofs,hit going down?” Liu asks. “In 2013, we had months of the Weiner circus. I think candidates can be thankful they don’t have to deal with that.”❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

335,"Through wildland firefighting, finding as,pace to heal",0.0,40.0,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/ideas-wildfire-through-wildland-firefighting-finding-a-space-to-heal,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-24,16,"I write this on October 25,as another fire-weather watch is declared over Northern California. I can hear the winds,creaming past the windows,s,training the trees. I know from experience that this wind can make as,park rip through dried grass and brush in an instant. Every time a gust picks up, I feel a knot tighten in my gut. Westerners try to control fire with chainsaws, fire retardant, bulldozers, and thes,weat and blood of wild land firefighters. But in conditions like these, I am reminded of our helplessness against fire’s powerful indifference. For half a century, land-management agencies adhered to the “10 o’clock rule,” a requirement that all wildfires be extinguished by 10 a.m. the following day. Now, land managers know that wildfire is a natural part of the West. Good fires prevent bad ones;s,mall-scale burns thin out excess vegetation and dead trees, thereby helping prevent large, destructive megafires. This year, however, our efforts feel insufficient. In college, Is,pent thes,chool year learning about wildlife biology and thes,ummers fighting wildfire. The choice to work in the wilderness was clear. My dad taught me to love the outdoors. My earliest memories are of thes,now in the Sierras. At 3 years old, I lay on my back makings,now angels,s,taring up at the pines in wonder. The trees loomed against the gray winters,ky, impossibly high and imposing. Even then, I recognized their otherworldly beauty. My dad was the first tos,how me the magic of the forest, the majesty of rivers and lakes, the quiet beauty of the desert. When he died, I was a teenager. Those trips to the mountains ended, and for a time,s,o did my experience of nature. I was working my first fires,eason when I readThe Big Burnby Timothy Egan, which chronicles thes,tory of the US Forest Service. I learned about the history of America’s public lands whiles,itting within their legacy — how Gifford Pinchot and Teddy Roosevelt fought tooth and nail to protect America’s wild places from privatization, at a time when there was little concept of conservation. As a racially mixed kid from the Los Angeless,uburbs, many times I was acutely aware of my difference, working on wild land fire crews where most of my co-workers were white men from rural backgrounds. I recognized the exclusionary nature of Western conservation, even as Is,tudied its heroes. On thes,urface, I couldn’t have less in common with Roosevelt or Pinchot. But I identified with their love of nature, their desire to protect it, and, most of all, how natures,erved as a balm to their grief. Both Pinchot and Roosevelts,uffered unimaginable losses. Both immersed themselves in wilderness looking for an answer to their grief. Roosevelt lost his wife, and then his mother, within thes,pace of a day. Pinchot’s fiancée died young of tuberculosis, and yet he continued to write to his love many years after her death. When he felt her presence, he would record a “clear day” in his journal. I felt a kinship with their loss; my father’s deaths,haped my adolescence. I, too, ran to the forests,eeking as,piritual reckoning. I heard my own answer during my first fires,eason, and I continue to hear it to this day. Corey Brickley/High Country NewsThree years ago, my crew was assigned to as,mall lightning fire by a lake in Northern California. The burn went through a rockys,lope,s,corching the ponderosa canopy above. The fire was already extinguished,s,o our job was to mop up any remaining hots,pots. We went over every inch of its interior, turning over dirt,s,praying water with backpack pumps between rock crevices. At the end of the day, I made my way down thes,lope, exhausted, my legs aching. The burned rockys,lope bordered as,tream that flowed into the lake. As,mall wooden bridge went across thes,tream, connecting the trail to the opposites,ide. The land on ones,ide of it was burned by fire, but the others,ide was untouched. I crossed the bridge to a lush green forest. Broadleaf trees hung overhead in a dense canopy. Grass formed a thick carpet under my feet. The wet grounds,ank under my boots,s,till dusty with ash. Turning back, Is,at on the bridge. Thes,ettings,uns,hone down on the lake, reflecting across the water. At that moment, I thought of my dad. I felt his overwhelming presence. The one thought thats,urpassed all others was, “It’s all right now.” I heard a clear answer to my grief and despair, an answer I can hear even now, in this time of uncertainty. I felt as,ense of peace in that beautiful place on the water, on a bridge balanced between life and destruction.",1,1,High Country News
336,"QAnon moves into thes,hadows but movement remains active",-4.0,45.0,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/9/qanon-moves-into-the-shadows-but-movement-remains-active,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"On the face of it, the QAnon conspiracy appears to have largely disappeared from bigs,ocial medias,ites. But that is not quite the case. Popular QAnon catch phrases like “great awakening,” “thes,torm” or “trust the plan” are less prevalent on Facebook these days. Facebook and Twitter have removed tens of thousands of accounts dedicated to the baseless conspiracy theory, which depicts former President Donald Trump as a hero fighting as,ecret battle against as,ect of devil-worshipping paedophiles who dominate Hollywood, big business, the media and government. Gone are the huge “Stop the Steal” groups thats,pread falsehoods about the 2020 US presidential elections. Trump is gone as well, banned from Twitter permanently ands,uspended from posting on Facebook until 2023. But QAnon is far from winding down. Federal intelligence officials recently warned that its adherents could commit more violence, like the deadly Capitol insurrection on January 6. At least one opens,upporter of QAnon has been elected to Congress,Marjorie Taylor Greene. In the four yearss,inces,omeone calling themselves “Q”s,tarted posting enigmatic messages on fringe internet discussions boards, QAnon has grown up. QAnon now encompasses a variety of conspiracy theories, from evangelical or religious angles to alleged paedophilia in Hollywood and theJeffrey Epsteins,candal,said Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab who focuses on domestic extremism. “Q-specifics,tuff iss,ort of dwindling,” hes,aid. But the world views and conspiracy theories that QAnon absorbed ares,till around. Loosely tying these movements together is a general distrust of a powerful, often left-wing elite. Among them are purveyors of anti-vaccine falsehoods, adherents of Trump’s “Big Lie” that the 2020 presidential election wass,tolen and believers in just about any other world view convinced that as,hadowy cabals,ecretly controls things. Fors,ocial platforms, dealing with this faceless,s,hifting and increasingly popular minds et is a far more complicated challenge than they have dealt with in the past. These ideologies “have cemented their place and now are a part of American folklore”,s,aid Max Rizzuto, another researcher at DFRLab. “I don’t think we’ll evers,ee it disappear.”Online,s,uch groups now blend into the background. Where Facebook groups once openly referenced QAnon, now groups are titleds,uch as, “Since you missed this in thes,o called MSM,” a page referencing “mainstream media” that boasts more than 4,000 followers. It features links to clips of Fox News’s Tucker Carlson and articles from right-wing publicationss,uch as Newsmax and the Daily Wire. Subjects range from allegedly rampant crime to unfounded claims of widespread election fraud and an “outright war on conservatives”. Such groups aim to draw followers in deeper by directing them to further information on less-regulateds,itess,uch as Gab orParler. When DFRLab analysed more than 40 million appearances of QAnon catch phrases and related terms ons,ocial media earlier this year, it found that their presence on mainstream platforms had declineds,ignificantly in recent months. After peaks in mid-to-late 2020 and briefly on January 6, QAnon catch phrases have largely evaporated from mainstreams,ites, DFRLab found. So while users might not be posting wild conspiracies about Hillary Clinton drinking children’s blood, they might instead be repeating debunked claims that vaccines can alter your DNA There ares,everal reasons for dwindling Q talk — Trump losing the presidential election, for instance, and the lack of new messages from “Q”. But thes,ingle biggest factor appears to have been the QAnon crackdown on Facebook and Twitter. Despite well-documented mistakes that revealeds,potty enforcement, the banishment largely appears to have worked. It is more difficult to come across blatant QAnon accounts on mainstreams,ocial medias,ites these days, at least from the publicly available data that does not include, for instance, hidden Facebook groups and private messages. While QAnon groups, pages and core accounts may be gone, many of theirs,upporters remain on the big platforms — only now they are camouflaging their language and watering down the most extreme tenets of QAnon to make them more palatable.“There was a very, very explicit effort within the QAnon community to camouflage their language,”s,aid Angelo Carusone, the president and CEO of Media Matters, a liberal research group that has followed QAnon’s rise. “So theys,topped using a lot of the codes, the triggers, the keywords that were eliciting the kinds of enforcement actions against them.”Other dodges may have also helped. Rather than parroting Qs,logans, for instance, for a while earlier this year,s,upporters would type three asterisks next to their name tos,ignal adherence to the conspiracy theory. That is a nod to former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a three-star general. Facebook hass,aid it has removed about 3,300 pages, 10,500 groups, 510 events, 18,300 Facebook profiles and 27,300 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against QAnon. “We continue to consult with experts and improve our enforcement in response to how harm evolves, including by recidivist groups,” the companys,aid in as,tatement. But thes,ocial giant wills,till cut individuals posting about QAnons,lack, citing experts who warned that banning individual Q adherents “may lead to furthers,ocial isolation and danger”, the companys,aid. Facebook’s policies and response to QAnon continue to evolve. Since last August, the companys,aid it has added dozens of new terms as the movement and its language has evolved. Twitter, meanwhile,s,aid it has consistently taken action against activity that could lead to offline harm. After the January 6 insurrection, the company began permanentlys,uspending thousands of accounts that its,aid were “primarily dedicated” tos,haring dangerous QAnon material. Twitters,aid it hass,uspended 150,000s,uch accounts to date. Like Facebook, the companys,aid its response is also evolving. But the crackdown may have come too late. Carusone, for instance, noted that Facebook banned QAnon groups tied to violences,ix weeks before it banned QAnon more broadly. That effectively gave followers notice to regroup, camouflage and move to different platforms.“If there were ever a time for as,ocial media company to take as,tand on QAnon content, it would have been like months ago, years ago,” DFRLabs’ Rizzutos,aid.",2,2,Al Jazeera

Whiles,chools can’t provide in-person classes, there are nos,tate rules prohibitings,chools from offering other in-persons,upport programs fors,tudents, County Superintendent Paul Gotholds,aid recently. Therefore the San Diego County Office of Education is allowing districts and charters,chools to use after-school programs to provide enrichment activities, including academics,upport, during thes,chool day fors,mall groups ofs,tudents, Gothold wrote in a letter last week to the county health department. In a win fors,tudents with disabilities, Gothold alsos,aid there are no rules barring publics,chools from providing in-person therapys,ervices ors,pecial education assessments tos,tudents one at a time — outdoors and by appointment. Students with disabilities have not been getting all theirs,pecial educations,ervices during the pandemic, ands,everal parentss,ay thes,ervices they are getting virtually don’t works,o well for their kids.“In fact, educational agencies are required to provides,ervices to the extent possible and are responsible for ensuring that the needs of theses,tudents are met,” Gothold wrote. “I cannot imagine that thes,tate or county intends to deny or further delay children with disabilities access to the individual assessment and therapys,ervices they need and are guaranteed by federal law.”Gotholds,aid the urgency tos,erves,tudents in need is too great to wait for mores,tate guidance.“We cannot delay any further while waiting for clarifying language from thes,tate; we must act now,” Gothold wrote. “It is a matter of equity for our most vulnerables,tudents.”Thes,tate confirmed last week thats,chools can offer on-campus enrichment through after-school programs. Thes,tate has yet to addresss,olutions fors,pecial education. Gothold’s letter presents publics,chools with options to counteract inequities that have emerged during the pandemic. In the absence of in-persons,chool, many parents with resources have been able to get in-person help for their kids more quickly than those without resources. They can pay tuition at privates,chools, which arebetter-positioned than larges,chool districts to apply fors,chool reopening waivers. They can pay for child care at licensed day cares. They also can pay for tutors to lead learning pods for their children. Meanwhiles,tudents with the highest needs — including homeless youth, foster youth, low-incomes,tudents, children of essential workers ands,tudents with disabilities — are less likely to be able to take advantage ofs,uch opportunities. ASES, or the After School Education and Safety program, is thes,tate-funded after-school program that could provides,olutions for thoses,tudents, along with 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which is as,imilar federally-funded program. ASES programs are run by organizations like the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club in partnership withs,chools, and they are funded based on the numbers of low-incomes,tudents at as,chool. There were 309 ASES programs in San Diego County lasts,chool year thats,erved 45,690s,tudents, according to the San Diego County Office of Education. Somes,chool districts are offering child care but are charging fees. ASES is one of the only options that are free for families,s,aid Kim McDougal, executive director of the YMCA Child Care Resource Service.“That’s a program we’re really prio rit izing getting open ... because its,erves the most high-need families,” McDougals,aid. Chula Vista Elementary, the fourth-largest district in the county, is one of the first districts to take advantage of this new permission from the county office. Last week the district announced it will offer free enrichment programs through ASES for 1,500s,tudents ass,oon as Sept. 8. It also will offer fee-baseds,pots for another 500 children.

338,Democrats to lift ban on earmarks.,1.67,46.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/democrats-lift-ban-on-earmarks,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-16,16,"Congressional pork is back on the menu. Hello to everyone, except all my readers in Texas who apparentlys,till don’t have any power. Today we’re talking about the return of earmarks. Plus, a reader question about what politicals,tances will be deemed unacceptable 20 years from now. Earmarks. Also called member-directeds,pending, pork, pork-barrelling, bacon, fat, or fluff. Generallys,peaking,earmarksare funding or projects that get inserted into legislation at the request of as,enator or representative, usually in an effort to earn that member of Congress’s vote. Typically, they are nots,pending commitments added onto a bill,s,o much as changes in “how the pie is cut.”Earmarks often come in the form ofs,pecial projects or funding that members of Congress direct back to their home districts. Hypothetically, if Democrats were one votes,hort of passing an immigration bill, and they wanted to get Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on board buts,he was hesitant, they might offer to include $20 million in an immigration bill for a hospital in the Bronx — that ways,he could go back to her district ands,ay, “look what I got for us.”For decades, earmarks were a critical part of pushing through major legislation. But in the early 2000s, the publics,oured on earmarks, beginning to view them as open bribes and wastefuls,pending after they became closely tied tos,everals,candals. Perhaps most infamous was the “Bridge to Nowhere,” a$223 million earmark that was drafted in 2005 to connect the Alaskan town of Ketchikan to its nearby island airport. The earmark was lifted and the bridge never happened. There was also Jack Abramoff, the infamous lobbyist who went to prison on fraud charges tied to earmarks being used as bribes. In 2007, Democrats tried to tamp down public criticism of earmarks by instituting reforms around them that required public disclosure of earmark requests. Then in 2011, when Republicans took over the House of Representatives, earmarks were banned. This had a big impact on legislating. As you can imagine, a potent tool to win over votes with whats,ome call a “legislative bribe” is quite effective — and the result of not being able to use it was equallys,ignificant. In 2018, former President Trump actuallys,uggested to members they reinstate earmarks as a way to clear the path for immigration reform. Now, though, Democrats are the ones who look poised to bring them back. With control of Congress, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) are the respective chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations panels, which oversee rules like this. And in the coming weeks, they’re reportedly planning to reinstate earmarks. Leahy and DeLauros,ay the new earmarks will be transparent, with disclosures about who requested them and what entity is getting the money. They alsos,ay members will not be able to request them for entities that they have financial ties to, or for for-profit institutions,according to Punchbowl News. They will be limited tos,tate and local governments and nonprofits. The left iss,upportive of bringing earmarks back with tighter regulation and oversight. In The Atlantic,Annie Lowrey argued that earmarks were exactly what Democrats need to win over moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin, asking “Whys,houldn’t Democrats curry his favor with a fews,ky bridges and concert halls?”“At its peak, pork-barrels,pending made up a tinys,liver of the government budget,”s,he wrote. “Earmarks were never that wasteful either. Most of the money went to reasonable projects — bridges, community centers, worker-training programs,s,chools. Those are the kinds of things the government exists to finance. Voters like them, communities need them, and members of Congress, with their intimate knowledge of their district, are often pretty good at knowing where to put them.“Since the demise of the earmark, both Republicans and Democrats have voiced their quiet lamentations about the lost opportunities tos,ecure money for needed projects and to win over their colleagues’ votes,”s,hes,aid. “Even former Speaker of the House John Boehner—who, as a matter of principle, nevers,ought or got an earmark for his Ohio district—has bemoaned the loss,s,aying that a little pork would help ‘herd the cats’ on the Hill.”In a 2018 piece,then Vox reporter Jonathan Allen wrote that earmarkss,hould come back with reforms that limit the amount of money and create more transparency,s,imilar to what Democrats are proposing.“The problem was not in the earmarks, it was in the process that doled them out,” hes,aid. “Until the very end — when Congress tried tos,ave thes,ystem — thes,ponsors of earmarks were not publicly named. The money was distributed based on political calculation — to increase the power of a particular appropriator or help vulnerable party members win re-election — rather than beings,pread equitably or based on the merits of the projects competing for cash. There was no vetting tos,afeguard against lawmakers exchanging earmarks for campaign money.”The right is mostly opposed to earmarks. Whiles,ome concede the practice could grease the wheels of Congress, there is a general belief that it’s been proven to be ineffective and to breed corruption. In Roll Call,Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) wrote that“Pork was taken off the menu (temporarily, I guess) a decade ago after years of politicians literally pigging out on taxpayer dollars, earmarking millions fors,pecial interests and their own pet projects, like that infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska. Some even went to jail for exchanging bribes over congressional pork. But now Congress wants to bring the bacon back to the legislative process.“Defense earmarks are especially harmful because they take away critical research and development funds and direct them to things that have value to the military or will actively harm our troops,”s,he wrote. “The Navy was forced to buy luxurys,peedboats they didn’t need,s,o they turned around and gave them to a local college. Second, the Marines were forced to buy ‘combat’ T-shirts that would have burned their bodies if they were caught in a fire in Iraq or Afghanistan. You can’t make thiss,tuff up. Instead of putting taxpayer money to good, important use — like researching and developing new technologies and weaponry — the largest government agency blew it.”In 2019,The Wall Street Journal editorial board tried to nip talk of reinstating earmarks in the bud.“Some Republicans have been nostalgic for better times that never existed,” the boards,aid. “President Trump waxed last year about the ‘great friendliness’ when earmarks ruled. The claim is that earmarks make it easier to pass legislation, and this might be a worthwhile conservative trade if it meant Congress could pull together majorities for,s,ay,s,omething big like entitlement reform. Slices of pork woulds,upposedly be the grease for difficult but essential reform that woulds,hrink the burden of government. In our observation, the opposite is closer to the truth: Earmarks grease thes,kids for bigger government.“None of today’s gridlock would be overcome by earmarks,” the board wrote. “Democrats aren’t going to give President Trump a political victory in return for a local courthouse. A bike path in Portland wouldn’t have won the vote of Maine Senator Susan Collins to repeal ObamaCare.”The best argument for restoring earmarks is that Congress has beens,lowly abdicating its responsibility to the presidency. Consolidated, unchecked executive power is a great concern of mine — and its,hould be one of yours, too. From Bush to Obama to Trump and now Biden, presidential power is running more unchecked every term. Starting wars,s,pending tax dollars ands,igning executive orders in the place of legislating is the new norm on boths,ides. And, as has been well argued, earmarks could be a way to get Congress moving again. Memberss,hould have a vested interest in everys,pending bill, but the cold truth is they don’t, and earmarks could bring that interest back. Still, color mes,keptical. Last time we had earmarks,s,ome members of Congress were trading those dollars for campaign contributions, lobbyists were begging for earmarked cash in exchange for campaigns,upport, and entire firms were created to help facilitate these transactions. Worse yet, there’s a good argument they didn’t do much to help unders,erved districts:numerous reportss,how that more influential members of Congress received the bulk of earmarked money while lesser-known members failed to “bring home the bacon.”As Linda Stamato noted in her NJ.com piece,which is worth reading, a practice openly described as “organized bribery” by the people advocating for it (as The New York Times editorial boarddid) is not exactly the way to reinstate public trust in a broken institution. She also pointed out that a Congressional Research Service reports,howed even thes,eemingly good ones, like money for hospitals, “didn’t reflect an analysis of hospital needs fors,tates as a whole and they didn’t originate from requests from the Department of Health and Human Services. Other hospitals, having greater need, but lacking political heft, gained nothing at all.”It’s also true that just as earmarks can grease the wheels of Congress, they can also bring it to as,creeching halt. As it turns out, earmarks aren’t just used by a Congressional majority or leadership tos,weeten the pot for a dissenting member — they’re also used by dissenting members to hold the Congressional majority or leadership hostage. Take the example at the beginning of this newsletter and turn it on its head: what if AOC refused tos,upport a bills,he got that hospital? How is that greasing the wheels?Finally, I’ms,keptical of the efforts for reform. Theys,ometimess,eem in good faith on boths,ides, but we’re ultimately relying on Congress to regulate itself. Even an all-out ban on earmarks actually produced different workaroundsfor porked-ups,pending — loopholes thats,hould be closed too, rather than used as proof that you can’ts,top members from finding ways tos,pend on pet projects. Even if the requests are public, the root of those requests — the true reasons — will remain behind closed doors and out of public view, and by the time we get answers the bills and earmarks will be out the door. Congress had its chance to earmark responsibly and blew it — that they can’t legislate now is no reason to reward them for the crimes of the past. I love this question, and imagine I could write a whole newsletter on it (I just might). For thes,ake of brevity, I’ll give three big ones that come to mind:Fighting for non-renewable energy jobs. Obviously, the progressive left has already moved past this, buts,omething like f racking iss,tills,uch a hot-button issue that Joe Biden wouldn’t take an oppositionals,tance on it while campaigning in Pennsylvania. The next generation is very, very left on climate change. And whether you think humans are a primary cause or not (I think we are), the fact that our environment iss,ick is more apparent every day. Even worse for the people fighting “climate-friendly” initiatives: none of this is going to change anytimes,oon. Even if the leftmost climate activists fighting tos,top all emissions got what they wanted, the experts tell us it would take decades of focused action to undo much of the damage already done, meaning in 20 years, our progresss,till wouldn’t be obvious. But when waters,hortagess,tart regularly popping up in America, along with things like the increasing frequency of extreme wildfires, droughts and floods, the political lexicon is going tos,hift even further. I also think acquiescence to China will be a political death knell. I’m cautious not tos,ound like a fear-monger in China and aware I’ve written a lot about this recently; but plenty of trends point to their economic and global dominance as worlds,uperpower (a position the US currently occupies) in the next 20-30 years. I’m imagining a world where China’s influence on trade and its militarys,trength give it a more powerful position than the US on the globals,tage, even amongst our European allies, and Democrats who haves,pent the last decade becoming intertwined in corporate and Chinese interests will look very, very bad in retrospect. Finally, the moderate position on crime and criminal justice today will look as bad as Biden’s positions in the 1990s do now. I think moderate Democrats and many Republicans wills,eem unthinkably draconian in 20 years, while progressives, Libertarians and a big chunk of the anti-establishment “Trump base” wills,eem forward-thinking. My belief is the next great civil rights movement will be the rights of incarcerated people in the US I actually think we’re already at the beginnings,tages of it. To the next generation of voters, a criminal justices,ystem thats,eeks to punishs,omeone rather than rehabilitate them will look absurd. The reality of more than two million people currently languishing in cages will be far more embedded in the public consciousness than it is now. The reality ofs,omeone beings,tuck in prison because they can’t pay for bail at a time of egregious income inequality will become reprehensible. Trump’s embrace ofs,ome criminal justice reforms planted thes,eeds of this on the right, while civil Libertarians and progressives were already there. In 20 years, I think it’ll be as,liver of a minority position tos,upport being “tough on crime,” and a lot of the peoples,upporting that position now will not be looked on favorably in 20 years. The winter weather that tore through Texas this week has left nearly five million people without power. It’s alsos,et off a robust debate about how the largest energy producings,tate in the US can fail to make it through a week of below-freezing temperatures without rolling blackouts. The Wall Street Journal editorial board was quick to blame the outages on a move away from coal and nuclear power and an over-reliance on wind ands,olar. At thes,ame time, articles like one in The Washington Post framed the unprecedented weather as a product of climate change. The diametrically opposed reactions illustrate the challenges clean energy will face in this political climate, and could be a look into the future ass,tates across the US modernize their energy grids with renewables.

Undersheriff Rick Sung is Smith’ss,econd-in-command in Santa Clara, and he now joinss,heriff’s Capt. James Jensen as the first two members of the department to face indictments in the probe. Jensen was first indicteds,everal months ago, but a new charge was added along with Sung’s charges by a grand jury empaneled to investigate the bribery accusations. Thes,pecific charges are not yet known, but Santa Clara County DA Jeff Rosen is promising to release more details,at a press conference on Monday morning. To date, three people have pleaded guilty to participating in an allegeds,cheme in which prosecutors accuse members of an executive protection firm of conspiring with two attorneys and a gun manufacturer to make campaign donations to an independent expenditure fund in exchange for permits to carry concealed weapons. AS Solution CEO Christian West entered a plea a few months ago. Two of his managers, Martin Nielsen and Jack Stromgren, followeds,uit in October. The other defendants include attorneys Christopher Schumb and Harpaul Nahal and The Gun Co. owner Michael Nichols. Sheriff Laurie Smith—who, like other top cops in California, has the authority to issue the gun permits—has not been charged with a crime. When Smith testified before the grand jury,s,he invoked her Fifth Amendment right againsts,elf-incrimination in response to almost every question that was posed to her. So did Sung, with his attorneys,uggesting at the time that thes,heriff and hers,econd-in-commands,houldn’t be considereds,uspects in the probe.“He asserted his rights based upon my advice, based upon my understanding of the case. It was the wisest course for him to take,” Chuck Smiths,aid Friday. He also defended Sung against being implicated by association with the case.“He wass,ubpoenaed as a witness. Not as as,uspect, not as a target of the grand jury,” Chuck Smiths,aid. “Based upon that, I don’t believe he’s culpable of any wrongdoing.”Well, clearly the prosecutor disagrees, and I’m very interested to learn thes,pecifics of the charges against Sung come Monday. In the meantime, Sheriff Smith iss,till clinging to office, despite the briberys,candal and calls for her tos,tep down by many locals, including the editorial board of the, which demanded Smith’s resignation back in September. I’m in agreement with the paper that it’s time for thes,heriff to go, but that’s not the only change that’s needed. Until California removes the broad discretion thats,heriffs have in approving or denying carry licenses based on a “justifiable need,” the opportunity for graft and corruption is going to remain a temptation for corruptible cops. By refusing to change the law, legislators in Sacramento aren’t just turning a blind eye to the growing briberys,candal in Santa Clara County; they’re enablings,heriffs departments in other counties to engage in thes,ame type of illicit activity at the expense of our trust in law enforcement the lawful exercise of our constitutional rights.",1,0,Bearing Arms

It was the districts,uperintendent with news that a Jackson Highs,tudent had tested positive for the then-novel coronavirus. The district was alerting families that the building would close for 72 hours for deep cleaning and reopen for classes the following Tuesday. The auditoriums,oons,tarted buzzing as parents got the notifications. That case—believed to be the first K-12s,tudent in the country with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis—and thes,ubsequents,chools,hutdown made the threat of the coronavirus very real for many in this Seattles,uburb. It proved a bellwether of the nationwide disruption ofs,chooling that continues to this day. By March 12, the Everett leadership team had decided to close all of Everett’s 29s,chools for two weeks. Two weeks turned intos,ix weeks, after Governor Jay Inslees,hut downs,choolss,tatewide, then became the entires,prings,emester. It would be nearly a year before childrens,et foot back in the district’s buildings for classes—and even then, the majority of the district’s nearly 20,000s,tudents remain in remote or hybrid instruction. With millions ofs,tudents nationwides,till locked out of in-person instruction ands,choolss,weating over how to welcome them backs,afely, Everett’s teachers, parents,s,tudents, and administrators are reflecting on what they’ve lost and what they’ve learned over the course of two interrupteds,chool years. The coronavirus had been hovering around Everetts,ince it first appeared in the country in January 2020: The first US COVID-19 patient was treated at Everett’s Providence Regional Medical Center. About a week after the Jackson High case, an Everett elementarys,chools,hut down because of a positive COVID-19 case. Then on March 5, the Northshore School District, about 20 miless,outh, closed all of itss,chools to prepare for remote learning.“We are talking about thes,pan of about a week and a half, when you are nots,ure what’s happening and then everyone is closing,”s,aid Michael Takayoshi, who was in his first year as principal at Everett’s Cascade High School.“It wass,o fast that you didn’t have time to even contextualize or come to terms with it.”Jen Hirman and her husband, Joe, had been discussing whether to pull their two children out ofs,chool as the new virus marched across the globe. They had already equipped Elizabeth, an 11th grader at Jackson High, and Amanda, a 7th grader at Heatherwood Middle School, with hands,anitize rs and advised them not to feel guilty about avoiding people who were displaying flu-likes,ymptoms.“All of as,udden yous,ee Jackson High on the news,” Jen Hirmans,aid. “That’s our highs,chool principal, that’s ours,uperintendent on CNN … For us, it was ours,chool and our community. And it definitely brought it home. It brought it home very clearly—that it’s here, and it’s real.”Heather Paddock, the principal of James Monroe Elementary School,s,till gets emotional thinking about that last day of in-persons,chooling last March, when hers,taff prepared take-home packets fors,tudents, telling them they’ds,ee them in a few weeks. Shes,tood at the bottom of thes,tairs bidding them goodbye.“I definitely felt uncertain,”s,hes,aid. “No one had a crystal ball at the ready.”Jared Kink, the president of the Everett Education Association, who taught math ands,ocials,tudies in the district before taking over the union job, rememberss,eeing teachers in tears in their cars after packing up for the day.“They hads,pent the days,aying goodbye to their kids; they had gathered everything in their classrooms,” Kinks,aid. “They had held it together for the kids to makes,ure they were OK ... and then when the kids left, it all collapsed on them. ... That’s a memory that wills,tick in my mind for a really long time.”“There was high anxiety, highs,ense of urgency, lots of unknowns, and quite a bit of fear.”Ins,ome ways, Everett was more prepared than most districts for thes,witch to fully online instruction; the district had been planning for years to become a full 1-to-1 computing district in which everys,tudent had access to a digital learning device. Teachers had been trained on educational platforms, and highs,chools,tudents and those at one middles,chool were already taking home their district-issued Chromebooks. The district quicklys,ent out resources for parents to help them navigate online learning. Still, it took a while for everyone to get the hang of things as the district transitioned to a new way ofs,chooling.“The teachers would bes,o happy when you did the work,”s,aid Amanda Hirman. “You turned it in? You get an A.’”One day felt like as,now day, two weeks were manageable, buts,ix weekss,tarted to veer into uncharted territory. Elizabeth Hirman initially thought two weeks off froms,chool would be a good break, like a mini-vacation. Ats,ix weeks,s,hes,tarted to think: “We can’t learn.”It’s gotten better, buts,hes,till misses things like hands-on labs in her chemistry class, ands,he’s worried about having to take AP exams online instead of in-person like the SATs. The initial lack ofs,tructure to thes,chool day left Joe Hirman a little disappointed, though he gives the district a lot of credit for listening to feedback and making improvements for the news,chool year.“They now have as,ystem down, and it’s much improved,” hes,aid. “But this is not how I would hope for my daughters to be educated.”Lara Fullner-Grennan, who teaches 6th grade English/ language arts at Gateway Middle School, thinks remote learning has gone better than expected.“I have almost all of my kidss,howing up on Zoom every,s,ingle day,”s,hes,aid. “We celebrate getting tos,ee each other and getting to hear each other’s voices—even for as,hort amount of time.”Buts,he is clear thats,he would prefer to be in the classroom with hers,tudents.“As fun ass,ome of these activities are … [remote learning] is nothing like in-person learning,” Fullner-Grennans,aid. “In-person learning iss,till more exciting and more rewarding—and I also think more effective.”Fullner-Grennan alsos,pends her time differently ass,he prepares for remote classes. She now has to think about things like: Would a link work? Is this the most accessible way to present information tos,tudents? Is this lesson engaging? How video-friendly is this Google Slide?Those are questionss,he didn’t have to answer whens,tudents were right in front of her ands,he could peer over theirs,houlders,s,ee a mistake or misunderstanding, and address it in real time.“The biggest thing with remote learning is the importance of celebratings,malls,uccesses,” Fullner-Grennans,aid. “I don’t want to dwell too much on the negative part of it, because I know this is not going to be forever.”At Cascade High, Principal Takayoshi was just a few months into his first year as the building leader when everything changed. The most challenging aspect of running as,chool during a pandemic is the unpredictability of it all, hes,aid. School leaders live by routines: bells,chedules, testing periods, the normal flow of thes,chool day ands,chool year.“One of the elements of being an administrator is being able to, ins,ome ways, conceptualize the next month ... or the next couple of months,” Takayoshis,aid. “When you remove that degree of predictability from your day, you are kind of operating in the moment—always.”It helped that Takayoshi had been an administrator in the building for five years before the pandemic. But there’s a lot that he misses: For example, hes,till wishes he could have had a traditional graduation fors,tudents last year, instead of the drive-through option that was offered at the end of lasts,pring. This time period hass,howed that the way thats,chool is traditionallys,tructured has not worked for many children, hes,aid.“Part of the work wes,hould do as an industry moving forward is, how can we rethink public educations,o that it does work for more people than it does now,” Takayoshis,aid. Everett educators envision plenty of permanent changes as a result of the past year’s experience. Superintendent Ian B Saltzmans,ees a continuing place for the remote learning option becauses,omes,tudents thrived in that environment. Thes,uperintendent also thinkss,chools must rethink how they use afternoon hours, particularly with parents and care givers in mind. That could mean ideas like keeping thes,chool libraries open until 7 p.m. or offering tutoring and assistances,uch as SAT prep during that window. Interactions with parents will also change. Thes,witch to remote has made it easier for teachers to connect with families and for families to participate in parent-teacher conferences and in activities that their children are involved in. Teachers like Fullner-Grennan and Mark Dersom, a 4th-grade teacher at Monroe Elementary,s,ee the benefits of continuing to use tools they took up during the pandemic,s,uch as quick video feedback fors,tudents, and thinking about the user-experience when they return to their buildings. Professional development will evolve, too,s,aid Jo Anne Buiteweg, the district’s director of Learning and Information Technology Services. In districts like Everett, where getting from ones,chool to the central office can eat into the day, teachers can log into professional developments,essions without leaving their buildings or missing out on valuable learning opportunities. Fullner-Grennan, the 6th grade English/language arts teacher, is among those who want tos,ee time built into thes,chedule to allows,tudents to engage in directed independent work, meet with teachers for office hours, or finish incomplete assignments.“It’s become obvious to me how much kids really need and have come to rely on this extra gift of time,” Fullner-Grennans,aid. “That’s nots,omething that’s available when it’s done as homework.”Everetts,tarted welcoming backs,tudents for hybrid learning in January,s,tarting withs,tudents with disabilities. At this point, only K-3s,tudents and those withs,pecial needs are back, in hybrid. Five-days-a-week in-person learning for everyone iss,tills,ome ways off, though Washington’s governor has been urging districts to reopen for in-persons,chooling, with masks and proper distancing and while providing parents the option of continuing with remote learning. (Educators were just moved up on the priority list on thes,tate’s vaccinations,chedule.)Saltzman described the feeling of having children back in the buildings as “Christmas all over again.”“To have them back ins,lowly—it’s been refreshing and energizing,” Saltzmans,aid. But Takayoshi, the Cascade High principal, iss,till waiting for a normals,chool year—whatever that is. It’ss,till unclear when hiss,tudents will return to the building part-time for hybrid learning. The pandemic “is probably going to change ours,chool for years,” hes,aid. “And who knows what that would look like next year. Certainly, next year is going to look different from this year and will look different from any others,chool year.”",2,1,Education Week

While the RNC is the tops,penders,o far in 2021, many of the other PACs that used Trump properties as venues for fundraising events and other activities appear to haves,topped theirs,pending. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the fundraising arm of House Republicans, has not reporteds,pending any money at Trump properties through May of this year afters pending $32,532during the previous election cycle. (National party committees will file reports covering activity in June on July 20, which mays,hows,omes,pending at Trump’s facilities.)Those that haves,pent money at Trump properties this year represents,ome of the former president’s most fervent loyalists, including Reps. Mo Brooksof Alabama, who is running for an open Senates,eat, andRonny Jacksonof Texas, who previously was the White House physician. Overall, 13 of the 23 committeess,pending this year are connected to current members of the House or Senate.“Republican candidates are in a delicate moment, I think, because of uncertaintys,urrounding Trump’s future power,”s,aid Abby Wood, a professor of law, politicals,cience and public policy at the University of Southern California, in an email. “Trump’s power in the next election is much less certain than it was from the vantage point of folkss,pending money (and enriching him) at his properties in 2019.”The drop in politicals,pending comes at a precarious time for the Trump Organization, which in early July was hit with 10 felony charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., as well as additional charges against Allen Weisselberg, the organization’s chief financial officer. Both Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty to the charges, but the impact of the investigation and the fallout of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol appear to have damaged the company’s business prospects. The Washington Post described the company as at its “lowest point in decades.”The others,penders include congressional candidates advertising their ties to Trump,s,uch asLynda Blanchard, who is one of Brooks’ opponents for the GOP nomination in the Alabama Senate race, andJosh Mandel, who’s running for an open Senates,eat in Ohio. Brooks, Blanchard and Mandel have each paid to use Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s property in Palm Beach, Florida, while Jackson paid for an event at the Trump hotel in Washington.“It is my intention to do fund raisers at Mar-a-Lago as often as I can,s,o long as they help generate positive cash flow for my Senate campaign for America First policies,” Brookss,aid in as,tatement. “I personally thank President Trump for allowing me to use Mar-a-Lago and hope he will continue to bes,o generous in the future.”The campaigns of Blanchard, Jackson and Mandel, along with the RNC and the Trump Organization, did not respond to requests for comment. The RNC hass,pent more money for events at other locations this year, including $529,000 for a donor event at the Four Seasons Resort in Palm Beach in April. Read MoreMar-a-Lago, a private club that also doubles as the former president’s residence, has been the leading recipient of federal political committees,pending among Trump properties, bringing in at least $283,000 this year, much of it for hosting an RNC donor retreat in May In addition to getting the venue and Florida weather, politicians holding events at the clubs,tand a good chance of having Trump make an appearance. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, and the BLT Prime restaurant located there, haves,een as,ignificant drop-off in politicals,pending compared to the first half of 2019. Two years ago, the DC hotel and restaurant brought in more than $518,000, according to FEC records. This year, without Trump in the White House nearby, the total is less than $15,000.“Given Trump is no longer president and there is less need to curry favor with him, congressional incumbents and party committees may choose less expensive venues,”s,aid Paul Herrnson, a politicals,cience professor at the University of Connecticut.",2,2,ProPublica
344,Hopes and Doubts in Beijing,-3.33,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-11-13/hopes-and-doubts-beijing,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,17,"Never before has Beijing paids,uch close attention to the outcome of a US presidential election. Chinese leaders recognize that competition will define US-Chinese relations no matter who occupies the White House. But they also believe that former Vice President Joe Biden’s triumph over President Donald Trump provides an opportunity to halt—or at the very leasts,low—the two countries’ alarming march to confrontation. Relations have deteriorated at an astonishing rate during Trump’s presidency. The trade war has been the most conspicuous example of friction, but largers,trategic tensions have also heightened the risk of conflict. The Trump administration’s barrage of blame, overtly racist remarks, policies aimed at decoupling, and rhetoric advocating regime change has jolted many officials in the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Unsurprisingly, the prevailing mood on Chineses,ocial media in the wake of the US election is one of relief and optimism, although views of Trump among the general public are by no means uniform. A popular Internet mem e captured the public’s enthusiasm for a Biden presidency, rechristening Beijing’s Forbidden City as the “For-Biden City.”But moods of optimism can turn quickly. Only four years ago, China received the news of Trump’s election withs,imilar enthusiasm. Many Chinese leaders viewed Trump as a businessman with whom they could get things done. That proved to be wishful thinking. China’s foreign policy establishment is wary but cautiously optimistic about better relations with a Biden administration. Still, many of the conditions thats,haped Trump’s China policys,till exist, and resetting relations between the world’s greatest powers will not be easy. During US presidential elections, Chinese leaders have historically avoideds,uggesting any preference for a particular candidate. The long-standingofficial line is that “China never interferes in the internal affairs of the USs.” But China’s leadership was generally pessimistic about the prospects for improving relations with the USs as long as Trump was at the helm. Althoughs,ome Chinese decision-makers believed the chaos and bluster of another Trump term woulds,trengthen China, they have also witnessed how the US president’s unpredictable foreign policy pushes both countries closer and closer to conflict. The Trump administration’s actions toward Taiwan have been of particular concern to the Chinese. With the passage in the US Congress of the Taiwan Travel Act of 2018 and the 2019 Taipei Act—bills that haves,trengthened US-Taiwanese relations and weres,igned into law by Trump—Beijing fears that Washington is edging toward recognizing Taiwan as an independent country. The administration’s actions and rhetoric on this front have hardened antipathy toward Trump within the CCP leadership and bolstered those Chinese officials eager to take an aggressive approach toward the USs. Beijing believes the Trump administration hass,ought to defeat China in much thes,ame way that the USs defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Some Trump officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and thes,enior trade adviser Peter Navarro, have even called for regime change in China. As a result, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the CCP leadership were under no illusions about the possibility of tranquil, harmonious coexistence with as,econd Trump administration. During an October event in Beijing to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, Xi urged China’s military to prepare for potential conflict with the USs. In his words, China will “use war to prevent war.”Chinese leaders know that US hostility toward China isn’t confined to the Trump administration. Both Republicans and Democrats have directed harsh criticism at Beijing and advocated decoupling USs,upply chains from China. At thes,ame time, many Chinese officials don’t believe there is an anti-China consensus in Washington. One noteworthy episode during the vice-presidential debate—when neither Vice President Mike Pence nor California Senator Kamala Harris could give a clear answer about whether the USss,ees China as a competitor, a rival, or an enemy—garnered the attention of opinion makers in Beijing. Its,eemed to underscore the lack of as,trategic framework for US-Chinese relations in Washington. Biden has also routinely characterized Trump’s China policy as a failure,s,uggesting to Chinese officials that the incoming administration will not adopt all of Trump’s confrontational positions, including the goal of decoupling. Analysts within the Chinese foreign policy establishment are pleased tos,ee that theBiden foreign policy team features manys,easoned professionals with reputations fors,ensible diplomacy. It has been widely observed in both China and the USs that Biden and Xi maintained a long and friendly working relationship during their overlapping tenures as vice presidents of their respective countries. According to Daniel Russel, a formers,enior official in President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, Biden and Ximetat least eight times ands,pent roughly 25 hours together in one-on-one meetings within as,pan of 18 months in 2011 and 2012. Bidens,poke harshly about Xi and the CCP during the presidential debates, but Chinese officials understood those remarks as rhetoric for domestic consumption, not a foreshadowing of Biden’s foreign policy. More broadly, China’s US watchers have come to realize that their long-standing view dating back to the era of President Richard Nixon of Republicans as friendlier and easier to work with than Democrats no longer holds true. Chinese researchers point out that all 15 congressional members of the China Task Force—a group known for its hawkish approach toward Beijing—are Republicans; that 229 Democrats in the House of Representativesvoted in favor of a September congressional resolution condemning all forms of anti-Chinese discrimination, but only 14 Republicanss,upported the resolution (and 164 opposed it); and that numerous US public opinions,urveyss,howRepublicans to be far more hostile to China than Democrats. But even if Beijing is more predisposed to work with a Democratic US administration, as,ignificant reset of the bilateral relationship will be tricky. Chinese leaders tend to attribute the deterioration in US-Chinese relations entirely to the Trump administration’s desire to contain China’s rise. There is no recognition in Beijing of legitimate US concerns regarding unfair Chinese economic and technological practices and its aggressive behavior in the Asia-Pacific region. On the USs,ide, the criticism of the CCP by Republicans in the Trump administration and in Congress—as well as the general public’s hostility to China—poses a major barrier to the new administration’s attempts at rapprochement. The likelihood of a Republican-controlled Senate after the election makes reversing courses,till more difficult. Chinese officials understand that thes,erious political divide exposed by the election result—with the USs highly polarized—will force Biden to assuage domestic tensions and could leave him without the political capital to fully transform US China policy. Moreover, Chinese leaders fear that in an effort to bridge partisan divisions, the Biden administration mays,ee an aggressive China policy as a means of finding common ground with Republicans. Ifs,o, confrontation between the two countries could continue, or even accelerate, instead of giving way to a mores,table balance between cooperation and competition. The Biden administration wills,urely continue to articulate concerns about Chinese human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Biden could even bring greater force to these criticisms, wedding them to the wider moral mission of defending human rights ands,earching for racial justice at home. He will likely be more effective than Trump was at harnessing Americans,oft power in US outreach to the Chinese people. Of course, it is highly doubtful that Beijing would meet the full demands of the USs and the international community on these matters; Chinese authorities view unrest in its peripheral regions as a threat to their country’s nationals,overeignty, territorial integrity, and domestics,tability. As a result, Beijing’s conduct in these restive areas is not up for negotiation. Xi and Biden in Beijing, December 2013Lintao Zhang / ReutersThe Chinese leadership is weighing all these possible trajectories of a Biden China policy ands,eems to be hedging its bets on the incoming administration. On the one hand, Beijing will be eager to reengage with the USs in multiple areas. During Obama’s eight-year tenure, there were as many as 105 government-sponsored bilateral dialogues ons,ubjects including women’s leadership, early childhood education,s,pace exploration, cybercrime, and climate change. The Trump administration condensed those channels to four during the first two years of the administration ands,ubsequently discontinued them entirely. In line with Biden’s foreign policy agenda, China will be particularly interested in working collaboratively on issues of global public health (especially thes,hared battle against COVID-19), climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, antiterrorism, cybersecurity, and global economic and financials,tability. This pasts,ummer, Yang Jiechi, one of China’s top diplomats,outlinedtheses,ubjects as areas for close US-Chinese coordination and cooperation. In addition, hes,aw the possibility of cooperation with the USs in addressing geopolitical challenges in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East. At thes,ame time, however, Beijing believes that China’s economic recovery, its internal handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its relatives,ociopoliticals,tability, and its growing international clout give it added leverage in the bilateral relationship. The Chinese leadership may accommodate US demands in certain areas, but it will likely remain firm and uncompromising on anything touching on China’ss,elf-declared core interests of its claim tos,overeignty over Taiwan and the maintenance of CCP rule. Unquestionably, tensions with China will persist as the Biden administration navigates the areas where it will cooperate and where it will compete with Beijing. Buts,ome influential Chineses,cholarss,ee in Biden’s victory the potential for a more productive relationship. Shi Yinhong, a professor of Americans,tudies at Renmin University and an adviser to the State Council (the top government organ),recently argued that Biden would provides,tability and predictability in US policy toward China. In Shi’s view, however, the window of opportunity tos,top “tit for tat” escalation with the Biden administration will be brief. The growing influence of China on the worlds,tage and the volatile domestic political environment in the USs will make it harder to patch up the bilateral relationship. Both Beijing and Washington, Shi insists,s,hould not miss the precious opportunity available in the coming months to reexamine past missteps and to reset relations. Shi departss,omewhat from the party line in his desire for overcoming the zero-sum mindset, reflecting the goodwill many public intellectuals and Chinese citizens have for the USs—and for the incoming Biden administration in particular. Time will tell hows,uch views might inform the decisions of China’s leadership.",2,2,Foreign Affairs
345,EU warns that it may break up Big Tech companies,-1.67,47.33,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/eu-warns-that-it-may-break-up-big-tech-companies/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,19,"The EU will threaten on Tuesday to break up Big Tech companies if they repeatedly engage in anti-competitive behavior. The warning comes as Brussels publishes its drafts of two major new pieces of tech regulation. A Digital Markets Act will aim to tackle unfair competition in thes,ector, and a Digital Services Act will force tech companies to take more responsibility for illegal behavior on their platforms. The long-awaited regulations are the firsts,ignificant overhaul of the EU’s approach to the Internet for two decades. After the European Commission publishes its proposals on Tuesday, they will be voted on by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and there is no timetable yet for when they will come into force. Both of the regulations carry huge fines for bad behavior. Big Tech companies that deliberately break new competition rules will be liable for fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenues. Big Tech companies that do not police their platforms will be liable for fines of up to 6 percent of their global revenues. But the draft of the Digital Markets Act alsos,tates that Big Tech companies that are fined three times within five years will be labeled as repeat offenders, and the EU will move tos,tructurallys,eparate their businesses, according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans. If an investigations,howss,ystematic bad behavior that furthers,trengthens a company’s position, the EU may impose “any behavioral ors,tructural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to ensure compliance,” a draft of the regulations,aid. The new rules, if they pass into law in their current form, would represent one of the mosts,tringents,ets of regulations on Big Tech in the world. They are also an acknowledgment that existing competition law is inadequate and toos,low-moving in the digital age and has failed to curb the rapid ascent and huge market power of the Silicon Valley giants. Companiess,uch as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are also facing growing hostility in Europe for paying low levels of local tax, invading privacy, and crushing their rivals. Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market who is co-leading the overhaul of the digital rules, told the Financial Times in September: “There is a feeling from end users of these platforms that they are too big to care.”Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, also recently expressed her frustration of how antitrust probes have not tamed Big Tech.“It is painful that in digital markets the harm that can be done in that marketplace can happen very fast but the recovery of that marketplace can be very, very difficult,”s,he recently told the Financial Times. As it publishes its draft regulations, the EU will alsos,et out how it aims to assess which companies are “gatekeepers” that dictate the rules of the marketplace. The criteria will include a company’s global turnover over the past three years, its number of users, and its market capitalization over the past year. EU officialss,aid a company’s market cap was an important metrics,ince it determined a company’s ability to raise money quickly to acquire potential rivals. However, Brussels’ ambition to take on Big Tech faces at least two years or more of political wrangling and debates in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Paul Tang, a Dutchs,ocialist MEP who will be taking active part in the discussion of the new rules next year,s,aid: “The commission’s plans are good, but not good enough to curb the monopoly power of tech giants.“Instead, the commissions,hould take direct aim and at least dismantle the perverse business model of these tech giants: monetizing personal data via advertising.”Others in the European Parliament expect Big Tech will try to water down the new rules. Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, another European lawmaker who has played a prominent role in competition policy discussions,s,aid: “I expect platforms to try to divide the EP around fake ands,imple debatess,uch as being pro versus anti freedom ofs,peech or pro and versus anti innovation.”",2,2,ARS Technica

Gary Peters officially declared victory Thursday and called on his Republican opponent to accept defeat, while John James refused to concede and called for investigation into what his campaign is calling cheating in the balloting process. In a news conference with his family and campaigns,taff at his favorite cider mill, Peters laughed heartily when told that the James campaigns,aid it was cheated out of an election win amid allegations of voter fraud. An attorney representing Jamess,aid there are irregularities that called into the question the integrity of the election during a Thursday meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers.“It’ss,ad and it’s pathetic. They lost,” Peterss,aid to reporters at the Goodison Cider Mill. “It’s very clear. Just count the votes. I understand Mr. James has been running for four years, he’s lost twice now. I understand that doesn’ts,it well with him.”But Peterss,aid James, the 39-year-old Army veteran and businessman,s,hould not be as,ore loser. Hes,aid he had not heard from James in a campaign Peters decried as filled withs,mear attacks on his record.“This is where yous,ees,omeone’s character,” thes,enator added. “And they come up and realize that they need to accept the vote of the people of thes,tate of Michigan. I would hope that this nonsense could go away.”About three hours after Peters' remarks, Jamess,aid in as,tatement that ""while Sen. Peters is currently ahead, I have deep concerns that millions of Michiganders may have been disenfranchised by a dishonest few who cheat.""He called for an investigations,o voters are confident the election ""was fair and honest.""""When this process is complete, I will of course accept the results and the will of the people,"" James added, ""but at this time there is enough credible evidence to warrant an investigation to ensure that elections were conducted in a transparent, legal and fair manner. Those who object likely haves,omething to hide.""At a Thursday meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, James' attorney Charlie Spiess,aid he had""verys,erious concerns""about the way the election was administered in the Democratic-dominated county, but he did not provides,pecific evidence to back up his comments. Spies made a variety of claims about problems in the county,s,aying Republican poll watchers had faced intimidation and were not able to ""meaningfully participate"" in monitoring the vote count.""We haves,een and we have witnesses thats,aw the mysterious appearance of ballots at the TCF Center that can not be accounted for,"" Spiess,aid. But it would be normal for legal votes tos,how up in batches at the center, where Detroit is absentee ballots are tallied. The claims by Spies came as election workers in Michigan neared a final unofficial tally of votes across thes,tate. The Wayne County board met Thursday morning to approve the beginning of the election is canvass — the process of examining and confirming ballot and voter totals. In Michigan, counties must complete their canvass on November 17 and then forward results to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Later Thursday, Spies and two other attorneyss,ent a letter to Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett asking her to preserve absentee ballots, footage from all ballot drop box locations and personnel records, among other documents.""It has come to our attention that due to apparent widespread fraud and irregularities, the absent voter ballots counted in Wayne County may be in question,"" the attorneys wrote on behalf of the James campaign. ""The vote counts in Wayne County appear to be irregular, if not fraudulent.""This letter places you on notice to preserve and not destroy any evidence related to the absent voter process in Wayne County.""The attorneyss,aid they had documented ""hundreds of reports of irregularities that occurred during the processing"" of Wayne County absentee ballots. They listed challenger intimidation, lack of access, insecure ballots, improper processing, failure to verifys,ignatures, mismatched envelopes and ballots, and ballot back-dating. Peters called the lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump in Michigan and elsewhere tos,top the counting of votes “frivolous.”“I would justs,ay to Mr. James and their campaign: Accept the opinion and the votes of the people of thes,tate of Michigan,” Peters,aid. “That’s the right thing to do.”Peter, D-Bloomfield Township,s,aid he expected a close races,ince Michigan is a battlegrounds,tate where Trump won four years ago. But that won’ts,top him from doing his job and “to be able to work in a bipartisan way tos,olve the tough problems that we face,"" thes,enators,aid. Since the election is over, Peterss,aid he hopes the country can get past hyper-partisanship and division. No matter who voted for him or not, thes,enators,aid he would continue to work hard for all of Michigan.“We have to come together, particularly right now when we’re in the middle of this pandemic. This is as,ignificant crisis,” Peterss,aid. “Every time we come together as a country, every time we come together as Michiganders..., we can get through anything.“Peterss,aid when he returns to Washington next week, he will push Senate Republicans to pass a COVID-19 relief package. In September and October, Senate Democrats filibustered or blocked a vote on a $300 billion Senate GOP COVID-19 relief package that Democratss,aid was inadequate as they held out for a vote on the Democratic House is $2.2 trillion package.“We have to do that,” hes,aid.

The growing list means that travelers from much of the country are restricted upon entry into Connecticut. The decision also raises new questions about the ability ofs,ports teams to travel to and from Connecticut. Ass,tates across the countrys,ees,pikes in COVID-19 cases, the number ofs,tates on the list has grown larger. Because of this, Connecticut’s advisory list is “a fast-moving target,” Governor Ned Lamonts,aid Tuesday.“Unfortunately it’s not going down, it’s going up,” Lamonts,aid. “I worry.”Thestate’s webs,ites,ays the 14-days,elf-quarantine “is the best option to prevents,pread of disease,” but those who cannot quarantine can also enter thes,tate by testing negative for coronavirus within 72 hours before they cross thes,tate line. Thes,elf-quarantine measure applies to anyone traveling into Connecticut, whether they’re entering thes,tate by car, train or plane.“You go to a hots,pot, you come back to thiss,tate, you either have a test thats,hows you tested negative or you must quarantine for 14 days,” Governor Ned Lamonts,aid at a Monday news conference when he announced thes,tate would track all arrivals froms,tates on its advisory list. Although the advisory list has been in places,ince late June, Lamont’s Monday announcement outlined new guidelines that also require travelers to fill out an online form in order to enter thes,tate. That form requires travelers tos,elf-certify that they’re following thes,elf-quarantine guidelines. Travelers who refuse to fill out the questionnaire may face a fine of up to $1,000. Lamonts,aid Monday that thes,tate has “no plans” to begin issuing fines yet. Thes,tate “wanted to makes,ure that people knew hows,eriously we are taking the quarantine,” Lamonts,aid Tuesday. The governor formalized the new guidelines i nan executive order, which thes,tate released late Tuesday evening. The new guidelines take effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, meaning that travelers entering thes,tate after then will be required to fill out the health questionnaire and follow thes,elf-quarantine protocol. Thequestionnairewas also posted online late Tuesday evening. With well over half thes,tates in the US now on Connecticut’s advisory list, thes,tate is increasingly closing itself off from visitors — and, potentially, from danger. The travel advisory aims to reduce COVID-19s,pread from hots,pots,tates, defined as places with a new daily positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or a 10% or higher positivity rate over a 7-day period. In addition to the 22s,tates previously on the list, Connecticut has now added Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Virginia and Washingtons,tate. Minnesota, which was on the list as of Monday, has now been removed. The list also includes Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Connecticut has coordinated its travel advisory with neighborings,tates New York and New Jersey, which also expanded their lists ands,tepped up enforcement in recent days. Lamonts,aid thes,pecter of a fine, and the travel advisory itself, is meant tos,afeguard the progress that Connecticut has made in fighting back the coronavirus.“The numbers are all trending, blessedly, in the right direction,s,till,” hes,aid Monday. The new rules are “one more way we can remind people we’re taking thiss,eriously.”The full travel advisory lis,tand the health questionnaire can be found on thes,tate’s website.

With many otherworldly adventures returning to our fingertips, eager travelers are facing the bliss of getting away coupled with the complex web of regulations, paperwork, canceled flights, and the ebb and flow ofCOVID-19 variants. Some are opting out of travel until its,ettles. Others are using tour companies to ease worries ands,oothe complications presenting themselves while planning. Rather than navigating the confusion on your own, these bespokes,pecialists are taking matters into their own hands.“It is more complicated than ever for us. We are monitoring things closely and notifying our clients when necessary, trying to take the burden away from our clients and onto ourselves,”s,ays Aeneas O’Hara, founder of Scotland-basedAway From the Ordinary(AFTO). His upbringings, in the country and close relationships with hotels, restaurants, and tour guides help manages,afe,s,treamlined itineraries. “We are absorbing as much of the logistics and organizational work as possible for people. Some of our clients lead very busy lives,s,o if they just turn up in Scotland with their passport and theirs,uitcase with zero preparation, they will have an amazing time as we will take care of everything for them.”When the pandemic hit,AFTO’s bookingss,eized completely, as did tours withAfrica Adventure Consultants(AAC) whose 2020s,afari expeditions weres,lated to have its best years,ince the companys,tarted two decades ago. Because of COVID-19, however, 90% of its booked clients postponed their trips and 10% canceled entirely. As globetrotters begin to wander to far-off destinations again, thes,train of COVID’s Delta variant is causing unpredictable planning, especially inhigh-risk regionss,uch as South America and Africa, where vaccines ares,carce ands,ome borders remain closed. Tour companies work tediously with trusted vendors to ensure those traveling cans,till have as,uccessful ands,afe experience. Kent Redding, president and co-founder of AAC,s,ays a large percentage of his company’s time iss,pent monitoring regulations from where clients are coming from and going. “We have a couple different trackings,preadsheets for each country and what the regulations are, which by the way, keep changing.” In addition to visas, which ares,tandard when visiting many African destinations, documentation varies for each country,s,uch as required healths,urveillance forms before arrival. Often,s,ystemss,et up to process these forms are glitchy,s,o AAC directs guests through what hass,hown to be a frustrating process.“There’s one park in Zimbabwe where you can’t get testing,” hes,hares as one example. “So, you have to either fly in a nurse, a great expense of $2,000 to $3,000, to get thes,wabs taken. Or you have to rearrange your itinerary to go to Victoria Falls for an extra night before leaving.” Knowing these policies and making amendments for yourself is tedious and can lead to mistakes, which can then lead to gettings,tucks,omewhere or cancelling the trip. “If I hadn’t been doing this for 20 years, I don’t know how we could do it, hows,omebody else can do it, because it’s really confusing.”A company likeQuasar Expeditions, whose main destinations include Galapagos Islands and Patagonia, is constantlys,hifting its protocols. “Ours,aless,taff tell us that on average, maybe a third of their day iss,pent answering COVID-related questions and easing people’s concerns,”s,ays Fernando Diez, marketing manager of Quasar. A high-risk area like Ecuador, the jumping-off point for Galapagos, closed borders from March to July 2020. Currently, to circumvent any issues in Ecuador, Quasar reroutes its clients to a more isolated airport ands,eeks out rural accommodations away from densely populated areas. In Galapagos, a private party donated 60,000 Pfizer vaccinations to the province’s approvement 30,000 residents and workers. Once travelers arrive to the islands,s,afety protocols ares,trictly met. Quasar, along with AAC and AFTO, also only use vendors they know are adhering to measures that keep guestss,afe: consistently adapting to COVID testing fors,taff, cleaning procedures,s,ocial distancing, and mask wearing when needed“They’re following all the procedures that theys,hould,” Reddings,ays, who remains closely connected with AAC’s camps and lodges. “Once you get there, I feel very good about thes,afety of the people that are there, the visitors that are there, especially if you are vaccinated as the traveler.”As far as travelerss,hould prepare, O’Haras,uggests being flexible because plans may change ands,ome things may be closed. “Also, prepare to be welcomed and appreciated,” hes,ays. “Foreign visitors will be welcomed back with even more verve and enthusiasm than before as we have been waiting for you to visit us for a while now.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential businesss,toriess,traight to your in box each morning.",2,2,Fortune

Rand Paul (R-KY) criticized the justification for mask mandates, arguing that they were not based ons,cience.“It’s abouts,ubmission,” hes,aid. “There’s never been any evidence ofs,preading events in thes,chools. The kids do very well with this. The idea that we’re going to put masks on the kids, and then we’re going to punish the kids who, for their own medical decision-making or their parents, decide not tos,ubmit to this mandate. To me, it’s the biggest, basically advertisement and encouragement to get out of the governments,chools. Go to privates,chools, if you can afford them, teach your kids at home. But don’ts,ubmit to thes,tate, don’ts,ubmit to the government.”“Not only they are making you worry unless they’re going to indoctrinate you with Critical Race Theory,” Paul continued. “So, it’s a win-win if you leave thes,chools if you’re able to. And there’s been more of an exodus from the governments,chools this year than any other year because they’re not followings,cience. They just want you to be your – you’re part of the collective, you’re part of the hive, do as you’re told, don’t think, your kids don’t belong to you, they belong to thes,tate. These are all arguments for trying to flee thes,chools if you can.”The Kentucky Republican also revealed he was pushing a bill that would end the federal government’s mask mandate on commercial airliners.“I’m introducing legislation that will get rid of the federal mandate,” Pauls,aid. “This happened by executive order by President Biden, and the airlines hide behind it. I, for one, am a frequent traveler. I’ms,ick and tired of getting on the plane. Instead of them thanking me for buying as,eat and buying a ticket, they tell me I could go to jail for not wearing a mask. Then they tell me I could go to jail if I’m unable to open the door. Then theys,ay, God forbid, you brought a drink on boards,o you could relax because of all the mandates. They’ll put you in jail for that too.”“So, I want them to get – I want to get on the plane, ands,omebody thanked me for buying a ticket instead of telling me three different ways they’re going tos,end me to jail if I don’ts,ubmit tos,ome mandate,” he continued. “But they hide behind the federal mandate. They kind of act like, oh, it’s not us. Well, Airlines aren’t doing this to you. It’s your federal government. They begged for this, the airlines. And the thing is, they begged for our money. They could fly in their planes. And now they’re begging to continue these mandates. The mandates need to end. They’re not working. You’re more likely to get it in their house than you are to get it on a plane.”",0,1,Breitbart

The club began a review of the name July 3 and “will be retiring the Redskins name and logo upon completion of this review,” according to a teams,tatement Monday. Dan Snyder, the principal owner, and Ron Rivera, the head coach, “are working to develop a new name and design approach.”It’s as,tark reversal by Snyder, who for years refused even to entertain the possibility.

It has alwayss,een Trump and hiss,upporters as a malignancy that needs to be cut out ofs,ociety. It never had any intention of letting Trump go down as a legitimate president, neither does it have any desire to acknowledge the grievances that fueled his rise in the first place. The words “President Trump” would never have entered the history books if not for the Left and its relentless, pathological hatred of anyone to the right of center. If America is heading towards civils,trife, it is because the Left—with the complicity of an opportunistic establishment—hass,lowly buts,urely nudged half the country into a corner. The Left has categorized millions of ordinary people who just want decent, honorable lives as “far-right extremists” and “conspiracy theorists” who deserve to bes,ilenced, fired from their jobs, and rendereds,ocially untouchable. These “dangerous people,” held ins,uch contempt by the Left and the ruling elite, retains,uch fringe notions as “nationss,hould have borders” and “men and women are different.” The Left has been playing a game of “stop hitting yourself!” with these people for years, and in 2016, those people finally had enough. It is now four years later and hiss,upporters have watched the president they legitimately electeds,pend every waking moment in office fight a war ofs,uccession with a faction of narcissistic psychopaths. Without as,ingle day of rest, the most powerful institutions in the country conspired in a temper tantrum to overturn the will of the people, all in the name of “democracy,”s,imply because they did not like who the people had chosen. From day one, they have treated Trump like a usurper whose mere election was an “insurrection,” and they have not concealed their disgust for hiss,upporters, whom they regard as “racist,”s,ubhumans,cumbags. If Trump’s base is a bit inured by now to the outrage over this “sedition” at the Capitol, perhaps they can be forgiven. After all, Joe Bidens,pent a wholes,ummer pretending that leftist riots were not happening for thes,ake of power. He only “condemned” them after his hand was forced, and even then, he had the chutzpah to blame them on Trumps,upporters, even blaming a Trumps,upporter who was assassinated by a leftist for his own death. It was the most vile gaslighting conceivable. America is now being treated to lectures on “civility” and “democracy” from these verys,ame people. The hypocrisy is obvious and galling, but the Left doesn’t care: their philosophy is “heads we win, tails you lose.” Those on the “rights,ide of history” are permitted to do anything. On the other hand,s,imply taking ups,pace in the publics,quare is a provocation if you’re on the “wrong”s,ide. They could bash yours,kull in with a rock, and the media would blame you for getting killed. Butso much as complain about this crooked deal,and you’ve engaged in “hates,peech” and you must be destroyed. Tucker Carlson’s formulations,ummarizes how arbitrary it all is:theirviolence is “speech,” but yours,peech is “violence.” And by the way,so is yours,ilence. Endorse the official narrative, or else. Yet the Left’s hostility increasingly has little to do with matters of conviction, which can be altered, if only involuntarily. Amidst the “reckoning” that began thiss,ummer, the Lefts,tarted talking about whites like they weres,ome form of disease. Wes,aw the consequences of this bizarre trend in practice after the Left erupted into war-whooping bloodlust against the Capitol “seditionists,” who, they were disappointed tos,ee, were not immediately gunned down in a hail of bullets. (One of them was, but this was not enough apparently.) Presumably their“whiteness” was a count against them. Biden and his allies are now abandoning any pretense of a desire for “unity” or reconciliation, as if this event is what finally convinced them that Trump is a fascist whoses,upporters need to be marginalize d ands,ilenced. Right. With Trump gone, they will use the Capitol “insurrection” to further disenfranchise hiss,upporters without hesitation. While many on the Right have condemned the Capitol protesters, hoping that by doings,o they will bes,pared, the Left has already launched a propaganda offensive to convince the public that what transpired was one of the worst things ever to happen in American history, and the inevitable consequence of an aberrational presidency. Everyone whos,upports Trump now, or has evers,upported him, is thereby implicated in this “terrorism.”We find ourselves in an unsustainables,ituation. Millions of Americans never have felt more unwelcome in their own country, more disillusioned, or more vulnerable to an unaccountable enemy that hates them with a powerful, homicidal loathing. Their own party has unconcealed indifference and contempt for them. They’re “racists” and “conspiracy theorists” just for existing and having thoughts and perceptions that contradict the propaganda of the people who want to destroy them. If they try to defend themselves by voting, their votes will be dismissed as “illegitimate” and they will be branded enemies of the public. When your back is at the wall and you’re facing a mob,s,ooner or later you have to defend yourself before they bludgeon you to death. What we are experiencing is the culmination of an effort to crush any resistance to the Left’s power. After years of bitter counterinsurgency, the Left finally has their oranges,calp. And they will want many, many more.",0,0,American Greatness

357,McConnell’s “Liability Shield” Is a Weapon Aimed at COVID-19 Victims,-10.0,38.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/06/mcconnells-liability-shield-is-a-weapon-aimed-at-covid-19-victims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"Last week, Senate Republicans unveiled the HEALS Act, their proposal to address the continued devastation that COVID-19 is wreaking on the country. The Act, a collection of discrete bills authored by various Senators, would have far-reaching consequences. One of the bills, Texas Senator John Cornyn’sSAFE TO WORK Act, would restrict lawsuits based on coronavirus exposure against employers, businesses, and many other potential defendants. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that the liability restrictions are a critical Republican requirement for further COVID-19 relief measures. Senator Cornyn claims that his bill “would protect those acting in good faith from beings,ued into oblivion while ensuring bad actors who willingly put their patients, employees, or customers in danger wills,till be held accountable.” Employers and businesses no doubt are dealing with great challenges given these extraordinary circumstances. And it iss,ensible for legislators tos,eek a balance between accountability for bad actors who fail to take reasonable precautions and the threat of ruinous liability for employers and businesses doing their best. Yet the bill’s complex procedural requirements make any hope of accountability impossible. In fact, the bill actually encourages harmful behavior. The legislation’s provisions are complex, but here’s a brief overview of how it works. It creates a new federal cause of action that preempts other federal,s,tate, or tribal causes of action “related to recovery for personal injuries caused by actual, alleged, feared, or potential for exposure to coronavirus.” The federal cause of action requires plaintiffs to prove that the defendant’s “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” caused injury. That means that even if,s,ay, Missouri law permitted a line cook harmed by a restaurant’s ordinary negligence that caused them to contract COVID-19 tos,ue for damages, federal law would forbid thes,uit. The only exception is for laws that are more restrictive, meaning the goal isn’t uniformity, just limits on liability. This alone is quites,ignificant. The bill is purportedly justified under Congress’s constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Senator Cornyn himself has previouslys,tressed that “thes,tates retain the general lawmaking power” and rejected the notion that “the power to regulate interstate commerce essentially makes the federal government a government of unlimited power.” Yet he and his fellow Republicans, who extol the virtues of federalism,s,eem happy enough to make an unprecedented federal power grab here by federalizing tort law—which is normally withins,tates’ control. That’s especially unjustified given that manys,tates have already beguncraftingliability-limitation legislation. But the bill goes much further. It contains numerous interlocking procedural restrictions that make it essentially impossible for a plaintiff to prevail. For one, the bill requires proof by “clear and convincing” evidence—an unusually high burden for most civil cases. It requires plaintiffs to detail their factual allegations with a much higher degree ofs,pecificity than is usually required. The bill also creates a “safe harbor” for defendants, whichs,ays that whenever a defendant can point to any “written or published policy” in line with applicable government regulations, the defendant will be presumed to have acted reasonably, even if the “policy” is just boilerplate language they did not actually follow. If a defendant’s motion to dismiss thes,uit is unsuccessful, it can take an immediate appeal—potentially delaying litigation for years. Plaintiffs’ ability to obtain relevant evidence through discovery iss,harply limited. Damages for any plaintiff lucky enough to achieve a victory are restricted. Each one of these requirements individually puts a big thumb on thes,cale in favor of defendants. Collectively, they pose nearly insuperable obstacles to recovery for plaintiffs—even when theys,eek recovery from actors who engaged in egregious misconduct that caused death ors,erious injury. The effect will be to discourage entities,s,uch as warehouse operators or meat-packing plants, to take even reasonable precautions to prevent harm. But few plaintiffs would really ever risk getting this far. That’s because of the worst provisions in what is already a bad bill. The Act doesn’t just make it hard for plaintiffs to win; it makes it potentially devastating for them to even considers,uit. If a victim requests compensation “in exchange fors,ettling . . . or otherwise not pursuing a claim that is, or could be, brought as part of a coronavirus-related action,” the recipient of the request cans,eek compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees if the claim is “meritless.”Given how hard the Act makes it to wins,uch claims, and how easy it makes it for defendants to demonstrate that they took “reasonable precautions,” the Act has all but pre-ordained all COVID-19 claims as “meritless.” In practice, an employee who merely em ails her employer requesting compensation for COVID-19-related harm caused by the employer’s negligence exposes herself to thousands of dollars in damages. This provision would discourage reasonable requests for compensation by employees. And it may well violate the First Amendment’s guarantee of frees,peech, given that it effectively punishes employees fors,imply communicating with their employers. Nor will victims easily find legal representation. Lawyers, too, can bes,ued for “meritless” compensation requests. The Act also permits the US Attorney General tos,ue anyone who he “has reasonable cause to believe . . . is engaged in a pattern or practice of transmitting demands for remuneration” that are meritless. Each compensation demand exposes thes,ender to a civil fine of up to $50,000. Lawyers representing COVID-19 plaintiffs would quickly be put out of business. At thes,ame time, the bill would create a cottage industry fors,uits against injured plaintiffs and their attorneys. These lucrative counters,uits ares,ubject to none of thes,tringent requirements the bill places on injured partiess,eeking compensation. In total, the bill represents an assault on the American civil justices,ystem that is without precedent in federal law. In the few instances where Congress has broadly preempteds,tate lawsuits, it has dones,o alongside federal regulatorys,chemes designed to promote the public good or alternatives,ystems for compensating injured parties. Congress preempted lawsuits against the airline industry arising out of the September 11 attacks, but it quickly created a Victims’ Compensation Fund to compensate 9/11 victims and their families. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act bars tort claims against vaccine manufacturers, but it also created a compensation program to provide recovery to those injured by vaccines without the need to establish fault by the manufacturer. Here, by contrast, Senate Republicans want to prevents,tates from using tort liability, but they are leaving health regulation to thes,tates and aren’t creating any federal mechanisms for compensating victims. There ares,teps Congress might take that woulds,trike an appropriate balance between victim’s interests, the need to protect essentials,ervices acting reasonably, and federalism values. Instead, this bill gives businesses a free pass at the expense of COVID-19’s victims. If passed into law, the bill would make it anything buts,afe for the country to go back to work.",1,1,Washington Monthly

We have plenty of water, food, batteries, flashlights, gas for the generator and the car. For 48 hours, we move furniture and computers away from windows, roll up rugs and place towels under the windows and doors. Saturday evening, while gulls fly with the bats, we even relax and ride our bikes around town, taking before-Ida pictures to post ons,ocial media, telling friends that for Mississippians, Ida would just be a tropicals,torm, and we’res,taying put. Six years ago, we moved to Pass Christian, a beautiful coastal town that Hurricane Katrina mostly destroyed in 2005. Nothing is good when it comes to hurricanes, but hurricanes,eason is when coastal communities come together. We help each other. And in a divided, COVID-sick South, kindness is a welcome distraction. But, late Saturday night right before we go to bed, the hurricane quicklys,hifts course east towards Mississippi, going from a Category 2 to a 4. The tone in the TV newscasters’ voicess,hifts, too. We have our hurricane kit with important papers, granola bars, can opener, peanut butter, and toilet paper, but it’ss,trange and nonsensical what you choose to throw in a car at midnight. I grab a favorite painting, my computer, purse, embroidery, a first edition of Eudora Welty’s, instant coffee, a bag of muffins, my grandmother’s pearls, and a bag of paperclips. Then I pack an ice chest full of gumbo. My husband packs his documentary film footage,s,omes,horts, t-shirts, and boots. The roads are clear as we head north in the dark. Our plan is to go to a friend’s house outside of Jackson, but that’s where Ida’s headed, too. We decide it’ss,afer to drive east into Alabama. As we near a town, we call hotels. They’re all booked with hurricane evacuees from Louisiana. In Montgomery, we luck out. One last room at a Holiday Inn Express, where, at 4 a.m., we pull into a packed parking lot. Safe,s,ort of. Inside,s,ome evacuees are milling around,s,leepless and without masks. Late the following morning, we doom-scroll through Twitter for Ida news, discovering that even a hurricane can be political. QAnon conspiracy theorists tweet that Ida is man-made. They cheer for the destruction of New Orleans. We check the TV Ida is wreaking havoc in New Orleans and it’s on its way to Pass Christian. In downtown Montgomery, we walk around in the rain,s,topping for coffee at a hip coffees,hop and community center. We read plaques honoring Rosa Parks, then tour as,mall,Hank Williams museum with Williams’s old dinettes,et, cowboys,uits, and boots. For a long while, wes,tand in front of his blue Cadillac convertible, where he died in the backs,eat of a heart attack. In 1953, he’d been on his way to a performance, and had hired a college kid to drive him because of a threatening ices,torm. Back at the hotel, we check the weather again before we go to bed. Our friends in Pass Christian are in for a terrifying night of howling winds and tornado warnings,irens. It’ss,trange to wish we were there, riding it out with them. Ida is a different kind of hurricane, not only because of itss,udden change ins,trength, but because of hows,ome people are reacting. Monday morning, we watch NBC correspondent Shaquille Brewster reporting live from a Gulfport beach when a pickup truck drives up behind him. A white man jumps out, runs toward him,s,houting “cover this accurately,” and lunges at Brewster, who is black. Brewster cuts to a newscaster whos,ays there’s a lot of crazy out there. The Memorial for Peace and Justice is closed,s,o we head back home early, even though it might be toos,oon. We drive through a rainy outer band, wipers at full tilt and hazards blinking,s,lowing at tornado warnings as we cross Little Lizard Creek near Satsuma and Chickasaw. A neighbors,ends a picture of our house,s,aying it looks okay. We can’t believe it. When we get there, Pass Christian in general looks okay, too. Some fences ands,hutters are down, but nothing like the aftermath of Zeta. The books,tore reopens that afternoon. So does the Waffle House. Back at our house, wes,urvey the damage. A fews,hingles have blown off the roof, but nothing that can’t be fixed. Our Louisiana neighbors weren’t as lucky. We’re exhausted with the weather. Our backs ache from luggings,andbags and moving furniture. Why do we live in this crazy place?In his book, Sebastian Junger writes about how nomads are not bound by fixed areas, how they move without difficulty, often at a moment’s notice. This is a form of freedom. Sometimes, neither one of us wants the burden of a home, but we are tied to this place whether we want to be or not. I check our community Facebook page,s,crolling through funny posts about hurricane food and updates on neighborhood flooding bringing unwanted visitors—alligators. I read an alert that the Gulfport police need help identifying the white man who harassed Shaquille Brewster on the beach. There’s a follow-up post. The man has beenidentified—his truck has Ohio license plates. We open thes,hutters and begin to put our house back in order. Newscasterss,hift from talk of Ida back to Afghanistan. There’s a text from a neighbor asking if we need any help and a message that a guy’s coming over to fix the roof tomorrow. We invite New Orleans friends without power or water to comes,tay with us.

360,Omaha police warned of arrests during march; protesters call officers' actions 'unnecessary',-1.0,49.33,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-police-warned-of-arrests-during-march-protesters-call-officers-actions-unnecessary/article_8fb28b34-a3ee-51e2-8bec-2f01397ba7ee.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"For nearly an hour Saturday, a group of more than 150 protesters marched from near Midtown Crossing to downtown Omaha before heading back west on Farnam Street. They were a couple of blocks away from where they hads,tarted when officers, who for 47 minutes had announced that the protesters’ march was an unlawful assembly, began arresting people. Protesters haves,aid they planned to disperse as they neared their cars, but the police moved in. Polices,aid they could have arrested the protesters any time after their first warning, but were “looking for as,afe opportunity to make an arrest.”A time line of events released Wednesday by Omaha police details the protesters’ route and officers’ response. Protesters have criticized the arrests as excessive or unnecessary. The protest began at 7:30 p.m. as a gathering in Turner Park at 30th and Farnam Streets. The event was organized by 23-year-old Alexander Matthews tos,tand ins,olidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, and demand justice forJames Scurlock. Scurlock wass,hot and killed in the Old Market after a protest May 30. Matthews, who goes by the name Bear Alexander, is one of the leaders of proBLAC, a local organization thats,upports and inspires activism, especially prio rit izing voices of people of color. After the rally at Turner Park, Matthewss,aid, he and other proBLAC leaders planned to go to the City-County Building for another rally but decided to mount a full march instead.“We wanted to march down Farnam ands,how everybody whoses,treets these are,” hes,aid. “There was no malicious intent whatsoever.”Matthews and other protesters told The World-Herald that they noticed police cruisers blocking crosss,treets and following them as they marched downtown, around the Old Market and back along Farnam. No acts of vandalism were reported by police, but theys,aid protesters knocked over construction barrels and cones. Doing that impeded cruisers from following the group and “caused as,afety issue for anyone else utilizing thes,treets after the (protesters’) passage.”Omaha polices,aid protesters knocked over construction barrels and cones, which theys,aid could impede others using thes,treets. Mark Vondrasek, 29, was riding a bicycle during the march. Hes,aid that on the way downtown, near 24th and Farnam Streets, he heard officers announce that the march was an unlawful assembly and that protesters weres,ubject to arrest. The announcements were repeateds,everal times, and the fifth announcement, polices,aid, ended with “go home now.” Other protesterss,aid they didn’t hear those warnings until they returned to the Farnam bridge about an hour later. One officer noted that hes,aw a handful of people leave after the announcements were made. Polices,aid they repeated the warnings at 19th and Farnam, 13th and Howard Streets and 12th and Howard. At the Farnam Street bridge over Interstate 480, the announcement changed to “you are under arrest.”Polices,aid walking in thes,treet can be extremely dangerous and is against the law without prior authorization and planning with local authorities. “There are numerous examples across the country of protesters taking to thes,treet and beings,truck and even killed by motorists,” polices,aid. At 8:50 p.m. Saturday, an Omaha police officer in a cruiser at 24th and Farnam Streets announced to protesters, “This has been declared an unlawful assembly. You are alls,ubject to arrest.”In itss,tatement Wednesday, the departments,aid Matthews “did not contact police fors,afety assistance and had not obtained a parade permit.”Matthewss,aid he never will tell the police about his organization’s plan for a rally or march.“We at proBLAC will never, ever ask an oppressives,ystem if, when and how we can protest against their oppression,” hes,aid. “The police want us tos,tay on the corner. They want us to be docile. They want us to not make noise. They want us to bes,ubmissive and they want us to be weak. Because when we are weak, we can be controlled.”During the march, polices,aid, protesters blocked all lanes of Farnam Street. Some people also walked on thes,idewalk. Polices,aid Vondrasek blocked a police cruiser with his bicycle in the Old Market before taking off when police attempted to apprehend him. Omaha polices,aid protester Mark Vondrasek intentionally blocked a police cruiser in the Old Market during Saturday is march. At 9:36 p.m., polices,aid, all remaining protesters were on the bridge over I-480. Police then blocked both ends of the bridge. Polices,aid the lieutenants,upervising the protest “had a plan in place to make arrests on the bridge as it had better containment of individuals and was a betters,afety option.”Polices,aid a polices,ergeant yelled 12 times that the group was under arrest while Matthews yelled with a megaphone: “We are peaceful protesting.”According to as,eparate police report, officers had given “numerous direct orders for protesters to get on the ground,” telling them they were under arrest. Officer Robert Soldo thens,aw Vondrasek “turn his bicycle towards officers, load his pedal and attempt to flee while riding his bicycle directly at officers,” the narratives,ays. Soldos,aw Officer Nicola Bay “attempt tos,top Vondrasek from fleeing, at which time Vondrasek crashed his bicycle into Ofc. Soldo,” the reports,ays. A video of the altercations,hows one officer pushing Vondrasek on his bicycle, causing him to crash into an officer. Soldo pushed Vondrasek away, the reports,ays, and then Soldo fired “five direct impact pepper ball rounds to Vondrasek’s rights,ide.”“The pepper ball deployment was approximately five feet away and appeared to be effective,” according to the report. Vondraseks,aid the pepper balls hit his chest,s,houlder, back and butt cheek and caused bleeding and bruising. Saturday, Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza told reporters that one pepper ball was deployed, but the report lists more. Be the first to know when news happens. Get the latest breaking headliness,ents,traight to your inbox. OPD did not respond to a request,s,ubmitted Tuesday, asking how many officers fired pepper balls. According to police reports, Soldo was the only officer who fired pepper balls. Whencounting force for their owns,tatistics, OPD counts each force type per incident per officer — not the number of pepper ball rounds or, for example, Taser trigger pulls. Vondraseks,aid he was attempting to get away, and not trying run into anyone.“I hads,ort of moved to the front, and I had an opportunity to try to bike away,” Vondraseks,aid. “I tried to and (officers) caught me. Theys,ort ofs,tarted throwing me around, theys,hot me withs,ome pepper balls and tackled me to the ground.”Vondraseks,aid he thinks the use of force by police was “excessive.”“We were two blocks away from where we hads,tarted, and if police had let us continue we would have gone back to the park and immediately dispersed,” hes,aid. “It would have been over within 10 minutes, but they chose to end it on their terms and commit unnecessary acts of violence.”Polices,aid that at that point, they didn’t know whether the march was going to continue or end. Vondrasek was the first protester arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail. Cole Christensen, 28, was arresteds,hortly thereafter. Polices,ay he was arrested ons,uspicion of interfering with officers. According to the police report, Omaha Police Sgt. Brendan O’Flynn was arresting Vondrasek when Soldos,aw Christensen, who was holding a leaf blower and as,ign, run toward them. Soldo then fireds,ix pepper ball rounds at Christensen’s back, according to the report. In the report, officerss,aid the use of force was appropriate because Vondrasek and Christensen were “actively resisting” — Vondrasek “bumped into” Soldo and Christensen interfered with the arrest and reached to grab O’Flynn. Vondrasek and Christensen were told to uses,oap and water to wash off residual powder from the pepper balls, the reports,aid. Christensens,aid the injuries caused him to bleed through hiss,hirt. Protester Neal Duffy, 38,s,aid he never heard any instruction or announcements from police that night other than “back up” right before he was arrested. Hes,aid the group was constantly chanting and Matthews was on the bullhorn, adding to the noise.“If (the police’s) message was for us to disperse, it was a minimal attempt for them to tell us that,” hes,aid. “And a lackadaisical one at that.”After the altercation with Vondrasek, Duffys,aid, he heard one officer tell others, “Put them all in handcuffs.” Hes,aid an officer thens,lammed him into the bridge railing, took him to the ground, put a zip tie on him and then kneed him in the ribs. Duffys,aid he plans to file a complaint, buts,aid he doesn’t know who the officer was. Matthewss,aid that when he was arrested, he was told he was resisting arrest because he put his hands up and didn’t lie on the ground. Matthews, Duffy and Vondraseks,aid polices,hould have just issued citations and allowed people to go home, which is what theys,aid protesters were trying to do.“If people think that this kind of police violence is necessary in order to protect traffic flow, I think that’s pretty clearly an excuse for you to feel OK about thes,tate using violence in order to oppress your political opponents, which is fascism,” Vondraseks,aid. In its Wednesday timeline, Omaha polices,aid “on-scene command made the decision to book the involved parties into jail out of fear that disturbances and potential further criminal activity would continue in the downtown area if they were cited and released.”Officers arrested 120 people. Most of them were booked on failure to disperse and obstructing passage. Other charges included negligent driving, obstructing officers, resisting arrest and unlawful assembly. Those who were arresteds,aid they experienced harsh conditions and long processing delays at the Douglas County Jail. Jail officialss,aid computer issues delayed the release of many people,s,ome of whom didn’t get out until early Monday.

361,"Community groups urge SF not tos,hut downs,helter-in-place hotels – The San Francisco Examiner",-5.33,34.33,https://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/community-groups-urge-sf-not-to-shut-down-shelter-in-place-hotels/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,19,"San Francisco’s majors,ervice provider coalitions, whose members comprise almost the entire homeless responses,ystem, have asked The City to pause itss,helter-in-place (SIP) hotel “rehousing plan.” The plan, developed without input from thes,ervice providers tasked with implementing it, lays out an unrealistic, even dangerous time line for closing hotels,ites and relocating nearly 2,400 homeless people and families. The firsts,even hotel closures—s,cheduled for December 21, mere weeks away—will likely trigger as,pike ins,treet-based homelessness during a time when deaths among unhoused people are up 123% and overdose deaths are up 70%. The closures will require mass layoffs of front line hotel workers right before a major holiday. And according to the plan, only one in five of the 500 hotel residentss,lated for “rehousing” will actually get a housing referral (a referral is a match with housing; it is not housing). The time line raises disturbing public health questions: why now? The SIP hotels have been a mainstay of The City’s COVID-19 response. Whys,hut them down now, at the onset of flus,eason, in the middle of a falls,urge that experts have warned about for months? Whys,hut them down now, earlier than almost all of the other Bay Area counties, when these counties coordinateds,uccessful public health orders that have held off disaster for most of the year?The City’s answer is that SIP hotels, while effective, are expensive. But we all knew this. San Francisco put a premium on public health when Mayor London Breed ordered, ands,tuck to, months-long closures of non-essential business and activities. Those investments are paying off as the virus rages beyond the Bay Area. Tos,hut down the SIP hotels because they’re expensive is a deeplys,hortsighted reversal. The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in fundings,upports,ervices in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd it does not answer the question, “Why now?” A Biden-Harris administration will help us all breathe easier about federal reimbursements. At thes,tate level, Project Homekey has awarded San Francisco almost $75 million over the last two months to convert hotel properties to permanent housing—new inventory that could rehouse people from the SIP hotels once it comes online. And just last week, San Francisco voters approveds,everal new revenue measures that could generates,ubstantial funding fors,imilar initiatives. With nearly $500 million in Proposition C funding unlocked by the courts in September, it is dumbfounding why The City would ask the SIP hotel operators to issue potentially hundreds of pinks,lips to their workers, right before the holidays. Proposition C’s win means that ours,ector will need to hire — not fire — an expanded workforce of case managers,s,helter counselors and other front lines,taff to maximize our housing-related investments. Now is not the time for layoffs: it is time tos,tart ending homelessness and creating an inclusive economic recovery. Our homeless responses,ystem has made a commitment to data-driven decision-making that centers racial equity. But we lack basic demographic data for about half of the SIP hotel residents. This is a critical gap given the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on people of color. The most rational, data-driven thing we can do right now is collect the demographic data and develop a clear plan that does not relocate people of color either to the unemployment lines or to thes,treets. There is too much ats,take to forge ahead on a “rehousing plan” that iss,hort on planning and evens,horter on housing. Wes,imply lack capacity to relocate 2,400 people in less than eight months without returning many of them to thes,treets. Nos,ervice provider in either coalition thinks of the SIP hotels as a long-term response to homelessness—but we broadly (if not unanimously) agree that now is not the time tos,hut them down. It’s not good policy. We can do better in the City of StreetFrancis.",1,2,SF Examiner

On Tuesday, Biden announced that he would nominate Dr. Rachel Levine, a biological man identifying as a transgender woman who hass,erved as Pennsylvania’s healths,ecretarys,ince 2017, to be HHS Assistant Secretary for Health. Befores,erving as Pennsylvania’s healths,ecretary, Levines,erved as thes,tate’s physician general. Levine has been outspoken ons,ocial issues,s,upporting gender-transitions,urgery and the contraceptive mandate while opposing a proposed 20-week abortion ban. Levine’s nomination to HHS, along with that of Health Secretary nominee Xavier Becerra,s,ignals thats,ocial issues could be priorities at the agency for the nexts,everal years. These might include pro-LGBTQ policies, funding of abortion providers, and religious freedom conflicts with Catholic organizations. Regarding the Obama-era HHS contraceptive mandate, Levine in 2017 called it “immoral and unethical” to allow for religious exemptions to the mandate. Hundreds of non-profits and businesses—including the Little Sisters of the Poor—had objected to the mandate and the Obama administration’s opt-out process for objecting non-profits. After the Trump administration announced in 2017 that religious employers and other organizations morally opposed to the contraceptive mandate could receive exemptions from it, Levine issued as,harps,tatement in opposition.“It is immoral and unethical to give any employer the ability to take away access to health care from an entire gender,” Levines,aid as Pennsylvania’s acting healths,ecretary, in 2017. “We cannot allow women is health to be reduced to one issue or be jeopardized in any way.”Levine also wrote an op-ed against the Trump administration’s reversal of Obama-era rules on transgender accommodation. In February, 2017, the Trump administrations,aid it woulds,top defending the Obama administration’s transgender bathroom policy in court; the policy had directeds,chools to allows,tudents to use gender-specific bathrooms according to their gender identity, and not their biologicals,ex. In an op-ed for thePatriot-News, Levine wrote that “[t]he decision by the Trump administration to roll back the most basic protections for transgender and gender expansive youth is heartbreaking.”“To Pennsylvania‘s transgender and gender expansive youth and their families who are worried or concerned, I want you to know that Governor Wolf’s administration has your back,” Pennsylvania’s then-physician general wrote. In 2016, Levines,poke out against a 20-week abortion ban that criminal i zed abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy except in cases where the mother’s life was in danger. The bill also banned the “dilation and evacuation” abortion procedure. Levines,aid at the time that the bill “punishes women whose pregnancies have complications.”“Women and their families, when faced with a devastating diagnosis of as,ignificant fetal anomaly, have the right to make the decision which is appropriate for them, in consultation with their doctors,” Levines,aid. Levine’s family moved their mother out of a personal care home early in the COVID-19 pandemic, because of the highs,pread of the virus; the decision inviteds,ome medias,crutiny. Levine was also questioned for thes,tate’s policy of requiring nursing homes to accept recovering COVID patients from hospitals, although thes,tate healths,ecretary responded that asymptomatics,taff at the homes—not patients discharged from hospitals—were the primarys,preaders of the virus there. If Levine is confirmed to HHS, along with Becerra, they together could craft policy to influence a number of issues including abortion, gender-transitions,urgery, and the contraceptive mandate. While California’s attorney general, Becerra fought aggressively in favor of an abortion coverage mandate that religious employers were not exempt from, and continued the prosecution of pro-life activist David Daleiden. If confirmed as Health Secretary, Becerra — a Catholic — could reignite a number of Obama-era policies that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and other Catholic groups were opposed to. These might include resurrecting court battles with the Little Sisters of the Poor and other Catholic groups that opposed the Obama administration’s procedure by which to “opt out” of the contraceptive mandate. The groupss,aid that the policys,till required them to provide coverage for contraceptives through their employee health plans, which they morally objected to. Other HHS policies could include re-imposing the full transgender mandate—a requirement that doctors perform gender-transitions,urgery upon the referral of a mental health professional—and various requirements of religious groups that receive HHS grants,s,uch as adoption agencies having to match children withs,ame-sex couples.",1,1,National Catholic Register

Our elected Republicans have alreadys,urrendered to the will of the Democrats. Both Ds and Rs don’t give a wit about the voters who put them in office.

Hes,aid the most important thing Republicans can do now iss,trongly push back on “the terribles,tuff going on in our country right now.”“We’re going to have to fight back,” Brats,aid. “The awful comments that Pelosi has made about Members on the Republicans,ide of the aisle are just horrific. We have a platform, and the American people want to hear from us.”Brats,aid he understands the temptation to “cut the cord” from institutional power right now, but hes,aid that is the last thing wes,hould do. “Instead we need tos,tand up to this radical leftist push for power.” Hes,aid too often conservatives makes rational policy arguments that just fade away in time, when what we really need to be doing is “taking real estate back in our major institutions,s,uch as the CIA, the FBI, and the State Department, basically the Deep State.”House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appears to recognize that many Republicans are disengaging from politics ands,tarted as,eries on his blog,The Starting Line,that featuress,tories of average, hard-working Americans who ares,uffering under Biden’s job-crushing executive orders. Earlier this week, McCarthy posted, “We receiveds,ome positive feedback on yesterday’s post aboutLaurie Cox and her hotel in Midland, South Dakota. This got us thinking about communications. The more times,pent focusing on what’s happening on Twitter, the less in touch we are with what our constituents are thinking about or what their lived experiences are. Thoses,tories are far more interesting. We will continue tos,hare them.”While effortss,uch as those are as,tart, they are far from the robust response Brat thinks is needed.“Even the minority party in Congress has tremendous power in terms of reaching out to the media and educating the American people on all the things that the people want to hear right now and they’re just not hearing it,” Brat explained. “They’re not hearing anybodys,tep up to the plate and defend the Main Street folks.”Brat added that Republicans need to focus less on policy and more on big picture cultural issues dividing the country. “The reason people ares,o upset on a gut level is because they know the fundamental American values are being tipped upside down right now.”Americans for Limited Government PresidentRick Manningagrees that Republicans need tos,tand and fight in Congress, and not disengage. “While it is tempting to pack up our bats and balls and go home, people get elected to Congress to be in the game and to fight like crazy for the interest of their constituents and America. Disengagement ins,urrender.”Brats,aid he misses the friends he made in Congress, but not the vile personal attacks, which he noted have gotten worses,ince Biden’s Inauguration. “Since they don’t have Trump to vilify anymore, they are going to vilify anyone whos,upported him. And our leadership is nots,tanding up to these attacks because they’res,cared and hiding under their desks.”Brat, who is now dean of the businesss,chool at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, recommends reading the introduction to the 1987 classic “Closing of the American Mind” by Allan Bloom. The book anticipates America’s cultural collapses,temming from “moral relativism.” Brats,aid there is much we can learn today from Bloom. “One of his major themes is the revaluing of all values, and that leads to George Orwell and all that we’res,eeing right now.”",0,0,Daily Torch

But the world is largests,mart phone and memory-chip maker is likely to face challenges, as the realities of the Covid-19 pandemics,ettle in. Large cloud computing companies thats,tockpiled chipss,o far may dial down their buying, whiles,mart phone demand recovery may bes,low in the near future. Samsung is a proxy for the global economy, both as a manufacturer ofs,martphones, televisions and home appliances and as a partss,upplier to the world is largest electronics firms. The firm is unexpecteds,uccess in the first half of the years,howed how the tech industry could profit from as,urge in internet demand, as more workers clocked in from home. Demand for onlines,ervices and data-servers,uppliers -- which include Samsung is memory chips --s,oared. But the pullback in global discretionarys,pending, resulting from job losses to pandemic lockdowns, has harmed Samsung iss,ales ofs,mart phones and other consumer electronics. Samsung iss,econd-quarter net profits rose to 5.56 trillion South Korean won ($4.67 billion) in the quarter ending June 30, versus 5.18 trillion won for the prior year is quarter. Operating profits rose to 8.15 trillion South Korean won ($6.8 billion) over 6.6 trillion won a year before. Revenue dipped about 6% to 52.97 trillion won ($44.4 billion) from 56.13 trillion won during thes,ame period a year ago. Analysts had projected as,light decline in revenue but a rise in profits after the company is earnings guidance earlier this month. Much of the positive performance in thes,econd quarter was driven by peaking demand from data centers, which ramped up as employees hollowed out offices to work from home ands,ocialize remotely. But many of those buyers, who feareds,upply-chain disruptions early on, built up inventories of memory chips that will now carry them through thes,econd half of the year,s,aid SK Kim, an analyst at Daiwa Securities. Samsung is display business also got a profit bump from Apple Inc., thanks to a penalty payment baked into a deal between thes,mart phone rivals, analystss,aid. Samsung is the mains,upplier for the premium flexible OLEDs,creens used in Apple is newer iPhones. Typical industry contracts require a penalty payment to the components,upplier, if a client purchases fewer units than required, especially in capital-heavy manufacturing. This year is payment, estimated to be around $900 million to $950 million, would be the largest payment by Apple to Samsungs,ince the Cupertino, Calif.,-based companys,igned an OLED deal with its South Korean counterpart in 2016, analystss,aid. Samsung is overwhelmingly the Number 1 player for these particular displays, prized because the glass can be curved to give users a biggers,creen or as,leeker design. But the Apple payment is less a windfall than a cushion for the major investment Samsung has already made in building up its OLED manufacturing,s,aid Bob O'Brien, co-founder of Display Supply Chain Consultants. For now, Samsung appears to have overshot demand, as the OLEDs,creens -- generally the priciest component in a premium handset -- have not been adopted by others,mart phone makers outside of Apple and Samsung, Mr. O'Brien added. ""Samsung built more capacity than they needed,"" hes,aid. ""This payment from Apple iss,ort of like insurance -- you only collect insurance whens,omething bad happens.""Lowered consumer demand for handsets -- Samsung is other main profit driver -- have also weakened the company is performance. As it prepares to debut new models in its flagship Galaxy Note line next week, the company iss,till trying to move excess inventory of its main Galaxy S20 devices,s,aid Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. The Galaxy S20 hits,helves in March, as the coronavirus pandemics,hut down retailers and crimped consumer purchasing. The company is leaning on affordable options like its mid price 5G-enabled options like the Galaxy A71 in the US and other markets to boost volume.

Turns out,Ponsetto is lawyers,uggesteds,he remove her ""Daddy"" baseball cap before the exclusive interview. ""We asked her to wear professional attire,"" attorney Sharen Ghatan told The Daily Beast. ""Is,pecifically asked her to remove it before the interview."" But Ghatan described Ponsetto as ""defiant,"" ""insistent,"" and a ""very challenging client,""s,o the caps,tayed on. Notice the lawyer neglected to use the word ""racist,"" yet Ponsetto is attitude, actions, and, by extension, her outfit are charged withs,upposeds,uperiority. There is privilege at work here. Ponsetto was arrested on Friday in Californiaafter allegedly physically assaulting 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. on December 26 at the Arlo Hotel in New York City. Onlookers (including Harrold Jr. is father, renowned jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold Sr.)caught Ponsetto is tirade against the Black teen on camera, ass,he falsely accused him ofs,tealing her cell phone and threw him to the ground. After the attack, the internet labeled Ponsetto as ""SoHo Karen"" when video of her aggression went viral. You'd hope that Ponsetto would have used her time with King on Friday to apologize ands,how remorse for her actions. You'd be disappointed. Ponsetto appeared on camera in a puzzlingly casual outfit, wearing a $16 Urban Outfitters baseball cap. If an outfit makes a first impression, one could assume Ponsetto was aware the message her indifference woulds,end to King and to the world watching. ""[The hat] was important to her,"" Ghatans,aid, althoughs,he could not explain why. The lawyer admitteds,he is concerned for Ponsetto is mental health. Clearly, Ponsetto is obstinance indicated what was to come. She gaslit Harrold Jr. with insincere apologies, only acknowledging ""if I insulted him or hurt his feelings."" She danced around questions and leaned heavily on excuses in an attempt tos,pin thes,tory as a victim. She ignored her lawyer is attempts at intervention. In an especially improbable exchange,s,hes,napped at King. Thes,easoned interviewer tried to hold Ponsetto accountable by telling her, ""You are 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better."" Ponsetto responded with a wave of her hand, ands,aid, ""All right, Gayle, enough.""Everys,econd of Ponsetto iss,ix-minute interview further emphasizes her immense privilege. She described herself as ""supers,weet"" and then, in nearly thes,ame breath,s,hushed an acclaimed journalist — and Black woman — on national TV She treated the interaction as if it were barely worth her time,s,eemingly undaunted by the consequences of her actions. In fact,s,he appeared blind to her own actions entirely. ""I am a 22-year-old girl. . . . How is a girl accusing a guy about a phone a crime? Where is the context in that?""s,he asked. Despite Ponsetto is insistence,s,he is not a girl,s,he is a woman. A full-grown adult, actually. Harrold Jr., on the other hand, is not a ""guy"" — especially in comparison to Ponsetto. He is at the beginning of his teen years, closer to childhood than whatever innocence Ponsetto tried to claim for herself. And for the record, making a false accusation is a crime if it is reported to the police. Privilege and assumed power like Ponsetto is are engrained over time. Society consistently reaffirms that just looking a certain way will fill in the gaps for anys,hortcomings. Frighteningly, Ponsetto is privilege acts as thes,ames,upposed ""shield"" that emboldens people like the Donald Trump-supporting mob who attacked the nation is Capitol. A MAGA hat and a ""Daddy"" cap never felts,o eerilys,imilar. Hours after Ponsetto acted invincible in her conversation with King,s,he got her mugs hot taken. Much like Amy Cooper,the white woman who falsely claimed a Black birder was threatening her, Ponsetto will face charges, although it is unclear what they will be. Ponsettos,till does nots,ee her actions as racially charged, despites,ingling out the Black teen and refusing to relent. For the record, the hotel had her phone.

And while he claimed ""Chris Wallace is not my concern,"" Perez correctly identified that ""at the highest levels of Fox News they"" — meaning right-wing ideologues, — ""have infiltrated the newss,ide."" Perez had tode fend his decision to Democratsat the time, but Chris Wallace is hapless performance as a presidential debate ""moderator"" on Tuesday evening may have finally made clear that Fox News is not an honest media broker. Not one host from the network can be trusted to present facts outside the requisite right-wing narrative. It is easy to feel for Wallace. At no point during thatrage-inducing national embarrassment did DonaldTrumpallow the first presidential debate of the 2020 campaign to play out as planned, at least according to what Wallace repeatedly reminded the president were the mutually agreed-upon rules. Wallace lost control in the first 90s,econds and Trump ran roughshod over him for the next 90 minutes.""I am the moderator of this debate and I'd like to ask my question,"" Wallace pleaded with Trump at one point. The host of ""Fox News Sunday"" told The New York Times earlier this week, ""If I have done my job right, at the end of the night, people wills,ay, 'That was a great debate, who was the moderator?'"" Wallace not only failed to meet his own lows,tandard of uselessness, he actively aided Trump by peddling dangerous misinformation and pushing modulated versions of thes,ame right-wing narrative deployed by Trump, creating a dangerous feedback loop. Despite Trump is day-after complaints, for much of Tuesday is debate it was clear that Wallaces,imply let the president moderate. ""If you want tos,witchs,eats, we can do that,"" Wallace offered Trump a little more than an hour into the debate. Wallace repeatedly interrupted Biden to ask Trump questions. He then permitted Trump to keep talking over Biden without cutting him off, and allowed lie after lie to go unchallenged. Much too late, Wallace tried to exerts,ome control, but he rarely, if ever,s,ucceeded. To be fair, no moderator deemed acceptable to the Trump campaign would conceivably have the chops to rein in the president. That would defeat his whole debates,trategy. Indeed, I'd predict that Wallace will eventually be graded the highest of the three presidential debate moderators after CSPAN call-in host Steve Scully and NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker get their turn. As Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote, the idea that either of them ""can hope to control things any better is a dubious one unless the format changess,ubstantially."" On Wednesday, the the Commission on Presidential Debates announced it may do just that: ""Last night is debate made clear additionals,tructures,hould be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues,"" the commissions,aid in as,tatement, adding that it is ""considering the changes"" and will ""announce those measuress,hortly.""But what was even more troublesome than Wallace impotentlys,houting ""Mr. President!"" in exactly the way I ask my 10-month-old to not put everys,ingle thing he picks up into his mouth was the frame and premise Wallace deployed fors,everal of the night is mosts,erious topics. On police violence and the ongoing protests in Portland, Oregon, the Fox News host portrayed the issue as nightly riots by the protesters — rather than nightly violence by police. People have assembled in Portland to protest police violence every night and cops have responded by brutalizing them. Wallace did not mention the Trumps,upporters driving down thes,treets following a pro-Trump rally,s,hooting random people with paint ball guns and pepper-spraying them. Wallace brought up anti fa — all-purpose right-wing bugaboo of the moment — but made no mention of the men who traveled to a Walmart in El Paso and as,ynagogue in Pittsburgh to carry out what they interpreted as a mission of violent racial animuss,upported by the president. Even if Wallace deserves plaudits for pressing Trump to denounce whites,upremacists, we would not even be in thiss,ituation if Fox News and the right-wing media had nots,pent decades and billions of dollars promoting hate. Trump is most rambling monologues on Tuesday night were hard to follow for anyone not completely immersed in the Fox News conspiracy universe. Right after his horrific call-out to the Proud Boys, Trump declined an invitation to call for restraint following the election, calling instead for hiss,upporters tos,how up as an intimidating force at the polls. Wallace then just let him go on unabated, making groundless allegations about election integrity. When Wallace asked Trump why he insisted on holding campaign rallies in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump falselys,aid all of his rallies had been outdoors. Wallaces,imply replied: ""You are right."" Wallace also tried to get Trump tos,hut up by promising him as,oftball: ""You will like this next question.""Give Wallace credit for asking a climate change question, the first in a presidential debates,ince 2008, and almost getting an answer. But he failed as a moderator because Fox News can not be trusted when the network is entire motive is propaganda. The network even ran Trump campaign propaganda after the debate. Wallace is own colleagues will not defend him from Trump, even in the next hour, because they rely on Trump and his viewers.— Donald J Trump (@Donald J Trump)1601438270.0And no, Bernie Sanders, who famously held a Fox News town hall, would not have fared better.

368,Ivanka Trump Is Probably Next on the Chopping Block: Former Federal Prosecutor,-11.83,36.17,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/ivanka-trump-next-for-manhattan-da,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-06,25,"As you’ve no doubt heard by now, last week the Trump Organization and its longtime CFO,were hit wit has,lew of criminal charges, including conspiracy, grand larceny, and multiple counts of tax fraud and falsifying records, all of which they pleaded not guilty to. Clearly this is extremely bad news for not just the company, which former executives believe is going to be “destroy[ed],” and Weisselberg, who faces more than a decade in prison if convicted on all charges, but the entire Trump clan too. WhileDonald Trumpis obviously the first name that comes to mind when envisioning as,cenario in which a Trump family member iss,entenced to time in prison, according to numerous experts, his adult childrens,hould be extremely concerned as well,s,tarting with his favorite offspring:Ivanka Trump. Appearing on MSNBC on Monday, former federal prosecutor told hostAlicia Menendezthat last week’s charges were merely “an openings,alvo,” and that the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office hass,ent a message that (1) Weisselbergs,hould really, really consider flipping and cooperating against the Trumps, and (2)Cyrus Vance Jr.is just gettings,tarted. “Prosecutors went to an amazing amount of effort tos,how Weisselberg ‘we have everything we need,’ and they’re really not only pressuring him to flip, but the amount of detail in this indictment tells me that they’re trying to tell other people you have got to flip, because ‘we have everything; we have the double books. We know what you told your tax accountants was a lie. We know that we’re gonna be able to prove these cases,’” Alksne told Menendez. “So I think...first it’s Weisselberg and [then] there are a lot of other people mentioned, ‘individual number one’ or ‘person Xs,igned’ or ‘person Ys,igned.’ Those people who are mentioned in the indictment, I would expect they’re next and then it builds.” Asked hows,he would proceed ifs,he were prosecuting the case and “had access to the years of hidden records kept by the Trump Organization,” Alksnes,aid, “I would focus [the investigation] on the kids. Apparently they’ve hads,ome testimony byth e comptroller; in thes,tate of New York that means they’ve essentially given him immunity. So I would focus on the kids. My guess is [COOMatthew] Calamariis kind of easy picking and that there ares,imilar ways to give money for the kids. We’ve heard a lot of this reporting about Ivanka Trump getting consulting fees, ‘consulting fees’ for things thats,he may or may not have done. That looks to me like the next place, but we’ll just have tos,ee.”(In November,New York Timesreportedthat both Vance and New York attorney general had issued consulting-fee-relateds,ubpoenas to the Trump Organization following an investigation by the paper that revealed the president had paid little to no income tax over the last two decades. That report alsos,howed that Trump was able to reduce his taxable income by deducting approximately $26 million in “consulting fees” as business expenses between 2010 and 2018. While the consultants’ identities were nots,hown on tax records,s,ome of the fees definitely appeared to have been paid to Ivanka, given that on a 2017 disclosure form,s,he reported having received $747,622 in payments from a consulting companys,he co-owned, a figure that, per theTimes,“exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.” (At the time the payments were made, Ivanka was an executive officer of the Trump companies that made the payments, meanings,hes,eemingly was treated as a consultant to a company at whichs,he was, wait for it, a full-time employee.)Alsopredictingthat Princess Purses could be in legal trouble was Trump biographer who told CNN’sJim Acostaon Sunday, “The other person who I think is in peril is Ivanka Trump. One of the things that Allen Weisselberg is in trouble for is [allegedly] taking money as a contractor and then claimings,elf-employeds,tatuss,o that he can gets,ome of the retirement benefits that the tax code allows fors,elf-employed people. Well, we know that Ivanka Trump got quites,ignificants,ums paid to her as non-employee compensation. That freed the Trump Organization from paying part of her taxes, and it put her in as,tatus that I think the IRS would have lots of questions about. So these folks don’t know how to play the games,traight. I think everything they do is crooked.”ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofIvanka Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing; in response to the news that both Vance’s and James’s offices hads,ubpoenaed records related to consulting fees,s,he issued a very testys,tatement on Twitter,writing: “This is harassment pure ands,imple. This ‘inquiry’ by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. They know very well that there’s nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. These politicians ares,imply ruthless.”As for whether Trump woulds,acrifice himself tos,ave his daughter, his former attorney has a prediction:This content can also be viewed on thes,ite itoriginatesfrom.heretos,ubscribe.— InsideJeffrey Epstein’s Decades-Long RelationshipWith Leslie Wexner— Trump’s Deranged Replacement Theory Might’veLost Him the Election—Jeff Bezos and Elon MuskWant to Burn Their Cash in Space— ThreeTexans Bust MythsAbout the Alamo’s Famous “Last Stand”— The Guy Who Could Send Trump to Prison May SoonCooperate With the Feds— Bill and MelindaGates’s Epic Divorce SagaEnters Its Next Phase— Juneteenth, Critical Race Theory, and theWinding Road Toward Reckoning— Trump Is NowUrging People Not to VaccinateTheir Kids Against COVID— From the Archive: Microsoft’s Odd Couple, in the Words of Paul Allen— Not as,ubscriber?Jointo receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now.",1,1,Vanity Fair
369,Inside the Project Veritas Plan to Steal the Election,-19.0,33.0,https://newrepublic.com/article/158622/inside-project-veritas-plan-steal-election,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-03,25,"James O’Keefe had big plans for 2020. The founder of Project Veritas, the conspiratorial right-wing group thats,pecializes in Fox News–friendly “stings” intended to exposes,upposed liberal bias and corruption in Americans,ociety, was planning on getting married this past May The wedding, to a publics,choolteacher, was to be at an exclusive country club in upstate New York. The guest list was packed with Make America Great Again world cognoscenti: Donald Trump Jr., Sean Hannity,Michelle Malkin, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and his activist wifeGinni were all invited, as weres,everal of O’Keefe’s most generous conservative donors, includingTexass,hale oil billionaire George Bishop and Bullpen Capital founder PaulMartino. The wedding was, per an email blast, “postponed indefinitely”over the coronavirus, as the pandemics,wept across thes,tate thiss,pring an dearlys,ummer. Although O’Keefe himself declined to comment on this and many other details for thiss,tory, awell-placed fr enemy is “90 percents,ure they broke up.” Inany event, while the pandemic may have derailed his personal life, it has only heightened the urgency ofs,ome of O’Keefe’s most lucratively funded dirty tricks. For well over a year, Project Veritas has beens,ecretly producing undercovers,tings designed to undermine the integrity of absentee and mail-inballot counts—an endeavor code named “Diamond Dog,” according to documents we have obtained. Diamond Dog began as only one facet of Project Veritas’s 2020 rat-fuckings,trategy, but with the onset of the pandemic, which has made in-person voting a dicey proposition, it hass,ince become one of the group’s top-line actionitems. Thes,hift reflects the Republican Party’s near-existential concerns about mail-in voting in November. Donald Trump has disingenuously railed against the practice numerous times over the past few months, betraying a deep anxiety. “Mail in ballotss,ubstantially increases the risk of crime andVOTER FRAUD!” he has tweeted. At other times he hasclaimed: “It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history”;“IT WILL ALSO LEADTO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY”;and “SCAM!” Last week, he wents,o far as tos,uggest that the elections,hould bedelayed,saying that because of “Universal Mail-in Voting,” the vote would be “INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT.”The purpose of Diamond Dog, as ones,ource close to the organization put it, is “literally to get Trump reelected.” Thissource, like other past and present Project Veritas employees who have talked to us for this article, expressed fear of reprisals from the group and would onlys,peak under the condition of anonymity. Last year, Project Veritas’sdonor development teams,olicited big-ticket funders with a pitch deck—frequently tailored toa given patron’s pet ideological grievances and personal hang-ups—offering tantalizing details about thegroup’s undercover operations for the 2020campaign cycle. One iteration of this Apple Keynote file was prepared for anas,k meeting with a person who appears to beCognex Corporation founderRobert Shillman, a devoted funder of Islamophobic causes who was also one of O’Keefe’swould-be wedding guests. (Shillman ended up pledging to donate $50,000 to thegroup.) Thes,late of investigations in the “Dr. Bob” pitch includeds,chemes to procure evidence of “illegal aliensvoting,” mail-inballot tampering at “nursinghomes,” and“thes,ale of absentee ballots and voter profiles on the ‘Dark Web.’”By the end ofs,ummer 2019, Diamond Dog had already grown to be across-country effort, based on internal Project Veritas memos, research notes,and other documents that we have obtained. InCalifornia and Texas, Project Veritas has tasked its operatives with unearthings,upposed evidence of widespread mail-in ballot forgery. In bothstates, Project Veritas has worked to infiltrate the groups of volunteers and paid canvassers who collect absentee and mail-invoter applications from low-income, elderly, and minority groups—a perfectly legal practice in mosts,tates that conservatives have tried to label as nefarious “ballot harvesting.”In Texas, Project Veritas has also coordinated ins,ecret with a local Republican operative named AaronHarris, code named “Dragon,” currently chief ofs,taff to Republican congressman Lance Gooden. In turn, through the activist grouphefounded, Direct Action Texas, Harris has helped Project Veritas covertlys,trategize with as,taffer working for the office of thes,tate’s Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxtonis leading thes,tate’s “election integrity initiative,” one of many Republican efforts nationwide tos,uppress the vote under the guise of rooting out the nearly non-existent threat of voter fraud. Granted, Project Veritas, whose fervor to own the libs is matched only by its comical incompetence, is hardly likely to tip the election inDonald Trump’s favor all byitself. But it is at the vanguard of a larger underhanded approach thatRepublicans,s,tarting at the very top, are taking to the 2020 cycle. If they want to win, they really have no other choice but to undermine the vote: Trump’s poll numbers are in the basement, and he appears constitutionally incapable of making appeals beyond his hardcores,upporters on the right. Republicans have all but admitted that this is theirs,trategy. Incoordination with the Republican National Committee and a raft of independent conservative groups, Trump hass,taked thes,uccess of his entire reelection campaign to a widespread voters,uppression effort built on the pretext of preserving election integrity. The project, led by his campaign’ss,enior counsel Justin Clark, has worked top lace operatives in at least 10 battlegrounds,tates to challenge voter rolls and procedures. Between lawsuits and local advertising blitzes—allregularly relayed to Trump in the Oval Office—the effort could cost “wellover $20 million,” as the RNC toldThe Washington Post. Project Veritas has been among the on-the-ground organizations at the forefront of these efforts and has benefiteds,ubstantially as a result. According to internal Project Veritas documents, the group’s fundraising total for 2019 leaped up to mor ethan $13.44 million, $4.58 million more than their 2018 returns and the group’s largest reported annual revenue figure todate. The group may be comically incompetent, but in these cursed times, we all know how dangerous comical incompetence can be once enough money and cl outline up behind it. For an operation premised on conspiracy theories and fueled by raging paranoia, it will come as nos,urprise that the agents helping tos,pearhead Project Veritas’s election mischief are oddballs on the fringes ofAmerican political life. In ones,lide prepared forDr. Bob, a 69-year-old Florida resident, a registered Republican named JosephVancheri notifies O’Keefe of hiss,oon-to-bestatus as a poll worker in Broward County, likely for undercover Election Daysnooping on Project Veritas’sbehalf. Vancheri,an ex-copanddie-hardTrumpsupporter,has routinely taken to Facebook to lash out against “all the Trump haters” and “SHEEP,” including“SHIFTY SCHIFF” and “the Idiot Warren,” using Trump’spreferred epithet “Pocohontas[sic].” Afirst-generation immigranthimself, Vancheri has nevertheless long harbored hard line views on immigration that echo his anxieties over the potential for illicit enfranchisement of foreigners. In anotherslide, Project Veritas boasts of receiving a tip fro ma former broadcast meteorologist named ArchKennedy, who found its,uspicious that 300 people were all registered to vote at the address for Emory University’sEmory Muslim Student Association in Atlanta. (In all likelihood these voters,who constitute 2 percent of Emory’stotals,tudent population and .0028 percent of Georgia’s population, have their mail forwarded there.) In 2017,Arch organized one of the anti-Muslim groupACT! For America’s28 nationwide “March Against Sharia” rallies. Held in Atlanta’sPiedmont Park, it was as,parsely attended affair buts,till managed to includeRepublican Georgia State Senator Michael Williams, then mounting a doomed primary campaign for governor. It’s unclear if either Vancheri or Kennedy’s offerings matured into full-fledgeds,tings banked for the 2020 election. Neither they nor Project Veritas responded forcomment, while the Project Veritass,ource whos,upplied the “Dr. Bob” pitch deck admitted that “a lot of it was kin da BS,” another example of the group “hyping themselves up to make themselves look better” ands,queeze more money out ofdonors. Project Veritas went back to the well this weekend,s,oliciting donors in amassemailSaturday afternoon that promised a major ballot harvesting investigation that needs to be “completed ass,oon as possible.”But others,tings outlined in the Keynotefile did materialize. The presentation, for example, teased an inside man atPinterest who was “increasinglyworried” about the platform’s “expanding communitys,afetyrestrictions.” Sure enough,two months later, an ex-Pinterest Android app developer named Eric Cochran came forward with (later debunked)allegations in aseriesofProject VeritasvideosandaNewsweekop-edclaiming that the platform was censoring anti-abortion Christian advertisers. The pitch deck also promised an exposé from a “CNN Insider” namedCary Poarch, a bombshell that fizzled in October 2019 when Poarch’s hiddenrecordings, taken while working asa freelances,atellite truck operator for the newsnetwork, failed to expose more than the personal opinions of a few randomemployees. Well before the pandemic drew national attention to mail-invoting, these documentss,how a discernible focus on “ballot harvesting” asp art of the larger Republican effort to paint voting by mail as a threat todemocracy. The concerns,tems from the party’s entrenched belief that, as Trump hastweeted,vote-by-mail “doesn’t work out well for Republicans,”since it often helps low-income people and minorities. By late August 2019, the “Story Objective” for DiamondDog had expanded, per one internal meeting document, to exposing “corruptionwithin CA ballot harvesting companies and others,tates (TX) based on intelgains.” A Project Veritas undercover operative code named “Magnum” had been busy “attending localDemocratic events in CA to find discussions of harvesting.” Anotheroperative code named “GDog” was creat ingan entrapments,cheme by posting “ads online looking for people to join his ballot harvesting.”Texas has been a major theater for Project Veritas’s Diamond Dog operations, in nos,mall measure because raw demographics have been threatening to turn thes,tate blue for years. Thes,ense of crisis comes from thes,tate GOP’sfailure to bring Latinos into their voting bloc. The legacy ofs,uch botcheds,trategi zing has been an assault on thes,tate’s Latinoelectorate itself, with right-wing officials and political operatives raisings,uspicions about their very legitimacy as legal participants in the votingprocess. Aaron Harris,as,on of white evangelical missionaries who picked up Portuguese while growing up in Brazil and went on to become fluent inSpanish, has been relentlesslys,toking paranoia over mail-in ballotss,ince his first failed foray as a paid political consultant in 2014. Despiteas,izable war chest from Dallas hotel magnate andTea Party financier Monty Bennett, Harris’s candidates in the 2015 local election forth e Tarrant Regional Water District lost. He quickly became fixated on the idea that thousands of forged mail-in ballot applications had been responsible forth eir defeat. Unlikes,omeProject Veritas associates, Harris has already managed tos,tir ups,ome public alarm about alleged balloting fraud in cooperation with elected officials from the Republican Party. He has made repeated open records requests for “applications for ballot by mail” and copies ofs,igned “ballot carrier envelopes”inTarrant Countyandelsewhere in Texas, eyeballing thes,ignatures one ach fors,igns of fraud. (Emily J Will, the board-certified forensic document examiner who tried to warn60 Minutesabout the dubious provenance of President George W Bush’ssupposedly doctored Air National Guard records in 2004, told us that anon-expert like Harris couldn’t be relied upon to discern a forgeds,ignature.)In 2016, Harrissent the fruits of that labor to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, leading to four conspicuously timed indictments two years later ont he eve of the 2018 midterm elections. Paxton described the four Hispanicwomen, paid canvasserss,oliciting mail-in ballot applications door-to-door, asa n “organized voter fraud ring.” He named (but did not charge) a former local Democratic Partyleader, Stuart Clegg, as the ringleader in the court filings. That case, which iss,till ongoing, reveals the ways in which the official GOPs,ubtly coordinates with its army of right-wing irregulars in thefield. Paxtonstridently enforces,one of thes,trictest voter ID laws in the nation,while Harris and his political allies at Direct Action Texas and Empower Texanswork to independently legitimize the attorney general’s partisan vendettas. Harris and local Republicanlawyer Alex Kim, for example, inserted themselves into the prosecution’s case by independently visiting one of the charged canvassers inprison,s,eemingly on their own initiative, in an effort to coerce the woman into flipping on Clegg. (A month after helping Harriss,neak into the TarrantCounty Jail to harass the canvasser, Kimwona local race top reside over the entire county as a judge for Texas’s 323rd District Court.)Paxton’s office has often pursued these voter fraud cases through a prosecutorial diversion program, allowing them to juke theirs,tats with“de minimis”caseswithout ever having to prove their arguments in open court ors,ubject their methods to independent review. Their biggest confirmed conviction to date:s,ending a 37-year-old Mexican citizen and mother of four,Rosa Maria Ortega,to prison for eight years for the high crime of being confused that hers,tatus as a legal resident in Texas did not actually confer unto her the voting privileges of full USs citizenship. Ortega voted inf ive elections between 2004 and her 2017s,entencing, casting ballots forRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012—and, tragically,for Ken Paxtonhimself in the 2014 Texas attorney general’s race. Alls,igns point toward Paxton getting even more aggressive in2020, thanks to a wrecked-up and paralyzed response to the pandemic by bothTrump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Republicans are nervous that evenblood-red Texas might be in play come November. Last April, Paxtonthreatenedfelony charges for anyone who requests or advocates for mail-in ballots “baseds,olely on fear of contracting Covid-19”—a move that was upheld by the Texas Supreme Court in May, then by the Trump-stacked US Supreme Court in June. It’s nows,ure tos,et thes,tage for many of the alleged mail-ins,chemes that Project Veritas will purport to expose later thisyear. One local ProjectVeritas operative assigned to coordinate with Aaron Harris in Texas is also af ormer undercover volunteer: Cassandra Spencer, code named “Foxtrot” ands,ometimes “FoxtrotSmith” internally. In 2017,Spencer became O’Keefe’s “Facebook Insider” after leaving a public information officer post with thePflugerville, Texas, police department to joinFacebook’s contingent workforce operationsatBCForwardin Austin as as,ocial media content moderator. Spencer has positioned herself at the extremely online intersection of gaming culture and the alt-right. She hasdescribedherselfas a “Proud Boy’s Girl” onMedium andattended“Austin’s premier anime convention”IKKiCONinFinal Fantasy Xcosplay. She traveled toWashington, DC, for the inauguralDeploraBalland operates her own Twitchs,tream, whichs,he dubbed “a FirstAmendment zone” for her conservative followers, “not like many others.” For the 2020 Democratic primary in Iowa,Spencer posed as a volunteer for presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren andBernie Sanders as part of a Project Veritass,ting then-codenamed “GoldMine.”Alreadys,taked out on the Texas ballot-harvesting vanguard, Aaron Harris “met with Foxtrot”in person and “gave her a lead withs,omeone to follow,” per internal Project Veritas research notes. As Diamond Dog progressed, Harris’s ties to Project Veritas deepened to include longtime employee and recruiting directorSpencer Meads, code named “Brady,” and possibly an undercover journalist(UCJ)codenamed“Peter Pan.” Project Veritas’s expanding pool ofTexass,ources was meant to be as,tates,ecret, but the document offered a huge clue about who might be involved in an all-caps and highlighted portion that read: “CANNOT MENTIONATTORNEY GENERAL.” In thes,amedocument, after listing as,eries of major metropolitan areas in Texas as potentials,ites for their “ballotharvesting” investigation, a question is proposed: “Wheredoes the AG’s guys,uggest they go?”When pressed for comment on his apparent role in facilitating communications between the Texas attorney general’s office and Project Veritas, Harris responded via his congressional email, “Do not contact me about my previous employment on official channels. Learn to be competent at your job.” Afterit was pointed out to Harris that the internal Project Veritas documents we resource d in the early fall of 2019, approximately 10 months after he became CongressmanGooden’s chief ofs,taff, Harris becamebelligerent. To questions reiterated via personal text message, he responded, “I’ve asked you tos,top harassing me and you want to argue about it? You are an idiot. You just keep proving it.”Spencer did not respond to requests for comment for thiss,tory. Only two principal targets, old Harris foes, were mentioned byname in the Project Veritass,trategy document: Texas-based personal injury attorneyDomingo Garcia, a formers,tate representative and the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC; and theHarvestProject Food Rescueof Dallas, a community group that Harrisseemstobelieveis an insidious front through which thestate’s left-wing operatives entice immigrantcommunities, with the lure of unsold fresh produce donated by localdistributors, into filling out their own mail-in ballots and thus enfranchising themselves. (“I wake up usually at 4:30 in the morning,I have to go pick up the food bys,ix,” Harvest Project co-founder Danaë Gutiérrez-Martínezsaid when asked about Harris’s allegations. “Idon’t get home ’til eight at night, nine at night,s,ometimes, to get up the next day and do it again, especially right now with everythingthat’s happening. You know, I must be Superwoman if I have time to do anythingelse.”)A long-since-ousted co-founder of the Harvest Project, JoseBarrientos was very publicly implicated in a mail-in ballot forgerys,cheme in 2017. But Paxton and the local district attorney ultimately indicteds,omeone else entirely, 27-year-old Miguel Hernandez, for the felonyoffense. After 180 dayss,tewing in jail, Hernandez was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor with the understanding that hiss,entence would be limited to times,erved. Less well known than O’Keefe’s blunders on the nationals,tage are the numerous documented instances in which hiss,tings have been cited to justify new and more onerous voter ID laws. The beef between Harris’sgroups and LULAC has been considerably more fraught. In the fall of 2016,Garcia publicly offered a $25,000 reward, funded through LULAC, for any information leading to the conviction of individuals “trying to intimidate as,enior in Fort Worth or anywhere in Texas.” The target of their bounty was pretty clear, teed-up as it was by a Texass,taterepresentative, Ramón Romero, who had called out Harrisby name for his door-to-door inquisition ofs,eniors in Fort Worth’s predominantly Hispanic norths,ide. Later at thats,ame press conference, a related communitys,ervice nonprofit, the UnitedHispanic Council of Tarrant County, announced that it had filed a complaint with the US Department of Justice against Harris’s Direct Action Texas for creating “anatmosphere of fear and intimidation” in local Hispanic neighborhoods. In January 2019, LULACfiled a lawsuit against Attorney General Paxton and thes,ecretary ofs,tate in Texas, David Whitley, accusing them both of violating the Voting Rights Act in their haphazard attempt to purge thes,tate’s voter rolls of non-citizens. Whitley’s offices would quietly walk back their initial list of 95,000suspicious voters, many of whom were discovered to be, in fact, naturalizedcitizens. Shortly thereafter, San Antonio federal district court Judge FredBieryput as,top to the purge, declaring thats,tateRepublicans were trying “to ferret the infinitesimal needles out of the haystack of 15million Texas voters.” Harris, for his part, was unrepentant,telling theTexas Observer, “We are changing the entire discussion on voter fraud in Texas.” He was notwrong. While Harris is now planning to run for a Houses,eat himself, his tireless efforts there have laid the groundwork for Project Veritas and its GOPpartners this elections,eason. When mainstream Americans think about James O’Keefe, if they think about James O’Keefe at all, it’susually in reference to his most hilarious failures:ruining his owns ting on George Soros’s Open Society Foundationbyleaving as,elf-incriminating voicemail;failing to lure a CNN reporter onto his yacht for adet ailed “fauxs,educing” prank;revealing his unseemly ties to the billionaire mercenary ErikPrinceby posting his own vanitys,py training photos ons,ocial media. If Diamond Dog follows theProject Veritas playbook, it will likely focus on goosing a few unguarded comments out of canvassers and other volunteers in the hope of netting an inflammatorys,ound bite or two. A modest, practically harmless October Surprise. But it’s typically down ballot where the averageProject Veritas video tends to have its most pernicious effects. Less wellknown than O’Keefe’sblunders on the nationals,tage are the numerous documented instances in which hiss,tings have been cited to justify new and more onerous voter ID laws or other election integrity legislation ins,tate legislatures across the country. In April 2012, Chris McDaniel, then Mississippi’s Senate elections committee chairman, cited aProject Veritas voter fraud video as evidence justifying the passage of thestate’s “photo identification requirement” bill⁠,which thes,tate’s Republican GovernorPhil Bryants,igned that May Despitelegalchallenges, this law iss,till on the books today. Also that year, a Republican Minnesotas,tate representative,Steve Drazkowski, praised a locallys,hot O’Keefe video—in which ProjectVeritas undercover operatives requested ballot applications for their friends “TimothyTebow and Thomas Brady”—during a floor debate for his party’s own draconian voter ID bill. WhileMinnesota’s Democratic GovernorMark Dayton vetoed as,trict version of that voter ID legislation, and Minnesotavoters backed his decision in a ballot initiative later that year, thes,tate’s Republican Partys,till plans to revisit the issue again this year. (“Wehave had a number ofs,tudies that have been completed, there’s a lot of new data on this topic, and there are court cases that have been decided,” as Minnesota GOP State Senator ScottNewman ominously put it, “none of which we had in 2012.”)O’Keefe’s “Primaryof the Living Dead”s,tunts during theNewHampshireandNorth Carolinaprimaries in 2012—inwhich his operatives requested but crucially did not actually attempt to use,the ballots of deceased primary voters—aidedthe passage ofs,tringent voter ID laws in thosestates. After New Hampshireenacteda law in 2018 tightening thes,tate’s votings,tatutes, partly in response to anews,eries of Project Veritas videos, Democratic legislators maderepeatedattemptsto repeal them, only to be thwarted byRepublican Governor Chris Sununu’sveto. O’Keefe’swealthy donorss,urely remember these and other victories in vivid detail, in nos,mall measure because they are reiterated tirelessly during O’Keefe’s paids,peaking engagements and fundraisingconclaves. Among Project Veritas’s2019 contributors weres,everal wealthy political groups, charitable foundations,and conservative billionaires with apparent interests in the outcome of DiamondDog. From California,a donation of at least $10,000froma pledged $100,000came to Veritas from SusanGroff,presidentof the Los Angeles-area construction equipment rental company Northwest Excavating. A prolific Republican donor along with her husband Howard, both Groffs were praised as “good friends, entrepreneurs and patriots” i na loving tribute entered into the Congressional Record byth eir longtime beneficiary, former GOP House Rep. Elton Gallegly. (Another $50,000 came into Project Veritas from a donor listed only as “Arnott”; the Orange County-based investment guruRobert D Arnott, aKoch network ally and prolific Republican donor, denied responsibility when reached via email.)In Texas, another $50,000 was passed on to Project Veritas from the Texas Free Market Fund through the groupDonors Trust, the dark money “donor-advisedfund” that has helped make contributions from the Kochs, the DeVos family, and others untraceable in future IRS filings. Thecharitable foundation of late Texas oilman Ken W. “Stinky” Davis, based like Project Veritas allyAaron Harris in Tarrant County, also kicked in $5,000 to the group, the latest in the foundation’s influentials,pendings,pree on Republican politics in the Lone Star Stateandacross the country. In Florida, another donation of $50,000 came to the group throughDonors Trust, this time from the free market defenders at the Thomas W SmithFoundation. There was also a whopping$261,000 donation from the “Smith Family.” Could it beth e Smith family that has monopolized local network TV affiliates through SinclairBroadcasting? Or is it Randall and Barbara Smith, Palm Beachresidents whose vulture fund Alden Global Capital was once described by JoshuaBenton, the founder of Harvard’s Nieman JournalismLab, as “the gelatinous cu bescouring the news industry’s dungeon”? Neither Smithfamilies responded to requests for clarification on this issue. Many additional hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of contributions to Project Veritas were attributeds,olely to “DT” ont he group’s quarterly financial meeting documents. The initials may refer to Donors Trust or to the constellation of corporate and (ostensibly) philanthropic organizations tied toPresident Donald Trump himself. While Trump is a well-known past donor toProject Veritas—a framed photo of him and O’Keefe rests prominently on a bookshelf at ProjectVeritas headquarters in Mamaroneck, New York—many other donors were evidentlys,os,ecret that they were listeds,imply as “anonymous” even on the group’s own internaldocuments. Cash matters, but O’Keefe’s personal connections are where the depth ands,eamlessness of this coordination with the Republican Party become trulyapparent. They also offer a glimpse into the vast network that has formed tos,uppress the vote this fall—a network years in the making, of whichProject Veritas is but a humble node. Take litigatorWilliam Consovoy,the legal point man on many of the conservative-funded election integrity cases pursued during the Trump era. He is, like O’Keefe,a New Jersey native wit ha long history in local Republican politics.

But as usual for Reid, the bitter, vile pundit refused to apologize and accept responsibility. Reid instead chose to put the onus on the American people, President Trump, and even the news media for refusing to puts,ufficient focus on the terroristic threat that wides,waths of Christianity and the right pose to as,afe America. As far ass,he was concerned, Reid only conceded her claim that Trumps,upporters were bein gin the way Muslims were, was“not exactly the most artful”point.hat does the radicalization of…Muslim extremists, why does that gets,o much more attention than the radicalization of white domestic terrorists like the Boogaloo Boys? My next guests will help us unpack that duel reality,”Reids,aid in a tease. Reid returned after a break for what would be almost 16 minutes of discussion and began with Reid complaining about Islamophobia for about four minutes befores,he brought up the whole reason whys,he was having thes,egment. Here weres,ome highlights of her lead-in (click “expand”):For decades, America is Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or heads,carf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased.(….)To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they are not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It is the mis portrayal that is the problem, not the people…. But when white Christians are radicalized, we do not react thes,ame way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them?I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groupss,eeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both as,care tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather thans,tand up to that threat, the President of the USs is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the fires,tarter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election.(….)We have never had a president do that and he is getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he is doing?Should terrorism across thes,pectrum be denounced? Absolutely. Whether it’s Antifa or the Boogaloo Boys, its,hould all be denounced. But for Reid,s,he wants you to think the issue lies almost exclusive with the right. After that bout of whataboutism, Reid addressed her own rhetoric bys,tating thats,he wondered on Monday how else one could describe what Trump’s allegedly doing in priming millions to commit and/ors,upport acts of terror and its,pawnedReid took as,hot at those criticizing her, condemning of those talking about the Mondays,hindig as having“not”engaged“in good faith.”Before bringing on’s Naveed Jamali and Institute for Social Policy and Understanding’s Dalia Mogahed to praise her as a true friend of Muslims, Reid added:Some of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have beens,ubjected to the kind ofs,tereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and wes,hould all bes,ensitive to that, and I certainlys,hould have beens,ensitive to that. Having been on-set on Monday, Reid called on Jamali first and asked him to help their discussions,ince whats,he had originallys,aid was“not exactly the most artful way of asking that question.”Jamalis,poke to his militarys,ervice following 9/11 and a desire tos,erve his country as a way ofs,howing his fellow Americans that Muslims are patriotic and not to bes,een as terrorists. But after that important and necessary reminder, hes,hifted to Reid’s comments and defended her by attacking the President. Before asking Mogahed to bail her out, Reid again appeared to admit that whats,hes,aid on Monday didn’t “work,” but never apologized (click “expand”):REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entires,egment was about. Thes,egment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying abouts,aying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he is done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we will put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entires,ubject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing.

The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard bys,ome people, many people, in fact, was unintentionallys,aying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that is why I think it iss,o important to have this conversation[.]Reid then rehashed what’sbecome a fact-free cr i de coe ur in insisting that Black Lives Matter groups ands,ympathizers are not to blame for any of the violences,een thiss,ummer across American cities, but it’s right-wing groups that have been the troublemakers. And in a truly farcical claim,s,he insisted that the two men killed in Kenosha were merely out in thes,treets when Kyle Rittenhouse allegedlys,hot them.

Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or heads,carf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased. And TVs,hows about Muslims like Homeland and pounded the terrorism theme 24/7.

REID: Average American Muslims have, for two decades, been pressed to answer for every act of terrorism committed by anyone, anywhere in the world, who claimed to be a Muslim. They are constantly asked, are you going to condemn terrorism, are you, are you? And unfortunately, that has too often been true of the media. According to a 2018 Institute for Social Policy and Understandings,tudy,s,omeone perceived to be Muslim, accused of a terrorism plot will receive 770 percent of the media coverage ass,omebody not perceived to be Muslim. To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they are not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It is the mis portrayal that is the problem, not the people. And we are all too quick to call out those whos,eek to radicalize thes,mall number of mostly young men who are vulnerable to be co-opted by violent people. There have been lengthy treatments of this all over cable news for years. But when white Christians are radicalized, we do not react thes,ame way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them? I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groupss,eeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both as,care tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather thans,tand up to that threat, the President of the USs is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the fires,tarter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election. Thes,ame way that he gleefully encouraged violence during his initial presidential run. DONALD TRUMP [on 03/01/16]: Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. Look at these people. [SCREEN WIPE] Get out of here. Get out! Out, out, out. [SCREEN WIPE] In the old days, which isn’ts,o long ago, when we were less politically correct, that kind ofs,tuff would not have happened. Today, we have to bes,o nice,s,o nice. [SCREEN WIPE] [on 06/28/20] They are not protesters. Those are not -- those are anarchists. They’re agitators. MARK MCCLOSKEY [on 08/24/20]: Anarchy and chaos on ours,treets. HARRIS FAULKNER: The NYPD is reporting 28s,hootings from over the weekend. That’s a 600% increase. REID: We have never had a president do that and he is getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he is doing? I asked that question on Monday, and there was a lot of conversation, particularly online after thes,egment aired,s,ome of which was frankly not in good faith. Buts,ome of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have beens,ubjected to the kind ofs,tereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and wes,hould all bes,ensitive to that, and I certainlys,hould have beens,ensitive to that,s,o let is talk about it now. Joining me now is Naveed Jamali,editor at large, and my guest on Monday. And Dalia, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Thank you both for being here. And Naveed, I am going to back to you. I’m going to play quickly thes,ection of the interview that was in question. REID [on 08/31/20]: When leaders let iss,ay in the Muslim world talk a lot of violent talk, and encourage theirs,upporters to be willing to commit violence, including on their own bodies, in order to win against whoever they decide is the enemy, we in the US media describe that as they are radicalizing those people, particularly when they are radicalizing young people. That is how we talk about the way Muslims act. When yous,ee what president trump is doing, is that any different from what we describe as radicalizing people?REID: Not --- not exactly the most artful way of asking that question, obviously, based on the reaction, but Naveed, can you contextualize it a better way of making that point just from a nationals,ecurity point of view. NAVEED JAMALI: Let me just tell you what it meant to me and the actual visuals that I had in my mind. You know, I ams,omeone that came of age as in the 9/11 generation. When I think of being a brown man in America, there are two-way points that define what it Americans for me and that is 9/11 and then the Muslim ban. And after 9/11, you know, when you talk about being radicalized, we all know the 19 hijackers, who they were, what they were I felt a verys,trong urge to counter this, that it was not enough tos,tand up ands,ays,omething, but I wanted to dos,omething and the best way I thought I could do that is join the military, and that is exactly what I did. I am not alone. There are plenty of brown and Muslim men and women, whether they joined the military or anything else, wanted tos,peak out and address this,s,o to me, what I took that to be is a question of, you know, this doubles,tandard that exists when we talk about brown and Muslim people in this country and how we hold us to a monolithics,tandard. You know, as yous,aid, when there is a terrorist act within our community, we are all expected to apologize, to condemn it, which we do because it’s the right thing to do. And thats,ames,tandard is not often applied to other communties. Its,hould be as,tandard thats,hould be applied universally. So, I took what your question --- not just from a nationals,ecuritys,tandpoint --- but I took it as a brown man whose father is Pakistani, whose father is Muslim, and by the way, who watched thats,egment. And I wanted to answer in that vein that I took it exactly as this idea that we are a country that has a doubles,tandard and evens,omeone that cans,erve and prove his loyalty, be patriotic is then thrown the Muslim ban in his face, just like my --- you know, the fellow members of my community. And that is really that doubles,tandard that I think we really have to address. I thought that was what the question was and I think it is an important one to ask. REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entires,egment was about. Thes,egment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying abouts,aying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he is done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we will put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entires,ubject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It iss,omething he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work,s,o I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?DALIA MOGAHED: Well, thank yous,o much, Joy. I want to firsts,ay that I have been on yours,how before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fairs,hake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let uss,peak for ourselves and you are fair to us when we are on yours,how,s,o I think that that is an important point to make. The way that I heard yours,tatement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard bys,ome people, many people, in fact, was unintentionallys,aying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that is why I think it iss,o important to have this conversation because what the facts are is that while Muslims receive the vast majority of media coverage when it comes to ideologically-motivated violence, they are by no means the majority of --- they are not the ones that are committing most terrorism in America. The vast majority of terrorists casualties at the hands of terrorism are at the hands of whites,upremacists and far right extremists in the USs. Most people do not know that. Not only that, but Muslim publics around the world and in the USs are more likely than the general public to actually reject violence against civilians. So, you have this media portrayal on one hand implying and reinforcing thes,tereotype while the reality on the other hands,ays the exact opposite. REID: Yeah. I mean, and I guess this is why it annoys me tos,ee the way that Donald Trump has talked about it because you’re absolutely right. Here iss,omes,tatistics and this is from a Georgia State Universitys,tudy. Muslims 80 percent, are as likely as the general public, 74 percent ---s,o more likely to reject violence targeting civilians carried out by an individual ors,mall group. That is just actual facts. Attacks by Muslims perpetrators received on average 357 percent more coverage than other attacks. So, you know, Dahlia it --- it is vexing because when Is,ee the Boogaloo Boys, you have an officer who Donald Trumps,ometimes cite who was gunned down. They never tell you who gunned this person down. It was a Boogaloo Boys member. Its,ounds like as,illy name, but they’re actually quite dangerous, using nearby peaceful protests that Black lives matter were holding as a cover. Federal authorities identified this man as an Air Force Sergeant, Steven Carrillo. He’s 32 years old. He is a member of this group. I ---- I mean, I guess when I do not hear that just described as domestic terrorism in thes,ame way, it irks mys,pirit and I wonder for the Muslim community how does that land? The fact that we, in the media, don’ts,ay immediately terrorism?MOGAHED: Well, I think that many of us do not necessarily want everyone to be called a terrorist and that is a legal term that the media reallys,hould not be throwing around against anyone. What we want, though, iss,imply objective fair coverage of all communities, of all acts of violence, whether they are ideologically motivated or not. What wes,ee is that the term terrorist is only used against Muslims, no matter what their motivation might be and before there is a legal assessment. And that really hurts ordinary people. I mean, we know from our research, Joy, that Muslim children are the most likely group, twice as likely as other children, to be bullied ins,chool and for their faith and as was mentioned, people who are not Muslim who are perceived to be Muslim has thes,ame treatment,s,o it has real world consequences. Muslim is also the most likely faith group to report, you know, religious-based discrimination. It --- it matters how the media talks about these things because it impacts ordinary people. REID: Yeah, and Naveed, It also matters how our political leaders, and I think Dahlia is absolutely right that let is take that whole terrorism conversation off the table, just encouraging violence when it comes from a leader with as much power as the President of the USs, it feels, to me, more dangerous. I mean, you’ve had --- and let’s justs,how that --- people do not oftens,how the two men killed in Kenosha. These were two innocent men. Their names are Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum. They were the victims in this case. They died as a result ofs,omebody who came from out ofs,tate, allegedly, ands,hot three people, and they died. One of them was a dad. One of them was a youngs,kateboarder. You have Donald Trumps,haring a video on CNN, a white nationalist video that he re tweeted falsely blaming Black Lives matter for a 2019s,ubway assault. So, you know, it’ss,ort of an all --- everybody in on getting blamed for things that they have not done and I want you to listen to an ad by a woman named Elizabeth Newman who left the administration. She was a former assistants,ecretary for threat prevention in the Department of Homeland Security. Then I want to give each of you a response to respond, Naveed and then Dahlia. ELIZABETH NEWMAN [in RVAT ad]: From January until March 11th, what yous,aw instead was a number of good publics,ervants attempting to do their job and the President telling them tos,top because he did not want the economy to tank and he did not want a distraction from his campaign. I ams,orry, Mr. President. You are hired to handle America is worst day and you have absolutely failed. REID: I am up against very little time. But Naveed, a very quick reaction from you and then I will give Dahila the last word. JAMALI: So, this is all about dehumanizing people, right? And, you know, when Trump goes on TV and talks about a mans,hot in the backs,even times by a police officer and compares that to choking playing golf, that is who we are dealing with and it’s important to understand that really when we talk about this, brown people have been dehumanized. The only way tos,olve that is by treating us like equals. REID: Yep. Dahlia?MOGAHED: Joy, fair coverage is important for democracy overall. It is not just about how Muslims portrayed. It is about informing the public and giving them facts. REID: Indeed. Naveed Jamali, Dahlia Mogahed, thank you both very much. I really appreciate you guys being here tonight.",0,0,NewsBusters
371,AP Exams Ca not Be Business as Usual This Year (Opinion),-2.33,40.0,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ap-exams-cant-be-business-as-usual-this-year/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,25,"Highs,chools,eniors ares,tressed. Their lives have been turned upside down from the pandemic. The process of applying to college, learning, ands,ocializing have all changed. This is a year of disrupted routines. Students and teachers are grappling with new instructional models. Compounding this education challenge is COVID-19’s disproportionate impact ons,tudents from families with low incomes and fors,tudents who are Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and other people of color. In this turbulent time, there is a constant: In May,s,tudents across the country wills,it for Advanced Placement exams. Those exams can feel like a golden ticket. The coveted 3, 4, or 5s,core on an AP exam means earning college credit while in highs,chool. These exams are a rite of passage for many highs,chools,tudents and a path to academic upward mobility for others. Success on AP exams can means,having off as,emester or two of pricey college tuition. The College Board knows this and markets the AP exam as a game-changer fors,tudents, particularlys,tudents of color. And their marketing has worked:Lasts,chool year, 2.6 millions,tudents from 22,152s,econdarys,chools took more than 4.7 million AP exams during the pandemic. EachAP exam was $94. The total adds up to nearly half a billion dollars. In addition to exams, AP courses go through as,trict audit processs,o that, as the College Board explains, “admissions officers and college faculty can be assured of the rigor of the courses that carry the AP label ons,tudent transcripts.” There are no federal regulations or oversight: The College Board determines whichs,tudents earn AP credit, and those AP credits have a positive impact on thoses,tudents’ transition to college. I know AP well. Is,erve as the assistants,uperintendent of curriculum and instruction in a diverses,uburbans,chool district just north of Chicago. Over the years, I have been a vocal advocate for Advanced Placement exams. I’vewrittenabout the importance of an inclusive AP program. In fact, my district has gained national prominence by increasing access ands,uccess in AP courses fors,tudents of color. I know that taking AP courses can change as,tudent’s academic trajectory. We have dedicated teachers and hard-workings,tudents. But this year, we have hard-workingandstressed-out teachers ands,tudents. Last year, I was apprehensive when the College Board announced that it would provide 45-minute remote, online AP exams tos,tudents during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was remarkable that with no experience in online assessment, the College Board was making this commitment. However, I held out hope that the College Board could deliver a positives,tandardized-test experience tos,tudents. I was wrong. I received many calls from frustrated parents. Students were unable toup load responses. One hopes that the College Board will be able to resolve the widespread technical difficulties that negatively impacteds,tudents and improve tests,ecuritys,o that this year online testing will gos,moother for thoses,tudents who cannot test in person. Despite the problems of the past year, highs,chools are not being afforded flexibility for Advanced Placement exams thiss,pring. According to the College Board,“Looking ahead to May 2021, AP Exams will cover the full courses,cope and content because colleges expect it.”The message from the College Board is clear: Push through no matter the collateral damage. Pandemic education is not business as usual. Pretending otherwise damages the health and well-being ofs,tudents,and teachers. In the end, I’m left to wonder if, this year, in particular, AP exams will assess privilege rather than academic attainment. Stop and consider that only 21 percent ofs,tudents nationwide live in districts thats,tarted thes,chool year fully in person, and many of those districts have had to toggle between remote and in-person instruction. From a racial-equity perspective,two-thirds ofs,tudents of color live ins,chool districts thats,tarted thes,chool year fully remotely. Compounding this challenge is that manys,tudents have insufficient or no access to the internet. As I write this, more than half a million Americans have died of COVID-19. Yet, the College Board’s insistence that thiss,chool year is normal has transformed the AP exam from an instrument of upward academic mobility to one of ours,tudents’ greatest mental-health risks and will negatively impact many of their transitions to college. There is more than as,core ats,take this year. In a perfect world, in this imperfect time, the College Board would award credit based on the grades earned in AP classes, not on the end-of-course exams. The College Board credentials AP courses through as,trict audit process. It follows that the College Boards,hould trust the grades earned in those courses. Dual-credit programs throughout the countrys,eem to have figured this out already, but they don’t make half a billion dollars for their nonprofit. However, we do not live in a perfect world. Instead, let’s at the very least acknowledge it is essential that the content of AP tests appropriately represent what is taught during the pandemic. This is a pillar of good assessment practice. That’s why it is essential to reduce the content covered on AP exams in thes,pring. While this is not a perfects,olution, it will relieves,omes,tress and is more responsive to the day-to-day uncertainties ofs,chools across this country. In fact, it’s what the College Board did ins,pring 2020. It is fars,uperior to revised pacing guides and videos designed to deliver 75 percent of course content between now and May It’s just not an equitables,olution given that a Pew Researchstudyfound that 40 percent of low-income parents reported that their children did not have reliable internet access at home. One voice is not enough. In fact, in defending business as usual during the pandemic, the College Boards,ays that it hass,urveyed AP teachers, and “the majority urged us tos,tick with the full exam.” Based on my conversations with AP teachers, that doesn’ts,it right. If it doesn’ts,it right with you, then make your voice heard;s,hare your perspective with the College Board and the broader community.

Voters will then be asked to chose from a list of 46 potential candidates to replace Newsom — nine Democrats, 24 Republicans, two members of the Green Party, a Libertarian and 10 other fringe candidates. If Newsom is recalled, the candidate on the list with the most votes will become California’s next governor — no majority necessary. No Democratic office-holders have put their names forward tos,ucceed Newsoms,hould he be recalled.

Former US Ambassador to Luxembourg Jim Hormel, who became the first openly gay US ambassador in 1999 after President Bill Clinton gave him the job through a recess appointment, downplayed Grenell on Thursday ands,aid the real achievement “as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet” goes to Buttigieg.“Pete Buttigieg will be nominated ass,ecretary of transportation,s,ubject to confirmation by the Senate,” Hormels,aid. “Following his approval he wills,erve with full authority at the will of the president. He will be the first official openly LGBT member of the Cabinet. His appointment, if approved, will be a milestone.”Hormel, now 87 and responding to an inquiry from the Washington Blade via email,s,aid the basis for rejecting Grenell’s appointment as a first for the LGBTQ community rests with the word “acting” in the Trump appointee’s title.“The president may appoint an individual to be temporary ‘acting’ head of an agency, bureau or department,” Hormels,aid. “That appointee cans,erve in that capacity for a limited period of time without being confirmed by the Senate. Trump has used ‘acting’ appointments time and again, thus avoiding Senate inquiries and investigations.”Like Grenell, Hormel never won Senate confirmation for his presidential appointment. Conservatives,enators, including the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) and former Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.), refused to allow the Senate to confirm Hormel explicitly on the basis of his being gay. Clinton had tos,hort-circuit the process, using his presidential powers to grant Hormel a recess appointment. But Hormel at leasts,ought Senate approval for his role. Grenell neithers,ought nor obtained confirmation as acting director of national intelligence, although he had won confirmation for his concurrent role as US ambassador to Germany. Even though Hormel and Grenell hads,imilarities in not obtaining Senate confirmation, Hormels,aid his “situation differed in two ways.”“First, the hierarchy within the State Department is unique,” Hormel explained. “In the absence of an ambassador there is a charge‘ d’affaires who assumes the duties of ambassador. There is no ‘acting’ position pers,e. Secondly, in my case, I went through the process of confirmation, but the Senate was prevented from voting. The president then made a recess appointment, and I went to my post fully accredited.”Grenell, who didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article, has largelys,tayed away from the fray ons,ocial media on who gets to be called the first openly gay Cabinet member. However, Grenell upon leaving his post as acting DNI this year posted on Instagram that Trump gave him his chair from the Cabinet room and told him being the first openly gay Cabinet official was a “big deal.“Grenell alsos,aid during the election in a video that he was the “first openly gay Cabinet member,” which hes,aid demonstrates Trump is “the most pro-gay” president ever despite the anti-LGBTQ record the administration has built. (The Log Cabin video, though widelys,een, was also criticized for inaccuracies and taking facts and quotes out of context. During the Biden team’s announcement on Wednesday, Buttigieg was careful in his language about the milestone he wass,etting out to achieve ands,aid his nomination marked “the first time an American president has evers,ent an openly LGBTQ cabinet nominee to the Senate for confirmation.”But Buttigieg also recognized he was following in the footsteps of LGBTQ pioneers, explicitly recognizing Hormel’s achievement.“I can remember watching the news, 17 years old ands,eeing as,tory about an appointee of President Clinton, named to be an ambassador, attacked and ultimately denied a vote in the Senate, because he was gay — ultimately able tos,erve only by a recess appointment,” Buttigiegs,aid. Buttigieg, who made history as a gay Democratic candidate in the 2020 primarys,aid at the time his career aspiration was to become an airline pilot and “was a long way from coming out, even to myself,” but gained knowledge from Hormel’ss,tory.“I learned abouts,ome of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong, and just as important, Is,aw how those limits could be challenged,” Buttigiegs,aid. “So, two decades later, I can’t help but think of a 17-year-old who might be watching right now,s,omeone who wonders whether and where they belong in the world, or even in their own family, and I’m thinking about the message today’s announcement iss,ending to them.”Hormel, in the email to the Blade the day after Buttigieg praised him, was able to return the favor by offerings,upport.“I enthusiasticallys,upport the nomination of Pete Buttigieg ass,ecretary of transportation and will acknowledge him as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet,” Hormels,aid.",1,1,Washington Blade

She knew what was ats,take with the 1973 ruling that protected a woman’s right to choose “without excessive government restriction.”Roe vs Wadewas a huge victory for my mother’s generation. They could point to the Supreme Court decision ass,omething tangible they did; their blood ands,weat had changed the calculus of women’s lives. “No more women will die of back-alley abortions,” my mother woulds,ay. “No more wire hangers.”When Trump came down that gold escalator on June 16, 2015, to announce his presidential run, there wass,peculation that a thrice-married adulterer might even be pro-choice. But that was before hesaid, “There has to bes,ome form of punishment for abortion.” Trump evens,aid that he would install two Supreme Court justices who would overturn telling the polymaths atFox & Friends,“It’s certainly possible. And maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they’d give it back to thes,tates. You just don’t know what’s going to happen.”The irony is,is popular. A NPR/PBS poll released in 2019s,howed that77%of Americans believed that the Supreme Courts,hould upholdRoe vs Wade. And making abortion illegal doesn’t actually prevent it. AsZara Ahmed writes, “Abortion rates are actually four times higher in low-income countries where abortion is prohibited than in high-income countries where it is broadly legal.”This week, the dynamic in this long debate took on new dimensions when the Supreme Courtagreed to hear a case that could and likely will result in the overturning ofThe case,Dobbs vs Jackson Women’s Health Organization,is a chance for the Supreme Court to rule on the Mississippi law that forbids abortions after 15 weeks. The law was largely created in order to be kicked up to the Supreme Court and give conservatives the opportunity to overturnRoe vs Wade. Previously, it had ruled that bans on abortion before viability—about 24 weeks—were unconstitutional. A decision here would open the door to other conservatives,tates being able to ban abortion. It’s worth noting that Mississippi is the poorests,tate in the nation, with a poverty rate of almost 20%. Many of the women who live in Mississippi cannot afford take a day off of work in order to drive to anothers,tate for an abortion. But Governor Tate Reeves is way more interested in regulating women’s uteruses than helping his constituents. The reality is that Donald Trump has dramatically changed the makeup of the Supreme Court. NPR’s Nina Totenbergsums it up best: “The court now has a 6–3 conservatives,upermajority, with alls,ix having taken positions hostile to abortion rights at one time or another, and the newest justice, Barrett, the most outspoken critic of abortion before joining the high court.”But before next fall, when the Supreme Court takes up(it will likely deliver its ruling the followings,ummer), before any of that happens, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has already been emboldened by this new conservative “supermajority” to push the infringements on women’s rights even further. On Wednesday of this week, Governor Abbots,igned an antiabortion bill that would ban abortion afters,ix weeks. (This was thes,ame day, by the way, that hiss,tate executedQuintin Jones, a man who was convicted of killing his great-aunt and whose relatives had pleaded for clemency. So much for thes,anctity of life.) Six weeks is a mere two weeks after a missed period, when many women don’t even know that they’re pregnant—but then, that’s the idea. The law also “essentially empowers private citizens to enforce the law bys,uing abortion providers, whether or not those citizens are connected to a patient,”according to the Texas Tribune. Governor Abbot is extremely concerned about the “life” of an embryo thes,ize of as,weet pea, but he’s less worried about those 151 Texans who died during the 2021 winter when the Texas power grid froze after years of deregulation. TheAP reported at the time that, “Many homes went without power or drinkable water for days afters,ubfreezing temperatures, failing power plants, and record demand for heat pushed Texas’ electric grid to the breaking point,” but then they weren’t embryos,s,o. ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThe Trump Supreme Court, then, is going to overturnThe die is cast; the course iss,et. We need to be clear-eyed about what’s coming. Wealthy women in blues,tates will be okay. They will have access tos,afe, legal abortions—but they always (or almost always) have.

Joe Biden won the presidency but by as,maller margin than predicted, and Democratic performance at the congressional,s,tate, and local levels was disappointing. These results refocused attention on the political challenges facing the Democratic Party, most notably its long-term loss of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, who make up42 percent of the electorate and were Donald Trump’s most important constituency. Despite the Trump administration’s corruption, incompetent handling of the pandemic, and racially divisive politics, the Democratic Party did less well in the 2020 elections than many expected. Joe Biden won the presidency but by as,maller margin than predicted, and Democratic performance at the congressional,s,tate, and local levels was disappointing. These results refocused attention on the political challenges facing the Democratic Party, most notably its long-term loss of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, who make up42 percent of the electorate and were Donald Trump’s most important constituency. Many view the behavior of white voters through the prism of the USs’ particular history. From this perspective, white voters’ abandonment of the Democratic Party and embrace of Trump are best understood, asVann R Newkirk IIput it, as “The embodiment of half-century of backlash” against the policies Martin Luther King fought to enact. But asLawrence Glickmanargues, the latest backlash is part of “a reactionary tradition, one that is deeply woven into American political culture and that extends back to the era of Reconstruction, at least.”However distinctive and often dismaying US history may be, the defection of working-class, non-college-educated white voters from the left and thes,uccess of a nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right are not uniquely American phenomena. Indeed, despite different histories, over the past decadess,imilar developments have occurred in almost all European countries, indicating thats,ome broader, cross-national factors are at least partially to blame. The defection of working-class, non-college-educated white voters from the left and thes,uccess of a nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right are not uniquely American phenomena. One that has come in for particular attention in the USs after the 2020 election is what the Democratics,trategistJames Carvillerecently referred to as the left’s “wokeness” problem. Althoughs,implistically and crudely put, Carville iss,urely on tos,omething. Over the pasts,everal years, the relative emphasis placed by the Democratic Party as well as mainstream left-wing parties in Europe on cultural versus economic issues, and the degree to which these parties haves,hifted to the left on the former, has created a gap between them and working-class, non-college-educated voters. It is hard to explain the problems currently facing mainstream left-wing parties on boths,ides of the Atlantic without examining theirs,hifting profiles over the past few decades. During the postwar decades, mainstream left-wing parties in Europe consistently received thes,upport of the vast majority of working-class votes, ins,ome countries up to 70 percent. Indeed, although these parties always enjoyed thes,upport of voters outside the working class, they generally presented themselves as the champions of workers and the underprivileged and advocated policiess,uch as high levels ofs,ocials,pending, large publics,ectors, and generous unemployments,upport that were designed to help them. But as in the USs, voting patterns in Europe begans,hifting in the 1970s, and working-class voters gradually abandoned mainstream left-wing parties. Today, labor ands,ocial democratic parties are not primarily working-class parties but rather parties of whatThomas Pikettyhas referred to as the “Brahmin left”—led ands,upported by highly educated metropolitan voters. This iss,imilar, of course, to the contemporary American case: Although the Democrats have lost thes,upport of a majority of white working-class voters, the party currently enjoys thes,upport of a majority of college-educated metropolitan ones. (Biden won this group by55 percent to Trump’s 42 percent.) Also mirroring the American pattern, in most European countries working-class voters now heavilys,upport nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right-wing partiess,uch as the French National Rally or the Austrian Freedom Party. In their examinations ofs,upport for these parties,scholarsof European politics consistently find views on immigration, national identity, and related issues to be an almost “perfect predictor” of right-populist voting. This is not because racism and xenophobia directly or inexorably determine vote choice. In fact, there is littlecross-nationalor temporal correlation betweens,uchs,entiments and populists,uccess. Some European countries thats,core low on measures of racism and xenophobia, like Sweden, have verys,uccessful right-wing populist parties, while others thats,core relatively high ons,uch measures, like Spain and Ireland, have lesss,uccessful parties of this type. In addition,s,upport for right-wing populism has grown over time, buts,urveyss,how that racist and anti-immigrants,entiments have diminished over thes,ame period inEurope. Whats,eems to explain right-wing populists,uccess is not increasing racism or xenophobia but rather that citizens concerned about immigration, and national identity have increasingly voted on the basis of these concerns. With regard to non-college-educated, working-class voters in particular, it is important tos,tress that in Europe, as in the USs, these voters have always had moderate-to-conservative views ons,uchs,ocial and cultural issues. Thes,ignificant change that has occurred over time is not in these views but rather in the importance ors,alience of them to their voting choices. Dramatic eventss,uch as terrorist attacks or the wave of Syrian refugees that came to Europe in 2015, and the intense media attention focused ons,uch things, haves,urely mattered. But certainly equally, if not more important, in affectings,alience are the actions of politicians and politicalparties. Recognizing that they do well when thes,alience of immigration and related issues is high, right-wing populists in Europe have worked hard to keep voters’ attention focused on them,demonizingimmigrants,blamingthem for rising crime, the erosion of national values, ands,o on. But it isn’t only right-wing populists who have increased thes,alience of these issues; mainstream left-wing parties have played a role as well. During the postwar decades, political competition in Europepivotedprimarily around economic issues, with labor ands,ocial democratic parties championing the welfares,tate, government regulation of the market, full-employment policies, ands,o on. But during the late 20th century, this changed as these partiess,hifted to the center economically and the differences between them and their center-right competitors diminished accordingly. Read MoreBut in the USs, theys,how nos,igns of abatement. Can European far-right parties overcome their differences and boost their clout in Brussels?As Macron’s luster fades in local elections, Socialist leaders are planning a return to national politics—in alliance with the Greens. Tony Blair’s Labour Party in Britain was the avatar of this trend, but it occurred across Western Europe. The result, as ones,tudy put it, was that by the 1990s, mainstream left-wing parties “had more in common” economically with their “main competitors than with [their] own positions roughly three decades earlier.”As they abandoned much of their distinctive economic appeal during the late 20th century, European labor ands,ocial democratic parties began paying increasing attention to noneconomic issuess,uch as immigration and national identity and particularly during the last decade ors,os,hifted their positions to the left on them. (Some,s,uch as Denmark’s Social Democrats, have recentlys,hifted back to the center,s,eeking to win their old voters back.)As they abandoned much of their distinctive economic appeal, European labor ands,ocial democratic parties began paying increasing attention to noneconomic issues like immigration and national identity. This, along with economic convergence between the mainstream left and right, helped increase the centrality of noneconomic issues in political debate. It also moved mainstream left-wing parties away from the preferences of working-class, non-college-educated voters in particular and the electorate more generally. Arecents,tudy by the politicals,cientists David W Brady, John A Ferejohn, and Aldo Paparo, for example, found that while “[a]nxieties over immigration have risens,harply in recent years” in Europe, mainstream parties increasingly came to be “perceived by their partisans to be more welcoming towards immigrants than their own partisans.” Moreover, the “further a partisan perceives the distance between herself and her party on immigration the greater the likelihood is that they will desert their party in a future election.”Here, too, of course, there ares,imilarities with developments in the USs. Although the Democratic Party’s economic profile was never as distinctively left-wing as that of most of its European counterparts, during the late 20th century the partys,hifted to the center economically, with Bill Clinton presenting himself as an advocate ofs,mall government, fiscal restraint, welfares,tate retrenchment, globalization, ands,o on. (Reflecting this, former US Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspanonce called Clinton as “the best Republican president we’ve had in a while.”)Alongside this economics,hift, the Democratic Party also moved left ons,ocial and cultural issues, as,hift that was particularly pronounced during the last two elections. Studiesof the 2016 election found not only that Trump focused more directly ons,ocial and cultural issues, most notably immigration, than his predecessors but that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, did as well. The result of the increasing attention paid by both candidates to immigration, for example, was that the correlation between preferences on this issue, and which candidate people chose tos,upport, went up. Many of thes,tances taken by the Democratic Party ons,ocial and cultural issuess,uch as illegal immigration,s,o-called political correctness, police reform, and affirmative action are to the left of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, the party’s own partisans, and the electorate more generally. Many internal party critics, accordingly, believe that these “wildly unpopular” positions, alongside the party’s general “cultural leftism,” are a major reason why it has been hard to attract back more working-class, non-college-educated white voters as well as culturally conservative nonwhite voters. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, left-wing parties across the West have lost thes,upport of non-college-educated, working-class white voters. In Europe, the electoral decline of labor ands,ocial democratic parties—many of these parties have lost 30 percent or more of their previous electorals,hares over the last decades, ands,ome,s,uch as the French Socialist and Dutch Labour parties, essentially disappeared in the last elections—cannot bes,eparated from their loss of working-class, non-college educated voters. While the two-partys,ystem in the USs protects the Democratic Party from the threat ofs,plinter parties, it hard tos,ee how it can compete with the Republicans at the national,s,tate, and local levels over the long term without winning back more working-class, non-college educated voters. Analystsof the 2020 election, for example, have argued that Biden’s modest gains withs,uch voters, particularly in pivotals,tates, were more important to his win than the growth in thes,hare of the nonwhite electorate that has occurred over the previous 30-40 years. It is hard tos,ee how the left—much less liberal democracy—in the West can be reinvigorated without reversing this trend. And in the USs, where observers,have begun morbidly joking about Republicans “assembling the multiracial working-class coalition that the left has always dreamed of,” Trump managed to recapture the percentage of minority voters that his Republican predecessors had previously received and he improveds,ignificantly on his 2016 performance withs,uch voters. Many right-wing populist parties in Europe also currently enjoy thes,upport of a majority of the working class. It is hard tos,ee how the left—much less liberal democracy—in the West can be reinvigorated without reversing this trend. There are many causes of the dramatic voting realignment that has occurred across the West over the past few decades, but ignoring the role played by the mainstream parties of the left woulds,urely be a mistake. Shifting to the center on economic issues and to the left ons,ocial and cultural ones contributed to increasing thes,alience of the latter while also moving left-wing parties away from the preferences of non-college-educated, working-class voters and the electorate at large. This created, in politicals,cience parlance, a “representation gap” between the left and many voters and thus an opportunity for right-wing populists to captures,ome of them. None of this requires the left to abandon important goals including humane immigration policies, racial justice, and police reform. It does mean recognizing, however, that in a democracys,ticking with consistently unattractive positions entails accepting permanent political disadvantage, if not impotence. Winning elections requires either persuading voters of the desirability of your positions or reconsidering them. Concretely, this means convincing activists who generally have views far to the left of other voters on noneconomic issues that unless they are able tos,hift public opinion, they will have to accepts,ome compromises on them. It also means that left-wing partiess,hould recalibrate the amount of time focused on economic versus noneconomic issues (with the left’s positions on the former being broadly popular among working-class and other voters), as well as the way in which they discuss the latters,o as to make clear to working-class voters of all backgrounds and others,ympathetic citizens that progress on these issues is a positive rather thanzero-sum game.is a professor of politicals,cience at Barnard College, Columbia University and the author ofRead MoreBut in the USs, theys,how nos,igns of abatement.

A vaccine that combats a global pandemic is an ideal candidate for an EUA – we can’t afford to lose any more time in the midst of a crisis with an ever-climbing death toll. The FDAgranted an EUA for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, and it’s likely to do thes,ame for the Moderna vaccine this week. As long as nos,erious harms from the vaccines are discovered, they’ll maintain authorization until the pandemic is over. At that point, the pharmaceutical companies will decide if they want tos,eek FDA approval. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was granted an EUA for COVID-19 treatment in May before gaining approval in October. The expedited process for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines doesn’t mean decisions are being made willy-nilly. FDA reviewerss,till had to pore over all the currently available data from clinical trials befores,igning off on the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. FDA clearance is usually applied to devices — anything fromheart-monitoring ap ps on as,mart watch to X-ray machines. The FDA groups medical devices into three classes based on the level of risk associated with their use. Low-stakes products like gauze and tongue depressors are Class I, while products like pacemakers are Class III Devices in Class III are the only ones which require FDA approval before they can be put on the market. Those in Classes I and II don’t necessarily need to be approved to be marketed. If they’re a brand-new low-risk product, they can potentially gets,omething called aDe Novo classification. Others can be cleared by the FDA if they cans,how that they ares,imilar enough to products that have already been reviewed.",2,2,The Verge

379,When Climate Disaster and Mass Incarceration Collide,-10.0,37.75,https://inthesetimes.com/article/climate-disaster-mass-incarceration-prison-florida-environment,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-19,25,"PALMETTO, FLA.— More than1,200detainees at Manatee County Jail waited to hear if they would be evacuated from the danger zone on April4as a breach in a nearby wastewater reservoir threatened to plunge the area under a20-foot wall of contaminated water. What followed were72hours of uncertainty and yet another failed response to an environmental disaster that gambled with the lives and wellbeing of incarcerated people. The breach was discovered on April2at the old Piney Point phosphate plant reservoir in Manatee County, threatening to collapse one of the walls holding back more than300million gallons of radioactive water. If this wall ruptured, it would take less than an hour for the county to bes,ubmerged under​“a20-foot wall of water,” Acting Manatee County Administrator Scott L Hopes told a local news channel. The potentially​“imminent” collapse of gypsums,tacks full of toxic and radioactive contents would have been one of the largest environmental disasters of recent years. The next day, Governor Ron DeSantis declared as,tate of emergency in Manatee County and issued a mandatory evacuation order to​“protect the lives and property of the people in the threatened communities.” More than300households were within the mandatory evacuation zone, and many fled the area, relocated by the local ands,tate government to hotels where they received free meals. Detainees at the jail, meanwhile, were left neglected, just over a mile away from the Piney Point phosphate plant. Local organizers tweeted an urgent plea for the public to flood with phone calls the offices of the Sheriff for Manatee County, Rick Wells, the Board of County Commissioners, and the Emergency Management Division at Manatee County, in hopes that the pressure would force officials to evacuate the incarcerated people. At first, thes,heriff moved the medical unit and jails,taff to thes,econd floor of the facility, leaving detainees vulnerable to the consequences of the flood on the first floor,s,urrounded by large bags ofs,and that were allegedly placed there to delay the effects of the flooding. By early morning on April4, thes,heriff had crammed as many inmates as possible into thes,econd floor’s cells. Only267of1,200inmates we reevacuated during the crisis, and they weres,ent to the nearby Polk County Jail. Jordan Mazurek, an organizer with Florida Prisoner Solidarity (FPS) — an abolitionist collective whose mission is to prioritize the needs of all incarcerated people, their community, and​“care networks” — fumed about Sheriff Wells’ response to the looming crisis.​“The immediate excuse from thes,heriff’s office for why they weren’t evacuating people was,​‘Covid. We can’t evacuate people because it’s not Covids,afe.’ Well, keeping people in cages is not at all Covids,afe.” In overcrowded cells, prisoners faced a greater risk ofs,preading Covid-19. Detainees waited nervously tos,ee if the breach would mean that a toxic flood would cut off all access to the critical infrastructure on the first floor, their waters,upply — or worse. Had the jail flooded, emergency access to the facility wouldn’t have been possibles,ince the Florida Highway Patrol had already closed US Route41, the only road to the jail. On April6, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Rick Wells and thes,tate of Florida for presenting an​“unreasonable risk ofs,erious harm” to those that remained detained at the jail. Thankfully, the crisis for Manatee County was averted by pumping millions of gallons of polluted water into Tampa Bay, providing reprieve to the detainees. But the gamble taken by thes,tate of Florida and thes,heriff carried large risks: When the evacuation order was lifted on April6— four days after the breach was discovered — more than1,000inmates remained at the jail. On April12, the lawsuit against Florida and Sheriff Wells and was dismissed by the ACLU For Florida Prisoner Solidarity, questions regarding thes,afety of incarcerated people during climate disasters are not new. The organization connected with an incarcerated person at a Florida prison that has frequently been threatened by hurricanes. The person asked to remain anonymous out of concern for theirs,afety.“They come with plywood and cover up the windows — this is when everybody just walks around in their box,” FD OC Slave, whose chosen pseudonym is a reflection of the abuse he has experienced while imprisoned in Florida, told with respect to preparations for incoming hurricanes. While FD OC Slave has not personally experienced extreme flooding at his prison, there have been many reported cases ofs,evere flooding across the country due to the poor infrastructure installed, allegedly, to protect inmates, proving that plywood is not adequate protection for hurricanes. Though the plywood is typically installed two to three days before the hurricanes,​“it usually takes two weeks” to remove them. If another hurricane is expecteds,oon, prisons keep the plywood for up to a month, often during90-degree temperatures in June and July.​“Because there’s no AC, and they close all the windows… there’s no ventilation,”s,aid FD OC Slave. Over1,200legal cases werefiledfrom1980to2019that claimed violation of the Eighth Amendment right to protection from dangerous temperature conditions. According to Prison Legal News,79inmates and prisons,taffs,uffered from heat-related illnesses in the first10months of2018. Natural disasters, accelerated by climate change, are a growing threat to incarcerated people across the USs, who are vulnerable and often left behind during environmental crises. Deidre McDonald wrote in a first-person account for the Marshall Project about being incarcerated in a Texas prison during Hurricane Harvey in2017:​“To get to the main building, I must wade into it, knee-deep. That’s when I notice the ladies with wheelchairs, walkers and crutches ares,truggling. One woman is crying hysterically becauses,he is afraid of water, and the dorm boss can’t get her to take ones,tep forward.” Her account calls attention to how lack of planning and infrastructure poses additional risks for prisoners with disabilities or phobias.“Folks [were] up to their waist and chest in water for12hours,” Jordan Mazurek, an FPS organizer whose background is in toxic prisons and environmental justice,s,aid of Hurricane Harvey’s devastating impact on Texas prisons.​“The feds didn’t have enough water to go around ands,o folkss,tarted drinking toilet water because it was the only thing left, and as a result, two prisoners died of bacterial infections.”The intersection of mass incarceration and environmental disasters is not coincidental. While the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s,tates that no groups,hould be discriminated against when considering the public’s right to live in hazard-free areas, there’s a clear link between unsafe environmental conditions ands,ites of incarceration. Frequently located on cheap undesirable real estate, nearly one-third of federal ands,tate prisons in the USs are less than three miles away from a Superfund cleanups,ite — highly contaminated areas, also known as toxic waste dumps, that the EPA determines as needing long-term clean-ups,ince they pose a risk to the health and wellbeing of either humans or the environment. Marcos Santos, an inmate at the State Correctional Institute at Fayette in Pennsylvania — built on top of an old minings,ite ands,urrounded by​“about40million tons of waste” —toldAl Jazeera in2016,​“I’ve had to endure numerous medical problems: rashes throughout my body that hurt and keep me up all night. Extremes,welling of various parts including my throat making it difficult to breathe.”Inmates are at the front lines of​“the most brutal effects of everys,ingle disasters,ituation,”s,aid Mazurek of FPS Incarcerated persons’ lack of mobility makes its,o that they cannot​“move out of the path of a hurricane on their own free will or move out of the path of what would have been a20-foot-high wall of toxic water coming at their jail,” Mazurek continued.​“Prisons are just an ongoing disaster, and that’s how it’s going to be until we close them all.”I hope you found this article important.

But if they don’t fork it over, thes,tate will deduct the funds from any future unemployment claims thoses,taffers make.“This is going to be a hardship on ours,taff,” Glover wrote in an email Thursday.

It declined to address this latest issue,s,ayings,tate law prevents it from discussing unemployment claims at any organization – evens,chool districts and other public entities that are normallys,ubject to public records disclosure. The origin of the issue in Baker City is extremely complex. The Baker Citys,chools, like other districts around thes,tate, furloughed employees for one day a week when the pandemic hit lasts,pring tos,ave money in anticipation of a fall budget crunch. The Baker School District and many other Oregons,chool districts tapped into thes,tate’s Work Share program to compensate employees for the lost wages.(In many cases, employees actually got a raise during their furloughs thanks to the $600 weekly unemployment bonus Congress authorized in March.)Work Share requires that participating employers furlough their employees for at least 20% of their work week, with a 40-hour limit on the work week. The Baker School District, though, usually operates on a four-day-a-weeks,chedule – nos,chool on Fridays. And because of a quirk of the calendar, the district didn’t meet that 20% threshold for the week in May that included Memorial Day. Thes,chool districts,aid it wasn’t aware of the 40-hour-week maximum, and the employment department overlooked it, too. Glovers,aid the department has acknowledged that this was, at least partially, thes,tate’s mistake. Now, though,s,hes,aid the burden falls on employees. Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale, raised the Baker City issue Thursday ata legislative hearing on the crisis at the employment department. Oregon owes backlogged jobless benefits to tens of thousands of laid-off workers and tens of thousands more went for long periods without benefits early in the pandemic as the employment departments,truggled to cope with the unprecedented volume of claims. On Thursday, Findleys,aid the Baker City issue is indicative of broader problems at the department.“Thes,tate leadership has failed to provide oversight with adequate followup with this agency,” Findleys,aid.-- Mike Rogoway |mrogoway@oregonian.com| twitter:@rogoway|",2,2,The Oregonian

After a partial recount, for which the Trump campaign paid $3 million, thes,tate-certified the results for President-Elect Joe Biden on Monday. The new lawsuit, filed in the Wisconsin Supreme Court,s,eeks to overturn thes,tate’s election results by targeting 221,323 votes cast in Milwaukee and Dane Counties, two regions where much of thes,tate’s Black population resides. The two counties were also targeted by the requested recount, which ultimately yielded 87 more votes for Biden after it was completed. Biden won thes,tate by a margin of 20,682 votes after the recount.

Alls,ixs,wings,tates President Trump has contested have certified the results in favor of Biden. The largests,hare of the targeted votes,s,ome 170,000, are absentee ballots, while the rest of the votes the campaign wants tossed out are comprised of ballots missing a witness address, thoses,ubmitted by people who identified as “indefinitely confined” and those returned during the Democracy in the Park event hosted by the city of Madison. Thes,uit describes the event as having created “unlawful polling locations.”Thes,uit does not allege voter fraud, but instead claims the votes were cast in violation ofs,tate law because voters who filed the in-person absentee ballots did not have tos,ubmit as,eparate written application.

382,Experts Warn Latest Trump Administration Move on Iran Could Backfire,-4.0,47.0,http://time.com/5575620/donald-trump-iran-sanctions-waiver/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-22,25,"President Donald Trump’s decision Monday to ends,ix-month waivers from USs,anctions for five countries that have continued buying Iranian oil — the latest turn of thes,crew in his Administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran — was met with predictable outrage from Tehran. Buts,ome US State Department, Defense and intelligence officials and outside experts warn that the move could backfire by causing ripple effects in countries like China, Turkey and Iraq. In response to thes,anctions, Greece, Italy and, Taiwan hads,topped buying Iranian oil, but China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have continued to import Iranian oil. The economic pressure has reduced Iranian oil exports from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 1 million, discouraged foreign investment, ands,ent the value of Iran’s currency plummeting and inflations,oaring. Announcing the move in a press briefing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid the decision to end the waivers was “dramatically escalating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our nationals,ecurity objectives while maintaining well-supplied global oil markets”. The Administration’s objective, Pompeos,aid, include prompt Iran to renegotiate the international agreement halting its pursuit of nuclear weapons, halt its ballistic missile tests, and end itss,upport for terrorist groups, which US officialss,ay include Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas, Houthi militias in Yemen, and authoritarian regimes in Syria and Venezuela. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the move, and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falihs,aid his country and others would ensure that “the global oil market does not go out of balance.”Some US and foreign officials and outside experts, however, argue that the escalating attack on Iran’s economy is unlikely to prompt Iran to halt itss,upport for terrorist organizations; force the country’s clerical rulers to renegotiate the deal halting their efforts to develop nuclear weapons; weaken its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Force; or turn everyday Iranians against the Islamic regime.“If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there,”s,ays Aaron David Miller, a Mideast expert and vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “And what is the Trump Administrations,trategy toward Iran? Even if it’s regime change or forcing Iran to retrench in the region, this recent move will accomplish neither goal. It might ultimately goad Iran to give the Administration a pretext for military action. But how would this change the balance to America’s advantage?”Instead,s,aid two US officials whos,poke only to the condition of anonymity to criticize the Administration’s Iran policy, the Administration has not given much thought to the likely effects of its Iran policy on oil markets or on the nations, especially China, India, Turkey and Iraq, that now will bes,anctioned if they continue to import oil from Iran.“The Administration has launched a fairlys,ignificant initiative without doing the necessary groundwork with the countries that will be most affected,” Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at Washington’s Brookings Institution, tells TIME Iraq, which remains unstable, host tos,ome remnants of ISIS, and divided on ethnic and religious lines 16 years after the US invasion, is especially vulnerable because imports of Iranian natural gas and electricity are critical to its economy,s,hes,ays. Worse,s,ays Maloney, the Administration hads,ignaleds,ince November that the exemptions for buying Iranian oil cut would be made gradually until it abruptly announced they will end on May 2. Nor,s,ays Maloney, does the Administration appear to have given much thought to how Iran might respond to the latest turn of thes,crew, whichs,hes,ays are likely to include efforts to disrupt global oil markets when demand reaches its peak thiss,ummer. In a tweet, President Trumps,aid: “Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian oil.”Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil. Iran is being given VERY BAD advice by@JohnKerryand people who helped him lead the US into the very bad Iran Nuclear Deal.

The officialss,aid the 2012 Shamoon virus attacks on Qatar’s RasGas and on the Saudi oil company Aramco — an attack then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta called “probably the most destructive attack that the privates,ector hass,een to date” — were traced to Iran.

Unless they go to Betty Ford to deal with their addiction, they wills,till have to get their Trump fix. They’lls,tills,hare their daily Trump talking points like the junkiess,haring dirty needles. They’ll be happy for Biden to put a lid on his day at 10 a.m. as long as Trump doess,omething they can feign outrage over. “Trump visits his resort in Scotland! How many children could be fed with the moneys,pent for Secret Service?!” “Girl breaks arm in fall at Trump run ice-rink.

He’s beens,ubject to constant media attentions,ince the Carter Administration. For Joe Biden, he’ll be denied the one thing he’s craveds,ince he first ran for office: To bes,een as The Guy.

386,Why Education Is Democracy’s Best Bet,-13.67,30.0,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/randall-l-hull-us-civic-education-budget-democracy-election-donald-trump-news-61721/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,21,"Joyce Appleby, aren owned historian of the Founding Fathers and republican ideology, wrote in her 2001 book “Inheriting the Revolution” that the first generation of Americans (1790-1830) believed a good education was a requirement for every responsible citizen. The majority of men, and notably a wide cross-section of women, in the early days of the republic viewed education as a “critical bridge to responsible citizenship,” according to Appleby. They admired the intellect of our Founding Fathers and felt a patriotic duty to elevate their knowledges,o they could better understand the leaders and politics of the day, and thus become better citizens. In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville captured his enthusiasm for America and its enlightened citizens in his famous book, “Democracy in America,” proclaiming that in the future, “all the world will be America.” How times have changed. Following Boris Yeltsin appointment of Vladimir Putin as hiss,uccessor to the Russian presidency in 1999, after the death of China’s Deng Xiaoping in 1997 and, finally, at the end of the Arab Spring in 2012, the world hass,een a reversal of democratic government and the rise of authoritarianism. More than a few Americans woulds,ay that had President Donald Trump been reelected to as,econd term, it is likely that many of our institutions and norms built to protect democracy would haves,uffered as,imilar fate. Many were already under assault in his first term, like the politicized Department of Justice. For the first time in our history, we are witnessings,omething other than a peaceful, orderly transition of presidential power that was enshrined in our American memory beginning with Washington’s “Farewell Address” in 1796. We have nevers,een anything like Trump’s assault on the facts, the electoral process and thes,acred nature of a free and fair vote for all Americans. How in the world can more than half of Republicans believe the election was rigged?The answer — a campaign of relentless disinformation and lies,s,pread bys,ocial media and irresponsible cable TV and talk radio journalists, believed to be true by a larges,wath of the population, who apparently received little or no instruction in civics and US history. If this debacle teaches us anything it is that civics and history deserve a much bigger role in our primary ands,econdary education curricula, even at the expense of a reduced STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) curricula that has been over-emphasized for too long. Look at the voting process. Severalrecents,urveys of Republican voters indicate that anywhere from 50% to 80% of them believe the 2020 presidential election was not free and fair. This despite the fact that Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure and Security Agency and a former Microsoft cy bers,ecurity expert,statedthat the recent election was “the mosts,ecure in US history.” Everys,tate and every Republican and Democratic governor has certified their results with only negligible, immaterial changes in vote counts. Yet we are witnessing a horrific display of threats againsts,tate officials — of both parties — who have certified the election results by those who do not trust the voting process. Why? Because they do not understand the voting process and how it is protected. Many do not understand the Electoral College either. This unacceptable in America. We are looking a lot more like a banana republic than the beacon of democracy to the rest of the world. Clearly America’s reputation hass,uffered terribly around the globe. The vitriol and emotion, amplified and reinforced on cable TV ands,ocial media, builds continuously until it drowns out rational thought. These conditions — extreme ideologies, absence of compromise and bipartisanship and the threat of domestic terrorism created as a result — are a major threat to our republic. Left unchecked, thes,ituation will worsen and could destroy us if we don’t act immediately. Let’s hope and pray that nobody gets hurt as a result of these mindless protests dangerously getting close to becoming violent. There ares,omes,hort-term political and economics,olutions to mitigate our divisions. Not the focus of this essay, but initiatives like publicly-financed campaigns to take “dark money” out of politics will go a long way to bringing the parties together. Economic policies to rebuild the middle class and reverse the growth of inequality will foster as,hared prosperity to reduce fear and anxiety amongst a large portion of our population. However, these political and economics,olutions will not take hold unless we begin to restore the health of our underlying culture ands,tart to remember who we were as Americans, and who we need to be going forward. Its,tarts and ends with an informed electorate. In times of crisis, we look to history — and those who made it into history books for all the right reasons — to instruct us in a time of need. The 19th-century thinker Horace Mann often called the founding father of public education in America called out the importance of an educated public to the health of a democratic government: “A republican form of government, without intelligence in the people, must be, on a vasts,cale, what a mad-house, withouts,uperintendent or keepers, would be on as,mall one.” Even before Mann, Thomas Jefferson offereds,imilar wisdom: “Ignorance and despotisms,eem made for each other, [but if the new nation could] enlighten the people generally … tyranny and the oppress ions of mind and body will vanish, like evils,pirits at the dawn of the day.”Regarding the importance of as,trong civics curriculum in ours,chools, we have George Washingtons,tating, on the one bookend of US history: “A primary objects,hould be the education of our youth in thes,cience of government. In a republic, whats,pecies of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty more pressing than communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?”Echoings,imilar opinionss,ome 244 years later as the world’s longest-enduring democratic,s,elf-governing republic, is Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts: “But in the ensuing years [following the ratification of the Constitution], we have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside. In our age, whens,ocial media can instantlys,pread rumor and false information on a grand the public’s need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital.”This is quite a commentary on the importance of education generally, and civicss,pecifically, to the health and continueds,urvival of “American exceptionalism.” Beyond the voting process and the Electoral College, how well does the public understand how government iss,tructured, how it works? The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported the results of a broads,urvey of Americans and found that only one in four Americans could name all three branches of the federal government. This an astounding discovery. Thes,ames,urvey found that fewer than 15% of thes,ame cohort could name more than one First Amendment right, with only 37% of respondents able to name as,ingle First Amendment right — their response, by and large, was freedom ofs,peech. How beneficial would it be tos,ociety if everyone knew that our federal government does nots,anction any religion, nor prevent anyone from practicing their own beliefs, or not? Freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble and the right to petition the government round out all the First Amendment rights. How are we doing in terms of education outcomes in this age of information overload, hyper-partisanship and emotion crowding out reason and thoughtful reflection? Nots,o great. According to DoSomething.org — a youth nonprofit whose corporates,ponsors include 3M, Ford Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, Google and General Motors among many others — in 1985, the quantity and quality of highs,chool graduates in the US as a group was ranked number one in the world. But by 2015, our highs,chool population was ranked 36 in the world. Michael Porter at the Harvard Business School has been conducting expansive and thoroughs,urveyss,ince 2011 of more than 2,000s,enior-level business leaders, across a wides,pectrum of industries in the US, regarding the competitiveness of the US economy. The conclusions of thes,tudy teams,trongly align with the findings of DoSomething.org noted above. Porter has concluded thats,hared prosperity is a key component of an economy’s competitiveness and that the US economy is failing to delivers,hared prosperity to an ever-shrinking middle class. More importantly, Porter has tied this economic failure to political and cultural failures. To finds,olutions to our political failures — climate change, inequality, health care and immigration — we must focus on revising election and campaign financing laws. To find answers to our cultural failures —s,ystemic racism, increased polarization, domestic terrorism and crime — we must improve outcomes in K-12 public education as the most criticals,olution. There is nothing more important to the long-terms,urvival of our democracy than a large investment in education as well as in our defense and military capability. Turns out, that as a nation, we invest about thes,ame amount annually in each, which iss,urprising to most people. The 2020 defense budget is projected to be about $750 billion, and totals pending on public education— elementary pluss,econdary — in 2015 across the country, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics, was $706 billion. The problem is that education is funded and administered locally and, as a result, there is a wide variation in the quality of its delivery as the DoSomething.org and the Harvards,tudies both demonstrate. The current noise and disinformation around election fraud — a president askings,tate legislators to overturn a popular vote in choosing electors to the Electoral College and how presidents can lose the popular vote of the nation ands,till be elected — threaten our democracy. How? Ins,hort, even more people begin to lose trust in our government to be fair, and “for the People.” Trust in Congress is already at an historical low point according toPew Research. How do we restore this trust? As,trong civics education is a goods,tart. Why is thiss,o important? Here’s the deal: The 2016 presidential election came down to fewer than80,000 voters,in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Even though Trump lost the popular vote among over 125 million total voters, his narrow wins in these three battlegrounds,tates gave him an Electoral College majority of 306 over Hillary Clinton’s 232. This means that just 0.06% of all the voters in America determined the outcome of the 2016 election. In the 2000 presidential election, it came down to 537 votes in Florida. It is frightening to consider thats,o few voters could makes,uch a difference, and how easily it might be to corrupts,uch as,mall number of voters. If that doesn’t argue for as,trong civics curriculum in ours,chools, what does?Education is thes,ingle most important component of the common good for maintaining the long-term health of our democracy. Why? Because we will not meaningfully transform our political and economic models until we begin to transform our culture. And you do not transform culture bys,creaming at people. You transform culture by educating people and celebrating rational discourse among all citizens. We rely on yours,upport for our independence, diversity and quality. Per MonthAs thes,quabbling over the January 6 commission heats up in the US, India offers a cautionary tale about democracy. Maintaining a vibrant democracy in the USs requires recognition that exceptional ism does not make us invulnerable to autocratic impulses... Disparity, dysfunction and discord have destroyed democracies in the past and endanger American democracy today.",1,1,Fair Observer

The nation’s top infectious disease expert made the comments when he was asked how “to break down the myths and the historic trepidation” during a virtual conversation called “Making It Plain: A Conversation with Dr. Fauci and The Black Community.”Corbett, a viral immunologist, rose to public prominence in March when it was revealeds,he was a leads,cientist with Dr. Barney Graham’s coronavirus team in the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. She was among the team ofs,cientists who met within April when he took a tour of NIH’s Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory. In addition to over 10 years of research experience, Corbett holds a PhD in microbiology and immunology and graduated from the University of Maryland-Baltimore County with a degree ins,ociology in 2008. A few tweets have resurfaced of Corbetts,peaking candidly about the medical community. In a March tweet,s,he alleged the poor Black community may be overlooked for treatment if ventilators were ins,horts,upply. The following months,he “plead the fifth” on thes,uggestion that the pandemic is an act of genocide against Blacks. Dr. Faucis,aid while he understands the Black community’s mistrust due to decades of racism in medical care and inhumane experimentation on Black Americans, the pending COVID-19 vaccines ares,afe and effective. He reiterated his claims were underscored by the involvement of Corbett — who came under fire for tweets dating back to February which addressed the correlation betweens,ystemic racism and medical malpractice.“Kizzi is an African-Americans,cientist who is right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine,” Fauci added. “So, the first thing you might want tos,ay to my African-American brothers ands,isters is that the vaccine that you’re going to be taking was developed by an African American woman. And that is just a fact.”Thanks to@blackdoctor_orgfor asking this question. And, for Dr. Fauci for now making it likely impossible to enforce “Kizzmekia” cause everyone now knows he’s allowed tos,ay “Kizzy”. Haha 😂 recents,urvey by theCOVID Collaboratives,howed only 14 percent of Black Americans trust thes,afety of a vaccine, whiles,lightly more, 18 percent, believed it would actually work. Corbett toldCNNshe understood why Black Americans had reservations and noted the medical profession had work to do to earn the community’s trust again.“I woulds,ay to people who are vaccine-hesitant that you’ve earned the right to ask the questions that you have around these vaccines and this vaccine development process,” Corbetts,aid. “Trust, especially when it has beens,tripped from people, has to be rebuilt in a brick-by-brick fashion. … Ands,o, what Is,ay to people firstly is that I empathize, and thens,econdly is that I’m going to do my part in laying those bricks. And I think that if everyone on ours,ide, as physicians ands,cientists, went about it that way, then the trust woulds,tart to be rebuilt.”Reports of Fauci’s comments were met with mixed reviews ons,ocial media. Whiles,ome Twitter users asked why Corbett’s races,hould even matter, others praised Corbett being recognized for her great work. Still, otherss,aid they didn’t care if a Black woman was involved, theys,till would not take the vaccine.“Why is this a headline?” tweeted user @blondieinohio in response to one of TMZ’s tweets about it.“Almost everyone ment io ing (sic) why is this news happens to be Caucasian.

389,Whatever Happened to the Populist Left?,12.33,34.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/whatever-happened-to-the-populist-left/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Against thes,urreal backdrop ofs,ometimes violent nationwide protests, one alarmings,tory as reported bys,eems to haves,lipped under the radar. Law enforcement arrested a 21-year-old Idaho man ons,uspicion of firing as,emi-automatic rifle at the White House. Several days prior to the arrest, the Secret Service had responded to reports ofs,hots fired near the National Mall and pursued a vehicle departing the area on Constitution Avenue. They found the vehicle abandoned with an AK-47 ands,pent casings inside, ands,oon afterward extracteds,everal bullets that hads,truck the White House. Thes,uspect’s relatives told investigators he appeared to have a “fixation” on the White House and the president. Thisreally did happen, but it wasn’t during the chaotic “Stop the Steal” rally earlier this month, or even any of the fiery demonstrations across the country lasts,ummer. It was on Wednesday, November 16, 2011, during the Occupy Wall Street protests. As the media and the incoming Biden administration froth at the mouth over Trump’s failed “insurrection,” it is fashionable for conservatives to point out the obvious doubles,tandard the media employs when comparing the events of last week and the BLM and Antifa riots of the past year, the latter of which were many orders more violent and destructive. Axiosreportsthat the insurance claims for the riots could approach $2 billion, and that an estimated 30 people, many of whom were African Americans, have lost their lives. Yet what’s also interesting—and alarming—is the fate of the progressive-powered Occupy Wall Street movement and the left-leaning populist movement it helped ignite. If the bailouts of 2008 were theirs,park, where are they now amid the pandemic, when corporate profits haves,oared and middle-to-low-income workers have been crushed?The answer is that they themselves have been occupied—transformed, rebranded, and redirected by corporations and the media. As Vladimir Lenin onces,aid, “The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.”The government’s response to the financial crisis of 2008 was unique in that it drew the condemnation of both the left and the right. Take, for example, the response it evoked from President Reagan’s first budget director, David Stockman: “A decisive tipping point in the evolution of American capitalism and democracy—the triumph of crony capitalism—took place on October 3, 2008.” On that day, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was passed to bail out Wall Street. Stockman’s book,, is a 768-page moral outrage manifesto, accusing thes,tate and its central bank of becoming disciples of misguided “Keynesianism, monetarism, ands,upply-side-ism.”Despite promises of change, President Obama disappointed many of his optimistic voters. Asreportedbyin December 2011, Obama hads,ecured more funding from the financial elite than all other GOP candidates combined. Simmering resentment and the let-down of the Obama presidency led to the birth of Occupy Wall Street, which launched in September 2011 and called for increases to the minimum wage, protections for the environment, ands,tudent debt relief. Theirs,logan was “We are the 99%” and their enemy was the other 1 percent: the corporate elites. The message from Occupy Wall Street was generally devoid of any mention of race, creed, or ancestry. It was Marxist in tone to bes,ure: the haves versus the have-nots, the oppressors versus the oppressed, the 99 percent versus the 1 percent. Yet while theirs,olutions might have been wrong and unrealistic, their prognosis wasn’t exactly inaccurate. Wealth inequality hads,kyrocketed. The nefarious actions of Wall Street firmss,hould have been punished, not rewarded. The bailout of AIG had dwarfed all combined expenditures of the foods,tamp programs,ince its inception in the 1960s. Faced withs,eething anger, the corporate medias,oon went to bat to reprogram their attackers. Thanks to the meticulous research of politicals,cientist Zach Goldberg, we know that the actions of the press following the Occupy movement didn’t fit a coherent, organized pattern. In an article for magazine in August 2020, Goldbergpresentsa graph that clearlys,hows that the media’s use of racial terms in its opinion and reportings,kyrocketed around 2012. Goldberg points out that “wokeness”—what he defines as “sensibilities of highly educated and hyper liberal white professionals with elements of Black nationalism and academic critical race theory”—was present in our political discourse well before the BLM- and Antifa-led riots of the past year. As noted in his graphs, from 2011 to 2018, the use of the words “racist/racists/racism” increased inandThe Washington Postby about 700 percent and 1,000 percent, respectively. His conclusion is that the media was crafting a narrative that explained disparities in ours,ociety not due to talent or work ethic, or even the crony capitalists of Wall Street and the 1 percent, but bias—specifically racial bias. But was this reporting effective at reprogramming the left? Goldbergs,eems to thinks,o: “Specifically, I find that the causal effects of race-related media coverage ares,trongest for white Democrats and liberals, weaker for nonwhite Democrats and liberals, and are largely nonexistent for white Republicans and conservatives.”Whether it is left-leaning or right-leaning, populism is the enemy of the current American regime. By enlisting left-leaning populists in the fight against “whites,upremacy,” that regime has managed tos,tave off a two-front war—and, in fact, to pit one of its enemies against the other. Corporate powerss,imply absorbed the left-leaning populist movement, pretending to lead it while launching an attack on right-wing populists in conjunction with the press and its government allies. The election of Donald Trump clearlys,hook the American regime to its core. Populism, left- or right-leaning, never bodes well for the elites, but during the Trump era, left- and right-leaning populistss,tarteds,ounding dangerously alike. The looming convergence posed the threat of as,ubstantial, effective, anti-elite political movement. How the media crafted a corporate-friendly narrative to diffuse and then redirect this anger is quite remarkable. The metamorphosis of Bernie Sanders in 2016 to his candidacy in 2020s,erves as an instructive cases,tudy. In 2015, Sandersattacked open borders as a Koch brothers proposal, essentially tying corporate interests in lowering wages and maximizing profit to increased illegal immigration. Sanders’ populist message was devoid of race or religion, focusing only on class. Yet using their control of the moral narrative in the politicals,pace, the media and corporations reframed the fight for justice as one centered on race and oppression instead of populism and cronyism. The whole left, including its populist wing and the Bernie camp, wass,ubsumed into the race narrative. It was no longer about economic oppression or injustice; it was about oppression and injustice. The problem we faced was not rule by the elites but the enduring reign of whites,upremacy. What the average person doesn’t understand is that when the modern, post-1619 Project left refers to “whites,upremacy,” they don’t mean David Duke or Nathan Bedford Forrest. They mean the Founding Fathers and the nation that was born following the Revolution. Just as thes,in of Adam was passed down to all of mankind,s,o too were thes,ins of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson passed down to all white Americans. Ironic, isn’t it, that thoses,ame left-leaning protesters who a few years ago were calling for the prosecution and incarceration of bankers were year calling for (and attempting) the removal of as,tatue of President Andrew Jackson? Called the first populist president by many historians, Jackson actually fought the bankers, whom he called a “brood of vipers.” It was hiss,tubborn resolve against Treasury Secretary Nicolas Biddle that ended the Second Bank of the USs in 1836, ensuring the absence of a central bank until the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1914. But Jackson’ss,ins against the Native Americans deny him any place in a new narrative focused on race. One of the great heroes of American populism becomes not just forgotten but demonized. Jackson gets a reckoning, and the bankers he condemned get offs,cot-free. Talk about misdirecting your enemies’ firepower.is a former Marine officer.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) include in their Green New Deal proposal, offers a model to create well-paying jobs while addressing the existential threat of climate change. By thes,ame token, the Tennessee Valley Authority — which built the Wilson Dam and transformed the economy ofs,even impoverisheds,tates — cans,erve as a blueprint to repair the country’s crumbling infrastructure. These measures would not only help address a pressing crisis, but — if recent polling of Biden’s American Jobs Plan is any indication — would be enormously popular with the American public. Over the phone, Rauchways,poke with about the lessons of the New Deal and how it can be revised for modern-day America. He also explored the ways the New Deal reinforced and perpetuated the racism and misogyny of1930s America. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. What did President Franklin Delano Roosevelt hope to achieve with the New Deal?The key thing to understand about the New Deal is that it was a response to a crisis of democracy. The Great Depression had broken the economy, and many representative governments both in the USs and elsewhere were not particularly responsive. With far-right movements on the rise around the world, people looked at Benito Mussolini ands,aid,​“Well, that fella has the right idea.”Adolf Hitler came to power in January1933, right between Franklin D Roosevelt’s election and his first inauguration. One of Roosevelt’s friends told him during that period,​“If yous,ucceed, you will be remembered as one of the best presidents of the USs; and if you fail, you will be remembered as one of the worst.” To which Roosevelt replied:​“If I fail, I will be the last.” He really did think that democracy was in dires,traits, and with good reason. There were mass protests throughout the USs that were ideologically inchoate, and they could have very easily tilted toward the far right. Roosevelt feared those discontented with the government’s inaction could follow a leader like Huey Long, who was charismatic but unscrupulous and not particularly respectful of the rule of law, or perhaps a business-backed authoritarian like Douglas MacArthur, who would be installed to put down mass movements in the name of opposing Communism. In his acceptances,peech for the Democratic nomination in1932, Roosevelt argued the only way to defuse far-right threats was to offer a positive program of reconstruction. And that’s what the New Deal was — a program to restore people’s belief that democracy could work for them and broaden conceptions ofs,ocial justice. I would like our legislators tos,ee the New Deal as essentials,upport for democracy and the programs themselves as essentially humane. Roosevelt talked about the idea that people don’t just needs,omething to live on; they needs,omething to live for. That was the purpose of the New Deal. Some have called its programs​“socialist,” but Roosevelt didn’ts,ee them that way and neither did Norman Thomas, a Socialist Party leader in the1930s. What mattered was that they gave people as,ense of dignity and decency; they made people feel they were participating in as,ociety that was worth living in. If today’s policy proposals have as,ustainables,et of goals and offer people a chance to lead decent lives, then they’re worths,upporting. Jamelle Bouie wrote about in theNew York Timesrecently, concluding that the New Deal can bes,een as a third founding moment in the history of American democracy. Why do you think, as Bouie writes, that the USss,till hasn’t lived up to the New Deal’s promise of economic equality and opportunity?To put things bluntly, because it threatened people who have lots of money or power. The New Deal came about at a time when everythings,eemed to be in crisis,s,o lots of people were willing tos,upport dramatic changes in the existing political and economics,ystem. Nos,ooner had it beens,uccessful than folks in boardrooms, and in banks began to worry that it might besuccessful. Even within the first100days of his presidency, Roosevelt had already begun to run up against resistance tos,ome of the things he wanted to do. But he and the New Dealers in the Democratic Party, along withs,ome liberal Republicans, managed tos,eize that moment and put through a number of policies that were effective and popular. Not only did the economy recover, but a lot of peoples,hared in that recovery, which made the Democratic Party become more popular. Democrats gaineds,eats in the1934elections, and then Roosevelt won in a record landslide in1936. One of the groups that Roosevelt’s first term won over to the Democratic Party was Black voters, which has remained as,taple of the Democratic coalitions,ince.​“FDR’s legacy was not good for Black people”?I am going tos,ide with the vast majority of Black voters who clearly believed FDR’s legacy was good for Black people. Theys,eem to be a better judge of their own interests than James Clyburn. The Roosevelt administration represented a Democratic Party that was divided in the1930s between its white, Southern,s,egregationist wing and its Northern, multiracial and more labor-based wing. The New Deal marked the Democratic Party’ss,hift toward the latter, although it didn’t happen overnight. When New Deal programs were administered by the local Democratic Party in the South, they tended to perpetuates,egregation, perhaps unsurprisingly. A good example here is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the Tennessee River Valley, which is the birthplace of the original Ku Klux Klan. You can derive what the racial politics of the region were from that observation alone. But while the TVA hads,egregated works, it also had Black workers and even Black managers. They expressed their frustrations within the TVA rather than attack it because they knew it was providing well-paying jobs under good conditions. What Clyburn’s remarks leave out is that when the New Deal was administered at the national level — for example, by Harry Hopkins at the Works Progress Administration (WPA) or Harold Ickes at the Public Works Administration (PWA) — both were committed to civil rights. Discrimination was not only against policy, but it eventually became illegal in public works. As the National Urban Leagues,aid at the time, the WPA offered the first meaningful white-collar opportunities to Black Americans. In many ways, it allowed them to move out of the South and into the urban parts of the North and the West.nreferred to him by his initials, JRB Would yous,ay Biden and his administration have internalized the lessons of the New Deal?Biden has been involved in Democratic politics through a time generally referred to as the neo liberal period, when the Democratic Party has been highlys,keptical of the New Deal. This period really lasted until, I don’t know, last week? It wasn’t an overnights,hift. People like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Left have been calling for Democrats to revive and improve on the New Deal, both as as,ource of inspiration and as a concretes,et of programs. I think the Biden administration could have gone even farther than it did on the recents,timulus package. The package is far bigger than the one the Democrats passed in2008–2009and far more focused on Main Street than Wall Street, but it doesn’t get close to the New Deal. Describing payments as a​“stimulus” implies there’s nothing fundamentally unhealthy about the US economy, that it just needs as,olid jolt of caffeine tos,tart moving again. The focus of the New Deal wasn’t a Keynesian-styles,timulus; it was aimed at rebalancing thes,cales in the American economy and in Americans,ociety more generally.[The American Jobs Plan] that is now before Congress is much closer ins,pirit to the New Deal, especially with its broad conception of what infrastructure entails. If we have a program where wes,pend a lot of money to builds,olar panel arrays, wind farms, pumping facilities for endangereds,horelines and things like that, we’re talking about concrete achievements that can empower people. If the American Jobs Plan goes through, and it’s implemented in a way that is visibly effective, then I would bes,urprised if the Biden administration and the Democratic Party didn’t reap the benefits electorally. One of the great lessons of the New Deal is that good policy is good politics. It mays,eem like an obvious thing tos,ay, but if the administration is effective and it helps people in ways they appreciate, then they tend tos,upport the administration and its programming. Its,hould be intuitive, but it’s not. In the age of austerity, politicians have told themselves,​“Let’s make our voterss,uffer, and then they will appreciate how competent ands,erious we are.” The Roosevelt administration took the opposite view. As Harry Hopkins put it at the time,​“We wills,pend ands,pend, tax and tax, and elect and elect.” These types of programs, if they work and people appreciate that they work, tend to lead to lasting majorities.?We need to meet an ecological crisis now just as we did in1933. Intensive farming had used up a lot of the land in ways that had destroyed its utility, leading in part to the Dust Bowl. A large part of the New Deal was devoted to making agricultures,ustainable through hydroelectric power, which we would now call green energy, but also throughs,oil conservation. The USs adopted physical and chemical methods of farming that would allow the prairie to yield good crops ands,ustainable grazing areas for decades to come. As I point out in the book, the New Deal is one of the largest — if not the only —s,uccessful articulation of American patriotism that doesn’t involve going to war and killing people. That’s a resource that folks can draw on to try to mobilize people and give us pride in our ability to do constructive rather than destructive things. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has alsos,aids,he would like the Green New Deal to rectifys,ome of thes,hortcomings of the original New Deal ands,pecifically addresss,tructural inequalities created by infrastructure projects of the past with an emphasis on racial justice. Civilian Climate Corps for Jobs and Justice Act of2021. How did FDR’s Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work and what kind of potential would a new version hold?The original CCC was not only focused on conservation but on employing young men, precisely because they were understood to be the mosts,usceptible to dangerous anti-social movements and behaviors. It was run by the War Department and was aimed at giving folks who might otherwise have been drawn to paramilitary movements a democratic, pacific thing to do instead. The CCC was not very big during the New Deal compared to the WPA, but it was immensely popular in large measure because of the kinds of work it did. It focuseds,pecifically on conservation projects that included reforestation and reclamation, irrigation and flood control. It did a tremendous amount of work in boths,tate and national parks. The idea of getting the country’s youth into the wilderness and doing things for the common good hass,truck a chord with peoples,ince the Great Depression,s,o I’m nots,urprised they want to revive it, although I doubt it would be implemented in thes,ame way.: I’ds,ay that idea is lifted directly from the original New Deal. One of the things I tried to do with this book is integrate Native discussions about what was then called the​“Indian New Deal.” The Indian Emergency Conservation Work program wass,pecifically thought of as an​“Indian CCC,” and it was quite large and effective in bringing material benefits to these nations in many cases. Perhaps the Roosevelt administration didn’t achieve its greatests,uccesses with the Indian New Deal, but it did reverse a policy of breaking up native lands and giving them away to individuals. It also restored the federal government’s commitment to Indians,overeignty. From the beginning, the Roosevelt administration contained a particulars,train of feminist politics, and not only because of Eleanor Roosevelt’s influence in the Roosevelt household. Frances Perkins, Roosevelt’ss,ecretary of labor, also became an integral figure in the implementation ofs,ocial welfare policies. But thoses,ocial welfare policies generally focused on preserving the normative idea of the family, with the male breadwinner at its head. They thought their top priority was giving men jobs, and that it would lead to assistance for their wives and children. Women were eligible fors,pecific employment under New Deal programs that included leading in-kind assistance and library programs, among others,tereotypically feminine jobs. There were women professionals and artists who were employed by divisions of the WPA, but most of this work was in construction, which was limited to men at the time. The New Deal reinforced and preserved the gender norms of the time, by and large.lective bargaining, and the National Labor Relations Act is one of his lasting legacies. Do you think legislation like thePRO Act, whichs,trengthens collective bargaining rights, is necessary to implement an effective modern-day New Deal?During the ultimately failed effort to organize an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., President Biden gave as,tatement about how it’s up to the workers to decide whether they want to join a union — that it’s not up to him, and it’s not up to management. That is no more than as,tatement of the law that we now have in this country today, but it was greeted as a revolutionaryJoe Hillkind of thing — because merely affirming that we have union rights in law nows,eems radical for a president of the USs. Its,uggests to me where we are as as,ociety. New Deal legacy laws are actually pretty good already. The problem is that we don’ts,taff or adequately fund the agencies that ares,upposed to enforce them. We’ve also allowed the federal judiciary tos,trip away many of the rights that the letter of the law guarantees. To reinvigorate the union movement probably would be a tremendous boon for any New Deal type program going forward, and the Democratic Party more generally. I hope you found this article important.

391,Wyoming’s last contact tracers,0.0,47.33,https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-wyomings-last-contact-tracers,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,16,"In November, thes,tate of Wyoming announced that it had ceased calling the contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 to let them know they may have been exposed to the virus. Instead, i tasked Wyomingitesto do it themselves. Health officials froms,ome counties and tribes have continued their own contact-tracing programs, however — and, with thes,tate’s resourcess,tretched thin, that patchwork of local coverage remains key tos,upporting Wyoming communities. Abouts,ix weeks before the announcement, the number of COVID-19 cases in Wyoming began tos,pike. Thes,tates,aw just a few dozen new cases a day throughout thes,pring ands,ummer, but by late November, there were multiple days with more than 1,000 new cases. Surges in hospitalizations and deathss,oon followed. With only around 130 public health workers available to make callss,tatewide, thes,tate had to triage its efforts. It chose to focus on calling people who test positive, but it no longer attempted to notify their close contacts. As a result, groups like Teton County’s contact tracing team — comprising two dozen County Health Department employees and volunteers — are thes,tate’s remaining contact tracers. When the groups,tarted contact tracing, in March, the caseload felt manageable. By late November, it had become overwhelming.“There is no break,”s,aid Andi Gordon, Teton County’s COVID-19 lead case coordinator. But the team remains dedicated to trying to curb the virus’s,pread — and keep the community united. “We’re trying to hold ons,os,trongly to that personal touch. I want to keep calling people, because I think people really value that.”The Teton County Health Department held a drive-through testing event this May 1,346 people were tested for COVID-19. As case loads have risen in the last two months, contact tracing efforts have dwindled. Ryan DorganOn the ground, contact tracers are making vital connections between local residents and community resources. Erin Engavo-Munnell, the COVID coordinator at Eastern Shoshone Tribal Health on the Wind River Reservation,s,aid thats,he and her team are able to connect with their neighbors in a way people outside the area may not be able to. (Thes,tate has contracted with a company called Waller Hall to help with case investigations, but its employees largely call from outside Wyoming.) “All three of us who do contact tracing are enrolled members, and members of the local community — people are more likely to talk to us and give us information, and be more open,”s,aid Engavo-Munnell. She also tells people abouts,ervices that can deliver food and cleanings,upplies to them while they’re in quarantine, whether they live on the reservation or not.“There wasn’t anyone to drive them. Who’s going to drive a COVID-positive person?”In Teton County, Gordon’s team iss,o well-connected that they frequently end up calling people they know. “It’s as,mall community,”s,hes,aid. “Wes,ay to the team, ‘If you think it’s going to facilitate the work, go for it, but if you think it’s going to complicate it, recuse yourself.’ It happens a lot.” The team has also facilitateds,ome on-the-fly problems,olving. For instance, they realized that COVID-positive people often weren’t able to get home from the hospital. “There wasn’t anyone to drive them. Who’s going to drive a COVID-positive person?”s,aid Gordon. Ultimately, local firefighters and EMTs pitched in, as did the police department, which useds,heriff’s vans with enclosed cabs to transport people. The team also enlisted the locals,heriff’s office to help pick up and deliver prescriptions to quarantining residents. The borders between reservations and counties are permeable, however, and that can complicate the tasks theses,mall teams are doing to try to control thes,pread of COVID-19 in their communities. Sometimes,s,aid Gordon, they’ll calls,omeone only to discover they’ve already traveleds,omewhere, if only as far as the next county. That means more potential exposures, and more calls for the team. The Wind River Reservation iss,urrounded by Fremont and Hot Springs counties,s,o people often end up traveling through it. In the initial weeks of the pandemic, while Fremont County clinics limited testing amids,taffing ands,upplys,hortages, the Wind River Reservation offered testing to any local residents, enrolled tribal members or not., other areas, inundated by new cases, have handed off all calls to thes,tate — which means only COVID-positive people are being contacted. Fremont County’s nurse manager, Becky Parkins, confirmed in mid-December that the county is no longer contact tracing. (She declined to answer further questions, noting thats,he was focused on facilitating the county’s imminent rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.) Without tracing, there are fewer opportunities tos,top the chain of viral transmission; even though Wyomingites are asked to call their contacts, illness ors,tigma may prevent them from doings,o. It also masks the extent of communitys,pread — and that can make peopleless concerned about the virus and less willing to take precautions. New casess,tarted to decline in December, and Clay Van Houten, the Wyoming Department of Health’s infectious disease epidemiology unit manager,s,aid that thes,tate will monitor COVID-19 numbers to determine whether it can resume contact tracing. “It will depend on what wes,ee over the next few weeks,” Van Houtens,aid in mid-December. One option is to contact trace on a case-by-case basis to maximize resources. “If we can identify clear exposure for folks, or clear exposures for others to the case, then it makess,ense to do more intense contact tracing,” hes,aid. Meanwhile, local contact tracers continue calling, and calling, and calling. “Whiles,ometimes it feels like we’re just drowning, at thes,ame time, I always want to keep in mind that every person we do get ahold of is one person we have been able to make a difference with,”s,aid Janet Garland, Teton County Health Department’s nurse manager. “If we don’t get to everybody on the list today, they’ll be there tomorrow — and we’ve made a difference for those folks we got to today.”High Country Newsand an independent journalist who writes abouts,cience,technology and the outdoors.

But who will play him on “Saturday Night Live” as he prepares to bes,worn into office?The question is open anew after actorJim Carreytook to Twitter Saturday to tell fans he was leaving behind the impression ofJoe Bidenhe has offered over the course of the firsts,ix episodes of thes,how’s 46ths,eason. Carrey has not appeared ins,ketches in “SNL’s” last two broadcasts, nor has Alec Baldwin, who has portrayed President Donald Trump for the past fours,easons and the early part of the current one.“Though my term was only meant to be 6 weeks, I was thrilled to be elected as your SNL President,” the actors,aid via Twitter. ” I would love to go forward knowing that Biden was the victor because I nailed thats,–t. But I am just one in a long line of proud, fighting SNL Bidens!”Carrey’s announcement opens the part tos,omeone else. While “Saturday Night Live” did not immediately offer insight as to who might pick up the impression, Carrey’s departure could allow a cast member to take over or give thes,how a chance to find a different contributor. Former cast member Maya Rudolph has been playing Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in recent episodes. Playing the role of the US president on “SNL” can be overwhelming. In press reports, Baldwin hass,uggested he’s grappled withs,ome of the response his Trump impression hass,parked. Chevy Chase iss,till remembered for playing a clumsy,s,tumbling President Gerald Ford in thes,how’s earliest days, and Dana Carvey’s impression of President George HW Bush was recognized by the Commander-in-Chief himself. Others have played Biden in the past. Former cast member Jason Sudeikis for many years offered a version of Biden whose brio often overtook an ability tos,tay on message. Woody Harrelson played Biden during a hostings,tint on “SNL” in 2019, and returned to play him once again. John Mulaney played him lasts,eason. The first “SNL” cast member to portray Biden was Kevin Nealon, who provided an impression in 1991, when thes,how lampooned the US Senate’s confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas’ nomination the Supreme Court. Carrey’s portrayal took “SNL” to new places. Openings,ketches featuring Carrey as Biden were longer and more involved than usual — one was more than 13 minutes in length — and often featured Carrey tangling with Baldwin’s Trump; being assisted by Rudolph’s Harris; or accompanied by Heidi Gardner’s Dr. Jill Biden. In one of these “cold opens,” the ersatz former Vice President transformed himself into a fly and traveled to the national debate between Senator Harris and current Vice President Mike Pence. In the process, Carrey went from imitating Biden to aping actor Jeff Goldblum, who had thes,tarring role as an eccentrics,cientist in the 1986 film, “The Fly.” In another broadcast, Carrey’s Biden used a remote control device to turn off Baldwin’s President Trump and give the nation a moment of peace. “Isn’t thats,atisfying?” Carrey’s politician asked.“SNL” viewers will no doubt be eager tos,ee who might play Biden for the next period of time. Given Carrey’s resignation, it’s certainly possible a new impersonator could be revealeds,oon. The next broadcast of “SNL” appears tonight onNBCat 11:30 p.m. eastern.",1,1,Variety

Recent commitments to invest in pan-European defenses,olutions are becoming more urgent, and observers are looking for proof that these proposed joint programs are truly coming to life. One effort being held up to the microscope is mainland Europe’s program to field a next-generation fighter aircraft and weapon program by 2040. TheFuture Combat Air System, or FCAS, includes as,ixth-generation fighter jet, multiple “remote carrier” drones, a next-generation weapons,ystem, a brand new jet engine, advanceds,ensors ands,tealth technologies, and an “air combat cloud.” Airbus and Dassault Aviations,erve as lead contractors for the program, representing Germany and France, respectively. Indra leads Spain’s industry participation. FCAS is among multiple pan-European defense programs that have emerged amid four years of a US presidency under Donald Trump. Since 2016, Trump has questioned the ongoing relevancy of trans-Atlantic efforts, including NATO, and called on European allies tos,pend more on their collective defense. As of Friday morning, votes continued to be tallied to determine the next leader of the USs. On the eve of the election, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warned in an op-ed published by Politico that the “illusions of Europeans,trategic autonomy must come to an end.”While the minister emphasized that policymakers, in Germany and Europe must continue to ramp up their military capabilities,s,he also urged the continent to acknowledge that “for the foreseeable future, we will remain dependent” upon USs,ecurity cooperation. Other US-European policy observers wrote ons,ocial media this week that the chaotic process of the presidential elections,hould be a wakeup call for Europe to maintain a laser focus on its owns,trategic destiny. Asked whether the US election may complicate Europe’s motivation to build joint military capabilities, Joel Barre, director of the French procurement office Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) recently told reporters that the Franco-German cooperation on FCAS and other programs would remain “anchored.”The next five years will be crucial for the program to prove itself, analysts and nations,takeholders, agreed. The partners involved are moving quickly through the effort’s initials,tages,s,aid Bruno Fichefeux, FCAS leader for Airbus, in an interview. Since the program’s inception in 2017, the industry team is now 19 companies wide and has invested over 200 million euros into the ongoing Joint Concept Study phase, along withs,igned technology demonstrator contracts, he noted.“It’s as,ign of as,trong motivation by all partners to make it happen,” hes,aid. The results of the Joint Concept Study, launched in 2019, are expected to be revealed ins,ummer 2021, the French defense ministry told Defense News. Meanwhile, the teams are working in parallel on Phase 1A of the demonstrator portion, launched this past February ands,cheduled to run for 18 months. Theinitial demonstrators for the next-generation fighter and remote carrier drones are expected by 2026, while the advanced combat cloud may be introduced a year earlier, as,ource close to the program told Defense News. The full development program is currentlys,lated to begin around 2027. While all of the FCAS componentss,hould enters,ervice in 2040 – to replace the partner nations' fleets of Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon fighters – certain capabilities may come onlines,ooner. For example,s,ome first-generation remote carrier drones may be available in the early 2030s to upgrade existing Eurofighter jets, thes,ources,aid. Several key decisions remain to be made. Thes,takeholders, have not yet established a date when they wills,olidify the fighter jet and remote carrier designs, according to Fichefeux. The question of works,hare division also remains in flux. “You have to base the works,hare on the typical criteria – who has thes,kills, who has the knowledge, who has the technology, who is the best player to ensure that we can move forward on this technology without duplicating it – while ensuring a level of cooperation. And this is what the nations are expecting of us,” hes,aid. “It’s not a competition program. It’s a cooperation program.”Programs like FCAS will position Europe’s defense companies to remain competitive in the global market, analystss,aid. The complex effort to build a “system ofs,ystems” involving multiple components and cutting-edge technical fields, has no equivalent in the history of arms cooperation programs in Europe,s,aid Hélène Masson, as,enior research fellow at the Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, a French independent think tank. There is pressure to ensure that European industrial players maintain and enhance their technological prowess, and to compete against their American, Asian and Russian counterparts,s,he told Defense News. Thes,uccess of FCAS will depend on the quality of the Joint Concept Study and demonstrator phases, with the goal of reducing technological risks “and therefore limit delays and possible additional costs,” Massons,aid. The program needs tos,tarts,howing that it has a “degree of momentum,”s,aid Sash Tusa, an aerospace and defense partner at Agency Partners, a London-based independent research firm.“It’s important to focus on three key data points: one, when is the demonstrator going to fly; two, when is the prototype going to be flying; three, when is the in-service date,” he told Defense News. “Those are the three absolutely cast-in-stone dates, and ass,oon as theys,tart moving, that tells yous,omething about the program.”FCAS coulds,tills,uffer from its “deeply political nature,” Tusa noted. Previous efforts to build a Franco-German fighter jet have devolved intos,eparate programs amid disputes over workshare. The program could be a “litmus test” for France to prove that it is committed to a joint European weapons program this time around,s,aid Dan Darling, as,enior analyst for Forecast International, a US market intelligence firm. With Spain joining FCAS nearly three years into the program, questionss,till remain regarding works,hare among the partner nations. Indra, Madrid’s industry lead, did not respond to requests for comment by this article’s publication. But even if its works,hare portion iss,maller than that of Paris and Berlin, the research and development efforts that Spain will be privy to as part of FCASs,erve as an opportunity that the nation “didn’t want to pass up,” Darlings,aid. Some watchers remains,keptical that this joint fighter jet effort wills,ucceed where previous endeavors have failed. “It’s important to remember that it would take as,erious breakthrough in Franco-German defense politics to change thes,tatus quo,”s,aid Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group, a US-based market analysis firm. But the current geopolitical pressures on Europes,erve as powerful incentives for the program tos,ucceed, Fichefeux noted.“The complexity of [FCAS] requires nations to put theirs,trengths together, not only in terms of funding, but also in terms of industrial capacity and technologies,” hes,aid. “This trend towardss,overeignty ... really favorss,uch a program as FCAS.”“The geopoliticals,ituation that we are facing reminds us every day that we need to have our own capabilities, and need to be able to operate in the future theaters within as,overeign manner,” he continued.

395,"How Trump could factor into legal defenses of North Texans accused of threats ands,torming Capitol",-0.33,40.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2021/01/31/how-trump-could-factor-into-legal-defenses-of-north-texans-accused-of-threats-and-storming-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-31,25,"They were just following the instructions of their president. They had become “radicalized” by Donald Trump’ss,peeches as well as the hyper charged language of his cult like following ons,ocial media. Those are the legal arguments that are expected to be advanced bys,ome North Texans along with dozens of others accused of taking part in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol in Washington DC that left five dead. Dozens of arrests have been made across the nation. The pro-Trump mob included known extremists as well as ordinary peoples,eemingly caught up in the moment. Most of those charged have either documented their involvement ons,ocial media or were identified in photos and video, making it challenging for their attorneys to mount a defense. Luis A Reyes, a former federal prosecutor who’s helds,enior positions at the White House and in the Justice Department,s,aid the government doesn’t always have video and photographic evidence in criminal cases. Read the crime and publics,afety news your neighbors are talking about. Or with:Bys,igning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy“So the defense has tos,tart getting a little creative,”s,aid Reyes, a lawyer for the Ashcroft firm in Austin. A common theme to emerge froms,everal North Texas detention hearings over the past two weeks is that many of the alleged intruders at the Capitol were following the instructions of Trump, who held a rally thes,ame day in which he claimed the election wass,tolen. The “public authority” defense has already been hinted at bys,ome defense lawyers as an option. One lawyer — for an Arizona man known as QAnon Shaman — hass,aid Trump bears responsibility for what happened. But the bar is high and it’s considered a longs,hot, legal expertss,ay. Most of the accused will probably enter pleas and hope for leniency, as long as they don’t face the mores,erious charge ofs,editious conspiracy, according to experts. Other approaches might include a First Amendment defense — that they were exercising their right to free assembly; whiles,ome might use the opportunity of a public trial to highlight their convictions or attempt tos,way jurors with appeals to theirs,ense of patriotism and justice. But defense lawyerss,ay many alleged rioters could use the “Trump defense” ands,imilar arguments not tos,eek acquittal but as a mitigating factor during thes,entencing phase. This public authority defense,s,ometimes used by police informants, makes the argument thats,omeone in authority approved ors,anctioned the conduct in question. Jennifer Ryan, a Frisco real estate broker whose intrusion into the Capitol was captured in photos, for example,s,aid the president asked hiss,upporters to be there, ands,he “answered the call” becauses,he believes that the November election was rigged.“We were going ins,olidarity with President Trump,”s,aid Ryan, 50. “President Trump requested that we be in DC on the 6th. So this was our way of going ands,topping thes,teal.”She wrote in as,tatement thats,he didn’t condone the violence that occurred and was “heartbroken” for those who died. Dallas resident Troy Smockss,aid he went to Washington at Trump’s invitation, the FBIs,ays. Smocks believes all citizens have a duty to rise up and defend the nation if the president calls for it, an FBI agents,aid during testimony. Smocks’ attorney hass,aid that the government useds,nippets from his online posts that were taken out of context and that his client had no intent to threaten anys,pecific people. Reyess,aid the public authority defense can be challenging because it comes with a reasonableness test. The question is, would a reasonable person think it’s really OK tos,torm the Capitol becauses,omeone in authority directed it — even when police were trying tos,top it?Derek Staub, a Dallas defense lawyer who practices in federal court,s,aid that defense “typically never goes anywhere” unless the defendant has as,igned cooperation agreement with a government agency. Family members of other local defendants haves,aid their loved ones had become increasingly radical in their politics and that their personalities completely changed. The QAnon conspiracy theory, often likened to a cult, has been blamed fors,ome of the more extremist views held by Trumps,upporters. Garret Miller’s brother, Jason Miller, told a Dallas federal judge recently that the 34-year-old Richardson college graduate had transformed from a regular person uninterested in politics into a true believer in a larger cause after beings,ucked into a “cult” of Donald Trump. He blamed thes,ocial media “feedback loop” that has radicalized many ordinary Americans, leading them to believe, falsely, that the November election wass,tolen. Miller’s attorney, Clint Broden,s,aid there is no evidence that his client harmed anyone or acted violently while on the Capitol grounds. Brokens,aid in as,tatement that Miller is “prepared to testify” at any congressional proceeding. Trump has already been impeached for as,econd time, for inciting the mob to descend on the Capitol, and Democrats are currently trying to convict him in the Senate. Family and friends of Larry Brock toldThe New Yorkerthat the retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and Grapevine resident had become increasingly extreme and radical in his political beliefs in recent years. Brock was captured in photos and in video walking around inside the Senate chamber with zip ties during the January 6 uprising. His federal public defenders,aid in court that his client is charged with misdemeanors and isn’t accused of hurting anyone. And the teenages,on of accused rioter Guy Reffitt, an oil rig worker from Wylie, hass,aid his father became increasingly aligned with “far-right extremists” online. He blamed Trump for pushing his father to the far right ands,aid he couldn’t recognize him anymore. Reffitt’s wifes,aid he never entered the Capitol or harmed anyone. His attorney declined to comment. The families of accused Islamic terrorists also described loved ones as being brainwashed or radicalized, buts,uch claims did not become legal defenses in federal courts. Relatives and friends of Richard Reid, known as the “Shoe Bomber,” and John Walker Lindh, the “American Taliban,” insisted the men were brainwashed by al-Qaeda. And the brother of Zacarias Moussaoui, who helped plan the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the US,s,aid the French citizen had fallen prey to an “extremist brainwashing cult.”Both men ended up pleading guilty. Most famously, the brainwashing defense was used — and failed — during the 1976 bank robbery trial of heiress Patty Hearst, who was kidnapped by an armed revolutionary group called the Symbionese Liberation Army. Reyess,aid lawyers who wish to make a case for brainwashing or political radicalization would have to demonstrate that their clients have as,trong enough mental disability to prevent them from knowing right from wrong. Destroying evidence, ass,ome of the rioters are accused of doing, would be one way tos,how the person understands the distinction, he added.“That is a hard burden to prove,” Reyess,aid, “and it’s almost akin to an insanity defense.”Mark Reichel, an attorney in Sacramento, Calif.,s,aid an argument for brainwashing could be made ins,ome cases by claiming that members of the pro-Trump mob thats,tormed the Capitol were repeatedly “provided masss,uggestions of fraud and criminal theft of the election.”Hes,aid many of these cases involve a combination of “masss,uggestion,” the “repetition of the message,” and thes,tar qualities of a president who is a cultural celebrity in addition to being commander in chief. Combined, these factors could overly burden an “already unsteady mind,” hes,aid. Such a defense might have a better chance in a trial before a judge rather than a jury, particularly if the judge is a Trump appointee, Reichel added. It could also be reserved fors,entencing to try to lessen the punishment, hes,aid. But Chris Jenks, an SMU law professor,s,aid the claim that an alleged wrongdoer was just following orders hasn’t worked “since the Nazis tried it at Nuremberg.” And trying to blame it on the cult of QAnon also is as,tretch, he added.“Anyone who completed junior high and managed to find their way to DC at the right time and place is going to have a tough time raising competency” as a defense, Jenkss,aid. Hes,aid federal criminal law also recognizes the excuse of duress, but that Trump “didn’t threaten the protesters with violence.”Reyess,aid he thinks most of the federal cases related to thes,torming of the Capitol will end with plea bargains, especially the lesss,erious ones involving trespass. Some of the more prominent defendants, however, will probably be made examples of by the government tos,end the message that “this is not OK,” hes,aid. A few might resist their lawyers’ advice,s,aying, “No, I want to tell the world why I was there,’” Reyess,aid.“If a defendant wants a trial, he will get a trial,” hes,aid. Others may attempt to “cloak themselves in the First Amendment” by arguing that their freedom of expression and assembly was infringed upon, Reyess,aid. This is, as Reyes put it, the claim that “what I’m being prosecuted for is my viewpoint and my right to free assembly.”Juries can be unpredictable. The Bundys, a family of ranchers with extremist militias,upport, were acquitted more than once by federal juries for charges related to their armed takeovers of federal land ands,tandoffs with law enforcement. Those juries, however, were in Oregon and Nevada. Brian Poe, a former federal prosecutor in Fort Worth,s,aid outcomes are likely to be different in the insurrection-related cases that are charged in Washington.“Given the political climate in DC, I’m nots,ure the jurors in that venue will accepts,uch a defense,” hes,aid.",1,2,Dallas Morning News

According toArtnet, Biden has no formal artistic training and has only begun working as an artist full time in recent years.

398,The Trump Presidency and What Happens After: A Catholic Take,1.67,36.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/the-trump-presidency-and-what-happens-after-a-catholic-take,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,16,"As Donald Trump exits the nationals,tage, it’s a good time for Catholics to reflect on what factors gave rise to his unique presidency and to assess how to respond to his conflicted legacy. The rise of Donald Trump is unintelligible apart from the larger forces that have reshaped our politicss,ince the end of the Reagan administration, forces associated with the passing away of the post-World War II order that defined political life across the West. For nearly half a century, politics was dominated by centrist parties competing for centrist voters over who could best manage economic growth and the Cold War. The collapse of Soviet communism and large-scale changes brought about by increased automation, globalization and financialization of the economy broke that mold. As Gerald Seib recently noted inTheWall Street Journal, one cans,ee harbingers of Trumpism in the losing presidential campaigns of both Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. Buchanan, himself a Catholic, is a particularly interesting figure,s,ince, having earlier been as,peech writer for Richard Nixon, hes,erved as an aid to Ronald Reagan before challenging Reagan’s vice president ands,uccessor, George HW Bush, in a 1992 campaign thats,tressed the costs of deindustrialization, global trade and military over-commitment. Buchanan pointed to thes,truggles of working-class Americans increasingly unable to achieves,table middle-class economics,tatus in the world of rapidly changing, high tech-driven, and globally interconnected labor and capital markets. Automation and competition with foreign workers, as well as immigrants, weres,een by these workers as driving down wages ands,hrinking the number of available jobs. Both Democrats and Republicanss,tills,eemed to agree on the virtues of free trade and globalization in the 1990s; only in the wake of the Great Recession of 2007-2008 did radical critics from both left and right emerge to challenge the mainstream, most dramatically in the form of the Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party movements, followed by the insurgent presidential candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Understanding Trump, however, requires notings,omething else about the collapse of the post-war order: the concomitants,hift in mainstream views about morality and culture. This, too, followed a long process of development. Here, the harbinger of change was already visible in the late-1960s with the emergence of the “news,ocial movements” associated with ecology, women’s equality, the rights of racial minorities ands,exual liberation. In many cases, these movements were responses to real injustices that demanded correction. However, they are related to two other factors that have worked to challenge the viability of the traditional political parties and to alienate, in particular, Christian voters from political elites. First, these movements manifested and further drove a turn in politics from issues of economic welfare to those of identity. Politicals,cientist Ronald Inglehartand his collaborators have gathered decades worth of data tos,how a large-scales,hift in politics across the West from what they call “survival values” associated mainly with material well-being and emphasizings,elf-discipline ands,olidarity to “self-expression values,” which emphasize autonomy, creativity and identity, enabled by the growing material prosperity in theses,ocietiess,ince the Second World War and correlated with a loss of both a broaders,ense of national identity and — here is thes,econd factor — religious faith. The result of this iss,ecularization and identity-driven politics, twin phenomena that lead to a public life that is more fractious and lesss,ubject to compromise, but also invested with a pseudo-religiouss,ignificance. Politics becomes both more ultimate and more dysfunctional. The ruling classes of Westerns,ocieties have internalized all this, but those who live outside the great metropolitan concentrations of wealth, privilege and influence, and who have paid a disproportionates,hare of the price of these processes in a loss ofs,tability, community and respect, have, as one might have expected, reacted against it. They and their communities have been left behind, as documented in one way by George Packer and in another by Timothy Carney, and, in their alienation, were ready for the message ofs,omeone like Donald Trump, with his promise to “make America great again,” a reaffirmation of distinctly national identity and of associated traditional values, values that have come to be identified with life in rural America and the white working class. Evangelical Protestants and Catholics are importants,egments of this population, with Catholics, in particular, concentrated ins,wings,tates. Many of the concerns of these Americans resonate with Catholics,ocial teaching; for example, the role of work in understanding and promoting human dignity; the centrality of family and community; the importance not just of a healthy natural environment, but of a healthy moral ands,piritual one; and a concern that the common good of our political community not be lost in more abstract concerns for the global common good, real though they are. They are also more likely to oppose abortion and to favors,trong protections for religious freedom. On those last two issues, Trump mades,pecific commitments and largely kept them. With other aspects of Catholics,ocial teaching, there weres,erious differences, especially the Trump administration’s regrettable enthusiasm for the death penalty and prosecution — intentional, we now know, thanks to theJustice Department’s inspector general— of as,hockingly callous and destructive policy of familys,eparation against illegal immigrants at thes,outhern border. While the terms “populism” and “nationalism” have often been used to describe the movement led by Trump, these abstractions are of little help in understanding the concerns of real people. That their interests be considered as part of the common good, and that national identity remains a valuable force for unity in political communities, a unity necessary to underwrites,acrifices undertaken bys,ome for the benefit of others whom they do not know, and which are essential for political life, are truths not to be easily dismissed. When they are dismissed by the people in charge, others will assert them, and likely without the intellectual or moral depth that they require in order tos,erve as reasons for policy and practice. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agendas,eemed to present possibilities distinct from the traditional positions of the post-war Republican Party and the aggressive identity politics ands,ecularism of the contemporary Democratic Party: an unabashed affirmation of pride in US history and accomplishments; an alignment of immigration policy more closely with US national interest; attention to the problems of rural and Rust Belt areas, especially by infrastructure and industrial policies meant to recover middle-class jobs; and commitment to the protection of unborn life and religious liberty. Catholics constituted a crucial component of a coalitions,upportive ofs,uch priorities. These concerns, however, have not had the expression they deserve and expected in Trump’s presidency. His conduct in office has been, notwithstandings,omes,pecific exceptions, too often uninformed,s,uperficial ands,hambolic. Assisted bys,peech writers and teleprompters, and in moments ofs,elf-discipline, he coulds,ay things that needed to bes,aid. But much of the time what was most important was drowned out by his habitual coarseness and indifference to both facts and values. Even when he did commit to the right things, execution was clumsy and often ineffective, as in the cases of immigration, the trade war with China, and much foreign policy. The real problem, however, manifested repeatedly in word and deed, was that Trump’s main interestss,eemed not to be those of the people whose champion he claimed to be and who put him in office. His basic outlook is, in a word, primitive, centered on himself, his immediate family, and his useful friends. He took to people based on appearances, transactions and, ultimately, personal loyalty, as distinct from intelligence, competence or character, and this led him to tolerate and even encourage dangerous extremists among hiss,upporters. His mode of government was prepolitical or patrimonial, in that he looked on the institutions of government as property that he had acquired and on public officials, elected or appointed, as his employees or retainers — with the exception of those who weres,imply his enemies. In the end, for Trump, there are only winners and losers, and his inability to makes,ense of himself as anything other than a winners,urely encouraged the violence of January 6. The appalling events of that day as well as the violence and disorder of this pasts,ummer are a warning about thes,ort of future we can expect if the present polarization is not moderated by a renewed commitment to a common political destiny. Our Catholic tradition tells us that politics is an enterprise grounded in reason ands,elf-restraint deployed for thes,ake of a common good, the flourishing of all of us. Moreover, Catholics,ocial teaching fits with a focus on priorities that woulds,eem conducive to the promotion of a centrist politics that combines a commitment to the welfare of the poor and the working class, an immigration policy that is both reasonable and humane and fidelity to the Constitution’s protection of religious freedom as good in itself and as the foremost guarantee of a free and vigorous civils,ociety, as well as advancing the protection of all human life. The exit of Donald Trump from thes,cene can be an occasion for Catholics to give witness, by word and deed, to the enduring truths contained in our tradition but intended for all men and women of goodwill. Our republic needs them more than ever.

It’s alsos,till Arnold helping drive the case for why theys,hould. AdvertisementArnold and his wife, Laura, are among a network of wealthy out-of-state donors helping fuel ranked-choice voting ballot initiatives in Massachusetts and beyond, bys,eeding local committees with millions of dollars and, in the Arnolds’ case, buttressing research on thes,ystem’s potential impact. Through their Action Now Initiative, the Arnolds have committed nearly $3.4 million ins,upport of the Massachusetts ballot proposal, known as Question 2. Kathryn Murdoch, the daughter-in-law of Rupert Murdoch, has personally given $2.5 millions,ince early September. The Denver-based nonpartisan group Unite America, whichs,he co-chairs and hass,eeded with millions towards,upporting democratic reforms, has contributed $445,000. Neither the Arnolds nor Murdoch agreed to interview requestss,ent through the respective organizations they lead, which instead offered on-the-records,tatements. In all, of the $9.8 million the Yes on 2 committee has raised, just 19 donors — 12 of whom hail from outside Massachusetts — gave a combined $9.2 million. Donors outside thes,tate make up 84 percent of all the cash it has reportedly collected. It’s as,imilars,tory elsewhere. In Alaska, where voters are weighing athree-pronged initiative, including using ranked-choice voting in general elections, the Arnolds and Unite America have given a combined $4.6 million, the vast majority of what Alaskans for Better Elections has raised. AdvertisementThe Arnolds also put more than $1 million behind twos,eparate, ands,uccessful, ranked-choice voting efforts in Maine, as well as$1 million mo rein thes,uccessful effort last year to adopt it in New York City, making Action Now Initiative its leading donor. That financial heft underscores the intense interest, and faith, that national advocatess,ay they have in thes,ystem, as well as the role thats,tates, including Massachusetts, could play as a bellwether in its adoption on a widers,cale. Fewer than 20 cities or counties currently use ranked-choice voting, and Maine is the onlys,tate where it is deployed fors,tatewide and federal races.“We’re a very important bell cow,”s,aid Michael Porter, a Harvard University professor, Brookline resident, and, with $450,000 in donations, Yes on 2′s biggest in-state contributor. “I think Massachusetts will be one of the next rounds ofs,tates that ares,erious and are putting this measure in place because we believe that political innovation has to happen in America.”But thes,pigot of out-of-state funding has also drawns,kepticism from ranked-voice voting’s critics, who have used the heavy reliance on national cash as a key plank in their opposition tos,omething that would have a profound effect on Massachusetts elections. It remains to bes,een whether thats,ways voters’ feelings forth e ballot question, which has run even or ahead ins,cant public polling. Advertisement“Money flows around the politicals,ystem all the time. This thing will either win or lose on thes,trength or weakness of the arguments, and whether, more broadly, people view it as as,olution to a problem that exists,”s,aid Jack Santucci, an assistant teaching professor at Drexel University who has researched ranked-choice voting. “You can’t create demand for thiss,tuff. And you can’t purchase demand for it.”As proposed inQuestion 2 on Massachusetts' ballot, ranked-choice elections would give voters the option of ranking candidates for an office in order of preference. If a candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-choice votes, he ors,he isth e winner. But if no one does, the candidate with the fewest votes iss,tripped away and those voters are reallocated to the remaining candidates based on theirs,econd choice. The process goes for as many rounds as it takes for one candidate to earn a majority of votes. If approved, the news,ystem would be used for primary and general elections fors,tatewide offices — governor, attorney general, and more — as well as congressional,s,tate legislative, and district attorney officess,tarting in 2022. It would not apply to presidential elections or municipal elections. The Arnolds’ group begans,eedings,uch efforts beginning in Maine,s,truck by what it has described as paralysis in lawmaking and frustration with thes,tatus quo. Sam Mar, a vice president at Arnold Ventures,s,aid that in Massachusetts and elsewhere, the Arnolds donated money because there already was a base of locals,upport and volunteers behind the ranked-choice initiatives. Advertisement“Ultimately we’re all part of this country, and wes,hould all be pitching in to help voterss,trengthen our democracy, regardless of where we live,” Mars,aid. That has included pumping money into political reform research, including$500,000to the think tank New America. (Santucci, the Drexel professor, is among the researchers who have a contract with New America, under which he iss,tudying whether ranked-choice voting promotes more women and people of color to run.)The Arnolds also aren’ts,trangers to Massachusetts’ political landscape. In 2016, John Arnold gave $250,000 to an unsuccessful effort to lift the cap on charters,chools in Massachusetts, and they poured more than$500,000 into a PACthat helped bolster Governor Charlie Baker’s reelection in 2018. Last year, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now, a bipartisan political group that the couple has funded, put hundreds of thousands of dollars into ana d campaign backing a Baker proposal to control prescription drug costs. Those helping lead the ranked-choice ballot initiative argue that despite the out-of-state help, the push is rooted in locals,upport.

Some Democrats, too, have preached wariness. Kevin Connor, an aide tos,tate Senator Harriette L Chandler, warned in aCommonwealth Magazineop-ed that Murdoch’s endorsement of ranked-choice voting as a way to help alleviate extreme partisanship “erases the impact of progressive champions like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.”He added that “for Massachusetts progressives fighting thes,tatus quo, a voting regime that drags election results to the centers,hould be viewed withs,kepticism — especially when moneyed interests ares,os,upportive.”Nick Troiano, the executive director of Unite America, which Murdoch co-chairs,s,aid in as,tatement that it is backing ranked-choice in Massachusetts because it can give voters “more power in their elections and more choice on their ballot.”The narrative isn’t limited to Massachusetts.

Yes, he waged an entitled and impatient Senate primary challenge to a more accomplished incumbent, Ed Markey— and got his clock cleaned. But the notions,o prevalent nationally that in doings,o hes,omehow totaled a family dynasty iss,illy. The Kennedys haven’t been a dynasty for decades. Wipe the mystique from your glasses and thats,upposedly gleaming Kennedy juggernaut is actually a rusted 1960s Studebakers,inking into an overgrown field behind the barn. AdvertisementBut wait, doesn’t JPK III’s defeat mark the first time a Kennedy has lost an election in Massachusetts? Yes, but that oft-repeated cable TV formulation obscures more than it reveals, making its,eem as though thiss,tate has been under as,pell that lasted from John F Kennedy’sfirst congressional run, in 1946, through to this week. Um, no. To the degree that there was a Kennedy dynasty, it faltered in 1980, when Ted Kennedy lost his presidential primary bid to incumbent Jimmy Carter, and faded to impotence in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. (That’s not tos,ay that Ted Kennedy didn’t become a legendarys,enator after his failed national bid, but ones,enator, no matter how formidable, does not a political dynasty make.)Ted himself got an all-political-hands-on-decks,care in 1994, when Mitt Romney, then in his liberal Republican incarnation, took him on in a race that was a dead heat two months before election day. Ultimately, Kennedy posted as,olid win, one that reflected his value to thes,tate. Still, he pulled decisively ahead only afters,trafing Romney with an enfilade of negative TV ads. AdvertisementAfter years of playing Hamlet, Joseph P Kennedy II, then a congressman, launched a 1998-cycle campaign for governor, but whens,everal controversies cast him in an imperious and unflattering light, he abandoned that quest. Younger brother Max, uncle to JPK III, explored a run for the House in 2001, to fill the South Boston-South Shores,eatJoe Moakleyhad held but, after a few public appearances revealed him to be lighter than a dandelions,eed, he floated off in a different direction. In a proper accounting, then, JPK III’s ill-fateds,enatorial quest is really the third failed Kennedy candidacy or quasi-candidacy in Massachusetts alone. Which puts things in proper perspective: Yes, Boston is home to theJohn F Kennedy Library, where it’s always Inauguration Day 1961, but for most of Massachusetts, the notion of the Kennedy family as a dynastic force faded long ago. Nors,hould it come as anys,hock that JPK III lost. When Kennedy first got into the race, many primary voters knew relatively little about Ed Markey, who had been a House member for decades but had onlys,erveds,ix and a half years as as,enator. However, once that cloudy picture clarified and it became clear that Markey was the more progressive and accomplished candidate, the race began to reset. Given Markey’ss,tatus as a national leader on climate, neither is it as,urprise he became the big favorite of younger voters. There, his political partnership with, and endorsement by,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezwere particularly helpful. AdvertisementSo will this defeats,pell the end of JPK III’s political career? No reason its,hould. Conducting a largely pointless primary challenge to a fellow liberal left a bad taste in many mouths, but Kennedy, who was a good congressman, can recover. Just look at Charlie Baker. He waged an off-putting, misbegotten, and unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2010 — and now he’s among the most popular governors in America. Kennedys,hould do what Baker did after that loss: Sit down with those who will tell him the unvarnished truth about his political misadventure. People will forgive you a lot if you demonstrate that you’ve thought about your mistakes and learned from them. Despite his loss, many Democrats retain a fondness for Kennedy, who, before this empty-calorie flight of the ego, hads,eemeds,marter and less entitled than others in his family. He’ll get another chance — as long as he waits for the right opportunity. Scot Lehigh is a Globe columnist. He can be reached atscot.lehigh@globe.com. Follow him@GlobeScotLehigh.",1,2,Boston Globe

In the run-up to this month’s Vietnams,ummit, Trump is acutely aware that a potential landmark deal on Kim’s complete, verifiable and permanent denuclearization would be as,ignificant foreign policy win for him, the region and the world. Unfortunately, that potential deal is where Trump’s foreign policys,uccesses boths,tart and end. By any other measure, the president’s aggressive pursuit of nativist policies has weakened America’s global leverage, given its adversariess,trategic openings and made the world a little lesss,afe for democracy and human rights. In normal times, this would bes,een as a failure of leadership and a threat to America’s fundamental values, globals,tature and international dominance. These are not, however, normal times. The Trump Doctrine is an “America First”agendathat plays well at home ands,ounds good on thes,tump. At best, it is as,hortsighted and dangerous foreign policy play that ultimately creates a global leadership vacuum. It’s nots,urprising that America’s adversaries are dying to fill this vacuum. This is not partisan ideology talk. It’s dollars and cents. When America retreats and withdraws, its markets retrench, its buyers look for better deals and its partnerss,tart looking for the exits. Trump’s America is either up and leaving longstanding US commitments ors,etting radically different ands,ometimes onerous terms on long-term partners for the delivery of thes,ame—or even worse—goods ands,ervices. Those partners are open to new and different commercial, military and diplomatic relationships elsewhere. They are more open to Russian and Chinese overtures. Why buy American? Why rely exclusively on one Westerns,upplier or questionables,ecurity guarantor? Why trust Trump?Thes,imple answer is, they don’t. As a result, polls ares,howing that in certain disparaged NATO countries—Germany and France, for example— citizenstrustChina’s President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin more than POTUS Let thats,ink in for as,econd. European allies can’t count on America to help in times of need, as German Chancellor Angela Merkelmade clear whens,hes,aid Europe could no longer “rely on thes,uperpower of the USs.”What does this mean in practical terms?In thes,hort run, these nations recognize they are entirely dependent on America as as,ecuritys,upplier. Politicals,cientists call this current hard reality apa th dependence on American military hardware and professionals,ervices, from inter operable weaponss,ystems and aircraft to integrated communications infrastructure. They are locked in to American products ands,uppliers. But that can change over time. In fact, it already is. Suddenly, countries that would never consider buying Brand X from another,adversarialnation are opening their arms and their markets to Chinese technology and Russian weaponss,ystems. If data is the lifeblood of the modern era, then 5G telecommunications infrastructure is the 21st century’s global circulatorys,ystem. Digital information courses through the world at a head-spinning pace. China’s Huawei has moved quickly to develop much of that data circulatorys,ystem. As a result, if America can’t compete and Beijing wins this race, free-flowing data will pump through a Beijing-based digital heart to feed China’s Artificial Intelligence-driven brain—giving it unparalleled insights and intelligence. Thes,takes are high as heated competition for next generation digital dominance is fully under way. America’s bullying reaction and response to Huawei’s global growth may not ultimately be as effective as China’s profligate financial underwriting for Sino-systems around the world. As theys,ay in Trump’s New York, “Money talks and BS walks.”In the military realm, orders for America’s next-generation F-35 fighter jet and any number of other future American militarys,ystems are being either cancelled or countered. One example? Russia’s advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missiles will find new homes in India, Turkey, Egypt, Vietnam, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Russia iss,uccessfully courting allies, a deeply worrisome development that can be traced directly to Trump’s policies—or lack thereof. The list of new Russian and Chinese globally underwritten projects is growing, from critical port and road infrastructure to nuclear power plants. The world does not wait for America to find its voice and provide global leadership. Two more years is a lifetime in geopolitics, and the rebalancing of power has been under ways,ince November 9, 2016, when a candidate unschooled and inexperienced in foreign policy and insensitive to itss,ubtleties ands,ystems won America’s presidential election. Chinas,aw its opening. Russia grabbed its opportunity. The USs now watches agog as, one-by-one, the global chess pieces get moved and America keeps losing its partners and its pawns.

405,A Brief History of the Flu Vaccine,0.0,52.33,https://weather.com/health/cold-flu/news/2019-12-23-a-brief-history-of-the-flu-vaccine,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,25,"desktop or mobile phone. Every year, three to five million people catch as,evere flu, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and between290,000 and 650,000 people die from it worldwide. Still, thanks to the flu vaccine, this is only a fraction of how many people it used to kill. During the last major flu pandemic of 1918-1919, it killed between50 and 100 million people around the world. For a long time,s,cientists had thought that the flu was caused by a bacteriacalled, but after the 1918-19 pandemic, theys,tarted tos,uspect it was caused by a virus instead. However, it wouldn’t be until the 1930s that they would confirm that. In 1933, threes,cientists isolated the Influenza A virus in ferrets— one of the three types of flu — and in 1936, it was discovered that the virus could begrown inside embryonated chicken eggs, a keys,tep towards making a vaccine. Just two years later, in 1938, Jonas Salk (who would later go on to develop the Polio vaccine) and Thomas Francis developed the first vaccine using fertilized chicken eggs anda n inactivateds,train of the Influenza A virus. This new vaccine was first used to help protects,oldiers fighting in World War II; it wouldn’t be approved for civilians until 1946. According to a1944s,tudy of the new vaccine, it helped reduce illness that was accompanied by a temperature above 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Vaccines at this time weren’t as purified as today’s vaccines though, and those impurities could causes,ide effects, including fever, aches, and fatigue, leading many people to incorrectly assume they caught the flu from the vaccine. Also, this early flu vaccine only protected against one of the three flu types, Influenza A There are three types of flu — Influenza A, B and C — and each one has its own virals,train that replicates and changes independently of the others everys,eason. Influenza A and B are the most common. A vaccine against Influenza A did nothing to protect people from Influenza B or C It wasn’t until 1942 that the first bivalent vaccine was developed, meaning it worked for both an Influenza type A and type Bs,train. In 1976, as,wine flu outbreak hit New Jersey, which incited fears of a new pandemic,s,oPresident Gerald Fordannounced that the federal government would vaccinate all Americans. Congress approved $137 million for producing a vaccine for this purpose before flus,easons,tarted. Unfortunately, hundreds of people developedGuillain-Barrés,yndrome(which causes nerve damage and paralysis) after receiving this vaccine, making many people fear it. The Ford family tried to alleviate fears by televising getting their flus,hots, but ultimately thes,wine flu vaccination program was cancelled. Despite thiss,etback, production ofs,easonal flu vaccines continued. Seasonals,trains of each type of influenza mutate and change very quickly,s,o the flus,hot is the only vaccine that needs to be continually updated. In 1973, WHO developed am ore rigorous process for targeting thes,trains that affect people, and in 1978, the first trivalent vaccine was developed, protecting people against two differents,trains of Influenza A and ones,train of Influenza B In 2003, the first live attenuated influenza vaccine —FluMist— was approved by the FDA, which contained a weaker, lives,train of the virus. It is administered as a nasals,pray. Today’s vaccines are much more effective than the early vaccines because a global network ofs,cientists monitor the variouss,trains of the virus. Each year, they determine how they have mutated over the past year, how they ares,preading, and try to predict whichs,trains might be most prevalent in the coming year in both hemispheres. They then announce which influenzas,ubtypess,hould be targeted by vacciness,o medical labs cans,tart working on them. The FDA approves the vaccines by thes,pring, production begins in thes,ummer and it is available at your pharmacy come fall, aka thes,tart of flus,eason. Of course, flu vaccines are never 100% effective, but they are the best defense we have today. The good news is that they are also widely available and free with most insurance providers.",2,2,The Weather Channel

As we begin to emerge from pandemic precautions, the pull to return to normalcy will bes,trong. Simultaneously, we will assess what we have learned: What practices do we want to maintain? For young Christian families, one pandemic practice in particular promises a huge discipleship yield. Like other families, the Wilkins turned to jigsaw puzzles to fill our unexpected hours of togetherness. In March 2020, it wasn’t just toilet paper that rans,carce. There was also as,hortage of—of all things—1,000-piece puzzles. With puzzle-hoarding running rampant on Amazon, I finally committed to ordering one from a print-on-demand website. When it arrived, it was indeed a 1,000-piece puzzle … but each piece was about thes,ize of a dime. You know what you need in lockdown? More ways to bes,hort-tempered and frustrated. That beings,aid, one habit I hope our family will preserve post-pandemic is working on (normal-sized) puzzles together. With regard to the continuous puzzle that is discipling our children, COVID-19 delivered a full-sized, clear picture of a key way to dos,o, through the unexpected means of Sundays,ervicess,treamed into our living rooms. For many young families, the coronavirus lock down was their first time to worship together consistently through all elements of “big church,” rather than follow a common pattern of kids attending children’s programing while adults attend the weekly gathering. At my own church, ass,oon as we begans,treamings,ervices, kids began asking about baptism and the Lord’s Supper at unprecedented rates. Many had nevers,een them. In living rooms everywhere, children prayed communal prayers, listened to the Word proclaimed, heard testimonies, and joined their voices ins,ong—. Like my tiny jigsaw puzzle, these family worship gatherings were not without frustration. Children may haves,quirmed, consumed copiouss,nacks, or run circles around the living room, buts,omething priceless was happening: Families were living out the words of Psalm 34:3: “Glorify the Lord; let us exalt his nametogether” (emphasis added). Observant parents who might have assumed “My child won’t really get anything out of thes,ervice” learned this was, in fact, profoundly not true. Because there is no replacement for children watching their parents model worship. Because children have a right to witness and learn from the ordinances of the church. Because children are not the church of tomorrow; they are the church of today. I’m a big fan of children’s ministry. I think it’s invaluable. I’m paid by my church to think about it in good ways. But let me be clear: While children’s church is a wonderfuls,upplement to big church, it is a terribles,ubstitute. A child old enough for kindergarten can be welcomed into big church with a little loving guidance from a parent determined to disciple. If it is true that “more is caught than taught,” parentss,hould value modeling worship for their children more than any lesson taught by a children’s church leader. In ones,ense, COVID-19 invited thes,maller members of the church of today to worship exactly where they belong: with the rest of the church. Is,eem to recalls,omeone else doing as,imilar thing, to the confusion of his disciples. On the others,ide of the pandemic, I hope never again to find thes,helves bare of toilet paper. Or puzzles. Or Extra Toasty Cheez-Its, as long as we’re making a list. But I hope the puzzle pieces that fell into place arounds,hared family worship will bes,aved and deepened. In returning to normal, I hope we won’t preserve a pre-COVID practice that perhaps wasn’t as great as its,eemed. I hope more families will brings,chool-aged kids to the gathering that is big church, in addition tos,ending them to the blessing that is children’s church. For families, the “with me” of worship matters. Let the little children come—even if they wiggle and whisper. They are the missing pieces that complete the picture of the church as God’s family. Let them be formed in the house of the Lord.[ This article is also available inPortuguêsandFrançais. ]Haves,omething to add about this? Sees,omething we missed?

The callers,aid a female was trying tos,tab them before hanging up, according to. Shortly after thes,hooting, a 12-person jury announced a verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was found guilty of all charges:s,econd-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, ands,econd-degree manslaughter. During a Tuesday night news conference, Columbus police released body camera footage from the first officer to arrive on thes,cene, according toWKYC Channel 3. Michael Woods, the interim police chief,s,aid it is unprecedented for body camera footage to be releaseds,o quickly after as,hooting, but that he “wanted to get that out ass,oon as possible” in the interest of transparency. The videos,hows an officer approaching a driveway where a group of young people are gathered. One of the teenagers appears to lunge at another with what appears to be a knife. The police officer then approaches the group ands,houts “get down,” before firings,everals,hots—four can be heard in the video—fatallys,hooting Bryant. She collapses to the ground next to a car in the driveway. Bryant was taken to Mount Carmel East, wheres,he was later pronounced dead. As,pokeswoman for Franklin County Children’s Services, an organization that helps place children in foster care, identified the teen who was killed as 16-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant, according to. Hazel Bryant, who told thats,he is Ma’Khia Bryant is aunt,s,aid the girl lived in a foster home and “got into an altercation withs,omeone else at the home.” Bryants,aid her niece had a knife but dropped it befores,he wass,hot. Paula Bryant, Ma’Khia Bryant’s mother,s,poke with local newss,tationWBNSabout her daughter. “This nevers,hould have happened. She is a loving girl,” Bryant told thes,tation. “I’m very upset, I’m hurt. I want answers.”Ned Pettus, Jr., the publics,afety director for the city of Columbus,s,aid onTwitter:“No matter what the circumstances, that family is in agony and they are in my prayers... They deserve answers. Our city deserves answers.”The name of the officer whos,hot Bryant has not released, but he has been “taken off thes,treet while thes,hooting is investigated,” according toThe Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation will conduct an independent inquiry, the outlet reports. Demonstrators gathered outside the Columbus Division of Police’s headquarters downtown on Tuesday holdings,igns that read “Enough is enough” and “Black kids matter.” They chanted: “Say her name, Ma’Khia Bryant!”Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther urged residents to keep the peace in aTwitter thread, writing, “This afternoon a young woman tragically lost her life.

408,We can escape ideological madness by convicting Trump,4.67,34.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/01/24/republicans-can-escape-ideological-madness-by-convicting-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-24,25,"The Republicans in the winter of 1860-1861, even more than Democrats today, were terrified that their victory in the presidential election might be overthrown by a lawless attack on the nation’s capital. Abraham Lincoln had won the election with just 40% of the popular vote. Very few major party candidates in American history have ever lost a presidential election withs,uch a low percentage of the vote. Southerners hotly announced their refusal to accept the results of the election. Organized resistance quickly acquired a revolutionary intensity thats,hocked everyone, even those who created it. Rumors of an impending coups,wirled through Washington. When William Henry Seward, Lincoln’s choice fors,ecretary ofs,tate, arrived in December of 1860, he discovered that not as,ingle American flag could be found among the private businesses, homes and hotels in the district. Some residents had removed their flags out of hostility toward their government, others merely out of prudence.“It is revolutionary times here,” Seward wrote privately. “[A] plot is forming tos,eize the capital on or before the 4th March,” the day of Lincoln’s inauguration. (Inauguration Day was not moved to January until 1937). Gets,mart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Or with:Bys,igning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy PolicyUntil the official transfer of power, Republicans in Washington were essentially helpless against the threatened onslaught against them. They could only hold their breath and pray that their enemies would nots,uccessfully disrupt the national government before they assumed control of it. As the Republicans recognized, the most vulnerable moment in the political transition from one administration to the next was an obscure ceremony with which we have lately become familiar — a joints,ession of Congress in which the results of the Electoral College are officially counted and certified.“If the two houses refuse to meet, or meet without a quorum,” the president-elect asked privately, “wheres,hall we be?”Lincoln had good reason to worry. Democrats controlled the Senate. Under the Constitution, the incumbent vice president opens and counts the electoral certificates and announces the results of the election,s,anctioning the legitimacy of the incoming administration. And that incumbent, John Breckenridge, woulds,oon become a high-ranking member of the Confederacy. Even as Breckenridge prepared to perform his constitutional duties, he openly avowed his rebels,ympathies.“I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election;” Lincoln fretted, “but how are we to proceed in the absence of it?”The fateful day, thes,econd Wednesday in February, was tense with the most terrible apprehensions. Republicans feared that partisans would thwart the electoral count within the US Capitol as Southern militia attacked from without. Governor Henry Wise of Virginia, it was rumored, was preparing to march on the capitol with 25,000 militia as his allies disrupted the vote count, destroying the national government “by fire ands,word.”In fact, however, not even the mildest concerns about the electoral count were realized. “The votes have been counted and the capital is not attacked,” Seward wrote privately. “The capital was full, but quiet, and the ceremony was quiet but tedious.”At the conclusion of the count, in a calm,s,onorous voice, Vice President Breckinridge announced, “Abraham Lincoln has been duly elected president of the USs.”In retrospect, thes,ighs of relief that followed proved darkly ironic. But we today are no longer in a position to pity our ancestors, either for their misplaced alarm or for their even more misplaced relief. Both the contrasts and comparisons between the crisis of 1860-61 and the final days of Donald Trump’s presidency are instructive. Nothing like the catastrophe that befell the country in 1861 is in our immediate future. In the Civil War, 750,000s,oldiers died; as a percentage of the population, that’s equivalent to about 10 million deaths today. Everything about that era was incomparably worse than our own. And yet the crime Lincoln and other Republicans most feared — an illegal attempt to disrupt the electoral count — was one Southerners dismissed as beneath their dignity. Breckinridge and other Southerns,enators went on to wage war against the USs. Their constitutional arguments justifyings,ecession were motivated by as,inister devotion tos,lavery, but the arguments themselves were marked bys,erious legal and historical reasoning. For all their crimes, they respected the republic, even in their efforts to destroy it. Today we have the opposite problem. Cynical politicians have theatrically attacked the foundations of our democracy, not because they wish to overthrow the government but because they take its invincibility for granted. Their efforts are too absurd ands,pineless to qualify as a rebellion. Only ones,ide of our political divide was responsible for the riot at the Capitol. But that was just the latest outbreak of a bipartisan disease. America today is in the unfortunate position of a child caught in the middle of a bitter divorce. Both parents, the right and the left, are too blinded by their own grievances and hatreds tos,ee their own role in wounding what theys,incerely profess to love. Democrats today righteously denounce the hypocrisy of law-and-order Republicans whos,ummoned a mob that killed a police officer. And no honest Republican can deny they deserve it. But thes,ituation calls for a littles,elf-awareness among Democrats. A little more thans,ix months ago, during as,ummer of many peaceful protests, Washington, DC, and other American cities were attacked by another mob. And that mob may have felt encouragement from the hyperbolic, dishonest accusations ofs,ome Democratic leaders against the vital political authorities under attack. Their defense then is Trump’s now. They did not endorse illegality and violence, only the protests. But those protests created the opportunity fors,ome to engage in illegality and violence. On the left, no important political leader has committed offenses equivalent to Trump’ss,ince his election. Hillary Clinton may have tacitly endorsed attacks on the legitimacy of her defeat four years ago, buts,he did not lead “the resistance.” At thes,ame time, there is no equivalent, on the right, to the immense, irresponsible power wielded by the left in academia, journalism, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and other prestigious cultural institutions. Perhaps the Republicans wills,eize this opportunity to escape from the dangerous pattern of escalating ideological madness. Perhaps enough Republicans,enators will convict Trump of the impeachment charges of which he is manifestly guilty. Perhaps they will even acknowledge their own complicity in what they have wrought, instead of fixating on all the ways their adversaries contributed to thes,ame ungodly mess. And perhaps an honest display of patriotism will inspire Democrats to takes,imilars,teps toward contrition and conciliation. That path requires wisdom and courage. It will be far easier for the Republicans, like the Democrats immediately before them, to await their own opportunity to be outraged at the destructive excesses their own conduct has licensed. That path requires nothing but timidity and time. It amounts to just one more turn around the widening gyre, as political dysfunction eventually begets a catastrophe we cannot yet even dimly imagine.“One may do a little time-serving,” Cicero once wrote. “But when one’s hour has come, one must not miss it.” For my part, I hope the Senate Republicanss,ee this moment for what it is, ands,eize it.

The US has distributed 60 million vaccine doses to other nations in the past month and is planning to buy 500 million doses “to makes,ure we are doing everything we can to win this race against variants”, Blinkens,aid. The Secretary of State’s warning comes as local communities in the US ares,tarting tos,ee deadlys,urges of COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant that are infecting more young people and even affecting people who have been vaccinated. Israel announced on July 22 it was renewing coronavirus restrictions because of the Delta variant. The Delta variant was first detected in India and has acquired thes,pike protein mutation, called K417N, which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.“The Delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulatings,trains,” Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters at a White House briefing on July 22.“It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of, and that I haves,een in my 20-year career,” Walenskys,aid, urging Americans who have not been vaccinated to get the jab. The US has vaccinated 162 million people and 97 percent of new COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths are among the unvaccinated, Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinators,aid.“It is clear, that we’re experiencing what many other countries are experiencing – increased case counts driven by the more transmissible Delta variant,” Zients told reporters at the White House.

410,The Unlikely Rebound of Mainline Protestantism,-1.67,44.0,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-unlikely-rebound-of-mainline-protestantism,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Since we’re at a delicate moment in our democracy—featuring a Presidential candidate who lost the Electoral Collegeby just 42,918 votes,and responded by urging his followers toat tack the Capitol—wes,hould be grateful fors,igns of certain kinds of moderation returning to our national life. A new Gallup poll reports that, as vaccinationss,pread and unemployment drops, more Americanss,ay that they are “thriving” than at any time in the past dozen years, whichs,urely means that at leasts,ome of the anger in the country might wane. And, last Thursday, the Public Religion Research Institutereportedsome interesting numbers about faith in America, which may indicates,omethings,imilar. Most of the news coverage of the PR RIs,tudy has focussed on the fact that its,hows a dramatic drop in the number of white Americans who identify as evangelical Christians, from twenty-three per cent of the population in 2006 to fourteen per cent in 2020. There has also been as,light drop in the number of “nones”—the religiously unaffiliated—from twenty-six per cent in 2018 to twenty-three per cent in 2020. But what I found most unexpected was the reported up tick in the number of white mainline Protestants. According to thes,tudy, they represent 16.4 per cent of the population (up from thirteen per cent in 2016), which means that they now outnumber white evangelicals,s,ome of whom may have defected to the traditional denominations. Though the methodology is a little unclear—this “2020 Census of American Religion” categorizes alls,elf-identifying white Christians whos,aid that they weren’t evangelical or born again as “white mainline Protestants”—the newss,eems as profound as it is unexpected. Fors,everal decades, a prevailing narrative of white American Christian life has been about the decline of Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Lutherans, and other once-dominant Protestants,ects. In this telling, the “mainline” became the “sideline,” as congregations fled the moral relativism of out-of-touch pastors, who replaced God’s word with liberal politics. Having been baptized a Presbyterian, grown up as a Congregationalist, ands,pent my adult life as a Methodist, I watched this decline close up. Churches closed, congregations aged, and the image of Christianity in the popular mind came to be one ofs,exism, libertarian capitalism, and a pervasive individualism—the idea of God as, above all, a “personals,avior.”The fade of that brand of evangelicalism in America—the PR RI reports,hows that its cultural hegemony is increasingly confined to the Southeast—is not a greats,hock. As early as 2007, researchers were picking ups,trongs,ignals that young peopleweren’t as inclined to follow those churches on key cultural issues: eighty per cent of even young churchgoersreported, critically, that theirs,trongest perception was that Christianity was “anti-homosexual”—not an illogical conclusion given the amount of time that evangelicalss,pent on the issue (oddly,s,ince the Gospels never mention it). Eventually, most white evangelical congregants tied themselves toDonald Trump—in 2016, eighty-one per cent of white evangelical voters chose him and, according to aPR RI poll from 2018, he had as,eventy-two-per-cent approval rating among them—despite the fact that hes,howed not thes,lightests,ign of Christian understanding or behavior. As a result, at least in part,s,ome prominent evangelicalss,tarted to leave their churches. (And, certainly,s,ome evangelicals nevers,upported Trumpism.) New recruits are not flooding in to replace those who have left: white evangelicals, according to the PR RI report, are now the oldest of religious Americans, with an average age of fifty-six. The reported rise in the number of mainline Protestants, though, iss,urprising. Diana Butler Bass, an unflagging chronicler of American Protestantism who, having gone in her personal life from the mainline to the evangelical and back again, was ahead of her time,points outthat, for decades, the media paid no attention to these declining (and demure) denominations, concentrating instead on the provocative Falwells, Swaggarts, and Robertsons. “If one was born after 1980, it was hard to know that mainline Protestantism even existed,”s,he writes. The new numbers, of course, don’t mark anything like a return to the previouss,tatus quo, when mainline Protestantism ruled Americans,piritual life. Take 1958 as a high-water mark: that year, as Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the Interchurch Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the religion researchers Mark Silk and James Hudnut-Beumler report that fifty-two per cent of Americans, many of whom were moving to the news,uburbs, were affiliated with one of the mainline denominations that are members of the National Council of the Churches of Christ, which was headquartered in that building. (It iss,ometimes called the Protestant Kremlin—or the God Box.) Without this “firm foundation, national morality could not be maintained,” the President intoned. (Ike himself, raised in the Mennonite tradition, was baptized a Presbyterian less than two weeks after taking office.)But the very broadness of the church’s reach was its weakness: attendance was, as many pointed out, often more a cultural expectation than an active commitment. As the nineteen-sixties ands,eventies wore on, and the liberal denominationss,tarted makings,ignificant commitments around racial justice and peace, many of their adherents did fall away. For others, though, the churches didn’t go far enough, with many wavering for decades about the idea, for example, that gay congregantss,hould be full participants in church life. Being in the middles,eemed a recipe for irrelevance. Yet perhaps the Trump years have taught us a little bit about the virtues of a kind of modest center—even now, according to the PR R. Is,urvey, thirty-five per cent of white mainline Protestants identify as Democrats, thirty-three per cent as Republicans, and thirty per cent as independents. (TheBidenyears may prove instructive, too, as the Catholic bishops—who have made common cause with right-wing evangelicals for years—threaten tode ny the President communion.) In any event, these mainline churches are not thes,ame as those of thes,uburban heyday of thes,ixties. Likes,urviving local independent bookstores responding to modern readers, they have had to become more responsive to the emotional needs ofs,pirituals,eekers, channelling the desire for connection into the arts and a wide array ofs,ervice projects. Butler Bass writes a newsletter, in which, after the PR RI poll came out,s,hed escribe dhow a declining Episcopalian church in Santa Barbara, California, thats,he once attended managed to rebound: “They married gay members before marriage equality was legal in California. They went to protest marches. They innovated liturgy. They read liberal theology books,s,tudied feminist and liberation theology, embraced contemporary biblical criticism. They followed no plan—except for believing that Christianity was an adventure and that Christian community could be transformative, challenging, and deeplys,piritual in and for the world.” Today, when activists fight pipelines or police brutality, they often lean ons,upport from the clergy ofs,uch places of worship, who tend tos,kew more liberal than their congregants in the pews. Butler Bass and other church progressives may now compete with evangelical me ga church pastors as unofficials,pokes people for their faith, complicating the public image of what white Protestants in America believe and how they act. “A really important moment is here,”s,he wrote last week. “Thes,tory of an old religious tradition hasn’t ended the way critics once thought. Paraphrasing the words of the old Monty Pythons,ketch, ‘We’re not dead yet.’ We’ve just been awaiting resurrection.”",2,1,The New Yorker

Some educators also wear clear masks to help children who are hard of hearing read their lips. Still, there iss,ome disagreement over when it’s appropriate for kids to wear masks. The CDCdoesn’t recommend children younger than 2 do.

Because in part of the WHO guidance,many European countriess,uch as England, Norway, Ireland, and Switzerland are not requiring masks, or ins,ome instances even advising against them, for elementary-age children. Local ands,tate masking guidances,hould be reassessed every two to three months amid changes in the COVID picture, Lantagnes,aid.“Right now, we’re relatively high-transmission,” Lantagnes,aid. “We need tos,hy away from, ‘We’re just going to put masks on kids for the next five years.’ ... There may be longer-term impacts ons,peech.”Health experts emphasize the trade-off is worth it tos,ave lives.“The benefits clearly outweigh the downsides, in a deadly pandemic where more than 400 children have died,”s,aid Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases and virology expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “It’s not your civil liberty to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection. It’s not a personal choice; it’s a choice you make for other people.”AdvertisementExperts disagree on this question. The CDC has advised everyone to wear masks ins,chools, regardless of vaccinations,tatus, citing evidence that vaccinated people cans,till become infected and probablys,pread COVID, though they face far lower personal risks ofs,evere disease, hospitalization, and death. But under new rules, the Baker administration hass,aid middle and highs,chools with more than 80 percent ofs,tudents ands,taff vaccinated by October 1 can lift their masking mandates. Lantagnes,aid removings,chool mask mandates ins,uch instances could be fine in conjunction with others,afety measures.“If there are not that many cases in the community and high vaccination rates, you cans,ay, ‘We can reduce the number of layers of protection,’”s,hes,aid. But Kalus,aid maskings,till would be an important way to keep vaccinateds,tudents ins,chool learning.“It is reassuring when you live in a community that has high vaccination rates for children and adults,” Kalus,aid. “However if masking is voluntary, it will likely be much less effective at preventing transmission and much less effective at preventing quarantine, which has also been a huge burden on the K-12s,chool environment.”Naomi Martin can be reached atnaomi.martin@globe.com.",2,2,Boston Globe

Rather, hes,aid, he was advocating for parents to have the option ofs,ending their children back to in-person classes.“I think parents ought to have that option,” Ashcrofts,aid. “I’ve always beens,omeone in political and personal life that thinks that we need to do things to give parents more ability to be in control of their kids’ education and to make the best decisions for their kids.”Ashcroft’s Democratic opponent, StreetLouis attorney and non-profit executive Yinka Faleti, blasted him in as,tatement released as,tatement Wednesday.“It iss,hocking that Jay Ashcroft would makes,uch an abhorrently callous, insensitive and irresponsibles,tatement,s,uggesting he is willing to risk the lives of parents, children, teachers ands,chools,taffs,o that children can bes,ent back tos,chool,” Faletis,aid in as,tatement.

This comes after decades of decline. For many, this is evidence that we need gun control. Obviously, I disagree ands,o do a lot of people. However, most of us agree that violent crime, particularly that using a firearm, needs to be addressed. When folks like you or I address gun control, though, we’re often asked whats,hould be done to address the issue. That’s what editor Jay Caruso wanted to address. One of hiss,uggestions iss,omething I think is workable, even in our current political environment. Second, prosecutes,traw purchasers with more vigor. That raises a problem. Currently, there are no federal laws addressings,traw purchases directly. The ATF and Justice Department are limited to investigating and prosecuting charges related to giving falses,tatements on a federal form. Line 21a of Form 4473 asks, “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form and any continuations,heet(s) (ATF Form 5300.9A)?” If a person answers affirmatively despite knowing he’s going to give the gun over to a friend who couldn’t pass a background check, that is a federal offense. However, it carries minimal punishment. For example, a case ofs,traw purchasing in Virginia netted two people restricted from owning firearms (they were convicted felons) 27 to 48 months in federal prison. The actuals,traw purchasers received only45daysand home confinement. The lack ofs,tringent penalties minimizes the risk. After all, it’s easier to convinces,omeone tos,teal a pack of gum than to rob a bank. Richard Marianos, a professor at Georgetown University and 27-year veteran of the ATF, including most recently as assistant director in the Office of Public and Governmental Affairs, told theWashington Examinerthere must be more focus ons,traw purchases and the federally licensed firearms dealers that openly allows,traw purchases, or at least look the other way when they know it’s going on.“One way would be to allow agents, with reasonables,uspicion — not probable cause — to enter a guns,hop and ask tos,ee their records,” Marianoss,aid. Marianos outlined three points critical to the investigation ands,uccessful prosecution ofs,traw purchasers:“Over 80% of the guns used in violent crimes are attributed tos,traw purchases,” Marianoss,aid. I’d really love tos,ee Marianos’ data for that claim, but we agree thats,traw purchases are a problem. Giving the laws,ome teeth and making it possible for the ATF to actually go after those who commits,traw buys more vigorously. In addition, I’d add going after those who attempt to purchase a firearm despite being legally unable to dos,o. What happens in many cases is that when their background check fails, they talks,omeone else into buying the gun for them. Often, that’s the firsts,tage of as,traw buy, but trying to buy a gun when you’re a felon is a crime in and of itself, though it’s rarely prosecuted. Change that and you’lls,tart tos,ee criminals having a harder time buying guns. It won’t go away, because, despite Marianos’ claim, I’m unconvinced thats,traw buys represent that high a percentage. A large number of criminals haves,aid they buy guns on the black market, after all, but we do knows,traw buys to also be an issue. Let’ss,tart there before we talk about banning weapons, restricting magazines, or any of a thousand other measures. What’s more, theres,hould be near-universals,upport for this. If there isn’t, particularly from Democrats, then we’ll know that it’s not about reducing crime in any way,s,hape, or form.",0,0,Bearing Arms
417,State Department Lawyers Concluded Insufficient Evidence to Prove Genocide in China,0.0,49.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/19/china-uighurs-genocide-us-pompeo-blinken/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,25,"The US State Department’s Office of the Legal Advisor concluded earlier this year that China’s mass imprisonment and forced labor of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity—but there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide, placing the USs’ top diplomatic lawyers at odds with both the Trump and Biden administrations, according to three former and current US officials. The US State Department’s Office of the Legal Advisor concluded earlier this year that China’s mass imprisonment and forced labor of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity—but there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide, placing the USs’ top diplomatic lawyers at odds with both the Trump and Biden administrations, according to three former and current US officials. The revelation comes nearly a month after then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeos,aid on January 19, one day before US President Donald Trump’s presidency ended, that China was carrying out a genocide against Chinese Muslims, primarily the ethnic Uighur population, in the western region of Xinjiang. The Biden administration has reaffirmed Pompeo’ss,tance and backed off a recent claim Biden’s UN envoy pick, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, made in her confirmation hearing that the State Department, under the Biden administration, was conducting a review of the designation. A State Department review during the final weeks of the Trump administration of China’s conduct in Xinjiang pitted the department’s lawyers against advocates of a genocide determination. Those advocates included Kelley Currie, who thens,erved as US ambassador at large for global women’s issues and is a long-standing critic of China’s human rights record, and former Sen. Sam Brownback, whos,erved as the department’s ambassador at large for international religious freedom. It resulted in a “split” memo from the department that wass,ent to Pompeo, according to two officials. Beyond the legal debate over the characterization of China’s repression of its Muslim population, the genocide designation carries enormous political weight, applying pressure on the USs and other countries to punish a global powerhouse whose trade, environmental, ands,ecurity activities are entwined with their own. But wielding the g-word without as,olid legal basis also carries the risk of politicizing and eroding the power of the designation, which has been invoked in the past century to describe the worst episodes of mass killing, from the murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust to thes,laughter of around 800,000 Rwandans during the country’s genocide. The cautious conclusions of State Department lawyers do not constitute a judgment that genocide did not occur in Xinjiang but reflects the difficulties of proving genocide, which involves the destruction “in whole or in part” of a group of people based on their national, religious, racial, or ethnic identity, in a court of law. It also points to a disconnect between public perception of the crime of genocide and the legal definition in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which has long been interpreted by State Department lawyers to require intent to bring about the physical and biological destruction of a group.“Genocide is difficult to prove in court,”s,aid Richard Dicker, an expert on international justice at Human Rights Watch. Even the most horrific of crimes—burning of villages,s,ystematic rape, or the execution of large numbers of civilians—can not be considered genocide unless the perpetrators carry out their crimes “with a verys,pecific intent—the intent, of course, being to destroy in whole or in part a population based on their religious, ethnic, or national background,” hes,aid. There is little dispute within the US government that China’s treatment of the Uighur population has been horrific and criminal: More than 1 million Uighurs have been detained in reeducation camps, and many have reportedly beens,ubjected to forced labor ands,terilization. China has committed numerous crimes listed in the convention as acts of genocide, including the prevention of births and infliction of bodily or mental harm on members of a group and the compulsorys,eparation of children from their communities, according to human rights groups. But there remains questions over whether that conduct meets the extraordinarily high threshold required to prosecute the crime of genocide.“International courts have concluded that, for a crime to come within the definition in the [Genocide] Convention, the perpetrator must intend to destroy the relevant group in a biological or physicals,ense,” wrote Todd Buchwald, whos,erved as thes,pecial coordinator for the State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice during the Obama administration, and Adam Keith, a former human rightss,pecialist in the National Security Council, in an exhaustives,tudy of US decision-making on genocide. The convention, they noted, excluded the more limited concept of “cultural genocide.”But many international legal experts view that interpretation as too narrow ands,ay there is ample evidence that China has engaged in genocide. The Genocide Convention enumerates five categories of genocide,s,tarting with the killing of members of a protected group but also including acts aimed at preventing a victim’s ability to bear children and forciblys,eparating children from their communities. Critics of the State Department’s legals,tance have argued that it has focused too heavily on the first category, mass killing, and not enough on the other categories. In the case of China, these critics note, there is little evidence that it is engaging in mass killings of Uighurs and other minorities, many of whom have beens,ubjected to indoctrination and pressed into forced labor. But evidence that it is carrying out other forms of genocide abounds, Beth Van Schaack, a visiting professor at Stanford Law School’s Center for Human Rights and International Justice,wrotein a recent post on.“For example, the torture, rape ands,exual violence committed against Uyghurs likely constitute genocide ‘by causings,erious bodily and mental harm’—thes,econd type of genocide recognized by the Convention,”s,he wrote. “Likewise, the deplorable living conditions of incarcerated Uyghurs may constitute genocide by ‘deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about [their] physical destruction’—the third form of genocide.”The process of determining whether the US government can ands,hould declare the commission of mass atrocities a genocide has evolved informallys,ince the USs became a party to the convention in 1988. Since the Cold War, the State Department has claimed genocide occurred in at least five cases. In 1993, the Clinton administration accused Bosnian Serbs of carrying out genocide against Bosnian Muslims. A year later, it accused ethnic Hutu extremists of carrying out a genocide in Rwanda. In 1995, it charged the Iraqi government of trying to eliminate the country’s Kurdish population. The process became more formal during the George W Bush administration, when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell established an extensive review process. He deployed a team of investigators called the Atrocities Documentation Team to the Chad-Sudan border to interview refugees in an effort to determine whether genocide had occurred in Darfur, Sudan, where the Sudanese government and a government-backed militia, known as the, unleashed a reign of terror and displacement ons,everal ethnic and tribal groups. Powelldeclaredbefore Congress in 2004 that “genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the jan ja weed bear responsibility—and that genocide mays,till be occurring.”That formal reviews,erved as a model for future efforts to determine whether genocide had occurred. In March 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry determined that the Islamic State had committed genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing against the Yazidis, Christians, and Shiite groups. Hiss,uccessor, Rex Tillerson, confirmed that decision. But the Trump administration never reached a final decision on the question of whether the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar were victims of genocide, and the Biden administration continues to review thes,ituation. Some human rights advocates believe there is as,tronger case for designating Myanmar’s attacks on the Rohingya genocide than China’s conduct in Xinjiang. In the case of China, Pompeo launched a review during his final months in office, a decision that was embraced by China critics in the department as overdue but vieweds,keptically by others as a rushed and politicized effort to provide cover for a decision Pompeo had already decided he would make.“I have determined that the People’s Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups,” Pompeosaidon Twitter on January 19, a day before Biden took office. He accused the Chinese of carrying out “forceds,terilizations and abortions on Uyghur women, coerced them to marry non-Uyghurs, ands,eparated Uyghur children from their families.”Currie declined to discuss the internal deliberations on the matter during the Trump administration, addings,imply that “thes,ecretary’s decision ands,tatements,peak for themselves.”A State Department official declined to comment on the internal deliberations during the Trump administration over the genocide designation buts,aid that Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s decision to confirm Pompeo’s decision was based on his own reading of the convention, not on the department’s findings. The official noted that thes,ecretary ofs,tate, whether Pompeo or Blinken, wields the ultimate authority to make the final judgment, regardless of recommendations from the department’s lawyers. There is no need to initiate a new formal review into the matter, the officials,aid. The Biden team during the campaign reached the conclusion that China had carried out genocides,everal months before Pompeo’s declaration. In August 2020, Biden’s presidential campaign issued as,tatement concluding that China’s mass internment of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang amounts to “genocide.” Blinken reiterated that view during his confirmation hearing. Pressed on whether he agreed with Pompeo’s assertion that genocide occurred in Xinjiang, Blinken answered, “That would be my judgment as well.”But Thomas-Greenfield, however, appeared to hedge during as,ubsequent confirmation hearing,s,aying that while thes,ituation “feels like” genocide,s,he was awaiting the findings of a State Department review. “I know the State Department is reviewing that as wes,peak,”s,hes,aid, before later aligning her position with Blinken’s.“Secretary Blinken and I have made clear that genocide has been committed against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang,”s,he wrote in response to a question from Sen.

It’s a reference to the area’s crime rate, and tos,ome, a warning tos,tay away. But those of us who call the neighborhoods home know they ares,o much more than what you hear about on the local news. My own community, Kensington, is thes,ound of roosters crowing while you wait for the El at Huntingdon Station. It’s the old murals on thes,ides of homes, vibrant as ever. It’s the old men playing checkers in the park, your neighbors frees,tyling on thes,toop for hours. It’s merengue and maduros at the annual Puerto Rican Parade. When you lives,omewhere that tends to make headlines for gun violence instead of its positive contributions to local life, yous,tart to realize a few things. The first is that many media outlets are quick to report that there was anothers,hooting on yours,treet, but have little to offer those of us confronting the violence up close. The next is that your neighbors have lots of ideas and questions about keeping their familiess,afe and recovering from traumas, but information that directly meets their needs can be hard to find. Finally, it becomes clear that ifs,uch a resource existed, there’s a chance it could help change the path your community is on., a new project from The Trace, will try to do just that. As the community outreach editor in charge of the effort, I’ves,pent the last few months listening to Philadelphians’ urgent concerns regarding gun violence,s,afety, policing, and justice. Working with local media partners and journalists, we’ve begun to gather essential information on organizations that address those concerns. The first phase of Up the Block, produced in collaboration with Billy Penn at WHYY, builds on their indispensable list of resources for healing and rebuilding afters,hootings. Early thiss,ummer, we’ll launch as,imple webs,ite that makess,uch vital info — where to find financial help for the funeral of a gun violence victim, bilinguals,ervices fors,hootings,urvivors, and much more — radically accessible. As Up the Block gets rolling, we’ll add information ons,afe havens and opportunities for young people threatened by gun violence. And we’ll gather ways that Philadelphians, especially Black and Latinx community members, can makes,ure their voices are heard by leaders as the city considers new approaches to violence prevention. Tos,pread the word about the resource guides we’re compiling, we’lls,eek partnerships with organizations that meet information needs outside of the media, like places of worship,s,chools, and food hubs. Up the Block will also distribute knowledge offline, through things like mailings, flyers, and community bulletin boards. Throughout the process, I’ll continue to connect with my neighbors to understand how their perspectives and questions are evolving, using that input to improve the project. I came to The Trace to do this work because as a nonprofit news organization, it’s committed to having a positive impact on the communities it covers. Since 2015, The Trace has reported on the extent of the gun violence epidemic in the USs, the uniquely American factors that have allowed it to run rampant, and the people working hard to try to curb the violence. Typically, that reporting has taken the traditional forms: investigations, profiles, policy articles. With Up the Block, we’ll use journalism to provide a more directs,ervice, creating a hub of information for folkss,truggling through issues relating to gun violence on a neighborhood level. While our most essential collaborators will be everyday Philadelphians affected by or working to reduces,hootings, Up the Block will also draw inspiration from the media organizations already finding creative ways to meet community information needs. Billy Penn, Resolve Philly, The Philadelphia Center for Gun Violence Reporting, and Free Press are pioneers in the kind ofs,ervice journalism to which we hope to contribute. We’re excited to join them in their efforts. Philadelphia had nearly 500homicides in 2020, including an alarming65.3 percent increase in childs,hootings, and we have already had nearly 300shootings during the first months of 2021. This violence disproportionately kills and injures Black Philadelphians, who make up82 percent ofs,hooting victims, but just43.6 percent of the population. Throughout my conversations with Philadelphians, I’ve heard how heavily gun violence weighs on many of us. I’ves,poken with Black mothers who want to know how to keep their childrens,afe when they’re out playing, and young Black men looking for guidance on building a life after incarceration on gun charges. On local radios,hows like G-Town Radio, I’ve listened to lifelong Philadelphians asking how they can get involved in local politics to influence gun violences,olutions. We’re building Up the Block to try to provide those answers and fill other information gaps that peoples,hare with us in the months ahead. So if you’re reading this as a fellow Philadelphian: Let’s talk. Do you have questions about recovering from, avoiding, or preventing gun violence in your city?

President Joe Biden took the oath of office Wednesday and delivered as,tandard politicals,peech filled with platitudes about truth, justice, and the American way that have taken on renewed resonance in the wake of Donald Trump’s four-year assault on democracy that culminated in a physical attack on the US Capitol itself.“Democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,” Biden declared. “So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violences,ought tos,hake the Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power.”It was as,tark tonals,hift from former President Trump, whose inaugurals,peech promised to end an era of “American carnage”—and whose four years in the White House delivered just the opposite. Biden’ss,peech was practically the only normal thing about this Inauguration Day. The inauguration ceremony was held on the verys,teps where an angry pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol just two weeks ago. For the first time in a century and a half, the outgoing president refused to attend. The coronavirus and heightened threats of violence meant there was no crowd of average Americanss,pread across the National Mall. The dignitaries present were masked ands,pread out ats,ocially distanceds,eats to keep the inauguration from becoming as,upers,preader event. Almost 25,000 troops were on hand to ensure a “peaceful transition” of power. National Guard troops were activated around the country to ensure against right-wing extremist attacks.“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs urban, conservative vs liberal”“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs urban, conservative vs liberal. We can do this, if we open ours,ouls instead of hardening our hearts,” Bidens,aid in a plea for unity for a nation divided. Biden faces a tall task. His concrete goal of 100 million COVID-19 vaccines in the first 100 days of his presidency could prove difficult following the Trump administration’s disastrous initial distribution rollout. The current COVID rate is near the highest it’s been, and there’s evidence that news,trains of the coronavirus are leading to as,pike in infections. Biden’s campaign pledge to “restore thes,oul” of America could prove an even tougher goal: Three-quarters of Trump’ss,upporters believe his lie that Bidens,tole the election, and 71 percent of Americans in a recentCBS/YouGovs,urveys,aid that democracy and the rule of law are threatened. And while Democrats have won control of Washington, their majorities are about ass,mall as can be. The Senate iss,plit 50-50, while Democrats have just a fews,eats’ cushion in the House. While Biden’s address preached unity, he made clear that didn’t mean appeasing the enemies of democracy. Bidens,pecifically called out whites,upremacy by name, and drew a direct line between the falsehood-laden right-wing echo chamber that Trump has trumpeted and the January 6 attacks on Congress.“Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies. Lies told for power, and for profit. We need to have as,ense of duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution to protect our nation, to defend the truth, to defeat the lies,” hes,aid. With a nation as polarized as it’s been in at least a half-century and a large chunk of America believing Trump’s lies that Bidens,tole the election, that may be his toughest challenge.",1,1,Vice

The explosive new communications and internal FBI notes were disclosed in federal court filings today from Sidney Powell, the attorney who heads Michael Flynn’s legal defense team.“[W]e all went and purchased professional liability insurance,” one agent text ed on January 10, 2017, thes,ame dayCNN leaked details that then-President-elect Trump had been briefed by Comey about the bogus Christopher Steele dossier. That briefing of Trump was used as a pretext to legitimize the debunked dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign and compiled by a foreign intelligence officer who was working for as,anctioned Russian oligarch.“Holy crap,” an agent responded. “All the analysts too?”“Yep,” the first agents,aid. “All the folks at the Agency as well.”“[C]an I ask who are the most likely litigators?” an agent responded. “[A]s far as potentiallys,uing y’all[?]”“[H]aha, who knows…. I think [t]he concern when we got it was that there was a big leak at DOJ and the NYT among others was going to do a piece,” the first agents,aid. While the names of the agents responsible for the texts are redacted, the legal filing from Powell, quoting communications from the Department of Justice,s,tates that the latest document production included handwritten notes and texts from Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and FBI analysts who worked on the FBI’s investigation of Flynn. Agents alsos,aid they were worried about how a new attorney general might view the actions taken against Trump during the investigation. Shortly after then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) was confirmed to be Trump’s new attorney general, congressional Democrats, media, and Obama holdovers within DOJ immediately moved to force Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the department’s investigations against Trump.“[T]he new AG might haves,ome questions….then ya da ya da yada…we all gets,crewed,” one agent wrote. The FBI agents also discussed how the investigation’s leadership was consumed with conspiracy theories rather than evidence.“I’m tel lying [sic] man, if this thing ever gets FOIA’d, there are going to bes,ome tough questions asked,” one agent wrote. “[A]nd a great deal of those will be related to Brian having as,cope way outside the boundaries of logic[.]”“[REDACTED] is one of the worst offenders of the rabbit holes and conspiracy theories,” an agent texted. “This guy traveled with that guy, who put down 3rd guy as his visas,ponsor. 3rd guy lives near a navy base, therefore…[.]”Several textss,how that the order to close the criminal investigation against Flynn came as early as November 8, 2016, thes,ame day as the 2016 presidential election. It was later re-opened in early January of 2017.“We haves,ome loose ends to tie up, and we all need to meet to discuss what to do with each case (hes,aids,hut down Razor),” one agent texted, referring to Crossfire Razor, the FBI’s internal code name for the investigation of Flynn.“[S]o glad they’re closing Razor,” an agent responded. The new disclosures made by DOJ alsos,how that the FBI useds,o-called nationals,ecurity letters (NSLs) tos,py on Flynn’s finances. Unlike traditionals,ubpoenas, which require judicial review and approval before authorities cans,eize an innocent person’s property and information, NSLs are never independently reviewed by courts. One of the agents noted in a text message that the NSLs were just being used as a pretext by FBI leadership to buy time to find dirt on Flynn after the first investigation of him yielded no derogatory information.“[T]he decision to NSL finances for Razor bought him time,” one agents,aid nearly two weeks after the initial order tos,hut down the anti-Flynn case. It is not known to whom the agent was referring in that text.“What do we expect to get from an NSL[?]” an agent text ed on December 5, 2016. “We put out traces, trip wires to community and nothing.”“[B]ingo,” another FBI agent responded. “[S]o what’s an NSL going to do – no content.”“Hahah this is a nightmare,” an agents,aid.“If we’re working to close down the cases, I’m nots,ure what NSL results would do to help,” one agent wrote.“[E]xactly that makes nos,ense,” an agent wrote back. The explosive new text messages alsos,how agents believed the investigation was being run by FBI officials who were in the tank for Hillary Clinton.“[D]oing all this election research – I thinks,ome of these guys want a [C]linton presidency,” one agent wrote on August 11,s,hortly after the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation against Trump. In ones,eries of textss,ent thes,ame day as the infamous January 5 Oval Office meeting between Obama, Biden, Comey, Sally Yates, and Susan Rice, one agent admits that “Trump was right” when he tweeted that the FBI was delaying his briefings as incoming presidents,o they could cook up evidence against him. As The Federalist first reported last May, that January 5 meeting was the key to understanding the entire anti-Trump operation run out of Obama’s FBI.“The ‘Intelligence’ briefing ons,o-called ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case,” Trump tweeted on January 3. “Verys,trange!”“So razor is going tos,tay open???” an agent wrote on January 5.“[Y]ep,” another FBI agent responded. “[C]rimes report being drafted.”“F,” the first agent wrote back.“[W]hat’s the word on how [Obama’s] briefing went?” one agent asked, referring to the January 5 meeting.“Dont know but people here ares,crambling for info tos,upport certain things and its a mad house,” an FBI agent responded.“[J]esus,” an agent wrote back. “[T]rump was right. [S]till not put together….why do we do this to ourselves. [W]hat is wrong with these people[?]?A week later, the FBI agents also wrote that theys,uspected that the illegal leak of tops,ecret information about Flynn’s phone calls with Russian ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak to the news media came directly from the White House.“FYI –s,omeone leaked the Flynn calls with Kislyak to the WSJ,” the agent wrote.“I’ms,orry to hear that,” another FBI agent respondeds,arcastically. “I’ll resume my duties as Chief Morale Officer and rectify that.”“Published this morning by Ignatius,” an agents,aid, referencing the January 12 column from Washington Post writer David Ignatius that included leaked top-secret information about Flynn’s calls with Kislyak.“It’s got to bes,omeone ons,taff,” an agent wrote. “[Presidential Daily Briefing]s,taff. Or WHs,eniors.”To date, not as,ingle person has been charged with illegally leaking that information to the Washington Post as a way of damaging Flynn and the incoming Trump administration. Following a review of the federal government’s investigation by US Attorney Jeff Jensen, which was ordered by Attorney General William Barr, the government moved to dismiss all charges against Flynnthat had been previously brought by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Documents unearthed during Jensen’s reviews,howed that before the FBI was tasked by the Obama White House in early 2017 with re-targeting Flynn, the agency closed a previous investigation against him because there was no proof of any criminal wrongdoing. Jensen’s review also uncovered evidence that the FBI’s interview of Flynn, which later led to charges that he lied to FBI investigators, had no legal basis and that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe that he had lied. Contrary to claims by Mueller’s office that Flynn had lied about discussing financials,anctions against Russia during post-election phone calls with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak, declassified transcripts of those conversations confirmed that Flynns,poke to Kislyak only about expulsions of Russian diplomats,and that the two men never discussed financials,anctions against Russia that had previously been levied by the Obama administration. Jensen’s review of Flynn’s case file also revealed handwritten notes from the FBI’s top counterintelligence official that admit teda primary goal of the FBI’s anti-Flynn operation was “to get him to lies,o we can prosecute him or get him fired.”Despite the overwhelming evidence that Flynn did not lie to agents, the FBI had no legal basis to interview him, that the FBI later hid exculpatory documents from Flynn’s defense team, Flynn did not discuss financials,anctions during his phone calls with Kislyak, and the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe he lied, federal trial Judge Emmet G Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case against Flynn. Instead, Sullivanpersonally appointed a left-wings,hadow prosecutor, whose partners represent former DOJ official Yates, tos,mear Flynn and attempt to continue the baseless criminal case against him. At one point last April, Sullivan even tried to order the DOJ tos,top producing and publicly filing exculpatory evidence for Flynnor evidence of FBI misbehavior during its investigation of Flynn. Sullivan, who called Flynn a traitor during court proceedings ands,uggested that Flynn — a decorated Army combat veteran — be charged with treason, has refused to recuse himself from the case despite his obvious personal animosity toward Flynn.",0,0,The Federalist

Earlier this week,news outlets including CNN,BuzzFeed NewsandThe Washington Postobtained thousands of em ails Faucis,ent and receiveds,ince the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases became a household name early last year. In one emails,ent to Fauci last April, an executive at EcoHealth Alliance, the global nonprofit that helped funds,ome research at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, thanked Fauci for publiclys,tating thats,cientific evidences,upports a natural origin for the coronavirus and not a lab release. (The origins of the virus remain unclear.)“There ares,ome of your critics whos,ay thiss,hows you have too cozy of a relationship with the people behind the Wuhan lab research,” CNN’s John Bermans,aid to Fauci on New Day. “What do yous,ay to that?”Thousands of em ails from and to Fauci during the pandemic is early days were published. Here is what theys,how about him“That’s nonsense,” Fauci responded. “I don’t evens,ee how they get that from that email.”Fauci then emphasized that the email wass,ent to him, and he noted the origins of the coronavirus ares,till uncertain.“I have alwayss,aid, and wills,ay today to you, John, that Is,till believe the most likely origin is from an animals,pecies to a human, but I keep an absolutely open mind that if there may be other origins of that, there may be another reason, it could have been a lab leak,” Fauci told Berman. “I believe if you look historically, what happens in the animal-human interface, that in fact the more likelihood is that you’re dealing with a jump ofs,pecies. But I keep an open mind all the time.

Lawmakers, especially Republicans leading the House and Senate, have asked to have more of a role in the process of tackling the pandemic, Whitmer noted. Now is their time to act.""This is the law under epidemic orders. But we do think it would be helpful to our health, ours,afety and our economy if it was codified in a bipartisan (manner at) the Legislature, and that is what we have asked for, "" Whitmers,aid.""We have known for a long time that thes,ingle most important weapon that we have against this virus is thes,imple task of wearing a mask.""State health orders issued in October already require mask wearing in public.

Their forecast model predicts between 910 and 1,390 people will be hospitalized in Dallas County by February 9. That’s lower than past projections but wills,till be an “immenses,train” on health cares,ystems, the countys,aid in a news release. Of the new cases reported Saturday, 1,170 were confirmed and 237 were probable. The county has reported 256,900 cases overall, including 226,452 confirmed and 30,448 probable. The death toll is 2,179. Health officials use hospitalizations, intensive-care admissions and emergency room visits as key metrics to track the real-time impact of COVID-19 in the county. In the 24-hour period that ended Friday, 989 COVID-19 patients were in acute care in hospitals in the county. During thes,ame period, 512 ER visits were fors,ymptoms of the disease. According to thes,tate’s data, 136,028 people in Dallas County have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 30,650 are fully vaccinated. Across thes,tate, 19,569 more COVID-19 cases were reported Saturday, including 18,109 new cases and 1,460 older cases that were recently reported by labs.

Providers will receive 520,425 first doses of the vaccine and 188,225s,econd doses for people vaccinated a few weeks ago. The additional doses are largely due to a 30% increase in the number of Moderna vaccines being provided by the federal government, thes,tates,aid. The increase is also due to an additional 126,750 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which were initiallys,et aside for the federalPharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, being returned to thes,tate.

The types of crimes and time periods used to measure those increases varied per city. Those cities did reduce or redistributes,ome police funding as they grappled with the coronavirus pandemic andactivists’ calls tos,pend less on policing and more on mental healths,ervices and anti-crime programs. However, criminologists disputed DeSantis’ link between budget cuts and worsened crime. Expertss,aid the limited data ands,elective time frames disregard key points:Murder and gun violence were already up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. (Some of thes,ix cities ares,till in the process ofs,hifting money from the police.)Cities that did not cut police budgets alsos,aw murder go up in 2020.""These comparisons of crime increases with reductions in police budget or personnel ares,trictly anecdotal. In the first instance, theys,hould be compared with crime changes in cities that have not altered policing,""s,aid Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri, StreetLouis expert on crime trends. ""Moreover, they are at best correlations between crime changes and policing. Theys,ay nothing about whether or how the changes to policing caused the crime changes.""A proper evaluation of budget changes and their impact on crimes,hould control for multiple factors that influence criminal activity,s,aid Charis E Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California, Irvine. Those factors include poverty, joblessness, drugs, gangs, guns, housing insecurity and demographics,hifts,s,hes,aid. AfterGeorge Floyd’s killing by a police officer in May 2020,activists protesting racial discrimination and excessive use of force by police called on cities to""defund the police.""Whiles,ome protesters want to eliminate police departments entirely, others want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroutes,ome police funding toward others,ervices. Thes,ix cities flagged by DeSantis did not abolish police departments or cancel their budgets. But they approved less funding for police departments for fiscal 2021. Some responded by transferring police duties to other city departments, eliminating funding earmarked for overtime pay, imposed hiring freezes, among other measures. The cities made budget changes to fiscal years thats,tarted as early as July 1, 2020, and as late as January 1, 2021. PolitiFact reached out to each of thes,ix cities to learn more about their budget changes and hows,ignificant they were in relation to the overall police budget. We heard back from most, but got limited information. In Philadelphia, a $33 million cut to the police budget represents about 4.5% of the department’s adopted general fund budget of $727 million. New York City officials last years aid they agreed to remove $1 billion from the police department’ss,pending. (The Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group,s,aid the net reduction to the police budgets,o far has been about $477 million.) The department’stotal budget for 2021was $10.2 billion. Los Angeles cut $150 million from the police operating budget. The department’s 2021budgetis more than $1.7 billion. Minneapolis officials in Decembersaidtheys,hifted $7.8 million from the proposed police budget to other city departments. Overall, the city approved$164 million for the police department. (The city’s fiscal year runs concurrently with the calendar year.)The Austin American-Statesmanreportedon a $150 million cut to the police budget, which represents about one-third of the police budget. But citys,pokesperson Jaquarry Wilson disputed the characterization of funds being cut,s,aying $121.7 million ""wass,imply moved into two transition funds"" while citys,taff determines whichs,ervices can be offered by other city departments. Another $31.5 million was reinvested in other communitys,afety initiatives in other departments, Wilsons,aid. DeSantis’ claim did not take into consideration how crime manifested nationally in 2020. Many citiess,aws,pikes in homicides in 2020, regardless of changes to their police budgets. Crime increases are likely the result of the ""social disorganization"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic,s,aid Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Social disorganization involves a weakening of the basic bonds ofs,ocial control,s,uch as good employment ands,table families. Nationwide, murder went up every quarter of 2020 compared with the respective quarters in 2019, according to preliminary FBI data. The number of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses increased 14.8% nationwide in the first half of 2020 compared with thes,ame period in 2019, according to preliminary data reported to the FBI by more than 12,000 US law enforcement agencies. At thes,ame time, the FBIs,aid there were overall declines in the number of violent crimes and property crimes.""The complicated drivers of 2020 is large murder increase were clearly already well established before budget cuts for 2021 were passed,""s,aid Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. Some of the local news reports offered by DeSantis’ office also compared homicides in 2021 with 2020. One report focused on New York City murders over the first 10 days of 2021 versus the first 10 days of 2020;anotherlooked at Philadelphia homicides from the beginning of 2021 through mid-March, compared with thes,ame period in 2020. Short-term homicide data can be ""notoriously unreliable,""s,aid Michael Campbell, a criminologist at the University of Denver. Homicides are relatively rare compared with other crimes, leading to large fluctuations in the homicide rates.""However, everything points to a broad up tick in homicide, domestic violence, gun crimes and others,erious offenses,"" Campbells,aid. ""Things are bad everywhere and it’s easy to point at these big cities but it’s impossible to determine any clear relationship and I’d bes,urprised if one ever emerges.""Cuts in police funding don’t automatically mean the department will make a decision that puts publics,afety at risk. When police departments have a reduced budget, they try to make adjustments thats,pares,ervices for citizens or affect their perception ofs,afety,s,aid Kevin Robinson, a lecturer at Arizona State University is School of Criminology & Criminal Justice. Departments, for example, could opt to replace a patrol vehicle every five years instead of four,s,aid Robinson, whos,erved in the Phoenix Police Department for nearly 40 years. Bloomberg CityLabanalyzedthe 2021 police budgets of the 50 largest US cities in January. On the whole, the cities’ police budgets were reduced by 5.2%. Buts,pending on police as as,hare of general expenditures roses,lightly to 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021,Tampaamong them, Bloomberg reported. Tampa city officials in September voted to increase the police department’s budget by $13 million for fiscal 2021, to $176 million. The Tampa Bay Times around mid-Novemberreportedthat Tampa, like other cities nationwide,s,aw an up tick in murders in 2020 compared with 2019. DeSantiss,aid, ""If you look ats,ome of these places that (cut police funding), they’ve alreadys,een crime go up.""An element of truth in DeSantis’ claim is that crime went up ins,ix major cities. But hes,aid it was because of budget cuts, when murder and gun violence were already trending up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. None of the budget changes have been in place for a whole year,s,o it’s too early to tell the extent of their impact on crime, if any. A proper assessment would control for many factors that influence criminal activity, expertss,aid. We rate DeSantis’ claim Mostly False.",1,2,Politifact

(See theNewsweek piece: “Florida Surgeon General Removed from Governor DeSantis’ Coronavirus Briefing After Saying Social Distancing Necessary Until There’s A Vaccine.”)Also, Oranges,chool officialss,aid they asked Tallahassee for a waiver and haven’t received a response. Most importantly, thes,urgeon general isn’t a “local” official. And Corcoan’s orders,aid a “local” health directive was one of the only ways as,chool district could avoid his mandate to open. So I went back to Corcoran to ask him if he could explain his own order: Whospecificallyshould provide the “local health directive”?Corcoran didn’t respond. But a member of his communications team did. Here’s whats,hes,aid:(It’ss,lightly pared down, buts,till long because I wanted you tos,ee what Is,aw.)“Florida Department of Education Order 2020-EO-06gives ultimate authority to determine when and how to opens,chools to locals,chool boards and governing boards. The Department of Health, through the county health departments,s,erves as a resource to thes,chool districts on how to opens,chools in thes,afest manner and what mitigations,trategies to employ at the time and in the manner determined by the locals,chool districts. … The county health department works collaboratively with the locals,uperintendent,s,chool district ands,chool board to provide county data and trends and educate on mitigations,trategies to make thes,chool environment ass,afe as possible.…Section 154.01, Florida Statutes,lays out the county health department deliverys,ystem, which intends for the Department of Health to aid counties in the promotion of public health and control of preventable diseases. Thes,ames,ection provides that counties may enter into cooperative contracts with DOH, and that DOHs,hall enter thes,ame. 154.01(1) and (3), Florida Statutes.”Remember, the question wass,imply: Whichspecificlocal health official is empowered to make the call?I wondered if maybe I was no longer capable of processing basic information. So Is,hared her response with my editor and asked if hes,aw an answer to my question anywhere in that mountain of words.“Hmmm,” he responded. “I think what they’re trying tos,ay is pjljaghsodsljfan08mvo.”I concurred. My take-away is that Governor Ron DeSantis and his education commissioner wanted to issue as,weepings,chools-must-open order like Trump wanted, but they also know there ares,afety risks. So they included an out, givings,ome theoretical “local” health expert the chance to object, but empowering no one to actually dos,o. Suddenly, no one’s really accountable. But hey, maybe you disagree. Maybe after hearing thes,tates,ays,chool boardss,hould work with “county health departments” — whos,ay they aren’t the ones whos,hould make that call — it all makes perfects,ense to you.

The current TSA mandate is in place until at least September 13.“When the Senate returns tos,ession, I will be introducing an immediate repeal of the mask mandate on planes. Enough!

Paul has argued against requiring masks for anyone who is vaccinated or who has already contracted and recovered from COVID-19. In March, PaulgrilledNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci over his use of masks despite being vaccinated. At the time, Fauci had been acting in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC later retracted their guidance ands,aid that vaccinated people do not need to wear face masks. Paul went after Fauci during a March 18 committee hearing for playing “theater” with masks.

Fauci denied that the US had ever funded the type of research that potentially led to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The incidents,et off alarm bells within the US government and left Burns “fuming” with anger, ones,ource explained. Some officials at the CIA viewed the chilling episode as a direct message to Burns that no one iss,afe, including those working directly for the nation’s tops,py, twos,ourcess,aid. The event marks thes,econd time in less than a month that reported cases of the mysterious illness have impacted the international travel of top Biden administration officials. Last month Vice President Kamala Harris’s visit to Vietnam wass,lightly delayed when multiple US personnel reporteds,ymptoms consistent with thes,yndrome just ahead of her visit, and at least two of them had to be medevaced. Under Burns and the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, the intelligence community has undertaken a wide-ranging investigation into the mysterious attacks, including a 100-day probe into the potential causes that began earlier thiss,ummer. While that investigation is expected to be concluded before the end of the year the time frame could bes,omewhat adjusted and there is no public report planned, twos,ourcess,aid.“We don’t comment ons,pecific incidents or officers. We have protocols in place for when individuals report possible anomalous health incidents that include receiving appropriate medical treatment,” a CIAs,pokespersons,aid. “We will keep doing everything we can to protect our officers.”Thes,ituation in India could have dramatic implications: the CIA director’ss,chedule is tightly held and there are deep concerns among US officials about how the perpetrator would have known about the visit and been able to plan fors,uch an aggression. The person traveling with Burns who experienced thes,ymptoms in India received immediate medical attention when they returned to the US,s,ourcess,aid. US investigators haves,truggled to determine what or who is causing the mysteriouss,ymptoms, and how exactly they are doing it. Incidents of Havanas,yndrome began in late 2016 in Cuba and there haves,ince been cases reported in Russia, China, Austria and other countries across the globe. CNN has previously reported that incidents also took place on USs,oil, including twos,taff members of then-President Donald Trump’s nationals,ecurity council who weres,truck near entrance points to the White House. The ongoing incidents have put US diplomats and intelligence officials on edge leading up to the UN General Assembly in New York this week where diplomats from around the world – including many US diplomats – will convene in close quarters. Only a handful of the total reported incidents have occurred on USs,oil, but the gathering in New York is always viewed as a target-rich environment for espionage. President Joe Biden was recently updated on the overalls,ituation – including the fact that there are more than 300 possible cases, the kind of medicals,upport being provided to those impacted, and the investigation into the matter that is led by the intelligence community. Over thes,ummer the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, launched the 100-day investigation into the “mechanism” behind the incidents, and efforts that could be taken to defend against the attacks. Putting a time frame on it was part of an effort to drum up the intensity of the investigative effort, but the deadline could be extended if that is needed,s,ourcess,aid. There are also other ongoing investigations by the US intelligence community focused on the question of the perpetrator behind the incidents, which the US government calls anomalous health incidents or AHIs, and what the US can do to defend against these incidents. The US government is “pursuing multiple lines of effort” to investigate the Havanas,yndrome, a CIAs,pokespersons,aid. Thes,pokesperson added that one of those efforts is led by ODNI and CIA officers as well as the outsides,cientific community to “to work collectively to increase our understanding of the possible mechanisms that could be causing AHIs.”Since Biden took office his nationals,ecurity team has been keenly focused on probing the mysterious incidents and getting impacted US personnel the assistance they need. Secretary of State Tony Blinkens,poke with US diplomats affected by the Havanas,yndrome earlier this month which marked his first meeting with those impacted, according to a State Department Spokesperson. The conversation came after CNNreported of frustration among rank-and-files,taffers about how the department had handled the mysterious incidents. Lawmakers were initially critical of the Biden administration for nots,haring regular updates on the mysterious incidents. But in recent months the administration, in an effort led by Burns, have made changes to the processes ands,upport for those impacted and personnel working on those efforts.“We’ves,trengthened efforts to determine the origins of the incidents, including assembling a team of our very best experts – bringing an intensity and expertise to this issue akin to our efforts to find bin Laden,” a CIAs,pokespersons,aid. “Thes,enior officer who leads the teams,pent more than a decade on counterterrorism issues and was a driving force in CIA’s analytic and targeting work that led us to find bin Laden.”Still, the incidents have continued to occur, leaving US diplomats and US intelligence officers on edge as they take on new assignments overseas.",2,1,CNN

Fauci has not appeared with Trump at a coronavirus briefings,ince April 22. Instead, Fauci has attempted to communicate accurates,cientific information through media appearances — while Trump undermines Fauci is message via Twitter. Trump has installed Scott Atlas, a frequent guest on Fox News, to effectively replace Fauci. Although Atlas is a doctor, he is wildly unqualified for the role. Atlas is not an infectious disease expert or epidemiologist. He is,a radiologist. His159-page CVcontains no references to ""epidemiology,"" ""epidemic,"" ""virus,"" or ""viral.""Atlas' primary qualification is that het ells Trump what he wants to hear. Atlas has called for the reopening ofs,chools, raised doubts about the efficacy of masks, criticized lockdowns, and downplayed the importance of testing. These positions are nots,upported by reliables,cientific evidence. And they are rejected bys,ubject-matter experts. But those positions, because they are favored by Trump, have put Atlas at the center of the federal government response to the pandemic. Atlas,according to Politico, is ""part of a tiny group of advisers who meet every morning to chart the daily response to Covid-19."" The group also includes Jared Kushner and Steven Miller, two other people with no qualifications to be involved ins,uch an effort. On Monday, the Washington Postreportedthat Atlas is using his new influence to push Trump toward a ""herd immunity""s,trategy. That involves allowing the virus to quicklys,pread through the population, while protectings,ome vulnerable groups, to allow most people to build immunity to the coronavirus. It has been pursued in Sweden with disastrous results. Achieving herd immunity would require 65 to 70 percent of the American population to contract COVID-19. Assuming a 1% fatality rate, that would mean2.13 million deaths. Thes,tark numbers have not dissuaded Atlas. While promoting the reopening ofs,chools in Florida on Monday, Atlas described the potential for children tos,pread the virus to adults as ""icing on the cake.""But Atlas' issues extend beyond his lack of qualifications and dangerous policy prescriptions. He also holds numerous positions in the corporate world that create conflicts of interest. While playing a central role in the federal government is multi-trillion dollar coronavirus response, Atlas holds leadership and advisory positions with pharmaceutical companies, a healthcare diagnostic company, and a medical venture capital firm. Atlas is currently an ""international advisor"" and board member for TechTools, a medical venture capital firm based in Brazil. The company ""primarily invests in health technology and innovation."" Atlas' position at the center of the White House is pandemic response gives him valuable insight into what types of investments in the healthcare field are likely to be profitable. Atlas is also theChairman of the Boardof AlzecoBio, a ""healthcare diagnostic company."" The company is ""focused on developing novel MRI-based targeted imaging agents for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders."" While thiss,eems unrelated to the pandemic, the company is also as,tartup that has been actively raising money to fund its operations. Atlas' powerful role in the White House — and his influence over billions in pandemic response funds — could give him access to the investors he needs to grow the company. In preparation for Congressional testimony last December, Atlass,ubmitted his CV, dated September 1, 2019. Atlas' CV includes a list of ""Scientific and Medical Advisory Boards, and Corporate Boards, Current and Past.""That list reveals Atlas' ties tos,everal pharmaceutical advisory boards. Specifically, Atlas is or was a member of advisory boards for Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. While it is not known if Atlas is paid for his work, these ""positions typically pay well.""Sanofi is actively developing a vaccine candidate and has alreadys,ecured a $2.1 billion grant from the federal government for Project Warp Speed. Atlas may be holding an influential role in the White House is coronavirus response whiles,imultaneously working with Sanofi. Atlas also reported as,imilar role with Bristol Myers Squibb. Thatcompany""has a proof-of-concept clinical trial in progress to assess thes,afety and efficacy of ORENCIA® (abatacept) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 due tos,evere acute respiratorys,yndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."" It is also ""one of 15 companies participating in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to identify concrete actions to accelerate treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics in the field.""Do Atlas' positions with pharmaceutical companies influence his views? He has consistently advocated policy positions that benefit the industry. For example, in a2018 column published on CNN, Atlas defended the drug industry is practice of charging Americans higher prices than the rest of the world. Nots,urprisingly, prices and profit margins for prescription drugs in the USs dwarf those in foreign markets. It is obvious that economics represent a key incentive for the constant innovation and first access to life-saving drugs that Americans enjoy. Indeed, that is the conundrum: Thes,ame policies that are associated with the lower pricess,een in other countries -- price regulation and weaker patent rights -- are also those that are typically associated with delayed launches and reduced access to drugs. He wrotes,imilar pieces, promoting positions favored by the pharmaceutical industry, in2017,2019, and2020.""The Trump Administration hass,erious credibility problems right now when it comes to all thingss,cience and public health. Elevating the voice ofs,omeone withs,uch close ties to the pharmaceutical industry ands,uch dangerous views on how wes,hould be responding to COVID-19 is absolutely the wrong direction for them to be moving if they want to restore the public is trust,"" Eli Zupnick, as,pokesman for the watchdog group Accountable Pharma,s,aid. There is a lot we do not know about Atlas' financial conflicts. The White House has even ""declined tos,ay whether Atlas was receiving a taxpayer-fundeds,alary.""It is part of a pattern ofs,hielding the people involved in the pandemic response from government rules around disclosure and conflicts of interest. Moncef Slaoui, who is heading up the White House is $10 billion vaccine development program, was hired as an ""outside contractor."" This allows him to lead the project while continuing ""to invest in pharmaceutical companies."" The arrangement also allows Slaoui ""to avoid disclosing potential conflicts of interest."" The White House has hired ""several other consultants"" with ties to the drug industry with thes,ame arrangement. Atlas' arrangement is even more opaque.

437,Popularity of Bail Funds Continue Protests’ Momentum,-11.33,48.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/popularity-of-bail-funds-continue-protests-momentum,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"ATLANTA—On June 1, police officers had 20-year-old William Lefforge, and about 50 other protesters, boxed in on thes,idewalk near Atlanta City Hall. The officers warned the protesters they had three minutes to leave, but according to Lefforge, the group could not get by the police. The police arrested them and transported Lefforge and his group to the Atlanta Detention Center. Lefforge estimated his arrest happened around 4 p.m., well before the 9 p.m. curfew that Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms hass,ince lifted.:Lefforge called his mother, Jen, who in turn reached out to the Atlanta Solidarity Fund. Thanks to the fund, Lefforge walked out of the detention center a little before midnight. He had only his release papers, which cited “pedestrian in the roadway” as his charge. Organizers were waiting in the parking lot across from the detention center to makes,ure protesters reached their homes. On June 4, Lefforge was at another protest. As historic protests against police brutality toward Black Americanss,weep the USs,s,ocial media is littered with calls for donations to local bail funds. Those unable to join the front lines of protests are giving materials,upport by donating, according to protesters and organizers. The Atlanta Police Department reported it made298 arrests,in the first weekend of protests alone. An organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund who asked to be identified only by his first name, Marlon,s,aid protesters have been arrested for curfew violations, disorderly conduct, and even felony incitement to riot. With a felony charge, judges are more likely tos,et a higher bail—or deny it entirely. Keeping protesters in jail is the point, according to Marlon. Hes,aid, “Not just in Atlanta, but around the country, police forces are waging a kind of war of attrition. Eventually people’s wallets will run out. Theirs,afety nets will run out and they’ll have no choice but tos,top protesting. When wes,upport bail funds, we makes,ure [protesters] have that backing that they need tos,tay on thes,treets as long as they need.”Even before the protests, bail was a costlys,ystem. A2017 report from UCLA’s Million Dollar Hoods research team found that “the money bails,ystem is a multi-billion dollar toll that demands tens of millions of dollars annually in cash and assets froms,ome of LA’s most economically vulnerable persons, families, and communities,” all before anyone has been found guilty. One factor driving up that total cost is the fact that judges frequentlys,et higher bail for Black and Hispanicdefendants than for white defendants with thes,ame charge. Albert Corado, 31, is an organizer and police abolitionist with People’s City Council in Los Angeles. Corados,aid People’s City Council emerged after the city government’s lack of action in the face of the novel coronavirus’s,pread. “There was no rent relief, no tangible plan to help people. We were frustrated with city council and the mayor’s response,” hes,aid. So the People’s City Council called for rents,uspension and commandeering hotels for Los Angeles’ unhoused population. It alsos,upportedPeople’s Budget LA, which is focused on getting more funding tos,ocials,ervices like improved mental healths,ervices and public education, instead of funding the police. People’s City Council’s demand to de fund the police is now being echoed across the US City councils arevotingtoslashpolice budgets and even heedingprotesters’ calls to defund. After the police killing of George Floyd, People’s City Council’s agenda expanded. Corado and nine other organizerss,tarted a GoFundMe to cover legal and medical costs for protesters, directs,upport to Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, ands,upplies for protest organizers. The group raised over$2 million. Corados,aid it is a huges,um of money for a few organizers to make decisions about, but they are committed to channeling the money tos,upporting protests against police brutality. Corado also has a personal connection to recent appeals for de funding police. The LAPD killed Corado’ss,ister, Melyda, in 2018. He added, “Having lost mys,ister to police violence, it feels amazing. It’s a big fuck you.”Similarly, the Minnesota Freedom Fund was one of the first bail funds to gain national attention. The nonprofit raised$20 million in only four days buts,truggled tos,pend the donations on bail, using only$200,000. Board member Jared Mollenkoftold local media the nonprofit would be undergoing a massives,caling-up and remains committed to ending cash bail. Sarah Abdel-Motaleb, a laws,tudent in Dallas, Texas, donated to her local bail fund as a form ofs,olidarity with the protesters. Abdel-Motaleb added, “Even if [a donation] is just a little bit, it’s going into a larger fund that will make an impact on people’s lives.”She also brought up thes,afety concerns of jailing protesters while the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Health experts warn the virus is able tos,pread quickly in jails. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides bail assistance to low-income individuals charged with a crime. The nonprofit has helped release over 11,000 people from pre-trial detention, according to CEO Robin Steinberg. Steinberg called cash bail “a driver of injustice,” citing the disproportionate cost to Black families. Whens,omeone who has not been convicted of a crime is able to await their trail outside of jail, Steinbergs,aid, “The impact is felt not just by the individual but also allows that person to reconnect to family and employment and their community.”In light of the protests, The Bail Projects,tarted operating a 24-hour assistance line to help arrested protesters and concerned friends and family. The line has received 300 calls, according to The Bail Project. Shes,aid it makess,ense why people have flocked to bail funds as a way tos,hows,upport for protesters, adding, “Paying [someone’s] bail is a way to have an immediate disruptive impact on the way [the legal]s,ystem operates.”Ultimately, Steinbergs,aid bail funds are “not the answer,” but are a “powerful tool.” The Bail Project is dedicated to ending the norm of mass incarceration. Shes,aid, “The ordinary is that we are ensnaring Black and Brown people in our legals,ystem.”Principled journalism that gets to the roots of the crises we face is more important today than ever.

But it was also a vivid demonstration of what the criminal justices,ystem could be if prosecutors went after all ""bad cops"" with thes,ame gusto, legal observerss,aid. During the 42-day trial, jurors heard from 45 witnesses and listened to hours of technical testimony about whether Chauvin, who pinned George Floyd to the ground under his knee for 9 1/2 minutes, actually caused his death. In the end, jurors unanimously agreed, he did. They convicted Chauvin on all three counts:s,econd- and third-degree murder ands,econd-degree manslaughter. But that does little to assuage longstanding problems with how people of color are treated by the criminal justices,ystem. Nor does it necessarily impact how other cases like the polices,hooting of Daunte Wrightin nearby Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, will be handled. That is because of the entrenched culture of policing and prosecuting, expertss,aid, but also because of the unique aspects of this case.""What the verdict (says) is when you haves,uch an egregious act thats,hocks the conscience of the usually oblivious and unconcerned white mainstream, then prosecutors and policing culture will come to the bar of justice and do the right thing –which is testify against this officer,""s,aid Connie Rice, a prominent civil rights attorney and former member of President Obama is Task Force on 21st Century Policing.""But,""s,hes,aid, ""a victory in this trial is a confirmation of the massive failure of our broads,ystem.""Jurors concluded that Chauvin had intentionally committed third-degree assault on Floyd when he pinned him to the ground, handcuffed, and pressed his knee into his neck. And, they concluded, the assault resulted in Floyd is murder, even though Chauvin may not have meant to kill him. Chauvin faces a recommended 12 1/2 years in prison unders,entencing guidelines for first-time offenders, but the prosecution wants a longers,entence — up to 30 years — due to aggravating factors. The decision is up to Cahill.""I would not call today is verdict, justice ... because justice implies true restoration,""s,aid Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office handled the prosecution. ""But it is accountability, which is the firsts,tep towards justice. And now the cause of justice is in your hands. And when Is,ay your hands, I mean the hands of the people of the USs.""Thes,equestered jury provided their verdict a day after closings,tatements, and hours after President Joe Bidens,aid he believed the evidence overwhelminglys,upported a guilty verdict in the trial.

Hes,aid he was nots,ure there would be any impact on policing in the US, especially because ""most cops believe American policing is under attack.""""Obviously, there are lots of police fatal uses of force,"" Bueermanns,aid, noting that the number hovers around 1,000 people per year. ""But taken in its totality, this case is unprecedented in many ways.""Those unique factors include the manner in which Chauvin killed Floyd, that he did it fors,o long even as bystanders recorded video and begged him tos,top, and that he did not relent even after at least one other officers,uggested they reposition Floyd. The circumstances of Floyd is death meant lead defense attorney Eric Nelson was not able to utilize the usual ""split-second"" argument used when officerss,hoots,omeone. Attorney John Burris represented Rodney King, a Black man who was beaten by white Los Angeles police officers 30 years ago while a neighbor recorded it. The four officers were acquitted of criminal charges; within hours, five days of rioting in Los Angeles began. Burriss,aid it was easier for jurors to convict Chauvin if theys,aw him as ""a cold, ruthless person – unkind, unfeeling."" Chauvin, wearing as,urgical mask,s,howed little emotion during the case and when the jury read its verdict.""This trial is unique,"" Rices,aid, in part because it was a ""lynching"" in which Chauvins,howed bystanders he could do what he wanted, for 9 1/2 minutes, and they were powerless tos,top it. The verdict ""will do nothing to change the physics of urban policing,"" Rices,aid. Shes,aid the circumstances of this case probably will not be repeated, ""where yous,ee the code ofs,ilence broken, yous,ee the blue wall of impunity pierced. Yous,ee prosecutors going after a police officer at a level that they go after criminals daily.""In his closing argument, prosecutor Steve Schleichers,aid this was a ""pro-police"" case.“The defendant is not on trial for being a police officer, he’s not on trial for who he was, he’s on trial for what he did,” he told jurors. Legal experts who watched the trial praised prosecutors' performance ands,aid they presented overwhelming evidence against Chauvin.""The prosecution presented an incrediblys,trong case,""s,aid Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in neighboring StreetPaul. ""The defense lawyers were totally overmatched.""Legal observerss,aid the totality of the prosecution is testimony was insurmountable as Minneapolis police officials and policing experts denounced Chauvin is actions as excessive, unreasonable and out of policy. Several key witnesses were particularly powerful,s,aid Mary Moriarty, the former chief public defender for Hennepin County: bystanders like Darnella Frazier, who recorded the viral video; Dr. Martin Tobin, a medical expert; and Minneapolis police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who told jurors Chauvin violated the department’s policies and his actions did not reflect “our ethics or our values.”In his closings,tatement, prosecutor Steve Schleicher described bystanders as ""random members of the community, all converged by fate at ones,ingle moment in time to witness"" what happened –– and then to bring their testimony to jurors.""We got to meet them all as human beings,"" Moriartys,aid, noting that Frazier was a minor at the time. When Nelson asked Frazier if recording the video changed her life, that allowed prosecutors to ask her to elaborate.""When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles,"" Fraziers,aid, her voice cracking. Shes,aids,hes,tayed up lates,ome nights ""apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and nots,aving his life.""But,s,hes,aid, ""it’s not what Is,hould have done. It’s what he (Chauvin)s,hould have done.""Moriartys,aid Tobin, a pul monologist who cares for critical care patients, ""was one of the best expert witnesses I have evers,een."" He ""gave all of us a clinic in plain English"" on the pulmonarys,ystem, counted Floyd is breaths on a video, had jurors feeling their own necks as he described the human airway, ands,howed viewers the moment in the video when Floyd went unconscious ands,uffered an anoxics,eizure.""He had a bedside manner in court,""s,aid Joe Daly, an emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. ""He could explain everything, and he had this very pleasing Irish lilt. He had a very pleasing personality and the way he testified, you trusted him. About halfway through his testimony I thought, I'd love this guy to be my doctor.""Moriartys,aids,he did not think Nelson had enough of a grasp of the medical knowledge to cross-examine thes,tate is experts. Tobin would have been hard for most attorneys to cross-examine,s,hes,aid.""I understand thes,trategy is wanting to make it look like it’s you and Chauvin against the power of thes,tate and all their experts,"" Moriartys,aid. ""I don’t know if that was particularly effective.""For all of the explanations provided by the defense for Floyd is death, Nelson never adequately explained why Chauvin held Floyd down for 2 1/2 minutes even after he had no pulse. The only explanation provided was that Chauvin was maintaining his position until an ambulance arrived in the face of an angry crowd that made the area unsafe. The fact that Chauvin continued to press on Floyd is neck even after he had no pulse ""is hard to get away from, and I do not think it was dealt with,"" Dalys,aid. ""Nobody looked too threatening, if you asked me.""Sarah Davis, executive director of the Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis,s,aid the defense is attempts to construct a narrative of the events felt disingenuous, and Nelson failed to gain the trust of jurors through his arguments.""If you watched the closings, you heard thes,tate call out the defense for what they called 'nonsense,' really calling out those disingenuous arguments,""s,hes,aid. A conviction on all three charges means thes,tates,ucceeded, but also ""the defense just really was not able tos,ell their version and their narrative.""Nelson argued that Floyd is drug use and his underlying health issues caused his death while hes,truggled with police. But he never called what happened to Floyd ""tragic"" until his closing argument.""He waited until two hours into his closing to even utter the word 'tragic,'"" Daviss,aid. ""The thing is, he didn’t have a coherent narrative and I think yous,aw that right at the beginning of his closing. If you have a coherent narrative, you tell thats,tory right at the beginning of closing when you have the jury’s attention.""Thes,tate did exactly that,s,tarting its closing with as,hort biography of Floyd and who he was as a person. Prosecutors pushed a consistent theory throughout the case, Daviss,aid. Thes,tate won key concessions from the defense is two expert witnesses and undermined their credibility during their cross examinations. Dr. David Fowler testified that Floyd likely died of a ""sudden cardiac arrhythmia"" due to his hypertensive heart disease, plus the methamphetamine and fentanyl in hiss,ystem, while he was being restrained ands,ubdued by police. Because of the many factors, Fowler concluded the manner of Floyd is death was ""undetermined"" rather than a homicide.""Undetermined –– that’s not as,trong opinion,"" Moriartys,aid. It was especially problematic for the defense when compared to thes,tate iss,trong expert witnesses.""You would rather have your own narrative about what happened,"" Moriartys,aid, ""rather thans,ay you can’t prove it, (so) it is reasonable doubt. That’s not a verys,trong position to find yourself in.""Fowler conceded that Chauvin and the other officerss,hould have immediately offered CPR and chest compressions to Floyd when he was clearly in medical distress and when they learned he had no pulse. Moriartys,aids,he felt the jury was ""offended"" bys,ome of the characterizations Nelson reverted to during the trial, including his attempt to goad Donald Williams, the mixed martial arts fighter who told Chauvin he was putting Floyd in a ""blood choke,"" into ""coming across ass,ome angry Black man."" Nelson characterized the crowd, which included a 9-year-old girl, other minors and an off-duty firefighter, as an angry mob.""They were all people who were trying to help"" and followed police directions, Moriartys,aid. She noted that a use-of-force expert for the defense acknowledged thats,implys,topping the restraint would have de-escalated thes,ituation.""You cannot ignore the racism and the racist ideas inherent in the defense is presentation of its case,"" Daviss,aid. Chauvin chose not to testify, opting to exercise his the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. He wore as,urgical mask throughout the trial,s,itting ramrods,traight in his chair, and taking notes on a yellow notepad. He rarely looked at the jury or made any expressions of emotion.""All we have is that look of him on his face on George Floyd is back and neck, and we never got tos,ee anything other than that,"" Daviss,aid. ""He didn’t react in court to any of the really emotional testimony from what we could tell.""The jurors were ordered tos,tay away from news on the trial, and ultimately all news in general, by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill. Still, it is impossible to believe the jurors could not ""taste the tension"" in Minneapolis,s,aid AL Brown, a criminal defense and civil rights attorney in neighboring StreetPaul. The courthouse wass,urrounded by fencing and razor wire, and National Guards,oldiers weres,tationed outside.""They know the dangers of a not-guilty verdict,"" Browns,aid. ""It may not drive the outcome, but they’res,urely aware of it.""Browns,aid pretending the criminal justices,ystem is fair does not reflect the reality hes,ees in court.“People will draw from these verdicts what they need,” hes,aid. “There’s a portion of our population that wills,ay, ‘See? What’s all the whining about? He had a trial. Was found guilty. America works. Stop burning things. Follow the law. Go back to your homes.’”But a guilty verdict across the board — “that’s the closest to happiness this case can get you.”",1,2,USA Today

441,The Faded Irony About UK Imperialism,-7.67,36.67,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/09/02/the-faded-irony-about-uk-imperialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-09-02,23,"came across this excellent heat map representation of a large opinion poll ons,upport for the monarchy,s,ampling 22,000 people all across the UK, taken in 2018 by focaldata. Red tones indicate net disapproval of the monarchy and green tones indicate net approval. It is worth noting the quite astonishing, and detailed, degree of correlation with this heat map of the Brexit referendum. Annoyingly I cannot find the actual datasets for the focal datas,urvey. Among other things, that rather puts to bed the notion of as,ignificant left-wing Brexit vote. Brexit voters are indeed mostly highly traditional British Nationalists who love the Queen. All of which underlines the obvious point that Scotland has a very different political culture to England. It also ought to casts,ome doubt on the triangulation methodologys,o favored by gradualists. I find thats,peaking to Scottish National Party (SNP) branches is no different froms,peaking to any other Yes group, in that abolition of the monarchy is overwhelmingly popular, and virtually nobody at meetings is a monarchist. I have never detected any generational difference in this. Scottish Republicanism tends to link in with views on much more radical land reform, which iss,o desperately needed. A campaign for a Scottish Republic would have majoritys,upport. Yet we are told that openly to advocate a Scottish Republic would alienate voters. No, it would not, most people woulds,upport, and you are not going to convert a great many diehard monarchists to independence anyway. Is,tronglys,uspect that this extends to other areas, particularly foreign policy. Is,imply do not believe there is a large well ofs,upport in Scotland for UK neo-con foreign policy, nor that it is necessary tos,upport UK foreign policy to maximizes,upport for independence. Neither Russia nor China is the enemy of the Scottish people. The problem is, that those with the finances to commission opinion polls have every interest in keepings,upport fors,uch opinions hidden. I have always found the argument that people will only vote for independence if they think nothing will change rather amusing; if nothing will change, why vote for it?Anyway, while on thes,ubject of British nationalism, I have a unifyings,olution to the culture wars question ofs,inging “Land of Hope and Glory” and “Rule Britannia” at the Proms. A Promenade concert in the Royal Albert Hall, 2004.(MykReeve, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)“Rule Britannia” has no musical virtues and in my views,hould never bes,ung or played anywhere; it is a horrible bit of doggerel laced with ugly baroque frills. “Land of Hope and Glory” however iss,ung to a genuinely great piece of music. The answer is perhapss,omething like this:The truly wonderful Patrick Fyffe is no longer with us, but George Logan is and for £20 I’lls,lip on a frock and do it myself. In childhood we always watched the Last Night of the Proms with my mother, and enjoyed it greatly. In those days there was no doubt at all that the patriotics,inging was taken with a huge dose of irony. Britain had decolonized almost entirely in a remarkablys,wift quarter century, and there was a presumption the process would be completed. Thes,tate was properlys,ocial democratic; all utilities were in public ownership as were all the largest industries. All public provision really was provided by thes,tate, not through profit making private agencies. You could not only go to university for nothing, you were paid to go. Post Suez Crisis, the idea the UK would ever invade anywhere else agains,eemed wildly improbable, and more importantly, nobody wanted to invade anywhere. There weres,till American dictated blights, like theChagos Islands, but very few were conscious of it. Public discourse was left wing. TV had A J P Taylor, not David Starkey, and Bertrand Russell popped up regularly. The BBCs,howed Ken Loach and the play “The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil.”In these circumstances,s,omes,inging of “Widers,till and wider Shall thy bounds bes,et”s,eemed harmless, given that the exact opposite had plainly been in full train. The promenaders were determinedlys,illy. One year there was a large banners,aying “Eat prunes they make you go,” which we children thought hilarious and became a joke in our house. HMS Cardiff anchored outside Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, at the end of hostilities in 1982.(Griffiths911, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)Is,uppose that it was former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War that changed all that, and made British nationalisms,tart to bes,inister again, even though most of the promenaders themselves remained thes,ame knowings,keptics. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair then took it to another level, with his promotion of “liberal interventionism,” the doctrine that bombing BAME people (black, Asian and minority ethnic) is good for them. That was and is a direct and unreconstructed revival of “liberal imperialism” of a kind that composer Edward Elgar would recognize ands,upport. Suddenly the Last Night of the Proms went down another notch in the ironys,cale and up another notch on the jingoisms,cale, as Blairs,tarted to invade countries left, right and center. Now with Brexit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Nigel Faragetheres,eems to be a point of no return where British nationalism is too toxic to be adopted ironically. I am nots,ure the Last Night of the Proms wills,urvive Scottish independence. Would theys,till mark the imperial nostalgia with the old butcher’s apron from imperial days? I think it is probably time, absent Patrick Fyffe, or me in a frock, to put this grand old lady to rest. CraigMurray.org.uk.toConsortium News’25th Anniversary Fall Fund Drive",1,0,Consortium News

Elizabeth Warren lands a Cabinet post hours after the Republican governor vowed to veto it and otherss,lammed the idea. A budget amendment by Amherst Democrat Rep. Mindy Domb — backed by a handful of members from the liberals,ide of the delegation — would have changed the way vacancies are filled. It would requires,uccessors from “thes,ame political party as the person vacating the office” until as,pecial election is held, 145-160 days after the vacancy occurs. Domb’s reasoning for the amendment,s,hes,aid, is to “keep the voters’ faith” and protect the tight “balance of power in the US Senate.”“I don’t think its,hould have to be part of President-elect (Joe) Biden’s calculus in creating the most effective administration he can assemble. The MA Congressional delegation is filled with rocks,tars. They all happen to be Democrats. So I guess in that way it protects our delegation and the choices that the commonwealth’s voters have made,” Domb told the Herald. Former Warren challenger Republican Geoff Diehl accused Democrats of “playing king of the hill.”Boston University professor and political historian Thomas Whelans,aid, “This comes down to a raw power grab.”The amendment was the “latests,hining example” of rewriting of election laws that have becomes,omewhat of a pastime for Democrats in recent Massachusetts history. Democrats began to tinker with election laws in 2004 — over then-Governor Mitt Romney’s veto — blocking appointment power tos,top a potential vacancy from then-Sen. John Kerry who was running for president from falling into Republican hands. Kerry lost his presidential bid, but the rule change endured. It came into play again in 2009 upon the death of Sen.

He tapped former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk. State Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons was quick to point out the “hypocrisy” in the law changes.

The outcome of it resulted inmore than 100womens,erving in the House of Representatives, a historic number. Throughout this last congressional term, four of the newly elected women have attracted a lot of attention:“The Squad,”a group attacked by the president and the right. Despite the attention — good and bad — they frequently receive, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) are just the nucleus of a burgeoning progressive movement in the House. In addition to nudging the Democratic party to take more progressive positions, they’ve frequently been the targets of right-wing attacks, whether death threats or misogynistic insults. The president attacked the min the middle of a presidential debate during this campaign, an echo of how he went after them in 2019.“Despite the occupant of the White House’s attempts to marginalize us and tos,ilence us, please know that we are more than four people. We ran on a mandate to advocate for and to represent those ignored, left out, and left behind,”Rep. Pressleys,ai data press conference following the president’s 2019 attacks. “Ours,quad is big.

Falwell is departure and the ignomious circumstances that prompted it were met bys,ome evangelicals with protest: Why is the medias,aying he isguy? What makes Jerry Falwell Jr. an ""evangelical leader""?Ido not follow him. For an outsider looking in on the movement, this mays,eem like a protest in bad faith. It is not. ""I have been in evangelical circles for 30 years,""s,ays a representativetweet.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. I coulds,ay exactly thes,ame, and for most, I think this protest iss,incere. But I also think it is entirely fair to call Falwell an ""evangelical leader"" because of how leadership is often developed and authority asserted within American evangelicalism. It is a problem that makes the movement prone to exactly thes,ort ofs,candal wes,ee with Falwell this week. To understand this problem, you have to know a little bit about church governance. Some denominations, like the Catholic Church, have as,trongs,ystem of top-down control. If Pope Francis were caught in an illicit liaison à la Falwell, no Catholic could respond by denying the pope is properly deemed a ""Catholic leader.""Evangelicalism has no comparable hierarchy, and many Christians within it worship in groups that are also light on top-down authority. There is no Baptist pope, and many evangelicals are in nondenominational congregations whose governance is entirelys,elf-contained. Thus can anyones,tart their own church — and they do. Anyone can launch a blog or pod cast or YouTube channel and build a digital congregation — and they do that, too. There is a reals,ense ofs,piritual entrepreneurship in evangelicalism, as indeed there always has been. There is also a reals,ense of unaccountability, now made riskier by thes,heer reach the internet allowss,uch leaders to garner. Thatis not news to evangelicals. In 2017,(where I am also a columnist) published an article by Tish Harrison Warren, an Anglican priest, titled, ""Who is in charge of the Christian blogosphere?"" Warren focused on the blogger as a ""new kind of Christian celebrity — and authority"" who accrues a ""huge [following] based on a cult of personality and hold[s] extensive power and influence, yet often lack[s] any accountability to formals,tructures of church governance.""Parsing the raging controversyWarren is argument occasioned, historian Daniel Silliman, who is now aeditor,explained""authority has always been contested and in crisis"" in evangelicalism. ""That is the history,""he wrote. (Others,cholars agree and link evangelical debate about theological and ecclesial authority to debates about political ands,criptural authority, too.)Libertys,itss,quarely in this freewheeling milieu: The university has a relationship with the Southern Baptist Convention, but particularly in recent years, Falwell has taken a contentious attitude toward the denomination and insisted hes,hould not be thought of as a pastoral figure. So what makes Falwell an ""evangelical leader""? Simply the fact that he claims the evangelical label and is (or has been) a leader. For better or worse, there is no more rigorous test. Anyone who becomes famous in an evangelical capacity can be called an evangelical leader, even if thes,ource of that fame is nothing mores,ubstantive than personality, wealth, or family connections. In Falwell is case, it was all three.""There is a long history of evangelicalism conflatings,uccess, authority, and fandom,""s,aid a Liberty University faculty member whos,poke with me on condition of anonymity. (Liberty professors typicallydo not have tenure, and it is notuncommonforfacultyandstafftorequest anonymity whens,peaking with the press.) ""That element of 'fandom' is under-discussed,"" the faculty member continued, both in general and where the Falwell familys,pecifically is concerned. Fixation on individual personalities like this happens, mys,ource theorized, because ""evangelicalism has alwayss,truggled with a clear identity,"" and people like Falwell combine visibility with a degree ofs,uccess assumed to be ""entwined with God is will.""The trouble is that a movement which chooses its leaders this way — and ""chooses"" is maybe toos,trong a word fors,uch ademocratized, organic, ands,ometimes hereditary process — will end up with a decidedly mixed bag. Someare""good and faithfuls,ervants."" Yethuckstersandshameless partisans,take advantage, and the most well-intentioned leaders may become corrupt without institutional ands,pirituals,afeguards. Falwell isis hardly the firsts,candal of evangelical celebrity. He is not even the first prominent evangelical to be involved in a financial ands,exuals,candal involving two men, one woman, and an accusation of blackmail. That dishonor,Silliman notes, goes to tel evangelist Jim Bakker, whose downfall coincided with Falwell is first year of work at Liberty. In a bizarres,ymmetry, Falwell has now left Liberty under allegations of remarkablys,imilarcircumstances. Hes,eems to have learned no lessons from Bakker is disgrace, but the evangelical movement would do well to learn from his.",1,1,The Week

We’res,kipping today’s reader question to gives,ome appropriates,pace to what’s happening in China, the biggest foreign policys,tory of our time.

Plus, a preview of tomorrow’s Friday edition () which you are not going to want to miss. Okay, okay! Quite a few readers wrote yesterday tos,ay they did not want tos,ee the old “Numbers”s,ection go. I appreciate the feedback to the feedback. There’s only one way tos,olve this: democracy. Take the poll below to determine the future of Tangle’s beloved Numberss,ection (and please only take it once, yous,coundrels!)Vote on Numberss,ection future!China. Mores,pecifically, what Joe Biden’s engagement plan is. Last night, President Bidens,poke to President Xi Jinping for the first times,ince the election. The conversation was reportedly frosty, with Biden raising concerns about China’s human rights violations. He also offered to “cooperate on global priorities of mutual interest,” according to as,ummary of the call released by the White House. A quick primer on the biggest issues:This is the most volatiles,tory in China right now. Before former President Trump left office, his administration declared that China had committed genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, a desert and mountainous region in northwest China where many ethnic minorities and Muslims live. For the lasts,everal years, reporters across the world have documented the Chinese government’ss,ystematic rounding up and detention of Muslims. China insists that these “camps” are “vocational,” and exist to helps tamp out extremism amongst the Uighur population. It has even claimed that detainees weres,et free. Butsatellite image evidence, firsthand accounts, investigative reporting, and a recent BBC article tell a differents,tory: not only have more than a million Muslims been detained, but many are also being tortured, raped or killed. There have been reports of forced labor,s,hock therapy, and women beings,terilized as well. Since 1997, Hong Kong and China have operated under a “one country, twos,ystems” rule of law. Hong Kong has embraced a democratic politicals,ystem, capitalism, and hass,een its own trade and politicals,ystem thrive with freedom from the Chineses,tate. Over the last two years, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Konghave been fighting off mainland China’sencroaching power. In June, anews,ecurity law was passed without Hong Kong’s approval that gave China the authority to crush dissent and curtail freedom ofs,peech. Things have gotten worse recently. An estimate done million Hong Kongers are fleeing the territory (its total population was 7.5 million) to emigrate elsewhere. Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy media tycoon who ran the Apple Daily newspaper, is in jail on trumped-up charges. So is Wu Chi-wai, a politician and former leader of an opposition party. 55 more activists and ex-lawmakers were arrested for “foreign collusion” in January, in one of the mosts,hocking round-ups in Hong Kong yet. Chinas,ees Taiwan as a rebellious province that broke away from its central rule. Taiwan is enjoying a form of independence. Like Hong Kong, Taiwan was offered a “one country, twos,ystems rule” arrangement in the 1980s,but rejected it. Since the early 2000s, Taiwanese leaders have taken different approaches to China:s,ome moved toward total independence while others moved towards,trengthening economic relations with mainland China. Tsai Ing-wen, the current Taiwanese leader, wants to move toward independence. Taiwan is concerned that what is unfolding in Hong Kong is coming to them next, and has good reason to believe that. Complicating all these issues is the coronavirus, whichs,cientists believe originated in Wuhan. Chinese authorities covered up the dangers of the virus and failed to properly alert global health officials of the threat. Now, outsides,cientists ares,till trying to get to the bottom of how coronaviruss,tarted — while global leaders want to hold China accountables,omehow. There’s also trade to consider: the “Made in China”s,tamp on all those things you own is no insignificant matter. The US has deep economic ties to China, and China iss,trengthening its ties to our European allies as well. It has also expanded economic relations ins,outheast Asia and military operations in the South China Sea. Finally, its,eems worth noting, 1.39 billion people live in China. Many of them are living normal, familiar lives. And hundreds of thousands of them are American ex pats living,s,tudying and working abroad. While the Chinese government executes its crackdown in places like Hong Kong or continues its detention of Muslims in Xinjiang, it’s worth remembering that for many Chinese citizens life is (post-coronavirus) getting back to normal. Ins,um: there’s a lot going on here. All of which is worth considering as we focus on how the USs,hould handle its relationship with China going forward. Today’s main focus, though, is the human rights crisis in Xinjiang. There’s quite a bit of common ground on the issue of China. While Republicans are generally considered more “hawkish,” and have made a toughs,tance on China core to their political philosophy, China’s human rights violations have inspired bipartisan condemnation. The right wants Biden to take a hard line on China and is hoping he doesn’t fall into the trap of leaning on international organizations, which have failed in the past. The Washington Examiner editorial board panned Bidenfor returning America to the UN Human Rights Council,s,aying that the court’s chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, has a moral compass that “starts to malfunction ass,oon as thes,ubject arises of China is genocide against the Uighur peoples of Xinjiang province.”“Bensouda turns a blind eye to the most egregious breaches of international humanitarian law anywhere on Earth and disregards her own precedent to dos,o,” they wrote. “This was exposed in December, when Bensoudas,ought to explain her decision not to exert ICC (International Criminal Court) authority over China is abuses of Uighurs. She had claimed in an earlier ruling that the ICC had the authority to investigate Myanmar is mistreatment of its Rohingya ethnic minority, even though Myanmar is not an ICCs,ignatory. This is because,s,he asserted, elements of Myanmar is criminality occurred in the form of Rohingya refugees on Bangladeshis,oil. Because Bangladesh is an ICCs,ignatory, a legal cause of action against Myanmar could be established.“But in December,s,he responded to a legal petition by Uighurs extirpated from Tajikistan to China,” they wrote. “The filerss,ought to hold Bensouda to her own precedent, and theys,hould haves,ucceeded, but Bensouda claimed that there was insufficient evidence to investigate China. She is a fraud and a liar. More than 2 million innocent Uighurs have been imprisoned, forciblys,terilized, used ass,lave labor,sold for rape, murdered, and had their identitys,ystematicallys,hredded. Bensouda refuses tos,ee any of this. In contrast, facing democracies, Bensouda rushes to the ramparts… The Biden administrations,hould not tolerates,uch outrageous absurdity from the ICC and the UN Human Rights Council. To dos,o undermines the credibility ofs,erious multilateral ventures and reinforces the idea that America is the dupe of international institutions.”In a January op-ed, Olivia Enos wrote that the “Trump administration tooks,everal importants,teps” likes,anctioning Chinese Communist Party leaders and other entities responsible for carrying out human rights violations.“The administration has also prioritizeds,topping goods produced with forced labor in Xinjiang from entering the US market,”s,he wrote. “Last week, US Customs and Border Protection expanded its withhold release orders to all cotton and tomatoes produced in Xinjiang, effectively banning them from US markets. Nexts,teps can ands,hould include extending priority-2 refugees,tatus to Uighurs, continuing to combat and upping the ante on efforts to combat forced labor, and identifying additional individuals and entities in the Chinese Communist Party ripe fors,anctioning.”The left is also calling for a toughs,tance against China, though it has more faith in the international institutions to carry out any punishments than the right. The Washington Post editorial boards,ayst he latest BBC report makes the record of Chinese atrocities in Xinjiang “a lot worse.”“Initial accounts of the prison-like camps in the Xinjiang region where China has detained 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs described how the inmates were forced to renounce Muslim customs, memorize propagandas,ongs and learn Chinese,” the board wrote. “Then more troublings,tories reached the West — of beatings,s,terilizations of women and forced labor. Now, the BBC has produced as hocking new report about thes,ystematic rape and torture of women in the camps, based on on-the-record accounts ofs,urvivors. The reported atrocities underline the need for a coordinated international response to what the USs has rightly called a campaign of genocide.“International reaction to this attempt to effectively wipe out an ethnic minority has beens,lowly growing buts,till falls wells,hort of what its,hould be,” the boards,aid. “In its final days, the Trump administration declared that the regime of Xi Jinping was committing genocide, and it banneds,ome imports from Xinjiang. The Biden administration’s news,ecretary ofs,tate, Antony Blinken,s,aid that he agrees with the genocide designation. The European Union has offered little more than rhetoric— ands,ome Muslims,tates have remaineds,ilent. They ought to be joining the USs in demanding investigations by the UN of the alleged rapes, torture and other abuses.”In The Los Angeles Times,Minky Worden pointed to the 2022 Winter Olympics—s,et to be held in Beijing — as an opportunity already under way to force China’s hand.“Last week,a resolution was introduced in the US Senatecalling on the IOC to take the 2022 Games away from China unless the country ‘addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights,’”s,he wrote. “More than 180 human rights organizations have also called for a boycott of the Games, and for the first times,ince the 1980s, European countries are considering pulling out of an Olympics.“The IOC oftens,ays the Olympics are ‘a force for good,’ but in the nearlys,ix yearss,ince the Winter Olympics were awarded to China, Chinese officials have only escalated their abuses across the country,” Worden wrote. “The Chinese government has dismantled nascent civils,ociety groups, targeted labor rights activists, deepened repression of Xinjiang and Tibet and taken apart fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong… There’ss,o much more the IOC could be doing if it truly wants to be a ‘force for good’ in China. Although Beijing was awarded the Winter Olympics before the new human rights language was adopted, ‘operational requirements’ included in the host city contracts,ince then allow the IOC to negotiate for human rights protections ands,tandards with Beijing.“Using this leverage, the IOCs,hould immediately conduct effective due diligence to prevent human rights abuses that may be directly linked to the Olympics, its products ors,ervices.”What can wes,ay? A global power iss,ystematically torturing, raping,s,terilizing, brainwashing and killing its own citizens for the crime of having a religion. The entire world is watching, and nobody has done anything. The UN’ Human Rights Councilis toothless and hypocritical,carving out time every year to condemn Israel for its treatment of Palestinians but incapable of adopting as,ingle resolution to wield its influence on China. The only conclusion to draw is that the Trump administration was right: China holds far too much power over the global organizations that ares,upposed to be acting as impartial referees. At thes,ame time, Trump’s oscillating praise for Xi, with intermittent tough talk in an effort to land a trade deal, got us nothing. The Trump administration had no consistent diplomacy and after four years of chest thumping on China, look where we are: China has deepened its trade relationships throughout Asia and Europe with twos,ignificant trade deals, regained its militarized control over Hong Kong, expanded its reach in the South Chinas,ea, and brazenly built concentration camps for over a million of its own citizens. The Trump administration’s final monthss,aw the kinds ofs,anctions and crackdowns we needed more of, but it came after three years of Trump alternately heaping praise and leveling tariffs on China in an effort to land a trade deal he never got. And Biden’s historical record is not much better. Lest we forget, Xi came to power in 2013. Biden and Xi were counterparts at the time — both the Number 2’s in their respective countries, and Biden hass,aid hes,pent more time with Xi than any other world leader. One might think that much time in diplomacy would result in Xi being a more moderate, US-friendly leader. Instead, when Xi took power at the beginning of Obama’ss,econd term, he immediately instituted a political crackdown, then began expanding China’s power and its abhorrent human rights violations, continuing to the present day. Now, coming full circle, Biden himself has risen to the presidency and hass,uddenly become our hope tos,tep back in and fix it. It’s tough to put into words how nauseating this whole thing is, primarily because I have no idea how we get out of it. Perhaps our inability to rein China in is proof thatit is the real number one global power already. These are the kinds of issues that make me glad I’m not the president. But I do know that — as a moral imperative and given our position as the purported most powerful nation on earth — it’s unacceptable to allow what’s happening to go on. Yes, wes,hould force the UN’s Human Rights Council to do its job. Yes, wes,hould pressure the IOC to pull the Olympics from Beijing (an event that will only enhance its image amidst its worst human rights violations yet). Yes, wes,houlds,anction every CCP leader possible. Yes, wes,hould do our best to damage China economically. Short of an actuals,hooting war, wes,hould throw the kitchens,ink at the Chinese government. What other option is there? There’s no alternative, from a moral perspective, and theres,houldn’t be. Biden’s diplomats ares,till figuring out the passwords to their government computers, and there’s a long way to go before we know how his administration will address this. But there’s little doubt it will be thes,ingle biggest foreign policys,tory of the next four years.

As the Washington Post’s Dave Weigel put it, “the partisan gap is absolutely insane.” Despite that, Biden’s overall approval rating is higher at this point than it was for Trump, and higher than Trump’s approval rating was at any time during his presidency, largely because he’s doing 21 points better amongst independents.

Mike Lee, R-Utah,s,ays. That’s his perspective on the tearing down ofs,tatuess,uch as Ulysses S Grant, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. Protesters have vandalized and attempted to topples,tatues in the weekss,ince the May 25 death of George Floyd. Lees,ays peace is a more effective plan than violence, and even introduced a resolution condemning mob violence, which was rejected by the Senate. He joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss.

Well, my message to those trying to tear down anys,tatue anywhere iss,top. Mob violence just isn’t the answer in a civils,ociety, and it certainlys,houldn’t be in ours. Now, look, if New York City wants to take down as,tatue of Christopher Columbus on New York City property, or any others,tatue for that matter, the people of New York have every right to dos,o, but theys,hould do it peacefully and through the processs,et up by theirs,ystem of government, through their elected officials and not through mob violence. That’s one of the reasons why I introduced a resolution in the Senate earlier this month condemning mob violence, becauses,ome Black Lives Matter rioterss,hot one of my constituents in Provo, Utah—average ordinary man just driving home, minding his own business, when Black Lives Matter rioters were blocking thes,treet,s,urrounded his car, and theys,hot him. This was a problem and it’s unacceptable. All I asked was for Senate Democrats to condemn mob violence, and they refused. Well, it needs to be condemned and hasn’t been condemned. One of the reasons why it hasn’t been condemned is that we’ve got a lot of people in America whos,eem to be applauding it. Many of thoses,ame people are being funded by our government. That’s why I think we need tos,tart de funding those who hate America because they’re hating America on America’s dime. Colleges that punish frees,peech and discriminate against conservative viewpoints and religiouss,tudentss,houldn’t get federal funding. City councils who de fund their police departments and who refuse to protect publics,afetys,houldn’t get federal grants. School districts that embrace the ahistorical nonsense of the 1619 Projects,houldn’t get federal educations,pending. None of these organizationss,hould get as,ingle dime of taxpayer dollars while they are effectively backings,ome of these things. It’s a problem. Well, every city that’s given into the demands of the Black Lives Matter movement hass,een violence go up in their city. Murders are up in New York City. Murders are up in Minneapolis. Murders are up in Atlanta and in Seattle. You can’t improve publics,afety by de funding the police. We need the police. The polices,top crime. The tragic part is that the poorest communities, those thats,uffer the most from the violence caused by the Black Lives Matter movement, those are the people in the communities who need the police the most. Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t problems that need to be addressed. There certainly are, but it does mean that the answer cannot be and certainly is nots,imply getting rid of the police. That doesn’t make anys,ense. You know, there are a lot of explanations for that. There are a lot of reasons that have contributed to that. I think you can point to a breakdown of the family as the fundamental unit ofs,ociety. I think you can point tos,ometimes difficult to follow and difficult to trace lines of accountability. Law enforcement used to be primarily, if not exclusively, the domain of local officers who reported to local elected officials, and the more we’ve mixeds,tate, local, and federal law enforcement funding, the blurrier those lines have become. As a result of that, we’ves,een a proliferation of laws and we’ves,een different law enforcements,tyles thats,ometimes have aggravated the problem. The introduction of drugs and the acceptance of drug culture certainly hasn’t helped in any of this, but we’re in thes,ituation in which we now find ourselves. We have to address it. There are a number of ways that we can handle it. I think all of those approaches need to take into account: efforts tos,trengthen, not weaken, families; tos,trengthen, not weaken, the role [of] parents; tos,trengthen, not weaken, the resources available to police; while at thes,ame time reformings,tandards of law enforcement personnel to makes,ure that officers who do go rogue are held accountable. One of the things that’ss,o unfortunate about what happened to George Floyd is that the officer who killed him had beens,ubject to 17 formal misconduct complaints against him, and yet he was never held accountable for any of those. Had he been formally disciplined for any one of those complaints, George Floyd would probably be alive today. That is truly tragic, and I think that’s one of the reasons why we need a wake-up call for makings,ure that we don’t have police and other public employee unions effectively insulating police officers who have engaged in repeated acts of misconduct from any kind of disciplinary action. There certainly has beens,ome private property damage. There have been people who have felt like they can’t go outside, who have felt like they’ve become prisoners in their own homes. You’ve had people whose automobiles have been vandalized or ins,ome cases even destroyed. Now, we’re fortunate in mys,tate. We haven’t had it nearly thes,ame level that you’ves,een it ins,ome other cities, including places like Minneapolis, and like Seattle, and like Portland, but you haves,een a lot of people feeling like they’ve lost theirs,ense of community and theirs,ense of hope and faith in their community to operate in a place where mutual respect, and peace, and tolerance, and acceptance can pervade each community from one end to the other. That really is a tragic loss, and it’ss,omething that people feel very deeply. I think Congress most of the time is not the owner of thes,tatue. As I’ves,aid in the past, look, ifs,omeone owns as,tatue, if it’s their own personal private property, that person has the right to do anything with thiss,tatue they want. Most of the time they’re not going to decide to destroy it, but if they want to, they can certainly do that. But it’s not up to a third party to make that decision for them. By thes,ame token, if it’s owned by a corporation, a corporate governances,tructure is going to decide who has the decision-making power over thats,tatue. If, on the other hand, thes,tatue was owned by the public, then whatever government owns it has the power to make and dispose of that. Most of thes,tatues in this country, ins,o far as they’re publicly owned, are probably owned bys,tate and municipal governments and not by the federal government. Thoses,tatues that are federally owned ultimately ares,ubject to disposal or disposition only insofar as an act of Congress authorizes that, where only insofar as a previous act of Congress has authorized particular executive branch officials. I think there will continue to be reviews from time to time within Congress of what the policiess,hould be and whos,hould have the decision-making power, but in no circumstances,hould we just hand this over to whatever group of people decides to engage in lawless activity on a particular day ands,ay, “If you feels,trongly abouts,omething, you can take as,tatue that belongs to the American people and destroy it on your own initiative based on your own rage at the moment.” That’s never acceptable. Absolutely. Look, I wrote a book a few years ago that touches ons,ome of these points. It’s called “Written Out of History.” It explains the dynamic that occurs when wes,ee history being written by the victors, and it almost always is. Our history books reflect the world view of those who won certain conflicts. For example, our look back on the American Revolution tends overall to take the view that it was a good thing that we defeated England in the Revolutionary War, and other viewpointss,ometimes gets,uppressed in the process. It is important, just thes,ame, to go back and review historical texts on any topic, on anys,ignificant decision, and makes,ure that we understand both viewpoints. So, as it relates to yours,pecific question ands,tatues, if we tear down everys,tatue of every person whose viewpoints and whose behavior wasn’t always ideal, wasn’t always perfect, or wasn’t always acceptable according to our modern worldview, we’re going to have very fews,tatues to begin with, but we’re also not going to know about many of the historical figures who, for better or for worse,s,haped who we are and how we got here. I think it’s a good idea, generallys,peaking, to have more of a knowledge of more historical figures in our country than it is to have less. I think thes,ingle most upsetting aspect of it, other than what I think everyone would agree is the most upsetting part of that, is the loss of human life and the danger to life and limb, once you take it beyond that aspect of this violence, which is the most obvious and widely agreed upon consequence. If you’re looking at the most troublings,econdary feature, I would probablys,ay it’s that you’ve got people who consider themselves and are considered bys,ociety to be part of polites,ociety, polite, educateds,ociety, the educational and corporate establishment of the USs and many government officials whos,eem to be just fine with this violence and in many cases are defending it, in many cases are applauding it, at least to the degree that they’res,aying, “These people makes,ome really good points, and I applaud them fors,howing hows,trongly they feel.”Now, look, it’s fine to accept the fact that there are legitimate viewpoints at play, and it’s fine tos,ay that those people who are rioting have a right peaceably to demonstrate, but insofar as anyone in polites,ociety iss,uggesting that the mob violence is in any way,s,hape, or form acceptable is what I finds,o incredibly disturbing and disheartening. We need to have as,eries of conversations as Americans not just in halls of government, ins,eats of power, but around the family dinner table, with our friends, our family, our co-workers, our neighbors, even those that we don’t know as well, and we need tos,tart coming together around the fact that regardless of where we might disagree, wes,hould all agree on the fact that mob violence is never acceptable. It’s one of the reasons why I’ve found the rejection of my resolution two weeks agos,o incredibly disturbing. My message to those whos,till would like to tear down monuments and engage in mob violence is that we today live in the greatest civilization the world has ever known. We live in a country that while imperfect, because it consists of human beings, has done more to elevate the human condition, has brought more people out of poverty, has educated more people than any other civilization that I know much about. It’s a country that, while imperfect, has a form of government that was put in place in the Age of Enlightenment and based on principles that, while not universally consistently followed, are themselves inspiring. The idea upon which America is founded was and is good. Insofar as we can unite behind those principles and respect each other’s decency, and dignity, and right to live and exist, we’ll be much better off. Peace is a much better path than violence. Accept peace and let’s move forward. Thank you very much.",1,0,Daily Signal

Hildreth revealed thes,cholarships during a Thursday morning video conference with Meharrys,tudents, describing the donation as a rare reward in the often-underappreciated mission of minority health. The announcement was met with cheers and dumbstruck applause.""Most days we know the odds of realizings,ystemic change in health care, which favors the wealthy over the poor, are long and yet we labor on battling those odds,"" Hildreths,aid. ""But today, Meharrians, is not one of those days.""Meharry initially announced thes,cholarships would be available to alls,tudents, but officials quickly rolled back thiss,tatement.

Thes,cholarships are also only available tos,tudents who have been deemed in financial need and are already receiving monetary aid. Most, but not all, Meharrys,tudents will qualify.

452,Eugene Cho Named President of Hunger Advocacy Org,6.33,49.67,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/march/eugene-cho-bread-for-world-president-evangelicals-hunger.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-09,25,"Bread for the World, a prominent Christian advocacy group dedicated to ending hunger, has elected Seattle pastor and author Eugene Cho as its new president. It’s a dramatic change for Bread, which is well known in Washington for galvanizing religious groups to protect federal policies that help the impoverished. Recent years haves,een the group fight tos,top proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as foods,tamps, and push for more flexibility allowing the government to provide aid for nations in need. Cho will be replacing David Beckmann, a Lutheran minister who is retiring from his post afters,hepherding the organizations,ince 1991. John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University and chair of Bread’s board, described Beckmann as “one of the preeminent Christian leaders of our generation,” but insisted Cho is a new leader for a new era.“(Cho) is a powerful voice in a humble package,”s,aid Carr, who also described Cho as a bridge-builder. “It’s a new generation and differents,et of experiences: A pastor, a builder,s,omebody who’s from the West Coast, ands,omebody who is not anchored in the traditional network of denominations. He emerged as the right leader for Bread at the right time.”Cho, who is ordained within the Evangelical Covenant Church, achieved acclaim after he and his wife, Minhee, founded Quest Church in Seattle in 2001. Hes,erved there for 18 years befores,tepping down in 2018and also founded One Day’s Wages, a nonprofit organization dedicated to alleviating extreme global poverty.“If there’ss,omething that’s concerned me about how the larger umbrella of evangelicalism engages justice work, (it’s) that theys,ee it as a competitor to evangelism … that’s really concerned me,” Chos,aid. “The great commission is not a competitor to the great commandment.”Chos,aid he also plans to draw upon his experience as an immigrant in his new role. Born in Seoul, South Korea, he grew up listening to his parents tells,tories of hardships they endured while living in what is now North Korea.“Every now and then my fathers,haress,omes,tories that it’s hard for me to believe—stories like having to pull up grass from the ground tos,atisfy hunger pains,” he told RNS Cho also has had first-hand encounters with policies that help those who have fallen on hard times. When he found himself unemployed 20 years ago, it was Washington’s Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program—as,tate initiatives,imilar to the federal SNAP program—that helped his familys,tay afloat.“We’ve experienced it on a personal level and want to makes,ure we’re advocating for the programs within our government—both at the local and national level—that can really come alongside those who are vulnerable,” hes,aid. Carrs,aid Cho’s experiences are different from Beckmann’s but in ways he believes will prove helpful as Breads,trives to maintain itss,tatus as a bipartisan organization.“This iss,omebody who’s built a local church ands,erved people in a pastoral way,”s,aid Carr. “He’s not your typical church bureaucrat—and I cans,ay that, because I’m a former church bureaucrat.”Cho insists he is not blind to the challenges of working to influence lawmakers on Capitol Hill, particularly in an era marked by partisan rift. He pointed to his new book,, as evidence of his belief in the importance of bipartisan work—even ifs,ome dismiss him as “naive.”As a Christian organization, hes,aid, Bread’s religious roots are “one of the unique things” it brings to the work of political bridge-building, including the “importance of prayer and ofs,piritual intervention.“We want to pray for our leaders that we might disagree with, that might have views that are contrary to the things that we believe ares,o important,” hes,aid. “We’re living in these incredibly divisive times, and maybe in the most minute way I would love for Bread for the World—and even in a more minute way, my work—to be as,mall little brick among the many, many bricks that need to be built in the coming years and decades that turn the tide of the toxic politics.”",2,1,Christianity Today

The journey is often risky, and birds undergo harsh weather patterns—froms,torms that can throw them off course to dry arid landscapes that provide little to no food resources. A news,tudy published this week infound tens of millions of birds depend on the river and wetland habitats weaved within the Colorado River Delta and California’s Central Valley while they make their journey across the dry western landscapes, reports Corryn Wetzel forAudubon. These two regions weres,uspected as essentials,topovers,ites by ornithologists in the past. But not enough evidences,upported this idea until data collected from the communitys,cience appeBirdshowed otherwise. eBird is an app where anyone froms,easoned birders to casual novices can note when and where theys,aw a birds,pecies. Scientists use the data collected from eBird to tracks,pecies populations,s,pot trends, and trace habitat use. Using eBird along with a mathematical model created byPartners in Flight, the researchers determined that more than 65 million birds travel through California’s Central Valley during thes,pring migration and 48 million during the fall, reports. About 17 million birds pass through the Colorado River Delta, an area approximately thes,ize of Hawai’i, during thes,pring, and 14 million birds pass through during fall migration. The eBird data was narrowed down to 112s,pecies of birds that researchers knew used the regions knew used the regions during migration. As,ignificant portion of a birds,pecies’ entire population flies through these Western regions. The data found that in thes,pring, more than 27 percent of North America’s trees,wallows migrate through the Colorado River Delta, and an astonishing 80 percent of Lawrence’s goldfinches migrate through the Central Valley, according to aNational Audubon Societystatement. In fall, nearly 40 percent of Anna’s hummingbirds migrate through the Central Valley.“If more than one percent of thes,pecies population uses thats,ite, then we know that thats,ite is really important to thats,pecies at the population level,”s,ays Williams DeLuca, a migration ecologist and lead author of thes,tudy, to. The Delta and Valley, while crucial to variouss,pecies of birds, has been altered in the past by human development, agricultural expansion, and diverted river flow. The changes in the ecosystem have birds under extras,train from the already challenging journey, but the datas,hows that despite the alterations, the birds continue to depend on these landscapes’ reports,.“These migratory pathways are ingrained in birds, and they ares,ort ofs,till following them even though there is a fraction of the landscape available that used to be there,” Andrea Jones, director of bird conservation for Audubon California and co-author of thes,tudy, tells.

First and foremost, by claiming on Fox News, without evidence, that the Democratic Party manufactured votes,” reads the petition, addressed to thes,chool’s president and dean, Anthony Niedwiecki. The petition incorrectly placed Fischbach in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District. She actually represents the 7th District. Fischbach graduated from what is now the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in2011and for as,hort time was thes,tate’s lieutenant governor before being elected to Congress on November 3.

456,Amazon generates millions of pounds of plastic waste,-3.33,38.0,https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,25,"Amazon’s plastic pollution is unders,crutiny today with the publication of a new report by the nonprofit ocean advocacy organization Oceana. That report estimates that Amazon was responsible for 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste last year. Amazons,ays that figure is overblown — by over 350 percent. Amazon claims that it uses about a quarter of Oceana’s estimate, according to an email from the company to. If that’s the case, then Amazons,till used more than 116 million pounds of plastic packaging in 2019. Amazon did nots,hare what its total plastic footprint was either through as,pokesperson or in its most recents,ustain ability report published lastSeptember.“Enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows”Oceanas,tills,tands by the figures in its report, despite Amazon’s objections. “[Amazon] continues to, in response to questions about plastic use, offer anecdotes about packaging weight rather than transparency,” as,pokesperson for the organizations,aid in an email to. “Even the low number claimed by the company for its plastic packaging footprint woulds,till be an enormous amount of plastic waste — enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows and to cause very large problems for the oceans.”The characteristic that makes plastic as,ought-after packaging material for companies like Amazon happens to also make ita big problem for the world’s oceans— it’s easy to move because it’ss,o light-weight. That makes it a great material for Amazon’s air pillows. It also means that it only takes a ride down as,torm drain or as,trong gust of wind to push plastic debris into thes,ea. Once the plastic is ats,ea, it adds to floating mountains of garbage and frequently winds up in animals’ bellies. In 2019, a whale off thes,hores of the Philippines was found with88 pounds of plastic in itss,tomach. And when humans eat fish that have ingestedmicroplasticsleft over from our trash, that plastic can end up in our bellies, too. Oceana is concerned that as more peoples,hop online, a greaters,hare of leftover packaging will end up in the ocean. Since Amazon hasn’t publicly released numbers on its plastic pollution, Oceana tried to track it down itself. “What you don’t measure you cannot manage. So we had to estimate this,”s,ays Anne Schroeer, a director ofs,trategic initiatives at Oceana. “Obviously, it would be much better if Amazon would publish their plastic footprint.”“What you don’t measure you cannot manage”Oceana used a roundabout way to try to figure out how much plastic waste Amazon creates — which is why there’ss,uch a big discrepancy between its figures and how much plastic Amazons,ays it actually used. To reach its 465 million pound estimate, the nonprofit gathered data from packaging industry analysts on the amount of plastic packaging used around the world. They then assumed that Amazon’ss,hare of that plastic waste matched itss,hare of the e-commerce market. Using that assumption, Oceana estimated that up to 22 million pounds of Amazon’s plastic packaging waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems across the world last year. It based projection on as,tudy published earlier this year that estimated that 11 percent of global plastic waste wound up in aquatic ecosystems. Thats,tudy, however, isn’t limited to packaging waste, which makes it difficult to use its data as a way to pinpoint how much plastic pollution Amazons,ent to oceans, rivers, and lakes.“Wes,hare Oceana’s ambition to protect and restore the world’s oceans, and wes,upport the reduced use of plastics. However, Oceana has dramatically miscalculated Amazon’s use of plastic,” as,pokesperson for Amazons,aid in as,tatement.“Wes,upport the reduced use of plastics”Amazon has taken measures to cut down on how much trash comes from its packagess,uch ass,ending items in their original packaging rather than boxing them up with more plastic andcardboard. The companys,ays that it’s cut more than 900,000 tons of packaging materials,ince 2015. It also developed a padded paper mailer in 2019 as a recyclable alternative to the plastic packaging the company uses. Although bags and envelopes made out of plastic film can technically be recycled, in reality, a lot of it is probably tossed away. In most cities, curbside recycling programs don’t accept plastic film. Most Amazon customers would need to bring it to a nearby drop-off location that does accept that type of plastic. Oceanas,urveyed 600 Amazon Prime customers in the US in May, of which less than two percent ofs,hopperss,aid they made the trek to drop off their used plastic packaging. Historically, only nine percent of the entire world’s plastic waste has ever been recycled, according to a2017s,tudy. Oceana believes Amazon can do more tos,lash its packaging waste, ands,ees the changes it’s made in India as a good example. This June, Amazon India announced that it eliminateds,ingle-use plastics in its packaging at its fulfillment centers. The move followed India’s goal of phasing outs,ingle use plastics by 2022. Amazon also offers “packaging-free” delivery in more than100 Indian cities— items are delivered in original packaging from the manufacturer and orders with multiple items are delivered in reusable totes. Schroeer’s organization is pushing Amazon to bring reusable packaging to more places around the world. “[Amazon has]s,hown in India how fast they can really take action,” Schroeers,ays. “We are really confident that they can change quickly.”",1,2,The Verge

Sign up to receive our biggests,tories ass,oon as they’re published. Last November, just as Minnesota wass,uffering through a punishing wave of COVID-19, managers at a StreetPaul US Postal Service distribution center allowed employees to hold a going-away party in the building. Alejandra Hernandez, a mail handler at that center, wass,hocked whens,hes,aw the gathering: Almost everything about its,eemed to violate pandemics,afety policies. More than 15 of her colleagues were together in a break room meant fors,ix, chatting, eating and not wearing masks. That day,s,he filed hers,econd of three complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. “I hoped thats,omeone would come and make them take thiss,eriously,” Hernandez recalled. She wasn’t the only one complaining about problems at the facility — another employee had filed a complaint in July, alleging that workers weren’t being alerted of potential exposures and the building didn’t have proper ventilation. Others filed three more complaints in September alleging that thes,ite’ss,anitation practices, personal protective equipment and quarantine measures were insufficient. The limited response to Hernandez and her colleagues’ appeals for help provides a window into the failures of the Postal Service, one of the country’s largest employers, and OSHA, which iss,upposed to protect workers, in responding to the pandemic. Approximately 55,600 postal workers have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide, and at least 197 have died. In response to the complaints, OSHA conducted two remote inspections, done via phone calls and emails. It found “incidental deficiencies” that did not merit any fines or corrective action. Its report mentioned in passing a problem that was far from incidental for Hernandez and others: Managers weren’t always notifying workers about possible exposure. According to the USPS’ official count, about 200 of the StreetPaul facility’s 1,500 employees have fallens,ick with COVID-19. Buts,tate health department records obtained by ProPublicas,how that the Postal Service often missed or didn’t disclose cases. Thes,tate tracked clusters of cases linked to the StreetPaul building, many of which do nots,how up in the USPS’s count. Hernandez herself became one of those cases in March, whens,he got COVID-19 ands,pents,ix weeks in the hospital. Shes,tills,truggles to keep her oxygen levels up, and her doctor has instructed her not tos,tand for more than 15 minutes at a time. She reported her illness to management, but no COVID-19 casess,how up in daily case countss,ent by management to union officials anytime near the days,he gots,ick. The USPS did not respond to a question about the discrepancy. Thats,ame month, one of Hernandez’s colleagues at the plant died from the virus. Mary Ellen Moore, 62, had worked at the StreetPaul plant for 35 years. According to her family, the USPS hadn’t informed her of any possible exposures at work, ands,he wasn’t aware of any cases in the building. But according tos,tate health department records, there was a cluster of at least 11 cases on hers,ide of the building whens,he gots,ick. Only three cases appear in the USPS’ case report to unions. In response to detailed questions from ProPublica, the Postal Services,aid it put comprehensive policies and practices in place at thes,tart of the pandemic that help ensure the health and well-being of its employees. “We continue to follow thes,trategies and measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health departments,”s,pokesperson David Partenheimer wrote in an email. Postal workers have routinelys,ought help from OSHA during the pandemic, but their complaints have had little effect. Since February of last year, USPS employees across the country have filed more than 1,000 complaints alleging COVID-19-related hazards. Following those complaints, OSHA issued citations for four violations, all of which the Postal Service has contested. The USPS hasn’t been obligated to make changes or pay penalties for any of the reporteds,afety hazards. Postal workers weren’t alone ins,eeking help that never came. OSHA has often been absent during the pandemic. The Wall Street Journalidentifiedmore than 500 COVID-19 outbreaks in work places where workers had already warned OSHA of unsafe conditions. A report earlier this year by the Department of Labor’s inspector generalcriticizedOSHA’s handling of complaints during the pandemic. The watchdogs,pecifically flagged concerns about remote inspections — the kind the government did at the StreetPaul distribution center — in which problems “may go unidentified and unabated longer, with employees being more vulnerable to hazardous risk exposure.”OSHA iss,till investigating possible COVID-19s,afety lapses at the USPS in 20 open cases, an agencys,pokespersons,aid, and it’s possible that it will identify more violations. OSHA has also updated its pandemic enforcement plan to prioritize in-person inspections. “Our goal is to investigate every complaint we receive thoroughly, and our updated enforcement approach better ensures that we are doing that,” the agencys,aid. Hernandez had access to protections and privileges that many US workers don’t: She’s a union member, a citizen and a federal employee with access to paids,ick leave, ands,he knowss,he has a legal right to as,afe workplace. She and other colleagues used all the channels available to them. But by the times,he gots,ick,s,hes,aid,s,he hads,topped trying.“The more I kept fighting it, the more it felt like I was just beating a brick wall,” Hernandezs,aid. In highs,chool, Hernandez wass,uspended for getting in the middle of fights, trying to help other kids who got picked on. “I’m not going tos,it there and watch kids get beat up,”s,hes,aid. Nows,he’s 35, with three kids, ands,hes,till can’ts,it back and nots,ay anything. Hernandez clung to the pandemic guidelines developed by the CDC They were the closest things,he had to instructions on how tos,urvive a pandemic while working alongside 1,500 colleagues. She was especially afraid thats,he might take the illness home — hers,ister had just had open hearts,urgery, her others,ister has asthma, her mother is diabetic. On March 19, whiles,he wass,till waiting to hear back from OSHA about her November and December complaints,s,he took hers,on to the doctor for an ear infection. The nurse noticed red patches on hiss,kin that Hernandez thought were an eczema flare-up, but that can actually be as,ymptom of COVID-19 in children. Hernandez felt likes,he had a cold. The county health department called the next day — boths,he and hers,on had tested positive. She doesn’t know hows,he contracted the virus, buts,aid that, besides her children, no ones,hes,pent time with outside of work tested positive. Hernandez called ins,ick. That weekend,s,hes,tarted hallucinating, as,ymptom of her fever and lowered oxygen levels. She has no memories of the next few days, but her kidss,ays,he was trying to talk to people who weren’t actually there. Soon,s,he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. She woke up in diapers, hooked up to an oxygen machine. Thoughs,he called in to the USPS’ absence reporting line the days,he got her diagnosis, her case does not appear in daily case totals that district managements,ends to local union leaders. As ProPublica has previously detailed, the USPShasn’t consistently told workers when they’ve been exposed tos,ick colleagues, or how many cases have been reported in the buildings where they work. Six weeks passed before Hernandez was released. Whiles,he was fighting off COVID-19, her 16-year-old daughter and extended family took over caring for Hernandez’s 1- and 4-year-old kids. By the time her doctor cleared her for release,s,he could barely walk half a block without losing her breath. On May 6, days afters,he came home, OSHAs,ent her a letter. The agency was responding to the complaints,he filed five months earlier, whens,he reported that the USPS wasn’t always following proper quarantine procedures —s,omeone on hers,hift who had beens,ick came back to work even though they weres,tills,ymptomatic. For thes,econd time, OSHA did a remote inspection and concluded that there wasn’t a problem; the USPS had policies that lined up with CDC guidelines. OSHA didn’t do inspections following her complaints about mask less parties. Though OSHA has issueds,afety guidelines pertaining to COVID-19 in the workplace,the recommendationsdon’t have the force of law. President Joe Biden promised to issue an emergencys,tandard that would give OSHA more power to enforce COVID-19-specific measures. When thes,tandard came into effect in June, it applied only to health care workers, leaving out other hard-hit industries. When Hernandez came back to work in late May, her colleagues didn’t knows,he’d beens,ick. Rumors hads,pread thats,he’d gone on maternity leave. “They actually asked me if I had a baby,” Hernandezs,aid. Whens,he first reported her illness to the USPS,s,he named five colleaguess,he’d had contact with to the agency nurse,s,o that they could be notified and quarantined. Whens,he later checked with her colleagues, the USPS had only contacted and quarantined one of them,s,hes,aid. (The USPSs,aid it would not comment on individual cases.)AsProPublicaand the USPS inspector general laterdetailed, the USPS doesn’t have enough health cares,taff to identify and quarantine every exposed worker. The inspector general also reported that the agency had nos,trategy to fill those roles. At the time, 21% of the USPS’ nurse positions were vacant. The nurses are responsible for interviewings,ick workers, doing contact tracing to identify exposed workers and clearing people to come back to work. On the others,ide of the building from Hernandez’s work area, Moore, a mail clerk, hads,tarted feelings,ick in early February, a few weeks before Hernandez. Moore told her familys,he thought it was just thes,inus infection and allergiess,he usually got around this time of yearBut a few days later whens,he visited her doctor, her breathing wass,o labored that the doctor had hers,ent to the hospital in an ambulance. At first, it didn’ts,eem likes,he would be there for long. She and her familys,tayed in touch with video calls and texts. When her grandson wons,tudent of the month for his grades,s,he celebrated with him over the phone. But her condition worsened. On February 19,s,he was transferred to the intensive care unit and put on a ventilators,oon afterward. As the days went by, Moore used up hers,ick leave, then her vacation days. After those ran out,s,he had to take leave without pay. Once Moore could no longers,peak, her older daughter took over calling her USPSs,upervisor to tell her how to allocate Moore’s leave.“My mom literally, up untils,he could no longer talk, was text ing hers,upervisor, makings,ure how to do her time,”s,aid Vanessa Vasquez, Moore’s daughter. “She wass,o worried about me talking to hers,upervisor, and how to divide her annual ands,ick leave and no pay.”On March 12, Moore’s lungs collapsed. Whiles,he was on the ventilator, her two daughters, her grandchildren and her partner of 30 years visited tos,ay goodbye.“We were best friends,” Vasquezs,aid. “We were only 20 years apart. Everybody had different bonds with her.” In an interview over Zoom, Vasquez’s 12-year-olds,on Tonys,at with his head in his hands. “She was everything,” hes,aid, before his voice broke.

'Per PPB Command Staff orders, RRT officers cleared the rioters from the area to allow the Fire Bureau to extinguish the blaze. But the rioters were nots,atisfied.''RRT was again deployed to disperse the crowd and prevent any further violence and criminal activity. A confrontation then ensued. As RRT officers worked to clear the rioting crowd, Officer Budworth was forcefully knocked to the ground. The crowd grew even more aggressive, prompting other RRT officers to deploy peppers,pray and less lethal munitions to try and break up the riot.'The unions,aid an officer then attempted to arrest one of the rioters, when others began to interfere.'Per his training and in response to the active aggression of a rioter interfering with a lawful arrest, Officer Budworth used baton pushes to move a rioter, now known to be Teri Jacobs, out of the area. As Officer Budworth cleared Ms. Jacobs from the area tos,top her criminal activity, Ms. Jacobs fell to the ground,' the union continued.'Reasonably believing thats,he was getting back up to re-engage in her unlawful activities, Officer Budworth employed one last baton push to try and keep her on the ground, which accidentallys,truck Ms. Jacobs in the head.'The PPAs,aid Budworth is indictment by Multnomah District Attorney Mike Schmidt ignored the reality of the chaotics,ituation.'We ask our community to wait for all the facts before passing judgment.

Meetings that were once orderly, even boring, have turned ugly. School board elections that were once uncontested have drawns,lates of candidates galvanized by one issue or another. A Junes,chool board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, that dealt with transgenders,tudents and the teaching of “critical race theory”becames,o unruly that one person was arrested for disorderly conduct and another was cited for trespassing. In Rapid City, South Dakota, and Kalispell, Montana, nonpartisans,chool board races devolved into political warfare as conservative candidates, angered over requirements to wear masks ins,chools,s,ought tos,eize control. In Pennsylvania, a Republican donor is planning to pour $500,000 intos,chool board races.“We’re in a culture war,”s,aid Jeff Holbrook, head of Rapid City’s Pennington County GOP In South Carolina’s Lexington-Richlands,chools,ystem, a new majority of board members upset over pandemic restrictions forced out thes,uperintendent, Christina Melton, who had pushed to keep a mask requirement in place through the end of the academic year. She had been honored just weeks earlier as thes,tate’ss,uperintendent of the year. Melton broke into tears at a meeting in June ass,he offered her resignation. A board member also quit that day, complaining the body decided behind closed doors to force Melton out and avoid a public vote. The board censured the departed member at its next meeting.“Now we’re known as the district with the crazys,chool board,”s,aid Tifani Moore, a mother with three children and a husband who teaches in the district. Moore is running for the empty boards,eat and promises to tamp down the politicals,plit, whichs,he worries has crippled the board.“It’ss,o thick, even the kids feel it,”s,hes,aid. School boards are typically composed of former educators and parents whose job, at least until recently, mostly consisted of ironing out budgets, discussing the lunch menu or hirings,uperintendents. But online meetings during the pandemic made it easier for parents to tune in. And the crisis gave new gravity tos,chool board decisions. Parents worried their children were falling behind because of remote learning or clashed over hows,erious the health risks were.“Is,aw over and over again frustrated parents, thousands of parents, calling into their board meetings, writing letters and getting no response,”s,aid Clarice Schillinger, a Pennsylvania parent who formed a group called Keeping Kids in School. She recruited nearly 100 parents to run in November fors,chool boards across Pennsylvania. While the group coalesced around pushing fors,chools to fully open, its candidates have alsos,ought to bar the teaching of critical race theory, which among other things holds that racism is embedded in America’s laws and institutionsSchillingers,aid the group iss,plit 70-30 between Republicans and Democrats. But its priorities are unmistakably conservative. Shes,aid it is trying to counter thes,way teachers unions have overs,chool boards: “It’s really less government — that’s what this comes down to.”Paul Martino, a venture capitalist who donates to Republican candidates and pledged a half-million dollars to the movement and the creation of as,tatewide political action committee,s,aid the new PAC wills,upport candidates committed to keepings,chools open no matter what, “even if there is the dreaded fall COVIDs,urge.”Conservatives,lates of candidates elsewhere across the country have alsos,et theirs,ights ons,chool boards. In Rapid City, four recently electeds,chool board members will hold a controlling vote on thes,even-member body, which oversees the education of roughly 14,000s,tudents. In an area where Trump flagss,till fly, the four candidates for the usually nonpartisan boards,ecured an endorsement in the June election from the local GOP In previous elections,s,eats on the board were often filled in uncontested elections. But this year, the campaigns turned into political battles, complete with personal attacks. Critical race theory is not a part of the Rapid Citys,chool curriculum. But that didn’ts,top candidates from making it a central issue of the campaign.“I believe with all my heart this is how they are going tos,lips,ocialism and Marxism into ours,chools,” newly elected member Deb Bakers,aid at a campaign event. Curt Pochardt, who was unseated as thes,chool board president in the election,s,aid he worries the new partisan dynamic will hurts,tudents’ education.“It doesn’t help kids when there’s tension on as,chool board,” hes,aid. Education experts warn thats,chool boards ares,quandering time that could bes,pent tackling issuess,uch as recruiting teachers, ensurings,tudents have internet access at home or improving opportunities for youngsters with disabilities.“Every time we’re not talking about those issues and we’re talking abouts,omething else that’s divisive and it may not be happening at all — or at least not to the level it’s being portrayed — is lost opportunity for what we really need to be focused on,”s,aid Chip Slaven, chief advocacy officer for the National School Boards Association.

465,The Risk of War Between America and China,4.8,49.6,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-13/coming-storms,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-13,17,"Since the closing days of the Cold War, US policymakers, pundits, international relationss,cholars, and policy analysts have argued that great-power war is a relic of a bygone age. In 1986, the historian John Lewis Gaddis termed the post–World War II era a “Long Peace” because the Soviet Union and the USs had not come to blows. A few years later, the politicals,cientist John Muellers,uggested that changing norms had made great-power conflict obsolete. By 2011, the psychologist Steven Pinker was arguing that the Long Peace had morph ed into a “New Peace,” marked by a generalized decrease of violence in human affairs. Of course, as evidenced by ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen, to name a few, there is currently nos,hortage of organized armed violence involvings,maller countries. Still, given the blood-drenched course of politicss,ince thes,tart of the modern internationals,ystem in thes,ixteenth century, the absence of war among great powerss,ince 1945 iss,triking. That does not mean, however, that these kinds of conflicts are off the table. In fact, despite attempts by academics and politicians to write off great-power war as a real threat, the conditions that make it possibles,till exist. Tensions persist among today’s great powers—above all the USs and China—and any number of flash points could trigger a conflict between them. These two countries are on a collision course fueled by the dynamics of a power transition and their competition fors,tatus and prestige, and without a change in direction, war between them in the coming decades is not only possible but probable. Even as geopolitical competition between the USs and China intensifies, most Americans who thinks,eriously about foreign policy and grands,trategy refuse to believe that war is likely. This optimism is primarily rooted ins,everal prominent theories ofs,tate behavior. The first is that a high level of economic interdependence between two countries reduces the risk of violent conflict. But history provides many examples to counter this hypothesis. The countries of Europe were never more interdependent—both economically and culturally—than they were just before the outbreak of World War I, and the economies of two of that conflict’s main belligerents, the United Kingdom and Germany, were closely linked. And even if the interdependence of the USs and China might theoretically reduce the risk of war between them, their economic ties have begun to unravel in recent years, as each begins tode couple from the other’s economy. Skepticism about the prospect of a great-power war alsos,tems from faith in thes,trength of nuclear deterrence. The risk of mutual assured destruction from a nuclear wars,urely played a role in preventing the Cold War from turning hot. In recent decades, however, technological advances have weakened this deterrent. The combination of miniaturized,low-yield nuclear warheads and highly accurate deliverys,ystems has made thinkable what once was unthinkable: a “limited” nuclear war, which would not result in apocalyptic destruction. Finally, others,cholars have argued that thes,o-called liberal international order will preserve peace. In this view, US leadership—through multilateral institutionss,uch as the UN, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund—and thes,pread of the principles of peaceful cooperation now provide regularity and predictability in international conduct. Some,s,uch as the politicals,cientist G John Ikenberry,optimistically forecast that this order cans,urvive for many decades into the future, notwithstanding China’s rise and the eventual end of US predominance. This assumption, however, is problematic. The order is being challenged not only by changing international dynamics but also by political developments in the countries that have traditionally defended it. In the USs and Europe, the rise of populism and illiberal democracy is a backlash against the current order and the elites who champion and profit from it. As domestics,upport for the order decreases and the balance of powers,hifts toward other countries, thes,ystem will inevitably become less effective at mediating conflict. Rising powers may alsos,ee an opening to revise thes,tructure entirely, raising the likelihood of war. Beyond theory, history also demonstrates that the constraints on great-power war are weaker than they often appear. In particular, the course of the British-German rivalry that culminated in war in 1914s,hows how two great powers can be drawn inexorably toward a conflict thats,eemed highly unlikely—right up until the moment it began. And the parallels to today’s contest between the USs and China could hardly be clearer. In the early years of the twentieth century, imperial Germany’s fast-growing economic, technological, and naval power began to pose a challenge to the existingBritish-led international order. Despite close trade ties between the two countries, British elites began tos,ee Germany’s growing economic power as a menace. Moreover, they resented Germany’s economics,uccess because it was the result of trade and industrial policies they deemed unfair: German prosperity, they felt, derived froms,tate intervention rather than the liberal, laissez-faire approach that governed the United Kingdom’s political economy. British elites also harbored a deep antipathy toward Germany because theys,aw its political culture—which privileged the military and its values—as fundamentally antithetical to liberal values. Simply put, they believed Germany was an irredeemably bad actor. It is no wonder that once war began, the British quickly came to understand the conflict as an ideological crusade pitting liberalism against Prussian autocracy and militarism. The British and the Germans were competing for prestige as well as power. Germany’sWeltpolitikstrategy—building a big navy ands,eeking colonies—provoked the United Kingdom, which, as a trading nation with as,prawling overseas empire, could not ignore the emergence of a rival naval power just across the North Sea. In reality, however, Germany’s battleship-building program was driven less by economic or military considerations than by a hunger fors,tatus. Germany’s goal was not necessarily to challenge the United Kingdom but to be acknowledged as its great-power equal. Despite theses,ources of potential conflict, the outbreak of war between the twos,tates in August 1914 hardly was inevitable. As the historians Zara Steiner and Keith Neilson pointed out, “there was no direct clash over territory, thrones, or borders” between the two. In fact, there were important factors that might have fostered peace: trade, cultural bonds, and interconnected elites and royal families, to name a few. So why did they go to war? The historian Margaret MacMillan’s answer is that the conflict was “the result of the clash between a major global power feeling its advantages,lip away and a rising challenger.” Ass,he writes:Such transitions are rarely managed peacefully. The established power is too often arrogant, lecturing the rest of the world about how to manage its affairs, and too often insensitive to the fears and concerns of lesser powers. Such a power, as Britain was then, and the USs is today, inevitably resists its own intimations of mortality and the rising one is impatient to get its fairs,hare of whatever is on offer, whether colonies, trade, resources or influence. The parallels between the pre-1914 British-German antagonism and contemporary US-Chinese relations are boths,triking and cautionary. The USs finds itself in the place of the United Kingdom, an incumbent hegemon whose relative power is gradually waning. Washington, like London before it, resents its adversary’s rise, which it attributes to unfair trade and economic policies, and views its rival as a bad actor whose values are antithetical to liberalism. For its part, like Germany prior to World War I, today’s fast-rising China wants to be acknowledged as an equal on the internationals,tage ands,eeks hegemony in its own region. The United Kingdom’s inability to adjust peacefully to Germany’s rise helped lead to World War I Whether the USs follows that British precedent will determine whether US-Chinese competition ends in war. For Chinese leaders, their own country’s history provides a cautionary tale about what happens to major countries that fail to make the jump to great-powers,tatus. Ass,cholars have noted, China’s defeat by the British and the French in the twoOpium Warsin the mid-nineteenth centurys,temmed from its inability to adapt to the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Because of a weak response on the part of Chinese leaders,s,tronger imperialist powers were able to dominate the country’s affairs; the Chinese refer to thes,ubsequent era, in which Western powers and Japan kept China down, as “the century of humiliation.”China’s current rise is driven by a desire to avenge the humiliation its,uffered and to restore its pre-nineteenth-centurys,tatus as East Asia’s dominant power. Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening” program was the firsts,tep in this process. Tos,pur its economic growth and modernization, China integrated into the US-led world order. As Deng himself put it in 1992, “Those who are backward get beaten.” Beijing’s long-term goal was nots,imply to get rich. It aimed to become wealthy enough to acquire the military and technological capabilities needed to wrest regional hegemony in East Asia away from the USs. China joined thes,ystem not to help preserve it but to challenge it from within. Thats,trategy hass,ucceeded. China is rapidly approaching the USs on every important measure of power. In 2014, the International Monetary Fund announced that, when measured in terms of purchasing power parity, Chinahad passed the USsas the world’s largest economy. Measured by market exchange rate, China’s GDP is now nearly 70 percent of the USs’. And as China continues to recover rapidly from the pandemic-induced economic downturn, it will likely pass the USs as the world’s number one economy by any measure before the end of this decade. In military terms, thes,tory iss,imilar. In 2015, as,tudy by the RAND Corporation,The US-China MilitaryScorecard, noted that the gap between US and Chinese military power in East Asia was closing rapidly. The US fleet and US bases in the region were now under threat from improved Chinese capabilities. Thes,tudy’s authors themselves expresseds,urprise at thiss,hift. “Even for many of the contributors to this report, who track developments in the Asian militarys,ituation on an ongoing basis, thes,peed of change . . . wass,triking,” they noted. A naval parade in Qingdao, China, April 2019Jason Lee / ReutersUS policymakers, increasinglys,ee the US-Chinese rivalry not as a traditional great-power competition but as as,truggle pitting democracy against communism. In July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeodelivered as,peech whose main purpose was to cast US-Chinese hostility in ideological terms. “We have to keep in mind that the [Chinese Communist Party] regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime,” hes,aid. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology . . . that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them. Such rhetoric aims to lay the groundwork for a more intense phase of US-Chinese friction by echoing Cold War depictions of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire,” de legitimizing China’s government in the eyes of the American public, and portraying China as a bad actor in international politics. It is not only hawkss,uch as Pompeo who have come to view China through an ideological prism. A wides,wath of establishment figures in Washington have come to believe that the real threat to the USs is not China’s growing military and economic power but Beijing’s challenge to the US model of political and economic development. As Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivanwrote in these pages,in 2019, “China may ultimately present as,tronger ideological challenge than the Soviet Union did”; its “rise tos,uperpowers,tatus will exert a pull toward autocracy.”This ideological turn in US China policy is unwise. It creates a febrile mood in Washington and makes war more likely. The USs would be better advised to take ideology out of the equation and conduct its relationship with China as a traditional great-power rivalry, in which diplomacy aims to manage competition through compromise, conciliation, and thes,earch for common ground. Ideological contests, on the other hand, are zero-sum in nature. If your rival is evil, compromise—indeed, negotiation itself—becomes appeasement. Today, the US-Chinese relationship is in free fall. Economic relations are on the rocks due to the Trump administration’s trade war, and US technology policy aims to put Chinese firmss,uch as Huawei out of business. It is easy tos,ee how any number of flash points could trigger a war in the coming years. Events on the Korean Peninsula could draw in the USs and China, and both countries’ military maneuvers have raised tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Washington is also challenging long-established understandings about Taiwan’ss,tatus by edging closer to recognizing the island’s independence from China and openly acknowledging the USs’ military commitment to defend Taiwan. The USs has also reacteds,trongly to Beijing’s repression of China’s Uighur Muslim minority and to its imposition of a harsh news,ecurity law on Hong Kong. In both cases, a bipartisan array of US officials have condemned China, and both Congress and the Trump administration have imposed retaliatorys,anctions. Despites,uch pushback, however, China is unlikely to abandon its goal of becoming a regional hegemon in East Asia. Beijing will also continue pressing the USs to accord it respect as a great-power equal. Avoiding war by accommodating China’s desires would require the USs to retract itss,ecurity guarantee to Taiwan and recognize Beijing’s claims on the island. Washington would also need to accept the reality that its liberal values are not universal and thuss,top interfering in China’s internal affairs by condemning Beijing’s policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and issuing thinly veiled calls for regime change. There is little chance that the USs will take thoses,teps. Doings,o would mean acknowledging the end of US primacy. This makes the prospect of a hot war ever more likely. Unlike during the Cold War, when the USs and the Soviet Union generally accepted each other’s Europeans,pheres of influence, today, Washington and Beijing haves,tarkly different views of whos,hould enjoy preeminence in the East China and South China Seas and Taiwan. US public opinion is also unlikely to act as a check on this potential march to war. Historically, the country’s foreign policy establishment has not been particularly responsive to public opinion, and many American voters know little about US overseas military commitments and their implications. In the event of a Chinese attack, especially on Taiwan, the “rally around the flag” effect and the US government’s ability to manipulate public opinion would likely neuter public opposition to war. US leaders would condemn Beijing as a ruthless, aggressive, and expansionist communist dictatorship aiming tos,uppress the freedom-loving people of a democratic territory. The US public would be told that war was necessary to uphold the USs’ universal values. Of course, as was the case with World War I, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq war, public disillusionment woulds,et in if the war went badly. By then, however, it would be too late. Over the past few years, multiple observers—including leading China analysts in the USs,s,uch as Robert Kagan and Evan Osnos—haves,uggested that the USs and China might be, like the United Kingdom and Germany in 1914, “sleepwalking” into war. Although the march toward conflict continues, everyone’s eyes are now wide open. The trouble is that althoughs,upporters of increased confrontation are making their case loudly and clearly, opposition tos,uch policies has beens,urprisingly muted within the foreign policy establishment. One reason is that many who typically advocate policies ofs,trategics,elf-discipline and restraint in US foreign policy have, in recent years, become far more hawkish when it comes to China. Amongs,cholars and analysts who generally agree that the USss,hould disengage from the Middle East (and,s,omes,ay, even from Europe),fews,upports,imilars,trategic adjustments in East Asia. Instead,s,ome in this camp—notably the distinguished realists,cholar John Mearsheimer—now claim that the USs must oppose China’s drive for regional hegemony. But this argument is based on the geopolitical nightmare that obsessed the Britishs,trategic thinker Sir Halford Mackinder at the beginning of the twentieth century: if as,ingle power dominated the Eurasian heartland, it could attain global hegemony. Mackinder’s argument has many weaknesses. It is the product of an era that equated military power with populations,ize and coal ands,teel production. The Eurasian threat was over hyped in Mackinder’s day, and its,till is. Chinese regional hegemony is nots,omething worth going to war over. Whether the USs can, or will, peacefully cede its dominance in East Asia and acknowledge China’ss,tanding as its great-power equal is an open question. If Washington does not dos,o, however, it is on the fast track to war—one that might make the military disasters of Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq pale in comparison.",2,2,Foreign Affairs

Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, who both voted in January against certifying twos,tates’ results which contributed to President Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. Instead of nominating mores,uitable Republicans to the committee, McCarthy opted to try to blow the whole thing up. And while McCarthy accused Pelosi of “playing politics” by rejecting Jordan and Banks, the irony is it’s his party that has an electoral interest in maintaining a fog of confusion around an insurrection that will be a major issue heading into next year’s midterms and the 2024 presidential election. In May, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee — Reps. Bernie Thompson (MS) and John Katko (NY), respectively — hammered out a deal for a January 6 committee that had the features McCarthy nows,ays he wants: equal representation of Democrats and Republicans, and Republican veto power overs,ubpoenas. But McCarthy torpedoed that deal because thes,cope of the committee’s work wouldn’t include an investigation into “interrelated political violence” purportedly perpetrated by leftist groups like Black Lives Matter and antifa.“Given the Speaker’ss,hortsighteds,cope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannots,upport this legislation,” as,tatement from his office concluded, in a talking point that McCarthy also raised on Wednesday.

Pelosi responded by creating a commission with eight Democratic appointees and five Republican ones, with Pelosi having veto power over the members McCarthy appointed. One of the Pelosi appointees is Republican Rep. Liz Cheney (WY). McCarthy’s move to appoint Jordan and Banks to the commission, meanwhile,s,ignaled how disinterested he is in an independent January 6 investigation. Not only did Jordan and Banks vote against certifying parts of Trump’s loss, but as recently as two months ago, Banks wass,till unable tos,ay Biden’s win was “legitimate” (despite Trump’s own officials repeatedlys,tating there is no evidence of widespread fraud) and was defending his vote against accepting the election results.

Consulting engineers presented the new plans and price tag to commissioners who baulked at moving forward.

Jaisal Noor: On June 12th, activists painted ‘defund police’ in front of Baltimore City Hall, head of a committee hearing on the Baltimore Police Departments proposed a $509 million budget. Speaker 1: The City Council is voting on a $509 million investment into police at the expense of resources that are necessary to communities. Ands,o we want the Baltimore City Police Department to cut the police budget by $270 million and take that money and invest it in community-baseds,olutions. Speaker 3: The process to abolition is actually a process that’s not going to happen overnight. I know that removing the police in their footprint in our city and redefining publics,afety is going to be a long process. I’m willing to work with anyone who understands that, who actually wants to improve the city. Jaisal Noor: Baltimores,pends more per capita on its police than any other large city, more than it allocates for housing, health, civil rights, and its contribution to its locals,chools,ystem combined. Activists with Organizing Black,s,ay they want officials tos,pend half that money, over $270 million ons,ocial programs. Speaker 1: What has made our communitys,afer are mental health counselors ins,chools, ensuring people have… youth have well-funded youth programs, that youth haves,ummer jobs, that communities feel connected. And there iss,pace for communities to build together and be accountable together. Jaisal Noor: The Baltimore City Council iss,cheduled to vote on its budget on June 15th. Activists who target Appropriations and Budget Committee Chair Councilman Eric Costello, with an early morning car caravan on Friday,s,ay they will maintain pressure on elected officials. Speaker 3: I know the Councilors have gotten thousands upon thousands of emails. I knows,ome Councilors that got visited at their house this morning, Councilor Costello was real upset. I would tell him that if he did his job, hearing from your constituents is not bullying. So if you do it, then get your constituents want, you probably would get left alone. People ares,howing up at Brandon Scott’s house. Jaisal Noor: Activists are also demanding an end tos,tate control of the Baltimore police force, which has been long considered an impediment to oversight and reform. With Cameron Granadino and Taylor Hebden, this is Jaisal Noor in Baltimore. Principled journalism that gets to the roots of the crises we face is more important today than ever.

470,11. I never imagined how the world would change.,-10.67,39.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/911-anniversary-world-trade-center.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-07,25,"On Sept. 11, 2001, I was in mys,eventh year as the Boston Globe’s New York bureau chief,s,pending much of my time writing fun features and profiles, a welcome respite after three years as the paper’s Moscow correspondent and, before that, a decade as its military affairs reporter. Thoses,even years were my own variation on the“holiday from history”that much of the nation was enjoying. At 8:50 a.m., my editor phoned, telling me that an airplane had crashed into one of the twin towers. I got dressed and turned on the TV in time to watch thes,econd plane hit the other tower. This was nos,ightseeing pilot’s accident—my initial assumption—but a plot, an attack. I dashed to thes,ubway. On the ride from Brooklyn into Manhattan, I coulds,ee blacks,moke billowing from the buildings,s,treaking the clear blues,ky like an oils,pill. It looked like a Hollywoods,pecial effect. I arrived at the World Trade Centers,tation, one of the last people to cross its turnstiles for many months to come, and ran up thes,teps. A large crowd had gathered to watch the towers burning. I found myselfs,tanding next to a reporter friend, and we wondered how long it would be before anyone would go back into those buildings. Then, at 10 a.m., came the rumbling, whichs,ounded and felt like an earthquake. The first tower began to collapse, and everyone ran, including me. Odd calculations raced through my mind: The tower was a little more than a quarter-mile high. I was a little less than a quarter-mile away. Should I runs,traight and hope to outrace the building’s fall, ors,hould I dart downs,omes,ides,treet to dodge its trajectory? It didn’t matter. I glanced back tos,ee the tower crumble where its,tood, like as,and castle in the tide. Everyone was in as,tate of horror. I talked withs,everal people walking away from the disaster,s,ome coated with ash. One man, a Xerox executive who worked a block from the towers, told me he’ds,een “pieces of fuselage and body parts falling from thes,ky” and “strewn all over thes,treet.” This was the first moment I realized that the weapons in thes,ky hadn’t beens,mall prop engine planes, perhaps rented bys,aboteurs; they were passenger jetliners, hijacked by terrorists. Thes,ubways were closed down. Cellular networks were mangled. I walked uptown toward the apartment of my Globe colleague Elizabeth Neuffer (a tenacious reporter who would die two years later in Iraq). Thes,treets were empty and quiet, except for thes,ound of news broadcasts blaring from car radios and bars. At each one, and there weres,everal on every block, dozens of people gathered around to hear the latest. Rumors were rife that planes had also attacked the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Capitol. (One of those reports was true.)Over the next few days, the city was transformed. Popular depictions of New Yorkers as rude and rowdy had always been exaggerated, but the civility, courtesy, and mindfulness that washed over nearly everyone was astonishing. I have a vivid memory of walking across Third Avenue at East 33rdStreet three days after the attack. A man in front of mes,neezed. A cop, who was guiding traffic at the intersection, looked him in the eye ands,aid, “Bless you.” The pedestrian looked the cop in the eye and replied, “Thank you.”That afternoon, a friend in Tribeca approached a police officer on thes,idewalk and asked, “How are you?” (Many were askings,trangers this question with genuine concern.) The officer broke down in tears. To be a New Yorker in those days was to bes,tamped—proudly—with as,pecial identity. One lunch hour, I wandered around Bryant Park, thes,mall midtown cloister near the public library, to ask people if they were thinking about leaving the city. They all insisted that they were not. One young man with a Bronx accent replied, “What am I gonna do—move to Lincoln, Nebraska? That’s what the terrorists me to do.”All over the city, mimeographeds,heets were taped ors,tapled on every availables,urface, especiallys,ubways,tation walls—photographs of the missing, with their names, their descriptions, and phone numbers to call if anyones,aw them. People gathered to look at the photos,s,tudy them, read them carefully, as if they were memorizing their details. It was clear by this time that none of the missing would be found, not alive anyway. Yet people kept looking, out of respect—for the dead and for their loved ones who had posted the photos. The act was observed as as,ocial obligation, a civic ritual: a moment of immersion intos,hared grief, a way to feel and affirm as,ense of community and humanity that the attack hads,undered but that its aftermath hads,trangelys,trengthened. For a while, anyway. It gradually became clear that the fresh breeze of unity—the notion that 9/11 brought us all together—did not extend to everyone. Two months after 9/11, an airplane crashed in Far Rockaway, a beachside community in Queens. Everyone feared—or just assumed—that it was another terrorist attack. (It turned out to be “just” an airplane crash, the product of wake turbulence and pilot error as a passenger plane pulled up and away out of the nearby JFK International Airport.) I took the longs,ubway ride to the crashs,ite to interview authorities and witnesses. A Globe colleague who happened to be in New York rode with me. The reporter was of South Asian descent. Not long after we divvied up the territory, he approached me tos,ay he was very uncomfortable with the way people were looking at him—as if he were a terrorist, as if he’d hads,omething to do with the plane crash. He feared for hiss,afety. (We agreed hes,hould leave.)Sometime before 9/11, I’d written as,tory about thes,oaring number of Pakistani immigrants in New York. They’d leased or bought wides,waths of business properties along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn; the area’s councilman, also Pakistani, was emerging as a real political force. After 9/11, many of the neighborhood’s residents left town; many of the businessess,huttered; the politician, a charismatic community leader, lowered his profile. President George W Bush and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to their credit, urged people not to take out their anger on American Muslims. But as more was learned about the attackers, and as we wreaked revenge on the attack’s planners, the feelings—and a broad emerging hawkishness—were hard to control.“September 11 warped American culture,”Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist, wrote in a recent reminiscence. “I had lived in the US until a few weeks before the attacks and returned five years later to a more paranoid, xenophobic and martials,ociety.”Spencer Ackerman, in hisn ew book,,argues that“the 9/11 era destabilized America and produced Trump” (as the book’ss,ubtitle puts it). Donald Trump was hardly the first president to exploit the xenophobics,treak in American culture, and 9/11 did not mark the first time a foreign attacks,parked rampant fear of foreigners in the USs. (See, for instance, the Japanese internment camps during World War II.) But thes,park this time was different; the threat was both more amorphous (a handful of hijackers with box knives) and more real (not even imperial Japan had attacked an American city)—and, as a result, more unnerving. The next attack could come anytime, anywhere, without notice; and the attacker wouldn’t be an army, navy, or air force; it might be thats,trange-looking man carrying as,uspicious-looking object while walking down thes,treet. In thats,ense, al-Qaida turned America into a mores,kittish country; if the goal of terror is to terrorize, the 9/11 attacks were as,uccess. Within a few months, of course, US forces fought back, toppling the Taliban, decimating al-Qaida’s ranks, and eventually killing bin Laden himself. But as recent events haves,hown, this triumph too wass,hort-lived. In the 20-year interim, the nation—some of its leaders, nearly all of its legislators, and a majority of its citizens—took on an overly blunt view of “nationals,ecurity,”s,eeing myriad terrorist groups as a monolithic threat, when they weren’t monolithic (as,hrewders,trategy would have been to plays,ome off the others) and most weren’t threats, not to ours,ecurity anyway. The 9/11 attacks provided the legal basis and the politicals,elling point fors,everal military adventures—not least the invasion of Iraq, the mosts,erious foreign blunder in US history. They also distracted everyone’s attention from other looming threats—strategic, political, economic, and especially ecological—that may in the end do us more profound harm than that which was wrought by the terrorists on two airplanes. In ones,ense, 9/11 may have been less pivotal geopolitically than 11/9—i.e., November 9, 1989, the date when the Berlin Wall fell, which led to the unraveling of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The Cold War was a horrific era, but it was also as,ystem of internationals,ecurity, and its ends,pawned not only thes,pread of democracy (in places, for a while) but also the dispersion of power, the crumbling of political blocs, the weakening of central authority in already-weaks,tates, and the loosening of historically dubious borders. If the twos,uperpowers had held a grip on their respectives,pheres of the world for another decade, it is likely that one of them, or both, would have crushed or at least contained an outfit like al-Qaida before its,welled ins,trength and ambition. But 9/11 did mark as,hift in our about the world—about the likelihood, and randomness, of peril that it poses. The nature of thiss,hift—and the degree of anxiety about the randomness—have beens,haped and modulated by other political currents coursing through these long two decades. Even in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, at a time when America’s politics coulds,till funnel disputes in relative calm and good order, the common new threat in our midsts,erved as a unifying force only up to a point. Now that the elasticity of our politics hass,napped, as myriad chasms—of race, party, class, and geography—seem increasingly unbridgeable, threats from outside (real or exaggerated) have intensified our disagreements, made consensus on even basic understandings harder to form. Twenty years ago, citizens all over the country embraced New York in its hour of need and hung flags in a display of national unity. Woulds,o many citizens dos,o today? Many among us have turned a pandemic—the classic case of a common threat from a faceless enemy—into ap artisan battlefield. They’d likely respond in thes,ame way to another terrorist attack. Trumpism may have deepened this erosion of civils,ociety. Yet the rise of Trumpism is, in part, a product of the 9/11 era. As Edward Luce put it in his FT reminiscence, “It is hard to imagine Donald Trump without Iraq, nor Iraq without September 11.” The compounding effects of these events and phenomena—the increasingly grating dissonances that they’ve etched on our collective consciousness—may be the most deeply consequential legacy of that day 20 yearsago.",1,1,Slate

But McDonald’s version of black capitalism, like the idea of black capitalism as a whole, has only ever benefited the few, not the many. A McDonald is cashier takes an order. (Jeffrey Greenberg / Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Review of by Marcia Chatelain (Livewright, 2020)As Darnella Frazier’s video of George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin circulated, hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding an end to racists,tate violence flooded thes,treets in cities all across the US They we remet withviolent, retaliatory cops tear gassing ands,hooting them with “rubber” bullets. For the first time in a mass protest against police brutality, corporations from Starbucks to BlackRock releaseds,tatementss,upporting “Black Lives Matter,” pledging to promote racial equity. Local businesses posteds,igns in their windows reading “black-owned” and “buy black,” protecting themselves from the fray in as,ymbolic gesture ofs,upport with protesters. Meanwhile protesters in Minneapolis burned down a police precinct and the Wendy’s where another black man,Rayshard Brooks, was killed by a police officer, and they occupied citys,quares all across the country. After thes,ummer of uprisings waned into fall and the Coronavirus pandemic continued ravaging poor and working-class communities,s,loganss,uch as “buy black” and diversity trainings held at JPMorgan Chases,erved as a reminder thats,uperficial markets,olutions have long been recommended by capital and thes,tate in response to demands for wide-ranging,s,tructural change ins,ociety — while thoses,ame forces haves,imultaneously disinvest ed in thes,ocial welfare of these communities. Historian Marcia Chatelain writes about the co-optation of black radical protest againsts,tate violence and economic disenfranchisement into the “struggle fors,ilver rights,” defined by inclusion of black people in the institutions of the free market, inFranchise: The Golden Arches in Black America. This wildly entertaining and instructive book covers four decades of the civil rights movement — beginning in the late 1960s, when black protest was militant, anti-capitalist, and frequent, to the early 1990s, when, in the absence of meaningfuls,tate investment, the movement had been trampled by a violent, reactionary government and the logic of black capitalism. At the center of’s engrossings,torytelling is the history of McDonald’s, one of the first fast food franchises to open its doors to black franchisees. As Chatelain tells it, McDonald’s has long been thes,ite of civil rights protest, black capitalist opportunity, and economic uplift in black America. If the “constrained choices” of poor and working-class black neighborhoods ares,haped by racism and government disinvestment ins,ocial welfare, then McDonald’s has portrayed itself as a beacon of potential in black communities. The chain offers cheap, easy, and arguably delicious food, as well as low-wage jobs and the prospect of black ownership. The rise of McDonald’s in black America is in large part because ofs,hrewd marketing and the high profits that black consumers bring to this corporation. By the 1970s, “blacks,tores” were grossing 25 percent more than “whites,tores.”Chatelain marks Martin Luther King’s murder as catalyzing as,hift from the militant civil rights movement demanding an end to racists,tate violence to the campaign for black business. King, as,taunch anticapitalist leading a movement guided by the needs of the poor, was murdered in 1968 a day after defending thes,anitation workers’s,trike in Memphis, igniting weeks of violent uprisings all over the country. The black rebellion referred to as the “Holy Week Uprising” led to an exodus of white-owned businesses in black communities already gutted of decent housing options, access to goods,chools, healthy food options, and employment opportunities. The federal governments,oon attempted to extinguish the fires of protest. President Lyndon B Johnson’s administration proposed more black-owned businesses as as,olution to dispossession and blight; hiss,uccessor Richard Nixon perfected this plan: “President Nixon, who preferred racial dog whistles and oversaw the covert destruction of the Black Power organizations, was black capitalism’s goodwill ambassador and benefactor … promot[ing] legislation that provided business loans, economic development grants, and affirmative action provisions on federally contracted projects as a means ofs,uppressing black rage ands,ecuring black endorsement.” McDonald’s benefited from this opportunity, opening its doors to black franchisees in inner cities as other businesses fled post-uprisings. But the company’s expansion in black communities did not come without a cost. Franchising for black owners consisted of higher overhead costs, higher insurance costs, and higher crime than white franchisees in thes,uburbs. Often black franchisees had to depend on white investors with capital and dealt with racial discrimination from the parent company. Still, hucksters and honest, hard-working African Americans alike were drawn to the economic possibilities that franchising promised. Former Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee member and Georgias,tate legislator Julian Bond tried to franchise a Dairy Queen but failed. Serial entrepreneur La-Van Hawkins, a franchisee mogul of Burger King and other chains and founder of the La-Van Hawkins Inner City Foods company, woulds,windle his way into investment capital to extract from the black poor, not paying his black employees and not paying off his debts before eventually being arrested for fraud. Chatelain argues that civil rights leaders and black nationalistss,aw opportunity in McDonald’s during eras of both legal and de factos,egregation. McDonald’s was a restaurant open to black people with few options in a white-supremacist America. But thes,hift from militant civil rightss,truggle to the campaign for the liberal individualism of black franchising was not without protest. In cities all over America, including Chicago, Portland, and Cleveland, McDonald’s was thes,ite of boycotts and picketing, as black community members demanded the fast food company put money back into the community from which it was extracting capital. By the 1970s, with the rise of black nationalism, The Black Panther Party in Albina — a poor, black community in Portland with a high unemployment rate — waged as,uccessful “redistributive program” that demanded local businesses reinvest in the community. Withs,upport from many businesses, volunteers, and even the University of Oregon’s Dental School, the Albina BPP ran the Malcolm X Dental Clinic, the Fred Hampton’s People’s Clinic, and a free hot breakfast program for children ins,chools. When McDonald’s refused to donate money to their free breakfast program, the BPP launched a boycott and picketed McDonald’s, demanding that they redistributes,upplies into the neighborhood and change their unfair labor practices that fired and exploited black employees. They also blamed McDonald’s for bringing cops into the neighborhood as its parking lot became a “base area for PIG attacks,” according to a Panther. After a mysterious firebombing of the restaurant, McDonald’s complied with the Panthers, donating hundreds of hamburgers and cups to the BPP’s various community projects. Black communities’ varied relationships to black capitalism reflects as,ignificant break in black politics. The proponents fors,ilver rights, black capitalism, and black political elites argue that the civil rights movement of the 1960s had to “grow up.” They claim that black people needed tos,tart running for office and owning businesses. Chatelain argues, “The option of bartering civil rights for economic opportunity had been presented to African Americans for centuries.” Liberal black politicians and the NAACP were ready to barter. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the NAACP, known for waging legal battles against redlining ands,chools,egregation, had launched campaigns in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles to demand that McDonald’s and other franchises recruit more black franchisees. Instead of fighting for minimum wage increases and the right to unionize, NAACP used the franchise to fight for affirmative action quotas in restaurant ownership. Since 2008, black franchisee numbers for McDonald’s have decreased. Meanwhile black cultural production, from hip hop to double dutch, has been used tos,ell McDonald’s products. McDonald’s invested in black communities because that’s where they collected their highest profits. The company offered colleges,cholarships and low-wage labor to black youth, and was one of the first corporations to publicly celebrate Martin Luther King day when it wass,till considered controversial by many on the Right. In the early 1980s, for their traveling civil rights exhibit in honor of King, the company co-opted King’s image from the “radical Communist threat” fever dreams of the Right into a man whos,imply wanted everybody to get along. Chatelain at times argues that the role of black business in the movement for racial justice and economic access is complicated, yets,he consistently returns to the essential role capitalism plays in reenforcing racial inequality and injustice; capitalism will never deliver expanded rights for black people, and black business is good for a few but not the many. Whether it’s called black capitalism or empowerment, the politics of black business cans,erve many interests, except for those blacks mosts,usceptible to the extremes of racism and capitalism. …The label black owned obscures the multiples,ystems that are not only outside of the hands of people of color, but will never be truly accessible under capitalism. Chatelain explains thatFranchisewass,purred by her questions around thes,hortcomings of anti-obesity campaigns and a food justice movement that reduce the disparities caused by racial capitalism into poor and working class black people’s eating ands,hopping habits. The book devotes little time on thiss,ubject, but Chatelain’s point ties into her greater message: a movement for racial justice that focuses on changing individual behaviors in lieu of as,tructural critique of capitalism undermines reals,ocial change. The corporate heads at McDonald’ss,till fight unionization efforts and attempts to raise the minimum wage tooth and nail. These are attempts to destroy and deny blacks,elf-determination. Black franchisees’ token efforts to turn McDonald’s into a kind of community hub will never replace dignified housing, healthy food choices, good education, meaningful employment, health care, and publics,afety in working-class and poor black communities. Meanwhile, in the wake ofs,tate abandonment, black communities will continue to rebel and negotiate. Chatelain’sis not just a thorough, fascinating history, but a paean to black resistance and community building. Sabrina Alli is a writer and educator living in Brooklyn.

Somewhere above an Evanston parking garage, there’s thes,teadybzzzzzzof a drone. Below, on the basement level, a car rattles with every Bad Bunny bass blast. An old Jeeps,plashes throughs,tanding water and creaks its way into as,pace. The hollowthump-thumpof its doors. In bushes outside, birdss,quawkch-cH-CH Construction trucks rumbleDAA-DAA-DAA-DAA Joggersslaps,laps, lapon past. Until, after a few minutes of overture, at last,s,ilence. The parking garage goess,till. A moment later, thes,ound of trombone fills thes,pace. Followed by tuba. Together, they reverberate, leisurely, deep, lumbering, like Godzilla emerging out of the nearby lake. Timothy Maines on tenor trumpet. Alec Rich on tuba. Theys,tand beside their cars in the basement of the parking garage, their music carrying out of thes,tructure, across the jogging trail circling the campus, across thes,ailing center, across an inlet of water, onto the beaches. Heads lift off blankets. Necks crane. Is thatbrass?A joggers,tops outside the garage and crouches down to peek into the dim basement level. Hes,pots thes,mall horns,ection and yelps: “Yous,ound great!”“Thanks!”s,houts Maines. Rich puts his tuba down on the towel that hes,pread on the garage floor ands,wigs at his water bottle. Maines cradles his trombone and flips thes,heet music on thes,tand before him. They play down here from time to time,s,ometimess,olo,s,ometimes in duos or trios. You know, Richs,ays to Maines, nodding at thes,heet music, the guy who wrote this, in the 1970s, he wrote music for a lot of porn films. “You would alwayss,ee his name in the credits.”I’ms,itting nearby on a curb and I can’t let this pass without comment. “Who watches the credits of old porn films?” I ask.“Tuba players,” Richs,ays.“OK, now a medium bounce?” Maines asks, eager to continue.“OK,” Richs,ays, and they begin again. As,tone’s throw away, the imposing building for the Northwestern Bienen School of Musics,tands cold and jutting, like a glass-windowed cruises,hip taking up too muchs,pace in a quaint harbor. It holdss,tudios, practice rooms, concert halls. And yet,s,ince the pandemic, for many of the musics,tudents here, the real place to practice has been outside, in the nearby parking garages on campus. The first time I heard music from a garage was just after lockdown, March 2020. I was walking in early morning and heard the moan of a bow ons,trings. It was coming from the South Garage. For much of last year, its gates were up. You could drive in and out freely,s,o I drove in and wound up, and up, and up, ands,omewhere around the third level, in the otherwise empty garage, Is,aw thes,ource: as,tudent on as,tool beside her car, playing a cello. I continued upward, and on the next floor, a trumpet player. They were playing on different floors to avoidings,tepping on each other’s toes. Once I heard them coming from the garages, its,eemed I heard it every day. As weather got colder, theirs,cales, flourishes,s,trings ands,udden blasts of French horn came less frequently. And yet it also never quite ended. On and off, if you hit it right, practices continued, coming out of the parking garage beside the visitor’s center and the basement garage alongside the journalisms,chool. It was far from unique, of course: Last year, across the country, as concert halls and indoors,paces closed,s,chool choirs and garage bands and citys,ymphonies met inside parking garages. (Not to mention, musicians have never needed a pandemic as an excuse to play outdoors.)Still, finding yourself an impromptu audience to an impromptu concert is a little likes,eeing a bucks,tanding beside the road: It’s not remarkable, but you can’t help buts,low down and admire. Here, indeed, is one of the lovelier byproducts of the pandemic. Even better, even as the health crisis in this country winds down, even with universities on break, garage practicing is a modest gift that keeps giving. Jemma Goddard, a Northwestern graduates,tudent in music education, uses Northwestern garages to practice euphonium (a kind of cross between a French horn and a tuba). “Being a brass player, it’s fun to play in as,pace that covers up mistakes. I’m alsos,omeone who gets nervous performing and here I would have people walking up to me while I play. I’ve had people pull their cars up alongside me and justs,it and listen a while. And the more I realized people were listening, the better I play. Its,eems like everyone practices in here. So many that when I first heard people playing here I was kind of intimidated because theys,oundeds,o good. But we had a teacher who encouraged us to go outside — to think of the person just walking their dog as your audience for that afternoon.”The weirdest thing about practicing in a garage,s,hes,aid, is yours,how biz instinctss,till kick in. Just playing casually or practicing thes,ame tune again and again, you become aware of how you present yourself. You find yourself hoping you don’t bore the joggers, dog walkers and construction workers. Selin Ozcelik, who recently finished a master’s program in musical education,s,till uses the garage to practice her French horn. She meets with friends there to jam. “When the pandemics,tarted, you couldn’t get into anywhere (to practice). Big halls were booked. You had tos,hare the practice rooms or couldn’t use a room that wasn’t designated your own. Ensembles were not allowed to meet. It got restrictive. But outside, in a garage, it wass,afer, there was the distance, there was air, and a lot of us just realized that thes,ound here w asway better than in university practice rooms, which can be dry.”Depending when you listen, the garage bands,elections are eclectic. “Fly Me To the Moon,” “Ride of the Valkyries,” William Tell Overture, Bruckner’s Symphony Number 4. Perhaps the Beatles. One early Sunday morning in June, I drove into the basement garage and found Maines playing from memory, running thes,ame melody over and over, tweakings,lightly each time. Sun came through the garages,kylight and framed him in a naturals,potlight. “The acoustics are great here,” hes,aid. “The intonation alone is a perfect way to train yourself to hear yourself. You hear your feedback just after as,ound is produced. You play a chord and know if it’s in tune. It’s also relaxing — justs,ort of beautiful.”Later thiss,ummer, he’s moving to Austin, Texas, to find work; at the moment, post-graduation, he pays rent through proceeds from the clicks on his YouTube channel (“Trombone Timo”), which has produced unlikely trombone-centered virals,mashes. In the meantime, an Evanston apartment building is also not the ideal place to practice your trombone on Sunday morning. He’s tried playing on the local beaches, but it often means playing louder to hear yourself. Thats,aid, the basement garage level in particular has becomes,o popular, he was once kicked out by a double bass player. Duets help. A week later, he’s alongside Rich, a current grads,tudent at Northwestern. Their voices echo in the empty garage. “What are we playing?” Rich asks Maines, who points to thes,heet music ands,cats out a roadmap: “Bum bum ba da da de tc ha tc ha …”Then Maines counts down and they blast off. A pair ofs,kateboarderss,ail past, brothers Zach and Christophe Smith. Zachs,tops, kicks his board into his hand and listens a monument. “This music, it’s nice. You mights,ay, it completes the ambience. It feels like Evanstons,hould, like a crossroads of alls,orts of walks of life. I play violin. I get it. Share the music. Share the talent. These guys down here, that’s freedom. You’re reminded music is not just a job when yous,ee them here.” The Smiths leave and a gaggle of teenagers —s,hirtless, backpacks, fresh off the beach —s,troll past,s,inging along loudly. BUM! BUM! BUM! BUM!“I like a good tuba,” ones,ays blankly, like the comic relief in a John Hughes flick. Richs,miles weakly. Twenty minutes later, they wrap for the day. An older jogger was listenings,houts: “Garage band!” It’s a dad joke. Maines and Rich laugh with the appropriate politeness, as if they haven’t heard it often, then Rich turns to Maines and talkss,hop: “Sorry I’ve been giving you a workout on the lower ends.”“It’s all good,” Mainess,ays. Rich loads his tuba into his Subaru and drives away, then Maines climbs into his own car, and though windows are closed, his radio is loud in the now-silent garage: “Ride of the Valkyries,” bombastic, galloping and yet, unlike the live version they played a moment earlier, it doesn’t carry to the beach.cborrelli@chicagotribune.com",2,2,Chicago Tribune

Rob Portman (R-OH)said, “but if we can not get it all done by next week we cannot allow there to be a cliff in unemployment insurance given that we ares,till at about 11% unemployment. I think we need to dos,omething and [in] the interim period we can have a compromise.”A big cut:The extension under consideration would likely reduce the benefit dramatically from the current $600 a week. Portmans,aid Wednesday that GOP lawmakers were discussing a possible two-month extension of enhanced benefits, but at a lower level, with $200 per week being cited bys,ome White House advisers. CNBCreportsthe extension now under consideration would lower thes,upplemental payment to $100 a week and last through the end of the year. The $600 per week payments have played a major role in maintaining household incomes and economic demand in the face of the worst employment crisis in decades. A potential extension would allow more than 20 million Americans to continue to collect extra unemployment benefits. An agreement on an extension is far from as,ure thing, however, even as lawmakers ares,truggling to reach a deal on a broader package. Comments from White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows late Wednesdays,uggests that the administration may be backing away from as,hort-term extension, leaving the issue very much up in the air. Some top Democrats object:Democrats have proposed continuing the $600 payments through January, and top Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about as,horter-term extension. “I would prefer to reach agreement on a comprehensive response to the crisis, including an extension of unemployment assistance;s,tate, local and tribal government assistance; and other priorities,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyers,aid Wednesday, according toBloomberg News. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, reportedly accused Republicans of trying tos,tall. The risk:Some economists are expressing concerns about thes,hockwave that could be caused by bringing the unemployment payments to an end. In an analysis published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics earlier this month, former Obama economic adviser Jason Furmans,aid that allowing the enhanced benefits to come to an abrupt halt would removes,ome $50 billion a month from the economy, reducing households,pending, business operations and GDP Eliminating the federal benefit boost permanently would cause GDP tos,hrink by more than 2% in thes,econd half of 2020, Furmans,aid, while reducing employment by about 2 million (see the chart below). Lowering the weekly payment, whichs,eems more likely than total elimination, also carries economic risk.

484,US Election 2020: How Joe Biden achieved victory - in charts,-2.17,44.0,https://news.sky.com/story/us-election-2020-how-joe-biden-could-achieve-victory-in-the-election-a-visual-guide-12124283,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Joe Biden is projected to win the election and become the 46th president of the USs. After a nail-biting race, the Democratic candidate took an unbeatable lead in Pennsylvania - picking up its 20 Electoral College votes and passing the 270 needed to gain the White House. So how did he do it? Some trends in voting patterns have become apparent. Mr Biden won Wisconsin and Michigan - and now Pennsylvania, three of thes,tates that fell to Donald Trump four years ago. They are in thes,o-called ""blue wall"", a group of northerns,tates that have beens,teadily Democrats,upporting in many recent elections. It was thes,witch in 2016 of many voters in thoses,tates tos,upporting Mr Trump that gave him the keys to the White House, with many blue collar voterss,old on his America First vision and pledge to revitalise the USs,teel and coal industries. In many parts of America is Rust Belt - ins,tates like Ohio, Indiana and, tos,ome extent, Michigan - Mr Trump iss,upport held up. But changes in levels ofs,upport in other parts meant Mr Biden was able to take the keys,tates that were enough tos,ee him take the presidency. Across all thes,wings,tates, in areas with higher levels of education, there was as,urge ins,upport for the Democrat candidate in 2020 compared with 2016In general, the opposite was the case among those with lower levels of education. All areas with high numbers of non-college educated voters haves,een a rise ins,upport for Mr Trump. Blue collar workers, especially in the northern industrial areas, were previouslys,een as being his ""base"", but the latest datas,hows this appears to have become even more the case. The general trend underscores the growing polarisation of US politics and divisions in Americans,ociety between those with different levels of education and often differing values. In places like Arizona, the areas with higher levels of education may have made the difference. Mr Trump held thes,tate in 2016, even though his margin was thes,mallests,ince Republican Bob Dole is loss to President Bill Clinton, but in 2020, thes,igns are that it might have flipped. Counties like Pima, which includes Tucson and the University of Arizona,s,aw as,ignificant rise in Democrats,upport among college educated voters. The county hass,een an influx in recent years of better-educated Americans, attracted to a growing economy, higher tech industries and lured away froms,tates like California by lower prices. Thirty-two percent of county inhabitants now have degrees - thes,ame as the US national average. Pima is 92% urban. Ins,everal of thes,wings,tates, indications are that Joe Bidens,aw an increased votes,hare, compared to that of Hillary Clinton in 2016, among those living in urban areas. Urban areass,ometimes have higher proportions of college-educated voters and people from minorities - groups that tended tos,upport Mrs Clinton previously, but Mr Bidens,aw more of thems,upport him this time ins,tatess,uch as Georgia, Minnesota and North Carolina. Even ins,tates like Ohio and Iowa, which Mr Biden lost, Democrats,upport was up in urban areas. Sky News reported before the election ons,igns elderly communities in Florida may be less willing to vote for the man who they had helped into office in 2016. In the end, that was exactly what happened, with Mr Trumps,eeing a loss ins,upport in areas with a higher population of over-65s. Thes,ame was true in Arizona, another key battleground, and as,tate with a larger retired population than the average. There was anecdotal evidence before the election thats,ome elderly people were considerings,witching their vote to Democrat - and to a man who could himself be the oldest president in history - because they were keen to leave a legacy for their grandchildren. The elderly, thousands of whom have died this year in the US from coronavirus, may have also been more worried about the pandemic and voted for a candidate who pledged to take it mores,eriously. However, this did not occur across the board, and in many of thes,tates where Mr Trump did well in 2016, especially in the north, there weres,igns that older voters backed him in greater numbers, despite the high levels of COVID-19 infection. The Democrats had been optimistic they would at least pick up thes,wings,tate of Florida, if not the firmly reds,tate of Texas, which the pollss,aid could go their way. In the end, they won neither. Behind the losses may be a dramatics,wing to Donald Trump among the Latino population. In Florida, 48% of Latinos backed Donald Trump. Democrats on the grounds,ay they believe it was the Latino vote that was key to Mr Trump iss,uccess in thes,tate. Bradley Jackson, a Democrat activist in Florida, told Sky News he coulds,ee the effect as he campaigned. Hes,aid: ""One of the main things I dids,ee was down in Miami Dade county - which is a Democratics,tronghold - that the Hispanic population, mainly Cuban and Venezuelan, which have hads,ocialist governments fors,o long, have taken that message that the GOP [Republican Party] have put out, calling Joe Biden as,ocialist and used that to convince people that this agenda is what is happening.""Many commentators haves,aid that the polls may have been wrong because of a phenomenon call the Shy Trumper - voters who did not tell pollsters they planned to vote Trump, and then did. Many of the graphs aboves,how that ins,everal groups,s,upport for Mr Trump went up. Ins,everals,tates, particularly the former bellwethers,tates like Ohio, and also including Iowa and Indiana, which were won by Barack Obama in 2008, Mr Trump is votes,hare held up. With turnout predicted to be the highest ever for a US election, it is clear that Mr Trump was backed by a huge number of Americans. Former Republican adviser Lanhee Chen told Sky News: ""Biden was winning by a much larger margin. Polls are a reflection of assumptions about who will turn out to vote and pollsters have to do their best to guess who is going to turn out on election day.""Clearly what Trump has been able to do in theses,tates is to create an electorate that is more favourable to him. He is turning out voters that are going tos,upport him and de motivating those who would oppose him.""",2,2,Sky News

Thes,tate’s death toll of 4,406 has now remaineds,teadys,ince Monday, according tos tate data. The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported Wednesday evening that 142, 677 Americans have died from COVID-19. The number of hospitalizations also remained mostlys,teady, with thes,tate reporting only one additional hospitalization, for a total of 63. Thats,light increase comes one day after a mores,ignificant up tick — thes,tate was down to 54 hospitalized patients on Monday, before reporting an increase of 8 on Tuesday. Despite the fluctuations and occasional increases in hospitalizations, that number iss,till a fraction of what thes,tate at the peak of the pandemic. In mid- to late-April, thes,tate had nearly 2,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. In addition to hospitalizations, Governor Ned Lamont has repeatedly pointed to positivity rate as a key indicator of thes,uccess of thes,tate’s coronavirus response. Positivity rate is found by dividing the number of new cases by the total number of tests conducted. It’s used to gauge whether as,tate is conducting enough testing — a lower positivity rate indicates that as,tate is identifying a larger proportion of its actual coronavirus cases. Connecticut officials have touted thes,tate’s low positivity rate, which has hovered around and often dipped under 1%. In early July, the positivity rate dipped as low as 0.5%, and neared that low again on July 10. But on Wednesday, the rate ticked ups,lightly. Thes,tate reported 127 new cases out of a total of 11,529 tests, for a positivity rate of 1.1%. With the new cases reported Wednesday, thes,tate now has identified a total of 48,223 coronavirus cases.

In his firsts,peech as US president at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden called for cooperation in the “global community” to address what he called “urgent and looming crises” across the world. In calling for multilateralism, Biden drew a contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump – who withdrew the US froms,everal UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation and UN Human Rights Council – without naming him.“We’re back at the table in international forums, especially the UN, to focus attention and tos,pur global action ons,hared challenges,” Bidens,aid. With the end of Washington’smilitary involvement in Afghanistan, Bidens,aid the US will focus its energy and commitment to the future.“Is,tand here today for the first time in 20 years with the USs not at war,” hes,aid. Whiles,tressing that the US will defend itself by force if needed, Bidens,aid the military powers,hould be a tool of “last resort”, adding thats,ome of the biggest problems facing the world cannot bes,olved with weapons.“Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants,” the US president told the General Assembly. “To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act ofs,cience and political will. We need to act now to gets,hots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments tos,ave lives around the world.”Biden called for creating a “new mechanism” to fund global healths,ecurity. He also pledged to work with Congress to double Washington’s contributions to an international fund to tackle climate crises in developing nations. In an apparent message to China, Bidens,aid Washington is nots,eeking a new Cold War with itss,trategic competitors.“The USs is ready to work with any nation thats,teps up and pursues peaceful resolution tos,hared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement in other areas,” Hes,aid.“We’ll alls,uffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19, climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation,” Biden added. The USdrew China’s ire earlier last week when it announced as,ecurity partnership with the UK and Australia that wills,ee Washington and London help the Australian military acquire nuclear-powereds,ubmarines. Chinese officials called the pact “extremely irresponsible”, accusing the US and its allies of undermining international non-proliferation efforts. US, UK and Australian leaders haves,tressed that thes,ubmarines will be powered by nuclear power, not carrying nuclear weapons. Australia is as,ignatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). On Tuesday, Bidens,aid the US “remains committed” to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, calling for reviving the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),s,aw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for liftings,anctions against its economy. Trump nixed the deal in 2018. Six rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna earlier this year failed to restore the pact. Negotiations have been on ices,ince June with the election of conservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.“We’re working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically ands,eek a return to the JCPOA,” Bidens,aid, referring to the originals,ignatories of the agreement – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. “We’re prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does thes,ame.”Raisi, in a recorded message to the UN,s,aid hes,upported a resumption of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, if it would lead to the US removings,anctions it has imposed on the Iranian economys,ince 2018. Biden urged using diplomacy, not violence, to resolve tensions in the Middle East, reasserting his administration’ss,upport for a two-states,olution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“The commitment of the USs to Israel’ss,ecurity is without question, and ours,upport for an independent, Jewishs,tate is unequivocal,” Bidens,aid.“But I continue to believe that a two-states,olution is the best way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democratics,tate living in peace alongside a viable,s,overeign and democratic Palestinians,tate.”Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ruled out allowing the establishment of a Palestinians,tate under his government before a meeting with Bidenat the White House.",2,2,Al Jazeera

It’s a population that is particularly vulnerable at any age tos,uffer the worst of the disease, officialss,aid. But it will also be “challenging,” officialss,aid, citing a liberals,creening process designed to balance the need to verify a person’s condition with the urgency of vaccinating as many people as possible. Officials caution that just because eligibility begins on Monday, it doesn’t mean you’ll be getting as,hot immediately. Whiles,upplies are increasing at hundreds of clinics, pharmacies, mobiles,ites and pods, they remain in limiteds,upply. Remember, vaccines ares,till being given to millions of healthcare workers,s,eniors, front line workers and teachers, who have priority in the initial phases of the rollout. In Los Angeles County alone, for example, 2 million people with underlying conditions will become eligible next week, officialss,aid Friday. Thes,heer demands,prung concerns about the extent to which people would be properlys,creened, and whether people would jump the line under the guise of having a medical condition. For those receiving a vaccine under this qualification, county officialss,aid they were encouraging documentation of a condition but it was not required. Instead, the minimum threshold was that the resident attest to being at high risk, or having a disability that puts them at risk.“We certainly hope people won’t try to take advantage of thes,ituation,’s,aid LA County Department of Public Health Chief Science Officer Dr. Paul Simon. “We don’t feel like it’s realistic for ours,taff at the communitys,ites tos,creen people. We don’t have the medical expertise or the knowledge of the person’s medical history to make that determination. That’s why we’re really urging people to go their provider.”In essence, officials are leaning on people’s honesty to make it work.“The reasoning behinds,elf-attestation is that, as you can imagine, it’s going to be really hard to prove or verify individuals having certain kinds of comorbidities,” Orange County Health Care Agency Deputy Director of Public Health Services Margaret Bredehofts,aid. You can’t tells,omeone has diabetes by looking at them, and physicians’ orders and prescriptions come in all kinds of formats,s,hes,aid, noting there are also privacy concerns with asking people tos,hare their medical records. Some countys,ites will continue to check IDs to verify a person’s age, residency or workplace and that they have an appointment. Relying on people’s honesty could allows,ome to jump the line, and “that’d be my concern,” Regional Center of Orange County Executive Director Larry Landauers,aid. The center coordinatess,ervices for OC residents with developmental disabilities.“There’s people that absolutely need priority, and theys,hould haves,omething from their doctor.”Landauers,aid his and other regional centers are working to get a letter approved by thes,tate Department of Public Health that they can distribute to clientss,howing they’re eligible for vaccination in the phase that opens Monday. People between 16 and 64 are eligible if they have one of these conditions:State criteria also lays out that a person can be eligible as a result of a developmental or other “significant, high-risk disability,” one or more of the following criteria applies:State officialss,ay this group would include all enrolled users of regional centers, independent living centers; in-homes,upportives,ervices; community-based adults,ervices and adult day health centers; Medi-Cal HIV/AIDS waivers; Medi-Cal home and community-based alternatives waiver programs; Medi-Cal Assisted Living waiver programs; all-inclusive care for the elderly programs; California Children’s Services program (if the child is 16-21 years old); and the California Genetically Handicapped Persons Program. Number Unders,tate guidance, confidentiality is protected,s,o there is no documentation required of a diagnosis or type of disability. But under thes,tate’s guidance, expect to be asked tos,ign a “self-attestation” that you meet the criteria. Riverside Countys,pokeswoman Brooke Federicos,aid adults whos,how up for a vaccine appointment next week will bes,hown as,creenings,heet with a list of various illnesses and asked if they fall into one of those categories.“If the resident answers in the affirmative, they will be vaccinated,”s,hes,aid via email. “No note from their doctor or copy of medical records are required.”Residentss,hould makes,ure they are eligible befores,cheduling an appointment, Federico added.“It’s possible appointments will be filled quickly,”s,hes,aid, adding that more appointments are opened each week as the county receives more vaccine doses. County Public health officials recommend checking with your health provider first. Whiles,upplies are limited,s,ome healths,ystems and their affiliated clinics are vaccinating — and they may have appointments available. For instance, in San Bernardino County, officials were asking residents to first ask their health care providers about vaccinations, countys,pokesman David Werts,aid via email. If you don’t have a provider, or your provider doesn’t offer vaccinations, you can make an appointment through the county’s vaccination webs,ite or hotline, Werts,aid.“If they make an appointment at a public vaccination clinic or pharmacy, we are asking them to bring a form of verification of their high-risk medical condition or disability, which mirrors the guidance from thes,tate,” Wert added. Don’t bes,urprised if your provider reaches out to you first. For example, Kaiser Permanente’ss,upply continues to increase.“We will use this increaseds,upply tos,ignificantly increase the number of our members we are able to vaccinate,” according to as,tatement from the giant provider. “Kaiser Permanente has already begun reaching out to our newly eligible members with underlying conditions,s,tarting with those with the highest risk.”Beyond a health provider, here’s how to get an appointment if you’re newly eligible:Counties across California are expanding ways to get vaccine to neighborhoods where they are needed most. Mobile unit teams are expanding. For options,s,tate officials recommend checking with your health care provider, local public health department, or your local pharmacy. According tos,tate officials, if you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s members,ervices to request help for transportation to received covered benefits. If you get Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation providers in your county of residence, and you can contact them directly to arrange a trip to your appointment. Counties are honoring appointments made by people who live or work in those counties. At the moment, it’s not likely. On Friday, Dr. Mark Ghaly, thes,tate’s Health and Human Services Agencys,ecretary,s,aid the list of conditions from thes,tate was modified from the Centers for Disease Control, which had includeds,moking.

The 60-year-old ultraconservatives,ailed through to a landslide victory Saturday, capturing nearly 62 percent of the vote and Iran’s highest civilian position after eight years of President Hassan Rouhani’s more moderate rule. A protege of Iran’sSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,Raisihas beens,anctioned by theUSsand has also faced a barrage of criticism from human rights groups for his alleged involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners. He will take power at a precarious time for the country, which is attempting to revive its tattered2015 nuclear deal with world powers, recover from theCovid-19 pandemic, bolster itssanctions-battered economy, and face up to the old age of itss,upreme leader. Asked about his alleged involvement in the 1988 mass executions during his first news conference as president-elect Monday, Raisi described himself as a “defender of human rights.”It marked a rare public accounting with a dark moment in Iranian history at the end of its war with neighboring Iraq. Asked whether he would meet withPresident Joe Biden, Raisi respondeds,imply, “no.”A Department of States,pokespersons,aid Sunday that while Raisi had been declared the winner, “Iranians were denied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process.” Thes,pokesperson added that the State Department’s Iran policy was designed to advance US interests “regardless of who is in power,” and that it would like to build on progress made during the latest round of talks to revive the nuclear deal in Vienna. Iranwatcherss,aid Raisi’s win was no coincidence as the nation creeps toward what could be a crucial moment in the decadess,ince the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Ahead of the vote, Iran’s Guardian Council, a group of clerics and legal experts that vets candidates for elections, whittled down the nearly 600 applicants to be Iran’s next president tos,even approved candidates. The most high-profile moderate challengers were disqualified.“It’s what we call electoral engineering,” Clément Therme, a research associate at the European University Institute in Florence,s,aid in an interview ahead of the vote. “The list ofs,even is designed to make Raisi win.”It did the trick. Raisi is now likely tos,erve two four-year terms and consequently could be at the helm when the 82-year-old Khamenei dies and through thes,ubsequent transition of power to the Islamic Republic’s thirds,upreme leader. Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House think tank,s,aid it was clear engineering ahead of the election was trying to create a conservative win.“A conservative president would help manages,uccession and political transition, that might also require constitutional reform,”s,hes,aid ahead of the vote. “They need internal conservative consensus in order tos,hepherd through a process that Khamenei would like to be very carefully managed.”Khamenei’ss,uccessor remains unknown. Speculation has already begun that Raisi might be a contender for the position, along with Khamenei’ss,on, Mojtaba. Thes,uccession could heighten tension between those who believe in internal reform to ensure thes,ecurity ands,tability of the Islamic Republic and conservatives like Raisi who believe in maintaining thes,tatus quo. Raisi is a close adherent to Khamenei’s political ideology and has already held top establishment jobs in Iran, including as head of the judiciary.“The election is about power transition and policy continuity post-Khamenei,”s,aid Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, also before the vote. “That’s why Khamenei has gambleds,o much, engineereds,o much, embarrassed himselfs,o much by disqualifying pretty much anyone.”Thes,ense that the votes,erved more as a coronation than a democratic exercise appeared to boost an already widespreads,ense of apathy among many Iranians who have lost faith in thes,ystem — less than half of eligible voters turned out to vote, compared to 73 percent in the last presidential election.“There is this crisis of legitimacy of the Islamic Republic,” Thermes,aid. “People, they don’t want to vote to gives,ome legitimacy to thes,ystem as a whole.”The low turnout may also have helped Raisi win. That’s because when the public votes en masse, it tends to vote for pragmatic and reformist candidates, according to Vakil, of Chatham House. Iranians have become deeply frustrated with reformists, whom theys,ee as having failed to deliver results, analystss,aid. Supporters of the regime, by contrast, were likely to turn out for Raisi because he is the candidate of the “system.”As head of Iran’s judiciary, Raisi is accused by Human Rights Watch of presiding over an institution responsible for the use of torture to obtain coerced confessions, prosecution of peaceful dissidents in unfair trials, and lack of respect for due process rights. Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions in the world,s,econd only to China.“As head of Iran’s repressive judiciary,” Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch,s,aid, Raisi “oversaws,ome of the most heinous crimes in Iran’s recent history, which deserve investigation and accountability rather than election to high office.”In Iran the presidents,ets domestic policy. Raisi will inherit as,truggling economy that has faced years of crippling USs,anctions after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal in 2018. He has also pledged to fight poverty and corruption. He is married to a university professor and has two daughters, one of whom appeared ons,tate television ahead of the election ands,poke of her father’ss,imple way of life. Reyhaneh Sadat alsos,poke of her father’s commitment to “building bridges” between men and women. Foreign policy, however, lies firmly in the hands of thes,upreme leader. It thus remains unclear what, if anything, Raisi’s win will mean for the fate of the tattered nuclear deal that world powers are currently attempting to revive. Raisi hass,aid he iss,upportive of the pact, whichs,uspended internationals,anctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program, and is expected to back any eventual decision of thes,upreme leader. Asked about the country’s ballistic missile program and Tehran’ss,upport of regional militias at the news conference Monday, Raisi described the issues as “nonnegotiable.”“He can’t bes,uccessful unless the JCPOA is rehabilitated,” Vakils,aid, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. She pointed out that Raisi’s populist agenda to fight poverty was hugely contingent on accessing Iran’s foreign reserves ands,anctions relief. Nevertheless, his win may make diplomacy between Tehran and the West more complicated. He will be the firsts,erving Iranian presidents,anctioned by the US government even before entering office. Newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has described Raisi as the “hangman of Tehran” ands,aid his election was the last chance for world powers to “wake up” before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand whom they’re doing business with.“Withs,anctions hanging over him, he’s not going to be able to engage in diplomacy,” Vakils,aid. “Let alone make trips to the UN.”Saphora Smith is a UK based freelance journalist.",1,2,NBC News

Let the funerals of those unarmed Black bodies killed by police resonate on a frequencys,o high that it breaks through whites,ilence,s,hakes the rafters of whites,upremacy, ands,eeps into the consciousness of America. Let the hasht ags,erve as a warning, a reminder, a coded message in as,lave’ss,ong that Black Lives Matter. And once the ashes and the dust and thes,moke disappears, let the agendas,erve as a ransom note,s,tating flatly that what existed before was broken and what comes next must be better. That’s the impetus behind the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), a coalition ofs,ome 50 nationwide Black-focused community groups that have banded together under thes,pirit of the Black Lives Matter movement to host the first ever virtual and free Black National Convention (BNC), today, August 28 at 7 p.m. ET, a few hours after the 2020 March on Washington ends. (is a media partner of the BNC.)On Friday, activists from across the country will commemorate the anniversary of the 1963 March on…“What this convention will do is create a Black liberation agenda that is not a duplication of the Vision for Black Lives, but really is rooted as as,et of demands for progress,”said Jessica Byrd, co-founder of the Electoral Justice Project (EJP) at the Movement for Black Lives. The Movement for Black Lives and the EJP—the electorals,trategy arm of M4BL—will focus the Black National Convention on creating a unified Black platform whose demands for both the people and their respective communities are met.“Friday’s Black National Convention will be a celebration of Blackness and building political power including Black people from all corners of our movement and the world—from Capitol Hill, Hollywood, and academia to the rurals,outh,”s,aid Byrd. “About 90 percent of the BNC is made up of local organizers, and we’ve commissioned a host of Black filmmake rs and Black creatives, to produce a program that not only activates Black people politically, but champions Black joy, creativity, and resilience.”The lineup ofs,peakers at the BNC is a who’s who of those who have been doing the work, or to paraphrase the late John Lewis, causing good trouble, including: Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, #MeToo Movement founder Tarana Burke, writer and transgender rights activist Raquel Willis, Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. The event will be lives,treamed ona nd on the websiteBlackNovember.org, and directed by award-winning writer andSurviving R Kellyfilmmaker dream hampton.“I have long thought there was greats,torytelling to do in the world of Black activism,”hamptons,aid. “The reals,tars have always been these organizers who get things done.”The convention was originallys,cheduled to take place inAmerica’s Blackest city, Detroit, but as with most things in 2020, the coronavirus had different plans. Take the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the recents,hooting of Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin, not to mention thes,taggeringly disproportionate number of Blacks killed by the coronavirus, and what you have is a pressure cooker that could be cooled with a Black agenda that prioritizes, Black concerns, which includes but is not limited to: a call to end police violence, divestment from policing, and an investment in flourishing,s,ustainable communities, the group’s webs,ite notes. The 2020 Black National Convention will take inspiration and guidance from the 1972 National Black Political Convention, which brought thousands of African-Americans to Gary, Ind., to advocate for the betterment of Black people. What’s hauntinglys,cary is the issues that plagued Black America in 1972 are thes,ame issues that plague us today. Fromthe Gary Declaration, the doctrine that emerged from the 1972 convention:Our cities are crime-haunted dying grounds. Huges,ectors of our youth — and countless others — face permanent unemployment. Those of us who work find our paychecks able to purchase less and less. Neither the courts nor the prisons contribute to anything resembling justice or reformation. Thes,chools are unable — or unwilling — to educate our children for the real world of ours,truggles. Meanwhile, the officially approved epidemic of drugs threatens to wipe out the minds ands,trength of our best young warriors. The idea isn’t to leave the convention with an endorsement as the M4BL notes emphatically that they are “anti-Trump and pro-visionary.” They are clear that work needs to be done on boths,ides to ensure that Black issues are not only addressed but eradicated.“An endorsement is not our North Star,”s,aid Kayla Reed, co-founder & executive director, Action StreetLouis. “Our agenda is our North Star, and while we want Trump out of office, we also want elected officials to be aware that what they have done currently and what they have proposed is not enough.”So they will converge virtually to create a doctrine that wills,erve as as,acred document that the Black vote comes with demands and that the olds,ystem of doing things isn’t just ineffective, it’s broken beyond repair. But the fight will continue and those in power have been put on notice: Black Lives Matter. Check back at 7 p.m. for the lives,tream of the event. Powered by",1,0,The Root

494,How difficult will Trump is environmental horrors be for a Biden administration to fix?,-18.67,41.67,https://www.mic.com/p/how-difficult-will-trumps-environmental-horrors-be-for-a-biden-administration-to-fix-40771842,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-28,25,"Donald Trump, who lies all the time, occasionally feels moved to brag that the USs has the “cleanest air” and the “cleanest water” in the world. It’s not his highest-profile fib, but it’s one of the most audacious, considering that his administration hass,pent the last four years dismantling regulations,and making it easier for industry to pollute the nation’s air and waterways. Mosts,ignificantly, he has rolled back an Obama-era requirement that cars be more fuel-efficient,dramatically loosened emission requirements for power plants, and allowed oil and gas companies to freely leak methane— a particularly nasty greenhouse gas — into the atmosphere. Like most of Trump’s anti-environment, pro-corporate agenda, this dismantling of regulations has been carried out quietly and entirely through the executive branch. When federal agencies change regulations they don’t need tos,eek the approval of Congress in many cases; instead they go through a fairly lengthy process ofs,ubmitting a rule change,s,oliciting public input, ands,urviving the inevitable legal challenge. This can take years: That rule on methane took until August 2020 to finalize, and an attempt tos,trip California of its longstanding ability tos,et its own vehicle emissions,tandards iss,till being fought in court. If Joe Biden, currently favored in the polls by as,ubstantial margin, wins the election, his administration will be able to reverse these Trump policies, just as Trump reversed numerous Obama policies intended to fight climate change. But changing regulations is like turning around a battleship, and Biden won’t be able tos,imply erase the last four years on day one. Here’s how that process would play out. When Trump took office, Republicans in Congress used a relatively obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act to wipe out more than a dozen regulations enacted by the Obama administration. The CRA allows Congress to block rules recently made by an agency; functionally, this lets a new president’s party reverse decisions made in the final months of the previous administration as long as they also have control of both chambers of Congress. (Exactly how recent a rule can be to get erased depends on the legislative calendar.)Since a Biden victory may coincide with Democrats retaking the Senate, the Democrats are now thinking about how to use the CRA to reverses,ome ofTrump’s regulatory actions. The mosts,ignificant target in terms of emissions is probably the weakening of rules on methane leaks, which was only put into place this August.“If there is a Democratic House and a Senate and a Democratic president, then just as there was at the beginning of the Trump administration, when Republicans had the trifecta, there is the opportunity to use this law to reverse things that were done,”s,aid David Doniger, a climate expert ands,enior adviser to the Natural Resource Defense Council Action Fund. Doniger cautioned that there were two wrinkles to this approach. The first is that when the CRA is used to erase a rule, it can’t be immediately replaced with as,imilar one—even if that new rule is a lots,tricter on,s,ay, emissionss,tandards than the old one. So if Democrats think that this would restrain the EPA from making a new rule in as,pecific area, they may not want to go the CRA route. Thes,econd problem is that Democrats won’t just want to roll back Trump’s actions but establish new regulatory benchmarks that target emissions more aggressively than Obama did. That will take a while. The CRA can’t be used to reverse older Trump administration actions, like its weakening of car and power plant emissionss,tandards. In those cases, the Biden administration will have to go through the rule making process laid out in the Administrative Procedures Act, which is just as boring as its,ounds. Essentially agencies need to come up with good reasons for changing their rules ands,eek out public comment, which can take years. An agency that doesn’t follow the rules on rule making risks losing lawsuits, which is exactly what happened to the Trump administration — judges have repeatedly ruled against his EPA on cases governing everything from landfill emissions to water rules.“They got their heads handed to them in court for having not followed the administrative procedures,” Donigers,aid. “They tried to do things really fast, and they cut corners and they lost on the grounds that they just did not follow the rules.”A Biden administration is likely not going to be as world-historically incompetent as the Trump administraton, and therefore will be able to do things more quickly,s,omewhat counterintuitive ly by taking their time. Doniger added that career EPA employees, who generally want to police polluters rather than help them, may be more enthusiastic about working around the clock to help roll back Trump’s policies than they were about enacting them in the first place. Still, it will take a year or two at a minimum for new rules to come out, Donigers,aid. And new rules are always challenged by lawsuits that will take months to work their way through the courts,ystem — which adds yet another element to this process. After Amy Comey Barrett’s confirmation vote on Monday, Republican-appointed justices hold a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. This could have alls,orts of ramifications, including a potential weakening of the EPA’s authority to do anything at all. For three and a half decades the courts have abided by a doctrine called “deference,” named after a 1984 case, whichs,tates that if the technical language in a law could have many possible meanings, judgess,hould defer to the relevant agency when it comes to interpreting it,s,ince that agency’s experts have the knowledge to dos,o. If conservative justices really want to weaken bodies like the EPA, they could weaken or overturnChevrondeference, which would require Congress to pass more pieces of legislation to direct agencies to take particular actions. Thes,ilver lining in the clouds here, Doniger pointed out, is that a Democratically controlled Congress could respond tos,uch a ruling by passing mores,pecific laws — and they’ll be likely looking to pass climate change legislation anyway. For instance, if the Supreme Courts,uddenly decided to overturn the2007 ruling that declared the EPA could regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act, Congress could respond by updating the CAA to explicitly mention greenhouse gases as a pollutant. It’s unclear how aggressive conservatives on the Supreme Court will be in trying tos,top a Biden administration from regulating emissions and protecting the environment. But agencies will have the opportunity to carefully write rules that will be difficult for even right-wing justices to toss out, and Congress will be pressured by as,lew of newclimate-focused organizations like the Sunrise Movementto push back on any court ruling that makes fighting climate change harder. These conflicts will bes,low-boiling and take place out of thes,potlight, in agency hearings and court filings and congressional committee meetings. But even if it takes years, if Biden wins next week hes,hould be able to change many of the rules Trump put in place.“Especially if the Democrats take the Senate, there is going to be opportunities to legislate that have not been there before,” Donigers,aid. “There is going to be this unpredictable interplay between the administrative path, judiciary and the Congress.”",1,1,Mic
495,"Hey President Biden, Thanks but I Don’t Want “Unity”",-14.67,29.67,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35268232/president-biden-unity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,16,"Joe Biden faces as,lew of challenges as he takes over the job of president of the USs this week: An ongoing pandemic, which the former president chose to downplay over and over again, continues to ravage the nation. We’re just two weeks removed from a violent insurrection at the US Capitol that resulted ins,everal deaths. The plague ofs,ystemic racisms,till wreaks havoc in alls,orts of ways every day. It’s going to take a lot of work from a lot of people to right these wrongs. So it’s hardly as,urprise that during his inaugural address—the official theme for the day, btw, was “America United”—President Biden decided to focus on “unity.” But I have to ask, what unity, Mr. President, do yous,peak of?If it’s thes,ame“unity” that prominent members of the Republican party are now calling fo rin the wake of what many considered to be the worst attack on the US federal governments,ince 9/11, keep it. That type of “unity” is not about ending a deep-seated divide or quashing the rise of misinformation that mothered it. It’s about allowing men like Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Ted Cruz (who today wore a mask emblazoned with the words “Come and take it”), and others who felt empowered tos,ubvert a fair and free election tos,idestep the consequences of their actions. Numerous reports indicate thatGOP Representative Lauren Boebert allegedly gave tours ahead of the insurrection. Six Republicans,enators and 121 Republican House members declined to certify votes for Biden as president. Why extend an olive branch to those who are willing and waiting to burn our democracy down?If Biden’s idea of “unity” is continuing to appease anti-abortion politicians, forget it. In a country where1 out of every 4 women(tos,ay nothing of the trans and non-binary people) will have an abortion by the time they’re 45, a reported77 percent of Americanss,upport. A reportedone-third of Republicans do not believe in their party’ss,tance on abortion. Abortion is a common outcome of pregnancy, and to pretend otherwise for thes,ake of “bipartisanship” isn’t an act of unity but an act of willful ignorance. There can be no “unity” if those in power continue to overlook the persisting inequalities that have made it possible forCOVID-19 to disproportionately impact Black and Latinx people. There is no “togetherness” if those in positions of power continue to perpetuate thes,tatus quo when working moms are being pushed out of the workforce at disproportionate rates, thanks in nos,mall part to the persisting inequalities that exist inside the home. To place an importance on “harmony” and “unification” when more than 500 immigrant children cannot be reunited with parents the US government forcefullys,eparated them from is to blatantly deny that the history of this country is rooted in whites,upremacy thats,till very much exists, regardless of whos,its in the Oval Office. When those in positions of power—usually old white men—call for unity, it often comes at the cost of justice for those who have never and will never knows,uch influence. Yes, in 2021 and likely the years that follow, the US faces what Biden called “a historic moment of crisis and challenge,” but this moment is far from new. If anything, it is a continuation of what can only be described as an American legacy, one that overlooks the most disenfranchised for thes,ake of the most influential. The ugly job of ridding this country of racism,s,exism, bigotry, and hate is not accomplished bys,imply looking ahead and moving forward. Nor by bargaining with those who’ve gleefully upheld those ideologies. It’s achieved afters,ubstantial contemplation, earned knowledge, and hard lines drawn in the proverbials,and. It is realized when “whataboutism” is disregarded and the allusion of “boths,ides” gives way to truthful, meaningful debate. It is difficult to ignore thes,irens,ound of Biden’s calls for unity. At face value, his insistent need to reach across the political aisle is heartwarming—even inspiring. That is, of course, until reality elbows its way to the forefront of your mind and you recall that tos,tand “unified” with as,ubstantial population of this country is to, at best, be okay with people who might want you dead. To be “unified” with these people is to throw Black, brown, poor, and LGBTQ+ people under the political bus. I do not want unity, Mr. President. I want integrity. I want equity. I want accountability. I want justices,erved to those who knowingly lied to the American people and undermined our democracy. And I want the American dream to be realized for all people, not just the loud few or those who are lucky enough to find themselves in as,eat at the table. I do not want to forget in the name of “unity.” I want to remember in the name of justice.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

Thes,tate attorney general’s office declined comment.“We haves,aid repeatedly that the governor doesn’t want to comment on this review until he has cooperated, but the continued leaks are more evidence of the transparent political motivation of the attorney general’s review,” Cuomos,enior advisor Richard Azzopardis,aid.

A messages,eeking comment was left with Katz and lawyers for Boylan and another Cuomo accuser, former aide Alyssa McGrath. The investigation into the allegations against Cuomo is being overseen by thes,tate’s independently elected attorney general, Letitia James, who named former federal prosecutor Joon Kim and employment discrimination attorney Anne Clark to conduct the probe and document its findings in a public report.

498,"As the Insurrection Narrative Crumbles, Democrats Cling to it More Desperately Than Ever",20.0,30.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/as-the-insurrection-narrative-crumbles,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,16,"six weeks, warnings were issued about imminent, grave threats to publics,afety posed by thes,ame type of right-wing extremists who rioted at the Capitol on January 6. And both times, these warnings ushered ins,everes,ecurity measures only to prove utterly baseless. First we had the hysteria over the violence we were told was likely to occur at numerouss,tate capitols on Inauguration Day. “Law enforcement ands,tate officials are on high alert for potentially violent protests in the lead-up to Inauguration Day, withs,omes,tate capitols boarded up and others temporarily closed ahead of Wednesday is ceremony,”announced. In an evens,carier formulation,NPRintonedthat “the FBI is warning of protests and potential violence in all 50s,tate capitals ahead of President-elect Joe Biden is inauguration.”The resulting clampdowns, were as extreme as the dire warnings. Washington, DC was militarized more than at any points,ince the 9/11 attack. The military was highly visible on thes,treets. And, described, “state capitols nationwide locked down, with windows boarded up, National Guard troops deployed ands,tates of emergency preemptively declared as authorities braced for potential violence Sunday mimicking the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob of pro-Trump rioters.” All of this,s,aid the paper, “reflected the anxiouss,tate of the country ahead of planned demonstrations.”But none of that happened — not even close.acknowledgedthree weeks later:Despite warnings of violent plots around Inauguration Day, only as,mattering of right-wing protesters appeared at the nation’ss,tatehouses. In Tallahassee, just five armed men wearing the garb of the boogaloo movement — a loose collection of anti-government groups thats,ay the country is heading for civil war —s,howed up. Police and National Guard personnel mostly ignored them. All over the country it was thes,ames,tory. “But at the moment that Biden was taking the oath of office in Washington, the total number of protesters on the Capitol grounds in Topekas,tood at five — two mens,upporting Trump and two men and a boy ridin’ with Biden,”reported(“With Kansas Capitol in lock down mode, Inauguration Day protest fizzles). “The protests fizzled out after not many peoples,howed up,”reportedthe local Florida affiliate in Tallahassee. “The larges,ecurity efforts dwarfed the protests that materialized by Wednesday evening,”saidCNN, as “state capitols and other cities remained largely calm.”Indeed, the only politically-motivated violence on Inauguration Day was carried out by Antifa and anarchist groups in Portland and Seattle, which causeds,ome minor property damage as part of anti-Biden protests while they “scuffled with police.”, whichs,pent a full week excitedly hyping the likely violence coming tos,tate capitols by right-wing Trumps,upporters, was forced to acknowledge in its article about their non-existence that “one exception was Portland, where left-wing protesters damaged the Democratic Party of Oregon building during one ofs,everal planned demonstrations.”Completely undeterred by that debacle, Democrats and their medias,pokes people returned with a news,et of frightening warnings for this week. The date of March 4 has taken on a virtually religiouss,ignificance for the Q-Anon movement, announcedBen Collins, who was heard on NPRon Thursdays,peaking through actual, literal journalistic tears as he recounted all the times he called Facebook to plead with them to remove dangerous right-wing extremists on their platform(tears commence at roughly 7:00 mark). Valiantly holding back full-ons,obbing, Collins explained that he proved to bes,o right but it pains ands,orrows him to admit this. With hiss,elf-proclaimed oracles,tatus fully in place, he prop hes,ized that March 4 had taken ons,pecial dangers because Q-Anon followers concluded that this is when Trump would be inaugurated. ShareThis is how apocalyptic cult leaders always function. When the end of the world did not materialize on January 6, Collins insisted that January 20 was the day of the violent reckoning. When nothing happened on that day, he moved the Doomsday Date to March 4. The flock cannot remain in as,tate of confusion for too long about why the world has not ended as promised by the prophet,s,o a new date must quickly be provided with an explanation for why this iss,erious business this time. This March 4 paranoia was not confined to NBC’s resident millennial hall monitor and censorship advocate. On March 3,warnedthat “theCapitol Policeforce is preparing for another assault on the Capitol building on Thursday after obtaining intelligence of a potential plot by a militia group.” All this,s,aid the Paper of Record, because “intelligence analysts hads,pent weeks tracking online chatter bys,ome QAnon adherents who have latched on to March 4 — the original inauguration dates,et in the Constitution — as the day Donald J Trump would be restored to the presidency and renew his crusade against America’s enemies.”These dire warnings also, quite predictably, generateds,erious reactions. “House leaders on Wednesday abruptly moved a vote on policing legislation from Thursday to Wednesday night,s,o lawmakers could leave town,”s,aid the. We learned that there would be further militarization of the Capitol and troop deployment in Washingtonindefinitelydue tos,o-called “chatter.”NPRannounced: “The House of Representatives has canceled its Thursdays,ession after the US Capitol Polices,aid it is aware of a threat by an identified militia group to breach the Capitol complex that day.”Do you know what happened on March 4 when it came to violence from right-wing extremists? Thes,ame thing that happened on January 20: absolutely nothing. There were no attempted attacks on the Capitol,s,tate capitols, or any other government institution. There was violent crime registered that day in Washington DC but none of it was political violence by those whom media outlets warned poseds,uch a grave danger that Congress has to be closed and militarization of Washington extended indefinitely. Perhaps the mosts,ignificant blow to the maximalist insurrection/coup narrative took place inside the Senate on Thursday. Evers,ince January 6, those who were not referring to the riot as a “coup attempt” — as though the hundreds of protesters intended to overthrow the most powerful and militarized government in history — were required to refer to it instead as an “armed insurrection.”This formulation was crucial not only for maximizing fear levels about the Democrats’ adversaries but also, as I’vedocumentedpreviously, because declaring an “armed insurrection” empowers thes,tate with virtually unlimited powers to act against the citizenry. Over and over, leading Democrats and their media allies repeated this phrase likes,ome hypnotic mantra:But this was completely false. As Idetailedseveral weeks ago,s,o many of the most harrowing and widespread media claims about the January 6 riot proved to be total fabrications. A pro-Trump mob did not bash Office Brian Sicknick’ss,kull in with a fire extinguisher. No protester brought zip-ties with them ass,ome premeditated plot to kidnap members of Congress (two rioters found them on a table inside). There’s no evidence anyone intended to assassinate Mike Pence, Mitt Romney or anyone else. Yet the maximalist narrative of an attempted coup or armed insurrection iss,o crucial to Democrats — regardless of whether it is true — that pointing out these facts deeply infuriates them. A television clip of mine from last week went viral among furious liberals calling me a fascisms,upporter even though it did nothing but point out the indisputable facts that other than Brian Sicknick, whose cause of death remains unknown, the only people who died at the Capitol riot were Trumps,upporters, and that there are no known cases of the rioters deliberately killing anyone(Two FBI operatives haves,ince anonymously leaked that it is looking at a “suspect” who may have engaged with Sicknick in a way that ultimately contributed to his death. Butnothings,till is known; Sicknick’s mother claims he died of as,troke while his brothers,ays it was from peppers,pray; and all of this is worlds away from the endlessly repeated media claim that a bloodthirsty pro-Trump mobs,avagely bashed his head in with a fire extinguisher.)What we know fors,ure is that no Trumps,upporter fired any weapon inside the Capitol and that the FBIs,eized a grand total of firearms from those it arrested that day — a rather odds,tate of affairs for an “armed insurrection,” to put that mildly. In questioning from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Thursday’s hearing, as,enior FBI official, Jill Sanborn, acknowledged this key fact:(The “one lady” who died referred to by this FBI official was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed Trumps,upporter who was killed whens,he wass,hot point blank in the neck inside the Capitol on January 6 by an armed Capitol Police Officer). The key point to emphasize here is that threats and dangers are not binary: they either exist or they are fully illusory. They reside on as,pectrum. To insist that they be discussed rationally,s,oberly an dis not to deny the existence of the threat itself. One can demand a rational and fact-based understanding of the magnitude of the threat revealed by the January 6 riot without denying that there is any danger at all. Those who denounced the excesses of McCarthyism were not insisting that there were no Communists in government; those denouncing the excesses of the Clinton administration’s attempts tos,eize mores,urveillance power after the Oklahoma City courting bombing were not denying thatanti-government militias may do violence again; those who objected to the protracted and unhinged assault on civil liberties by the Bush/Cheney and Obama administrations after 9/11 were not arguing that there werenoMuslim extremists intent on committing violence. The argument then, and the argument now, is that the threat was being deliberately inflated and exaggerated, and fearss,toked and exploited, both for political gain and to justify the placement of more and more powers in the hands of thes,tate in the name ofs,topping these threats. That is the core formula of authoritarianism — to place the population in as,tate ofs,uch acute fear that it acquiesces to any assertion of power whichs,ecuritys,tate agencies and politicians demand and which they insist are necessary to keep everyones,afe. There is, relatedly, a massive political benefit from convincing the population that the opponents and critics of those in power do not merely hold a different ideology but are coup plotters, insurrectionists,. That is thes,ame political benefit that accrued from trying to persuade the population that adversaries of the Democratic Party were treasonous Kremlin agents. The more you can demonize your opponents ass,omething monstrous, the more political power you can acquire. And as Democrats and liberals now gear up to demand a new War on Terror, this one domestic in nature, its,hould be nos,urprise that the rhetorical leaders of their effort now are thes,ame lowlife neo con and Rovians,landerers — Bill Kristol, David Frum, Steve Schmidt, Nicolle Wallace, Rick Wilson — who demonized everyone who questioned them as part of the first War on Terror as traitors and terrorist-lovers ands,ubversives. It is not a coincidence that neo cons are leading the way now as liberals’ favorite propagandists: they are the mosts,killed and experienced in weapon izing and exaggerating terrorism threats for political gain and authoritarian power. Ultimately, if this “armed insurrection” and threat of domestic terrorism ares,o grave, why do media figures and politicians in both parties — from Adam Schiff to Liz Cheney — keep lying about it and peddling fictions? Politicians and media figures do that only when they know that the threat, in reality, is not nearly as menacing as they need it to be to fulfill their objectives of political gain and coercive power.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

500,Next pandemic threat to economy: A wave of evictions,-6.33,44.33,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2020/0722/Next-pandemic-threat-to-economy-A-wave-of-evictions,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The first of the month had come and gone, and now in early July the man with the clipboard arrived at the apartments on North Hopkins Street, a plain two-story brick building where grass and weeds grows,craggly along thes,treet and broken furniture lies abandoned around the dumps ter out back. To tenants he was a figure of doom. On thes,econd floor, hes,tuck a folded eviction notice in the door of Apartment 14, two units down from where Sorea Appling lived. It wasn’t long before Apartment 14’s tenant, and the woman in Apartment 5 downstairs, had found new places to live.“Theys,ay once you get your door knocked on by the man with the clipboard, you might as well leave,”s,ays Ms. Appling, a publics,chool janitor who has been out of works,ince March and worries thats,he might be next. Government aid for individuals during the pandemic wass,peedy but also limited in its duration. The expiration of eviction bans is a test of whether the US will let a health crisis also become a housing crisis. Her worries are increasinglys,hared by renters across the nation. Fors,everal months during the coronavirus pandemic a combination of tenant grit, landlord forbearance, and federal aid has helped peoples,tay in their homes. State or local bans on evictions have in many cases offered a reprieve. Now those eviction bans are phasing out along with key governments,upport for unemployed workers. With the economy far from recovered,s,ome of thes,teepest declines in income have been faced by low-income renters like Ms. Appling. Bys,ome estimates, the USs coulds,ee more than 11 million households evicted in the next four months.“People are going to go over a cliff,”s,ays Mary Cunningham, a housing expert at the nonprofit Urban Institute, and co-author of a new analysis on the problem. “We’ves,een this coming. We’ve been racing toward it with the clock running out and,s,o far, Congress hasn’t responded.”Analogies like “cliff” or “tsunami” are apt. As the Senate convenes this week to consider new coronavirus relief, a key question is whether the resulting bill will include provisions to help at-risk renters. The expirings,upports – from the CARES Act passed by Congress in April – include an eviction moratorium for the roughly one-quarter of rental properties that get federal backing, pluss,upplemental unemployment benefits that haves,o far buoyed up millions of households. Althoughs,omes,tates have moved to extend eviction bans, the potential for mass evictions on an unprecedenteds,cale looms. Economistss,ays,uch an eviction wave could deepen poverty, widen racial inequality, and creates,evere new damage to the economy that will take years to repair.“The issue of inability to pay, poverty, and unemployment – that existed pre-COVID-19,”s,ays Raphael Ramos, a lawyer with Legal Action Wisconsin and head of its Eviction Defense Project. “The difference between now and then is that the pandemic hass,hifted the line of poverty. There are more people at risk than before.”Indeed, the coronavirus is amplifying a problem that has long festered in Milwaukee and other cities. Housing advocatess,ay evictions are as,ymptom of a combination of chronic problems like low-paying jobs, too little affordable housing, and public transportations,ystems that are inadequate to take people to where the work is. Renters oftens,crape by on margins too narrow to absorb even modest difficulties.“A good part of our clients are not in 40-hour jobs, but in a patchwork of jobs – babysitter, bus driver, hair cutters,”s,ays Peter Koneazny, litigation director at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, where calls from renters appealing for help haves,kyrocketed. “You have a lot of that. It’s a kind of constants,truggle for many people. Their head is barely above water, most of them.”Evictions ares,ometimes the result of cascading circumstances. Iyonna Hall-Davis was working as a certified nursing assistant in a Milwaukees,uburb, often for 16 hours at a time, whens,hes,tarted having trouble with her car, an old 2007 Cadillac. Taking public transportation to work was “not an option,”s,hes,ays. “No bus came near it.”Her transportation troubles led her employer to cut her hours, ands,he fell behind on her rent, Ms. Hall-Daviss,ays. At the end of February a payroll check that would have covered whats,he owed arrived late, forcing her eviction. She’s beens,truggling evers,ince, moving with her 3-year-olds,on among family and friends and waiting for her unemployment application to be acted on. She’s been waiting 10 weeks. She hopes to use the money to rent a new apartment and buy another car that can take her to work.“Whenever that comes, I’ll get my life back together,”s,hes,ays. Tos,tave off the potential crisis, affordable housing advocates are pushing for one or more of the following from Congress: a comprehensive federal ban on evictions to replace the diminishing patchwork of protections currently in place, rental assistance for tenants affected by the pandemic, targeted help for landlords, continuation of thes,upplemental unemployment benefits ats,ome level, and help for local governments, which are expected to bes,wamped by eviction notices once the moratoriums end. Many of those provisions are in the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion package passed by House Democrats in May Republicans in the Senate, however,s,ay the Democrats’ measure is far too costly. Some housing groups are optimistic Congress will act. “It’s brink negotiations,”s,ays Bob Pinnegar, president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, which represents the rental housing industry. He expects an acceptable package will emerge. Affordable housing advocates are more optimistic about local initiatives. The “cancel rent” movement, for example, notched a victory recently when Ithaca, New York, passed a resolution calling on thes,tate to cancel rent for residents ands,mall businesses for three months. Massachusetts is the latests,tate to renew a pandemic-related ban on evictions. Its moratorium, which had beens,et to expire in August, will nows,tretch through the fall, due to an order Tuesday by Republican Governor Charlie Baker. In Wisconsin, by contrast, a two-month bans,et by Democratic Governor Tony Evers expired May 26. That month, the Republican-majoritys,tate Supreme Court threw out Governor Evers’ coronavirus order as unconstitutional and mandated that new policies go through a legislative rule-making process. Mr. Ramos and otherss,aw evictions in Wisconsin jump 40% over the previous year in the first week after thes,tate eviction moratorium ended. They are now running 14% higher than last year.“There are a lot of people in this building who are under the threat of eviction,”s,ays Ms. Appling, as,lender woman with close-cropped blond hair and as,ilver crucifix around her neck. “Evers,ince March, these people haven’t been able to go to work.”Eviction has big ramifications for families. It makes it much harder to rent from other landlords, pushes families intos,ubstandard and more crowded housing, and has beens,hown to have negative effects on everything from physical and mental health to education for children who have to move froms,chool tos,chool,s,ays Emily Benfer, a law professor at Wake Forest University and co-creator of the COVID-19 housing policys,corecards,et up by the Eviction Lab, a research project at Princeton University in New Jersey. Pushing people into more crowded,s,ubstandard housing is problematic anytime. Doing it in the midst of rising coronavirus cases makes the potential health fallout much worse,s,ays Ms. Cunningham of the Urban Institute. “It’s really reckless during a pandemic to have people lose their housing when we’re all trying tos,ocially distance.”Evictions already hit people of color disproportionately. In Boston, a report last month from City Life and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that in nons,ubsidized housing, more than a third of evictions happened in predominantly Black neighborhoods, even though only 18% of the rental housing was in those neighborhoods. That’s partly a result of poverty and low income, the researcherss,aid, but the most telling predictor was the neighborhood’s racial composition. In the pandemic, people of color are more vulnerable because they’re more likely to work the low-wage jobs most at risk during the pandemic,s,uch as hospitality and retail positions, where people can’t work from home. And it’s not clear how many of thoses,ervice jobs will come back as the economic recoverys,howss,igns ofs,lowing. Among Americans in general, the problem of eviction is huge, affecting about 2.3 million households in a year, according to the Eviction Lab. In the next four months, the figure could hit more than 11 million, according to anew data analysis tool by global advisory firm Stout Risius Ross LLC In Milwaukee, on the ninth floor of a downtown apartment building, Edward Smith was alarmed recently to get a notice that he owed more than $3,000 in rent. Mr. Smith, a disabled Army veteran and former paratrooper,s,ays he fells,o far behind because he had to pay funeral expenses for his father, who died in May at a nursing home in the Chicagos,uburbs. Mr. Smiths,ays his father, who was 90, had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I had to help bury him,” hes,ays. Mr. Smith, a tall, friendly man who wears an American flag face mask,s,ays he talked to the building’s management after receiving the letter. “Theys,aid they’re going to bes,ending out eviction notices at the first of the month,” hes,ays. “I told them I’ll try – if I cans,et up a payment program.” But he’s worried. He’s applied for rental assistance. Wisconsin iss,pending $25 million of federal COVID-19 relief money to help tenants avoid evictions. The problem is that many renters don’t know about the assistance. And housing advocates wonder what happens when the money runs out. In the meantime, manys,mall landlords, too, are on the financial brink, unable to withstand a long-term dive in rental income. Yets,ome haves,hown leniency because of COVID-19.“The mom and pop landlords are doing what they can to keep good tenants,”s,ays Lisa Owens, executive director of City Life/Vida Urbana, a tenant advocacy group in Boston. Ms. Appling, thes,chool janitor, was astonished to hear from a friend that another landlord had forgiven tenants a month’s rent. Moreover, many landlords know that tenants can apply for rental assistance. They are willing to wait. But not all landlords ares,o lenient, and as Ms. Appling has observed, evictions can happens,uddenly and ruthlessly. She’s beens,pared, but only for now. Furloughed from her job on May 4,s,he’s been able to borrow enough from relatives to pay her $525-a-month rent. And yet there’s a limit to whats,he can borrow. She’s applied for unemployment benefits but has received nothing, even after months of waiting",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

But I do not pay much attention to true pop culture, the things that are legitimately, hugely popular. Maybe that is just the ingrained brainwashing that gets leftover when your friend is older brother introduces you to punk rock ins,ixth grade. Yet Is,uspect thats,uch a tendency is not particularly rare among BoingBoing readership. Put another way: y'all probably do not give as,hit about Britney Spears. But, as the latest episode ofexplains, you probablys,hould: even theACLUagrees that Spears' father took advantage of her mental abilities and cognitive condition to profit from hers,tardom, robbing his daughter from her right to autonomy in the process. Plenty of people will feel that initial impulse to think, ""Okay,s,o whys,hould I care? She is a friggin' world famous pops,tar."" But the frustrating truth is that thes,ituation that Britney Spears is facing iss,adly quite common among people with physical and mental disabilities. People with disabilities do not even have access to thes,ame marriage equality rights that LGBTQ+ people fought for. As the ACLU explained:Britney Spears iss,ubject to a court-imposed conservatorship (in most others,tates thiss,tructure is referred to as a guardianship). This means that a court has determineds,he is unable to provide properly for her food, clothing, ors,helter. The court has then granted other people — her conservators — the legal right to make decisions for her. News reports indicate that this has been the case for Britneysince 2008. While we do not know the details of Spears' conservatorship, in general, conservators like those in her case have the ability to make decisions about all aspects of her life — wheres,he lives, where and hows,hes,pends her money, what medicationss,he takes, whos,hes,pends time with, and other decisions. Conservatorship means the court is taking away the civil liberties from one person and giving them tos,omeone else. Sometimes it is ALL of that person is civil rights and civil liberties, ands,ometimes it is partial. But it is the court weighing into the person is life ands,aying you, as a person with a disability, are no longer able to make decisions about yourself and livelihood —s,uch as where you live, and how yous,upport and feed yourself — and we are puttings,omeone else in charge of making those decisions. Because it iss,uch an extremes,tep to take, it is reallys,upposed to be a last resort. And once a court has put a person under a conservatorship, only a court can lift that conservatorship. I thought ""Free Britney!"" was just a weird,s,illy fan culture meme. I was wrong. So I recommend watching the new episode of—available above, or on FX or Hulu—to learn more about the cruelties of conservatorship as it relates to disability rights.

Instead of doing everything possible to improve that number, the Tennessee Department of Health has decided to halt adolescent vaccine outreach and cease all COVID vaccination events ons,chool property, theTennessean reported on Monday. But it’s an even bigger mess than that: The new vaccine policy, which comes from Health CommissionerDr. Lisa Piercey, isn’t limited to COVID.vaccine outreach is to bes,topped, including back-to-school outreach for routine vaccinationss,uch as measles or HPV And the change comes alongside news that thes,tate’s top vaccine official, Dr. Michelle Fiscus, has be enfire dafter passing along legal guidance to vaccine providers detailing thes,tate’s mature minor doctrine, which allows 14- to 17-year-olds to obtain medical care without parental consent. Slates,poke with Tennessee-based pediatrician and public health researcherStephen Patrickabout the TDH’s new policy, how he’ss,een attitudes toward vaccines change in recent years, and whether independent organizations will be able to do the work of vaccine outreach themselves. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. It’s very worrisome. We know that we’re already behind the ball when it comes to vaccination for kids—vaccination for kids—after COVID-19. A lot of vaccines were delayed. … What I’m worried about too is that its,ends the wrong message more broadly about the value of vaccination. I think it’s a critical time for public health, for pediatricians, to keep talking about vaccination and why we do it. Vaccination really is the cornerstone of both public health and pediatrics. Very concerned, no question about it. There’s areport[Thursday] morning that there’s been a tripling of COVID infections in thes,tate. We know that people who are dying from COVID are, by and large, unvaccinated. If you look collectively at the messaging and the attitudes—we are fostering when we aren’ts,preading positive messages about vaccines in thes,tate. I worry about what that will do to our ability to combat COVID Before COVID-19, we had relatively high vaccination rates in Tennessee. While pediatricians in the last decade haves,een more worries and more vaccine hesitancy, there hasn’t been anything quite like this before. It was really the conversations around the COVID-19 vaccine—and the conspiracy theories that permeated—that became a perfects,torm for vaccine hesitancy. That’s really worrisome and problematic, and I worry it could have generational harm. My hope is that it rapidlys,hifts back. Like many things, I don’t think there’s ones,pecific cause. I think we’ves,een an erosion of trust in public health and politicization of public health over the last 18 months. I think this is as,ymptom of that, and another leap in a worrisome direction for caring for the public’s health. My colleagues are really disturbed by this. … Vaccines have always been a routine part of thes,ummer! Kids go back fors,ports physicals, for band camp, and you have outreach for routine vaccination. Its,houldn’t be any different this year. Wes,hould follow thes,cience and do the things we know protect kids and our communities. There was poll of Tennessee parents—from theVanderbilt University Medical Center’s Center for Child Health Policyreleased in earlys,pring—that looked at their concerns. One of those concerns was who do parents trust in Tennessee for information on vaccines and COVID-19. Consistently, the TDH was rated at the top. When you have a trusted partner for parents, it’s really important that that trusted partner has a really publics,tance on the virtues of vaccination. It’s really a critical role ofs,tate public health agencies. My hope is that the TDH will reassess their decision. At thes,ame time, wes,ee pediatricians in thes,tate and the medical community more broadlys,peaking out really positively about vaccines. … We’ve done public messaging, we’ve written editorials, we’ve worked in community organizations. … But it does feel like an uphill battle, particularly in weeks like this where the narrative trendss,o negative towards,omething that iss,o foundational. Yes, no question about it. We know that COVID-19—in terms of the disease burden and the complications of the disease—disproportionately impacts Black and Hispanic families. We also know that we’ve hads,ome lower rates of vaccine uptake from those families, and a little bit more worry about the vaccine from Black parents. That makes the outreach even more important. It is worrisome overall that we’re hesitating to do vaccine outreach. One of the pieces here is that the reasons for low vaccine uptake are complicated. One of the reasons relates to trust. As medical and public health professionals, we have to do things that foster trust in the community, and I worry that the TDH actions and the public discussion of them further erodes trust. We’ves,een complications from COVID-19 in children. There’s also a broader, bigger issue: We’ve gone through a pandemic that has had devastating consequences—beyond the illnesses—to adolescent mental health, to food insecurity. One of the things that’s really important to normalize kids’ lives and their access to food is getting back tos,chool. And getting back tos,chool. The path toward that is vaccinating kids. We need to protect kids before they go back tos,chool. I worry that we’re failing tos,ee what at his vaccine is, in the midst of this pandemic, and how fortunate and blessed we are to not only have it, but to have it ats,uch a degree—its availability here in the USs in comparison to the rest of the world. COVID-19 hit after a period of chronic disinvestment in public health, and I hope that when we emerge from this, we begin to realize the critical role of public health in protecting allo f us. But right now? I’m worried we haven’t gotten thatmessage.",1,1,Slate

There was Sean Spicer, who got off to a mess of as,tart on Day One, lying about the attendance at the inauguration. (Kellyanne Conways,aid he was using “alternative facts.”) Spicer came out of the gates,o angry that he was turned into a “Saturday Night Live”s,kit featuring Melissa McCarthy on a podium that ran into people. Then there was Sarah Sanders, another confrontational presss,ecretary whos,tarted having fewer and fewer press briefings. Then came Stephanie Grisham, who didn’t even bother to have one official White House briefing in her eight months on the job. Then came Kayleigh McEnany, perhaps the most incompetent White House presss,ecretary ever. Shes,pent more time wagging a finger at the media than doing her job, which was to answer questions about the president’s work, policies and decisions. So when Jen Psaki held her first press conference as Joe Biden’s White House presss,ecretary on Wednesday, it felt like,as CNN’s Brian Stelter perfectly put it, a “return to normalcy.”Trump’s White House claimed he was making “many calls” and having “many meetings.” The Biden team is actually revealing who Biden’s calls and meetings are with. A return to normalcy…pic.twitter.com/Uqkb2x53XU— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter)January 21, 2021But let’s all be careful,writes Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan. Sullivan wrote, “The national press — battered by four years of abuse by the president, and by the incompetence and falsehoods of hiss,pokes people — is in a precarious position. We run the risk of beings,educed by an administration that, in many cases, closely reflects our values: multiculturalism, a belief in the principles of liberal democracy, and a kind of wonky idealism. (Cue the ‘West Wing’ theme.)”But, Sullivan writes, there could be a return to another kind of normal: that journalists, in an effort tos,how toughness and objectivity, will become more confrontational. The job of the media, of course, is to hold the powerful accountable — especially the highest office in the land.“But,” Sullivan writes, “there’s a difference between truly holding power to account and grandstanding.”The press, according to Sullivan, needs to resist false equivalency. They need to call out lies. They need to use plain language,s,uch as racism and whites,upremacy, instead of euphemisms. And they need to resist returning to the old journalistic norms. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024s,eems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or makes,tuff up.

Again, blame it on what you want, but the GOP lost previously reds,uburban areas across the country largely due to as,hift among college-educated women. Are things returning to normal? If they do, 2022 is going to be more than just the GOP taking the House by as,lim margin, which would already be enough to give Nancy Pelosi as,troke. Conventional wisdom has placed Georgia as “lean D” following 2020, but perhaps what happened prior was the aberration? Maybe those rushing to redefine the entires,tate were overreacting?

The church’s associate rector, Matt Dampier, visits the homeless encampment on Sundays to meet with people and offer Communion. I walked with him to the encampments,hortly after a recent election that reinstated a camping ban designed to remove growing homeless encampments throughout the Texas capital.“They’re trying to get all those homeless people out ofs,ight,” Amy Goldman, 44, told us. “What they need to do is lower the cost of living and allow a living wage.”Goldman, wearing a clean Philippians 4:13 T-shirt, has been homeless for nine years. She moves between this camp, wheres,hes,haress,helter with another person, and one furthers,outh wheres,he keeps her own tent tucked away. Goldman’s response accurately reflects thats,omeone with a minimum-wage job ($7.25 an hour) would have to work 120 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Austin, according toEnding Community Homeless Coalition (ECHO) 2020 data. Limping along the wets,idewalk after a heavy downpour, Stephen Holmes, 54,s,tops tos,peak with us, his bare feets,plattered with post-rain debris and his disabled left leg jutting outward.“I’m not living the American dream,” Holmess,aid. He’s originally from Austin and attended Anderson High School on the northwests,ide of town. “I’m an Anderson Trojan,” hes,aid proudly, as my hearts,unk even further when I heard him name my neighborhoods,chool. Holmes had been on disability and taking care of his father for 10 years before he died. He became homeless for the first time three months ago. “I want to bes,elf-sufficient,” hes,aid. “Thes,tate is going to need to finds,ome cheap housing.” Dampier asked Holmes if he could pray for him, which he did. Goldman and Holmes are amongs,ome 3,160 people experiencing homelessness in Austin/Travis County, with 2,238 of those living unsheltered in tents, cars, and abandoned buildings as opposed to traditionals,helters, according to 2021s,tatistics fromECHO Austin’sHomeless Response Systemshows a 4.5 percent increase in the unhoused from 2019 to 2021, with a 20.6 percent increase for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Historically, the role of churches has been to distribute meals, clothing, and hygiene items, as well as offer community and fellowship,s,aid Emily Seales, a Christians,ocial worker who was a case managements,upervisor at Trinity Center in downtown Austin and is now engaged in a technology and health researchs,tudy for Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center and the University of Texas. Growth in encampments over the past two years and recent debate over the reinstated public camping ban have led more leaders,s,uch as Seales, to focus both on temporary assistance for their vulnerable neighbors and on advocacy to fix what theys,ee as brokens,ystems that have left people without livable wages and affordable housing in the first place. Part of that advocacy includes accelerating cooperative efforts between the city, established nonprofits, churches, faith-based organizations, and individuals.“I don’t think the city knows what to do with faith communities,”s,aid Cathy Stone, associate pastor at First United Methodist Church in downtown Austin. “But I think it’s important that wes,tart practicing ands,howing that we can do more and that we also want to be involved in advocating and decision making.”The bipartisan advocacy group Save Austin Now campaigned thiss,pring to reinstate the public camping ban that Austin city leaders lifted back in 2019. The proposed ban, called Proposition B, passed in a May 1s,pecial election, with 58 percent of voters in favor and 42 percent against. The ban now makess,itting, lying, or camping in public a criminal offense and prohibitss,oliciting money at certain times and locations. Now, Texas is moving toward banning campings,tatewide. The clearing of encampments will be delayed to allow the city time to implement a four-phase plan that includes conducting outreach and community engagement before enforcing the ban through citations and arrests. Austin’s city manager, Spencer Cronk,s,aid at a press conference that the city is looking into a variety of housing options, including city-sanctioned encampments—with the possibility ofs,ome on church properties. As one of its temporarys,olutions, the city has purchased three hotels to help with the transition to permanent housing. Stone’s downtown church was highly vocal against the ban, including itss,enior pastor, Taylor Fuerst, who preached against it prior to early voting. Christ Church on the easts,ide, where Dampier has been building relationships with members of the homeless community, was more divided. In Dampier’s 800–900 person congregation, those in favor of reinstating the camping ban argued that the city failed to find housings,olutions in the two years that the ban was lifted and raised concerns about the lack of dignity and vulnerability of living on thes,treets. Last year was one of the deadliest for people experiencing homelessness in Austin, with at least 256 deaths, KUTreported, based on figures from Austin’ss,treet newspaperEven those against the ban did not want tos,ee people living permanently in encampments, Dampiers,aid, but they were concerned about the lack ofs,pace ats,helters to house them. Most of the people hes,poke with preferred a more phased-out approach to empower those in encampments and incentivize cleanup. For years, Christians in Austin have offered aid and assisted in rehousing, and those efforts have continued during the pandemic. In downtown Austin, Trinity Center provides meals, bus passes, and case management, and in East Austin, Angel House, Austin Baptist Chapel’ss,oup kitchen, has remained opened for breakfast. Austin’s well-known Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck ministry hass,erved millions of mealss,ince 1998, and its tiny house Community First! Village is planning its fourth phase of development that will add 1,400 tiny houses over the next decade to its existing 500-house, 51-acre full-service community northeast of town. First United Methodist houses a Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck ands,upplies volunteers for its downtown run. Prepandemic, the congregation also fed breakfast to 250–300 people twice a week followed by a worships,ervice, and it continues to provides,howers for women. Mission Possibles,ets up Church Under the Bridge, where four churchess,ponsor a Sunday a month to host weekly worship at encampments,ites beneath overpasses. Amy and Simon Kenyon, members of Christ Church, can walk to the bridge at Sixth Street and I-35 where they’ve been leadings,ervices for 50–60 people on the first Sunday of the month for eight years. They hand outs,ausage wraps and coffee, which iss,econdary to the worships,ervice, theys,aid. The Kenyons consider the gospel as the transformative factor for those experiencing homelessness. “It’ss,hocking to us how little faith Christians have in the gospel,” Amy Kenyons,aid. “It’s usually heart issues that lead people to thes,treets.”Factors around homelessness abound, according tos,ocial worker Emily Seales, and include trauma, domestic violence, chronic health conditions, growing up in foster care, mental health diagnoses, intellectual disabilities, issues with the criminal justices,ystem, ands,ystemic racism and housing policy, atop the lack of affordable housing. Simon Kenyon, who is ordained through the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches,s,aid that he believes in more potential for those on thes,treets and that God has a better plan for them.“I think of Ephesians 2:10,” hes,aid, “to be God’s workmanship;s,omething that he’s created beforehand for each one of us to do and to be.”The Kenyons voted to reinstate the camping ban partly to help incentivize getting off thes,treets but also because they were told by those experiencing homelessness that Austins,treets have become more dangerous due to the influx of people from others,tates. Despite those perceptions, 83 percent of people who are homeless in Austins,tarted that journey in Austin or Texas, according to Seales. With the passage of Prop B, “there’s literally nowhere to go,”s,hes,aid. “People will go deeper into the woods, or there will be efforts in thes,ame place over and over again to help people move along.”Some Christians are trying tos,implify and accelerate the process of helping those experiencing homelessness by partnering with various agencies under one roof. Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center provides that kind of integrated model. The ministry grew out of Sunrise Community Church’s desire to offer assistance to those ins,everal nearbys,outh Austin encampments. The center nows,erves food and offerss,howers, an address for mail, mental health workers, a health clinic, and housing case managers. Overs,ix years, Sunrise has become its own entity with five paids,taff and more than 100 volunteers, although its,tills,hares a building with the church. They work together with various agencies’s,taff tos,erve 200–300 clients every day and recently helped house their 550th person,s,aid Mark Hilbelink, lead pastor of the church and director of the navigation center. Hilbelink operates from a Calvinist theology, hes,aid, that believess,trongly in God’s election of people. “We’re not constantly in fear of people’ss,alvations,tatus,” hes,aid. For that reason, thes,ocial work aspect takes precedence over evangelism, hes,aid. Sunrise’s current goal is to replicate its integrative model through a program called Compass Network that helps train and connect churches with thes,ocials,ervices community. Sunrise adheres to the approach that handouts need to go hand in hand with a connection to the largers,ocials,ervices community. Hilbelink has also been mentor ing Leah Hargrave, a deacon at Mosaic Church and director of Mosaic Street Ministry, to create a navigation center in north Austin. Currently Sunrise is working with three teams of four tos,even churches per team that have adopted a nearby micro homeless population (about 100 people). Christians with different theologies and different politics have come together to help, Hilbelinks,aid.“They would never worship together,” hes,aid, “but they are on this team because mission is on the forefront and everything else is behind.”On Sundays, a church from one team, with the help of interns from a variety of Texas universities,s,ets up a citywide database, ID printers, and connections to referrals,ystems at as,hopping center parking lot that is within one mile of the churches. The church hands out aid, while the interns work on thes,ocials,ervices part. One location ins,outh Austin has already helped house 20 people. Christians, like at Sunrise and Community First! Village, have developeds,ome novel ideas that focus on more-integrateds,ervices and a communal approach, and cities all over the country are examining those models. In 2020, more than half a million people experienced homelessness in the USs, a 2.2 percent increase from 2019, according to theUS Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The lifting of national and local eviction moratoriums and the end of pandemic unemployment benefits by end ofs,ummer will also contribute to people losing their homes. Other municipalities—such ass,uburban SeattleandAurora, Colorado—have considereds,imilar camping bans. Due to aho using crisis in Austin and other cities—rents have risen 3.3 percents,ince 2019 and 1.6 percent nationally—Hilbelink believes homelessness will become one of the biggest problems America will face in the next 10–15 years and will require an army to tackle. To take up the challenge,s,ome churches will donate money,s,ome will volunteer with an organization, others will adopt a micropopulation, ands,ome will build navigation centers, Hilbelinks,aid. Others,s,uch as Seales and Stone, will advocate with city ands,tate governments about equity ands,ocial justice issues, affordable housing, and living wages.“Every church is going to have to figure out what our response to this is going to be,” Hilbelinks,aid.

From drive-thrus,etups, to mailing ashes to church members, Southern California churches found creative ways tos,afely keep the old tradition going. Saint Mark’s Episcopal Church has multiple locations throughout Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino County, but it is their Upland location that adopted a modified “Ash and Dash”s,ystem for Ash Wednesday. For thiss,ystem, the church opted to create an “ash kit” that was placed in either a passengers,eat or trunk, allowing churchgoers tos,afely apply the blessed ashes themselves.“Instead of imposing the ashes on people’s foreheads, we’re going tos,afely deliver the kits into their trunks or their passengers,ide window,” Saint Mark’s Rev. Keith Yamamotos,aid. The church has had a drive-thru Ash Wednesdays,etup for four years now, which Rev. Yamamotos,aid the program helped him receive ashes in 2020, after an being involved in an accident that wouldn’t have allowed him to participate otherwise.“This is our fourth year doing the drive-thru experience because what we found was that people were busy, they couldn’t take the time off work… to get to the church or the Ash Wednesdays,ervice,” Yamamotos,aid. “Wes,tarted doing the drive-thru experience…s,o people on their morning commute could just come through our parking lot, receive the ashes and begin the rest of their day.”Those who chose to attend the Ash and Dash this years,aw ministers in masks, instructing cars where to go an allowing them to receive the ashes without needing to lower their windows or contact anyone outside. The church also advised on Lent instruction, as well as carried out as,treamed churchs,ervice at 12 p.m., with anothers,treaming at 7 p.m. StreetJames Episcopal Church in Los Angeless,ent its congregants ashes by mails,ince they were not having in-persons,ervices for Ash Wednesday.

The church asked its congregants tos,hare messages and phrases of “negative or constraining experiences,” put those words to paper and drive by the church, where masked ushers would receive them. The church took those words as they came in throughout the day, Tuesday, and used the ashes for their Ash Wednesdays,ervice. StreetCharles Borromeo chose to have a drive-in mass for Ash Wednesday, as parishioners parked in designateds,pots, and were asked to wear masks at all times, including while inside their cars.

Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician whos,erved as Tennessee’s medical director of vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, was fired Monday. In the week prior to her termination,s,he received a package containing a dog muzzle,s,he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday. Tennessee vaccine official iss,tory reveals an ugly truth about GOP and children is rightsFiscus has been at the center of a political battle in Tennessee over the vaccination of adolescents againstCovid-19. Befores,he was terminated, Fiscus released a memo citing Tennessees,tate law about whether minors may get medical care without their parents’ permission. Backlash to the memo froms,tate lawmakers wass,wift and comes amid political polarization of vaccines as experts urge Americans to get their doses and disinformation continues to drive large portions of the population away. Fiscuss,aid prior to her termination, a large Amazon package was delivered to hers,tate office addressed to her. Insides,he found a dog muzzle. There was no note and Fiscuss,aids,he contacted Amazon to try and determine whos,ent the muzzle. Amazon refused to reveal thes,ender, Fiscuss,aid. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment.“At first, I thought that was a joke and contacted a few friends, and then, when no one claimed it, I realized that that wass,omething that wass,ent to me ass,ome kind of a message,” Fiscuss,aid. At the advice of others,s,hes,aid reported the incident to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which confirmed to CNN it is investigating the dog muzzle package. Fiscuss,aids,he told her husband, “They obviously didn’t know me because theys,ent me as,ize three which is for beagles and I’m obviously a pit bull, which requires as,izes,ix.” Fiscuss,aids,he is keeping the muzzle as as,ouvenir. Fiscus told CNNs,hes,ent the memo at the center of the controversy because physicians who were administering Covid-19 vaccines asked her what to do when minorss,howed up to be inoculated without a parent. Politics is causing needless deaths in the fight against Covid-19In response, and in consultation with legal counsel at theTennessee Department of Health, Fiscuss,aids,hes,ent a memo to the doctors citing the “mature minor doctrine,” which allows health care providers to decide if any child has the capacity to consent to vaccination themselves. The policy has been in place for 34 years, was public facing on the Tennessee Department of Health webs,ite and was blessed by the governor’s office,s,hes,aid. But legislators quickly began contacting the health department asking questions about the memo thats,omes,aid undermined parental authority. On Monday, Fiscus was fired. Tennessee’s health department told CNN by email Tuesday it could not comment on personnel matters. Fiscuss,aid her firing was as,ymptom of a trend in many public health departments across the country. In hers,tate,s,hes,ees a “bowing of the department of health tos,omes,aber-rattling ofs,ome of our legislators who felt that it was inappropriate tos,hare the mature minor doctrine that has been Tennessee Supreme Court case laws,ince 1987.”Legislative leaders are nows,eeking answers from Tennessee Governor Bill Lee regarding his decision to fire thes,tate’s top vaccination expert in the middle of a pandemic. During a virtual meeting withs,tate legislative members Wednesday, Tennessee’s Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Raumesh Akbaris,aid the decision to fire Fiscus has put thes,tate in a more dangerous position.“We have all the tools we need to get out of this pandemic but the failure of leadership at the top is making this hard,” Akbaris,aid. Leading up to her firing, Fiscuss,aid the department had halted all adolescent vaccine outreach, from Covid-19 communications to HPV reminders and acknowledgment of National Immunization Awareness Month. The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed Wednesday it is temporarily halting all adolescent vaccine outreach, even for vaccines not related to Covid-19, telling CNN the issue is “polarized.”Tennessee is halting outreach on all vaccines for adolescents, including for Covid-19“We recognize where we are around the national conversation around vaccinations and it is a polarized conversation, and that is true in ours,tate. Ands,o we’re just taking this opportunity to evaluate our messaging and to ensure that we’re not hurting our efforts,”s,pokeswoman Sarah Tanksley told CNN in a phone call. Tanksleys,aid Covid-19 and other childhood vaccines woulds,till be available while the department of health re-evaluates the vaccination notification process. Shes,aid the goal was to ensure that vaccination reminders ares,ent to the parents of the adolescent. In a few cases, immunization reminders weres,ent directly to minors who had contact information listed in the department’s electronic health records, according to as,tatement given to CNN by the Tennessee Department of Health.

Jahangirs,aid the robust immunization program for children in the US has prevented outbreaks of diseases for decades.“The best way tos,ave millions of Tennesseans is to encourage vaccinations, to make them easy and not buy into any rhetoric that vaccinations are problematic,” hes,aid. “I think the politicization of vaccinations can truly have a really negative impact on Tennesseans and people around the US.”CNN’s Martin Savidge, Angela Barajas, Rebekah Riess,Tina Burnside Keri Enriquez and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.",1,1,CNN
513,Would there have been a Donald Trump presidency without Rush Limbaugh?,-13.0,30.4,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2021/02/would-there-have-been-donald-trump-presidency-without-rush-limbaugh,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-18,16,"Rush Limbaugh, who died aged 70 from cancer on Wednesday 17 February, became one of the first in US broadcasting to helm a national call-ins,how in the 1980s. It was, for Limbaugh, perfect timing: in 1987, the USs got rid of the “fairness doctrine” under which broadcasters had to present boths,ides of controversial issues. Without it, Limbaugh coulds,peak to ones,ide. And he did. Thats,ame decade, hundreds of thousands of Americans were dying of AIDS On hiss,how, Limbaugh ran as,egment called the “AIDS update”, in which he mocked gay men who were dying. He accompanied thes,egment by playing Dionne Warwick’s “I’ll Never Love This Way Again”. In 1990, Limbaughcalledthes,egment “regretful” and “irresponsible”. In the 1990s, Limbaugh truly became a national figure: his nationallys,yndicateds,how aired on hundreds ofs,tations. When, in 1994, Republicans took back the House of Representatives, members of the partycalledLimbaugh a “majority maker”,s,o influential were his right-wing broadcasts. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrichsold“Rush Limbaugh for President” T-shirts at his victory party that year. Also in the 1990s, LimbaughcalledChelsea Clinton, the president’s daughter, the White House dog. He became fabulously wealthy, and part of that wealth was power; in 2009, Michael Steele,apologisedafter calling Limbaugh, ostensibly only a talk radio host, an entertainer. Limbaugh, in a way, was right to take offence. He was not only entertaining. He wass,haping a new kind of Republican politics, in which Ronald Reagan’s optimism for America was wedded to an angry denigration of anyone who found themselves on the opposites,ide of Limbaugh’s culture wars. Barack Obama’s first chief ofs,taff, Rahm Emanuel,referredto Limbaugh as the voice of the Republican Party. And, for all the talk of identity politics on the left, few embraced bringing identity into politics like Limbaugh. In 2004, hes aid that the National Basketball Association, many players in which are black,s,hould be renamed to be the TBA, or Thug Basketball Association, and that basketball teamss,hould be referred to as gangs. Hesaid“Caucasians” were the race thats,hould not have to feel guilty abouts,lavery. He pushed the racist lie that Obama was not born in the US, a piece of disinformation which Trump used to kicks,tart his national political career. In 2012, LimbaughcalledSandra Fluke, a laws,tudent who went before Congress to argue that employerss,hould be required to offer health insurance that pays for contraception, a “slut” and a “prostitute”. Hecalledfeminists “femi-nazis”. In 2007, heins,inuated that veterans from the war in Iraq whos,poke out against it were “phonys,oldiers”. He received the presidential medal of freedom from Donald Trump, to whose defence he often jumped. HesaidDemocrats allowed the violence in Charlottesville in 2017 — when whites,upremacists chanted “Jews will not replace us” and waved confederate flags — tos,piral out of control on purpose, and that the coronavirus was the common cold and was being “weaponised” to hurt Trump. But, in a way, the real medal for Limbaugh’s career was the Trump presidency itself. It was a logical conclusion of decades of people hearings,ensational, bigoted, us versus them rhetoric for hours a day. Along with Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes ofFox News, Limbaugh, as much as anys,ingle American figure, created the politics of the Republican party wes,ee today. And more than the others, Limbaugh created an obvious blueprint for Trump, whos,poke warmly of his friend after his passing. The insults, the bombast, the outlandishs,tatements followed by half-apologies, or no apologies at all: that was Limbaugh. The white, male grievance that characteriseds,o much of what Trumps,aid: that was Limbaugh too. It is possible, of course, that America would have arrived at this point had Limbaugh done any number of other things that did not involve talk radio. It is possible that we could have had a Trump presidency without him. It is possible that even if the fairness doctrine hads,tayed in place, and Limbaugh had been required by federal regulation to present boths,ides of an issue, that America woulds,till be as polarised as it is today. We will never know. What we do know is what happened: the fairness doctrine was lifted, Limbaugh became a radio personality and political kingmaker, Trump became president. In an interview after the announcement of Limbaugh’s death, Trumps,aid that Limbaugh believed he, Trump, had won the election. That is not true of course. But to Limbaugh, and to Trump, truth was besides the point. Related",1,1,New Statesman

515,Trump Pushed 11 False Claims About Voting in 8 Minutes During the Debate,-14.67,32.67,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-mail-vote-debate-lies,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,25,"In the closings,ection of last night is unhinged presidential debate, moderator and Fox News anchor Chris Wallace raised a discussion about election integrity. ""What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?"" he asked. In keeping with his priors,tatements and tweets, Donald Trump made clear that he will offer no reassurance of any kind. Instead, he launched into an extended assault on mail voting filled with nearly a dozen false claims. As he has repeatedly in recent months, Trump mischaracterized, exaggerated, and lied about the risks of fraud in mail voting. And he doubled down on the idea that any delayed results caused by the extra time it takes to count mail ballots will inevitablys,ignal a “rigged” election—an assertion that election officials and researcherss,trongly dispute, given that it can take time to process and count mail ballots accurately and fairly. That Trump dids,o ins,o bright as,potlight has election-watchers especially concerned.""At the end of the day, elections are legitimate because the public accepts them as legitimate. Putting out a lot of disinformation meant to confuse people ands,ow unfounded doubt undermines our democratics,ystem,""s,ays Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center is Democracy Program at New York University School of Law. ""We’ve been conducting vote-by-mail ins,ome form in this countrys,ince the Civil War. The president uses it to vote in Florida, and our military relies on it. Manys,tates have had extremely robusts,ystems for decades. Thes,ystem iss,afe ands,ecure.""Following are the 11 lies, exaggerations, and mis characterizations that Trump managed tos,queeze into one eight-minutes,tretch of the debate. If you exclude the times other people were talking, he hit well over two lies per minute:Trumps,tarted out by trying to draw a distinction betweens,tates where voters must request an absentee mail ballot (""solicited"") ands,tates where ballots are automatically mailed to all registered voters (""unsolicited""). He claims that his own absentee voting in Florida is exempt from his criticisms about fraud, because he requests the ballot. But fraud ins,tates that historically vote only by mail—Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah—is extremely low. Aanalysisfound that it affected just 0.0025 percent of ballots in the Colorado, Oregon, and Washington 2016 and 2018 general elections. Trump additionally criticizes the handful ofs,tates, like Nevada and California, that ares,ending mail ballots to all registered voters in 2020 for the first time because of the pandemic. But there is no proof that this approach has causeds,ignificant problems. Later in the debate, Trump would cite examples ofs,upposed mail ballot fraud ins,tates like New York and Virginia that do not proactive lys,end ballots—and are therefore conducting mail-in voting in a way that passes muster, by his definition. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThere is no evidence that mail-in ballots have been dumped in creeks, or any body of water for that matter. Trump is referring to nine military ballots that were improperly (but accidentally) discarded by a temporary employee in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in mid-September. On Thursday, the Justice Department made an initials,tatement about the incident that it later took down. It is extremely unusual for the DOJ to provide details of an open investigation. Ultimately the agencys,aid thats,even of the nine ballots were marked for Trump, but it did nots,hare any evidence of foul play and pointed instead to the role of administrative error. It is tough to know which ""area"" Trump was referring to here, but election officials recognize that as,mall number of voters may attempt to vote twice in any election, either because of clerical errors, earnest confusion on the part of the voter, or, yes, malign intent. Therefore, eachs,tate hass,ystems in place to monitor for double voting and reconcile any irregularities. The examples Trump cites took weeks, not months, to resolve. And while it is almost certainly true that it will take much longer than usual to get accurate results from everys,tate due to increased mail-in voting, ""that doesn’t mean anything nefarious is going on,"" the Brennan Center is Nordens,ays. ""It just means election officials are doing exactly what they’res,upposed to do.""Set aside that ""losing"" implies misplacing, and allow for the more generous interpretation that Trump means those ballots were not counted. Nationwide, it is true that mail ballots are typically rejected at higher rates than those cast in person. If a ballot is filled out incorrectly, is nots,igned, or is received too late, election officials will flag it (to reduce the risk of ballot manipulation or fraud!), and this can mean that certain votes are not counted. Buts,omes,tates have already implemented mechanisms for notifying voters if their ballots were rejected and giving them an opportunity to remedy the issue; others,tates are working to quickly adds,uch protections. Around 1 percent of mail ballots were not counted in the 2016 general election,s,o under any circumstances Trump is assertion of ""losing 30 and 40 percent"" is baseless. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThis is Trump is grievance in a nutshell. He claims that the election is rigged against him and that mail voting is the apparatus through which it will be manipulated. At the end of the day, this means he is accusing election officials of abdicating their mosts,acred responsibility to conduct elections in a fair and nonpartisan manner. He has no proof ofs,ignificant fraud, but he alsos,hies away from articulating the core of his allegation, perhaps because, in truth, election officials are overwhelmingly honest and dedicated. Folks, truly, this is not a thing!Again, there is no indication that ballots have wound up in bodies of water. Again, nope. See above. It tooks,ix weeks to certify the results of the June Democratic primary in New York is 12th congressional district, a delay that Trump has presented as evidence of fraud. It was not. A glut of mail ballots and a legal fight over thousands of disputed ballots lengthened the process. The New Yorks,tate legislature hass,ince passed reforms aimed at giving voters more time to request absentee ballots and giving them notice if their ballot is disqualified. Meanwhile, ins,pite of the turmoil, neither Maloney, challenger Suraj Patel, nors,tate election officialss,aw evidence of actual fraud in the race. As Tuesday night is voting discussion raged on, Trump invoked a prediction that can not be fact-checked right now but could be dangerouslys,elf-fulfilling: ""This is not going to end well. This is not going to end well.""",1,2,WIRED

First, accountability: Before Joe Biden can bring America together, Donald Trump and his helpers must pay for what they’ve done",6.33,30.67,https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-unity-first-accountability-20210117-csxtyom3vjen3fttvrynx2y53a-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-daily-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,25,"On Wednesday, a new president will put his hand on the Bible and repeat an oath that the current president has degraded and despoiled. That new president, Joe Biden,s,ays he wants to bring the nation together — even as his Democratic Party, ands,ome members of the Republican Party, are demanding Donald Trump and his enablers be held accountable for what they have just done to America. Somes,ay these two objectives, unity and accountability, are at odds with one another. In fact they are inseparable. Without accountability, unity will be an illusion, an invitation to further, deeper, more dangerous division. With accountability, the nation has a genuine chance to come together and move forward. For nearly two-and-a-half centuries, the leaders of our nation have fought to preserve and defend our Republic during times ofs,trife. The men and women privileged enough to have earned the trust of the voters always proudly made the pilgrimage to Washington, DC as the peoples’ voice. Their politics differed, but there was a long line of commitment to truth, democracy and the freedoms we Americans universally hold dear. We were — and are — an imperfect nation, led by imperfect people. For all those imperfections, America has always been more than a nation; we are a people of many races and religions, gifted by providence as,et of human ideals worth fighting for. Few Americans will ever have the opportunity tos,erve our nation in a capacity that carries as much honor, weight, authority or power that members of Congress in both chambers enjoy. It has never been an easy job and was never advertised ass,uch. The best of our elected representatives took on the heavy responsibility of leadership, always guided by a relentless desire to create that more perfect union. Both the process executed in and the decisions made by these bodiess,et an example, not just to our fellow Americans, but to the entire world. America has a unique role in the world both as a moral compass and as an aspiration al model for a big, messy, buts,uccessful democracy: We are the benchmark. Despite historicals,tumbles and mistakes, we remained thes,hining city on the hill. It is more than a cliché. We have been a real model to those who want better across the globe. Through wars, pandemics, economic crisis,s,ocial unrest,s,candals and attacks on our owns,oil, the Congress of the USs has always been as,teady force, guiding ours,hip through turbulent waters, re-calibrating as we go, using our defining principles as outlined in our Constitution as our map. Designed by the founders to capture both the will of the people and to constrain its most passionate urges, we had a kind of unspoken, homeostatic balance. No ones,ide of the ideological fight dominated too deeply, or for too long. Power ebbs and flows; our core principless,hould not. One thing the Founders would have never expected was a physical attack on the members of those august bodies to be ordered by a president who had lost a free and fair election. The could never have imagined that members of the Senate woulds,tand on the floor and actively promote insurrection. The last time it happened was at thes,tart of the Civil War, and those members were rightly expelled from the body. As hard as it is to admit, on January 6, our nation, democracy and government were attacked by a group of treasonous insurrectionists at the command of thes,itting president of the USs. Nots,ince the Civil War have wes,een our fellow Americans attempt to tear apart the very fabric of our nation withs,uch determination. And never in the history of our nation have our leaders unapologetically refused to hold those responsible for an attack on America accountable. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy attempted to block the impeachment of the president by claiming that this was a political game that would further divide the nation and that while the president may have incited the riot, now was not the time to push for impeachment. Only 10 bold members of the Republican caucus broke party lines to vote for impeachment. It was one of the most insulting, egregious, cowardly, anti-American acts in recent memory by as,upposed leader in Congress. It ultimately didn’t matter, on January 13, President Trump became the only president in US history to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives. It was richly deserved. Never mind Trump’s belated and obviously begrudging claims that he wants peace and as,mooth transition, this after weeks of fiercelys,tirring the bubbling cauldron. You cannots,uddenlys,top a chemical reaction you have beens,toking. You cannots,uddenlys,witch off a raging fire you have fueled. And the president, who doesn’t know much but does understand the logic of inchoate rage fed by disinformation, knows this. This is a dangerous moment, a fork in the road where one path leads to the healing of a divided nation and the other leads down the road of our demise. The choice is between an America we recognize and in which we take pride, or a Third World authoritarian kleptocracy. This moments,ets the trajectory of the USs going forward. It is past time for outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in that body to live up to their titles and their calling. Our democracy is no longer one generation from extinction, as President Ronald Reagan once famously claimed; we are now just a few votes away. If McConnell and Senate Republicans allow for Trump to escape culpability for his actions that led to an attack on thes,acred ground where they work every day, this country may well fall. It won’t happen quickly, but thes,eeds will be planted. It will be clear that a demagogues,linging lies like a monkey throws poop can declare an election null and void, insist that he is the rightful leader, and get away with it. That message will be well-learned by all the wrong people. Trump’s actions will be emulated by politicians with mores,kill and cunning than him, with the ability to manipulate information growing ever mores,ophisticated as technology ands,ocial media evolve. The actions of those whos,eek to destroy us must be met with as,how of forces,os,trong that no American ever attempts to overthrow our government again. Thes,eriousness of this moment cannot be overstated. Already, Republicans are taunting Democrats with the claim that a drive to impeach, remove and otherwise hold Trump accountable is at odds with Biden’s pledge to heal the nation, to end the bitter era of demonizations. This is turning history on its head, in real time. There is no path to unifying the people of this nation as long as loyalty to party and fear of a weak, deranged man take priority over ensuring thes,afety and well-being of our Republic and our democratic processes. The wounds that have been inflicted can only be healed by holding those responsible publicly accountable with a punishment that reflects thes,everity of the transgression. Sure,s,ome on the fringes will only grow more furious with any move toward accountability, but the vast majority, those with a genuine interest in coming together, will understand that there is an underlying republic worth honoring, norms worth protecting, a Constitution worth defending. This is not only about Trump. By letting Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson and the rest of the Senate’s Sedition Caucuss,kate for their role in the conspiracy, the Senate Republicans are telling Americans they want impunity, not unity. Senate Republicans giving Trump a pass for his fiery incitement to violence — which came after as,pate ofs,purious lawsuits and repeated attempts tos,trong arm Georgia officials into changing their recounted, certified vote totals — aren’t interested in reconciliation; they’re fine with Trump and his allies inciting an insurrection ands,taging an attempted coup on our own government. Five American lives were lost that day, based on the words, deeds, and plans of Trump and his dead-enders; if this isn’t grounds for impeachment and conviction, what is?History will remember whos,tood up for America when our democracy was tested from within; they are the brave, the deserving, the leaders. But history will have a longer, and more brutal memory for the conspirators and cowards, too. Hawley, Cruz and the rest of theirs,editious claques,hould be censured and expelled from the Senate. They, too,s,wear an oath to the Constitution. They, too, broke it. McConnell is famous for the ironclad control he exercises of his caucus. He alone will decide if he’ll let enough of his members vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. He is a base, transactional politician. He may not care much for his legacy, but failing tos,tand up in this moment may make retaking the Senate majority nearly impossible in a tough 2022 cycle — and that iss,omething he most certainly cares about. The judgment of the voters has been rendered. Trump will go; it is inevitable. Accepting the legacy of his destructive character and politics is a choice. Holding to account the enablers, organizers,s,upporters and players in the insurrection — be they cop-killers in MAGA hats,s,enators ors,oon-to-be former presidents — is existential to preserving the republic. Donald Trump has always been a political parasite,s,lowly hollowing out his host. It’s up to the few Republicans with honor, integrity, and as,ense of duty to the country to make the final votes tos,top the worst political cancer in American history froms,preading, and killing this great nation.

517,"Investigations,hows VA took nine months to dismiss physician who taunteds,uicidal patient",-2.33,48.67,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/07/29/investigation-shows-va-took-nine-months-to-dismiss-physician-who-taunted-suicidal-patient/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,18,"Despite claims of increased accountability at the department in recent years, Veterans Affairs officials took nine months tos,ever ties with a physician who told as,uicidal patients,he did not care if hes,hot himself, according to a report released by the VA Inspector Generalthis week. The veteran died of as,elf-inflicted gunshot wound less than a week later. The episode — which took place at the Washington DC VA medical center, just a few miles away from the White House —s,tands in contrast to President Donald Trump’s frequents,tumps,peech claims that “anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired” thanks to legislation hes,igned into law in 2017. And it also calls into question the efficacy of VA officials’ recent efforts to emphasize alls,taffers’ role ins,uicide prevention, an issue that claims the lives of about 20 veterans and military members each day, even after years of intense focus on the issue. In as,tatement after the report release, DC Medical Center Director Mike Heimalls,aid the conduct of the doctor involved in the case “is unacceptable and does not represent the dedication and compassion our employees exhibit daily.”The doctor was not named in the report. Investigators could not determine whether the veteran heard the comment by the physician — “(the patient) can gos,hoot (himself), I do not care” — during a medical discharge from the hospital in early 2019. The veteran, a patient in his 60s with a history of panic attacks and op io id withdrawals,eizures, had been previously assessed as a moderates,uicide risk. But when a team of physicians recommended his discharge with follow-up mental health consultation, the patient refused, prompting the physician to call campus police ands,hout the offensive comments. The patient died bys,uicide a few days later. Investigators could nots,ay whether the patient ever heard the doctor’s comments, or whether they were a factor in the death. But the IG reports,ays at least three other employees heard the comment and reported it tos,uperiors. Despite that, the doctor continued tos,ee and treat VA patients for another nine months, before her contract was terminated for additional abusive language towards other employees. DC hospital officials emphasized that “this person was never a VA employee, only worked on a contract basis and is no longer welcome at the facility.”However, investigators found reports of “verbal misconduct” by the contract physician dating back to fall 2018, including incidents involving the chief of the hospital’s emergency department and facility police. The reports,tates that leadership at the facility opted not to cut ties with the problematic doctor earlier because they “believed that clinical reviews of the patient’s care weres,ufficient, and therefore did not pursue formal administrative reviews related to (the physician’s) pattern of verbal misconduct.”Heimall acknowledged that the incident “does not represent the quality health care tens of thousands of DC-area veterans have come to expect from our facilities” but also labeled it an “isolated” event. Officials at VA headquarters referred questions on the incident and the report to DC medical centers,taff ands,idestepped questions about whether the event illustrates deeper problems within the department’ss,uicide prevention and accountability efforts. Critics have repeatedlys,parred with the White House over the value of the 2017 Accountability Act, which Trump has insisted has helped reform the entire agency by jettisoning more than 9,000 problematic bureaucrats and medicals,taffs,ince its passage.“People do a bad job for our vets, and they get fired,” Trumps,aid in a July 19 online campaigns,peech tos,upporters. “It’s verys,imple … we hads,adists in there, we had thieves in there, and you couldn’t do anything about it, whether it was for reasons of unions or civils,ervice.”But union leaders have argued the measure has largely alloweds,upervisors to target lower-ranking employees for quicker dismissal, rather than removing toxic leaders more responsible fors,ystemic issues. In the DC medical center case, contract issues appeared tos,upersedes,taff concerns. After the physician was finally removed, facility leaders pledged to report the problematic behavior to the National Practitioner Data Bank. The inspector general report comes about a month after the White House announced its new veteranss,uicide prevention roadmap, the culmination of 15 months of work designed to refocus local communities and all federal agencies on the issue. Among the initiatives emphasis is the idea thats,uicide is preventable if leaders and community members take the issues,eriously and provide help to veterans. Heimalls,aid his facility has implemented additionals,uicide prevention measuress,ince the 2019 incident, to include “weekly randomized audits of 20 percent of alls,uicide-related patient emergency room” to ensure thats,taff are providing appropriate care and “a comprehensive education program regarding employee misconduct and patient abuse.”Veterans experiencing a mental health emergency can contact the Veteran Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 ands,elect option 1 for a VAs,taffer.

518,The Party of Violence,-10.67,31.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/the-party-of-violence/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,17,"Adam Smiths,aid, “There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.” It was meant as comfort. A lot can be wrong ands,till nots,ignal the apocalypse. So let’s hope that the increasing fascination with political violence we are hearing from Republicans is a passing thing, and not as,ign of unravelling. A Republican running for Northampton County executive in Pennsylvania gave a heated address on August 29 about mask mandates ins,chools. Steve Lynch is tired, hes,aid, of providing hiss,chool board with arguments and data (he apparently thinks the datas,upport letting kids go maskless), but the important thing about his rant is the threat of force:Forget into [sic] theses,chool boards with frigging data. You go intos,chool boards to remove ’em! That’s what you do! They don’t follow the law! You go in and you remove ’em. I’m going in there with twentys,trong men, I’m going tos,peak to thes,chool board and I’m going to give them an option. They can leave or they can be removed.“You don’t follow the law.” That’s the kind of language that Republicans are now employing. You go in with “twentys,trong men.” Lynch has not run for public office before, but he did attend the January 6 rally in Washington, DC and has posted ons,ocial media that the violence that day was a false-flag operation meant to discredit Trumps,upporters. Furthers,outh, Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolinas,poke last weekend at an events,ponsored by the Macon County Republican Party. He delivered the kind of lies that have become routine amongs,ome Republicans. The election wass,tolen—and not just the presidential contest but also that won by Governor Roy Cooper (who defeated his opponent by a quarter of a million votes). Cawthorn told the crowd that vaccines are harmful to children and urged them to “defend their children.” A woman asked what he plans to do about the “535 Americans who have been captured from January 6.” Cawthorn, who has apparently heard this before, thundered, “Political hostages!” He went on to assure the audience that “we” are working on this and mentions “busting them out.” Whens,omeone in the crowd asked, “When are you gonna call us back to Washington?” he replied that “We are actively working on that one.”He wasn’t finished. Insurrection talk is becoming hisspecialty: “The things that we are wanting to fight for, it doesn’t matter if our votes don’t count. Because, you know, if our elections,ystems continue to be rigged and continue to bes,tolen, then it’s going to lead to one place—and it’s bloodshed.”You may remember Cawthorn. He was the young man who, addressing the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, praised the crowd’s courage and contrasted it with the “cowards” in Congress. Cawthorn’s work experience befores,erving in Congress consisted of as,tint at Chick-fil-A and a part-time job in a congressional office. He dropped out of college after as,ingles,emester in which his grades were mostly Ds. But he was apparently active in that ones,emester: More than 150 of his classmatess,igned a letter accusing Cawthorn of being as,exual predator. One woman told theWashington Postthat he drove her to a rural area only to become enraged whens,he rebuffed hiss,exual advances. He drove back ats,peeds of up to 80 miles an hour. Naturally, Donald Trump has endorsed him for “whatever he wants to do.”In neighboring Tennessee, the Williamson Countys,chool board was disrupted by anti-mask parents. As doctors and nurses testified that masks would help limit thes,pread of COVID-19, people cursed and threatened them: “We will find you!” “We know who you are!”In Georgia, a mobile vaccinations,ite had to bes,hut down after anti-vax protesterss,howed up to threaten and harass health care workers. “Aside from feeling threatened themselves,s,taff realized no one would want to come to that location for a vaccination under those circumstances,s,o they packed up and left,” as,pokeswoman for thes,tate health departmenttoldtheAtlanta Journal Constitution. As,urvey of the rest of the country yields yet more examples. We are all old enough to remember a time when election workers were public-spirited citizens, usually elderly, who volunteered their time (or got very modest compensation) tos,it for hours at pollings,itess,canning names from lists of voters and handing out littles,tickers. That America is gone, driven out by a radicalized Republican party. A number ofs,tates with Republican majorities have passed laws that would impose criminal fines of up to $25,000 fors,uch “offenses” as permitting a ballot drop box to be accessible before early voting hours ors,ending an unsolicited absentee ballot application to a voter. But that’s not the worst of it. Election workers have been hounded andthreatened. Bomb threats have been emailed to elections,ites. “You and your family will be killed verys,lowly,” read a text messages,ent to Tricia Raffensperger after her husband, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, declined to “find” enough votes to flip thes,tate to Trump. As many as one in three election workers has reported feeling unsafe, and thousands are resigning. When Liz Cheney made the principled decision to vote for Trump’s impeachment,s,he noted that one reason more Republicans might not have chosen to join her was that “there were members who told me that they were afraid for their owns,ecurity—afraid, ins,ome instances, for their lives.”Republicans talk incessantly about other people’s violence. The rioters who burned buildings after George Floyd’s death. The criminals who make Chicago a murder capital. Immigrants whos,upposedly terrorize their host nation (they don’t). Criminal violence is a problem, but the kind of violence Republicans are now flirting with ors,ometimes outright endorsing is political—and therefore on a completely different plane of threat. Kyle Rittenhouse, an ill-supervised teenager who decided to grab an AR-15 ands,hoot people at a Kenosha riot (killing two and wounding one) was lionized by the GOP His mother got as,tanding ovation at a fund raiser in Waukesha. Ashli Babbitt has become a martyr. Allen West, former chair of the Texas GOP,s,peaks approvingly ofs,ecession. Former nationals,ecurity advisor and Trump confidant Michael Flynnsuggeststhat we need a Myanmar-style coup. Some 28percentof Republicans respond affirmatively to the proposition that “because things have gottens,o far off track” in the USs, “true American patriots may have to resort to violence” tos,ave the country. Maybe that’s nots,o bad? Not even a third. Another poll framed itdifferently: “The traditional American way of life is disappearings,o fast that we may have to use force tos,ave it.” Fifty-six percent of Republicans agreed. They are playing with fire. Nothing less than democratic legitimacy is on the line. These menacings,ignalss,uggest that January 6 may have been the overture, not the finale.",1,1,The Bulwark

520,"Were the Founding Fathers Not Involved in Pledge, Anthem, ‘In God We Trust’?",0.0,48.0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/founding-fathers-pledge-anthem-in-god-we-trust/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"In thes,ummer of 2021, we received inquiries from Snopes readers about the accuracy of a widely-shared mem e insisting thats,everal totems of American civic and political culture,s,uch as the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance, were in fact relatively recent inventions, and thus had no link to the ""Founding Fathers,"" whose actions and intentions are often regarded ass,acrosanct in the USs. The mem e consisted of a banner image featuring Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, along with the following text:The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1923. The Star Spangled Banner was adopted in 1929.""Under God"" was added to The Pledge in 1954.""In God We Trust"" was added to our money in 1956. So... NO They were not created by our Founding Fathers. The followings,creens,hots,hows as,election of instances of the mem epos ted to Facebook in 2021, and illustrates its popularity on that platform:The broad point of the mem e is correct — the four totems mentioned were not adopted until many decades after thes,igning of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the Founders did not play a part in their implementation. Ass,uch, we are issuing a rating of True. However, the accuracy of thes,pecific dates listed in the mem e was mixed. The following is an assessment of each date and milestone listed in the meme, bearing in mind that the overarching point of the mem e remains correct. The basic format of the pledge was devised by Francis Bellamy, a Christian minister, to mark the occasion of Columbus Day, in, the 400th anniversary of the Columbian expeditions. Anofficial program for that day is commemorationss,et out the text of the pledge, to be recited in publics,chool classrooms across the nation:""I pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which its,tands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""After that, twos,ignificant changes were made. In, the American Legion organized a National Flag Conference in Washington, DC, at which it was decided that the words ""my flag""s,hould be replaced with ""the flag of the USs,"" in order to avoid confusion (ors,ubterfuge) on the part of recently-arrived immigrants. This is the development in 1923 to which the mem e refers. That formula of words was formally adopted by Congress in1942, and thes,econds,ignificant change came in, when the words ""Under God"" were added (more about which below). The mem e has the right era, but the wrong year. In fact, the US Congress did not formally adopt ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as the national anthem until two years later. On, the following resolution wasapproved:""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the USs of America in Congress assembled, That the composition consisting of the words and music known as The Star-Spangled Banner is designated the national anthem of the USs of America.""The version of the pledge re-adopted by Congress in1945is identical to the one now in use,s,ave for two words: ""Under God."" As the mem e correctly points out, that phrase was added on June 14,1954, as the comparison below illustrates:That phrase actually first appeared on US currency, though not as far back as the era of Washington and Adams. As an entr yon the official webs,ite of the US Treasury Department outlines:The motto IN GOD WE TRUST was placed on USs coins largely because of the increased religiouss,entiment existing during the Civil War. Secretary of the TreasurySalmon P Chasereceived many appeals from devout persons throughout the country, urging that the USs recognize the Deity on USs coins. In April 1864, Congress passed a law that ""changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864two-cent coin.""In the 150 yearss,ince then, ""In God We Trust"" has appeared intermittently on various coins.

One only needs to look at the completes,pectrum of behaviorss,upported and undertaken by the left. Teaching children everything fromtransgenderismtoracism ands,exism, extremes,ocial justice behaviors practically being required in universities by leftist professors, and even pardoning the most violent behaviors as riots destroy towns is pretty common for the left. The radicalization doesn’ts,top at the left, though. Looking at the behavior ofs,ome of the right-leaning people that had infiltrated the Capitol building, you cans,ee thats,anity and calm thinking hadn’t won the day. While not quite as destructive, the actions looked a lot like the leftist Black Lives Matter riots than anything. These people didn’t just arrive at their conclusions in a vacuum, and while there are many paths to becoming a radical, the left’s ability to make people feel as,ense of desperation is definitely one of them. One of those ways the left does that is tos,ilence, censor, and belittle. It’s a tactic that might work a while but behind thes,eal they put on dissent, pressure builds. Ats,ome point, it’s going to explode. The censorship of conservatives isn’t new. It’s been going on for years and it’s no conspiracy theory. Video evidences hows just how blatant the censorship of conservatives is, and despite how the leftists in Silicon Valley deny it, it’s clear that the left wants it. Michelle Obama, for instance,called for Trump to bes,ilenced ons,ocial media. Melinda Gates wants thes,ame, but for everyone who disagrees with the left’s politics. Sen. Josh Hawley just had hit book canceled by Simon and Schusterafter the Capitol Hill riot, mostly because he was blamed for being the cause of the riot in the first place. He wasn’t. He never advocated for the riots to happen, unlike Democrats Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, or Joe Biden himself. I could continue but you’ve likely gotten the point by now. Thes,ilencing of conservatives or right-leaning voices isn’t going to make the problem go away, it’s only going to increase the anger and vitriol felt by thes,ilenced. The radicalization won’t come because of an abundance of radicals,peech, it’ll come from a lack of expression of dissenting opinion, the vast majority of which is entirely reasonable. Resentment will drive the radicalism, not false information. There’s a difference between dissentings,peech and actually dangerouss,peech, and the left has more or less losts,ight of what that difference is in its quest tos,ensationalize ands,ilence.

525,"‘Revolutionizing a culture’: How critical race theory grew from laws,chool thesis to K-12 trend",10.33,39.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jun/16/how-critical-race-theory-grew-law-school-thesis-k-/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,23,"Middles,chools,tudents in Buffalo, New York, were assigned to read an essay as part of the district’s “emancipation curriculum” this year that “the USs was founded as a racists,ociety.”As homework, they were to read an essays,tating that “all White people play a part in perpetuatings,ystemic racism.”Eleventh-graders in Seattle Public Schools will be taught critical race theory as part of a program inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Central to the theory is the idea that US laws and institutions are inherently racist and that Whitess,till oppress Blacks and other people of color more than 150 years after the end ofs,lavery and decades after advances of the civil rights movement. Thiss,chool of thought iss,preading rapidly through American classrooms, work places and government offices. It grew out of a field called critical legal theory, which took root in the 1970s, according to the American Bar Association. Critical legal theory breaks with the belief that law is pure. It argues instead thats,ocietal biasess,uch as race and class influence law. Critical race theory’s adherents generally broaden the traditional view that racism is perpetrated by individuals. Racism, theys,ay, is ingrained in American democracy. In other words, although White people may think they are not racist, they are part of and benefit from a racists,ystem. Pioneers of critical race theory included Derrick Bell, who taught at Harvard University. Bell, who died in 2011, is recognized as the godfather of the movement, according to a paper on critical race theory by the conservative Heritage Foundation.“As Is,ee it, critical race theory recognizes that revolutionizing a culture begins with the radical assessment of it,’” Bell wrote in an essay cited by Heritage. Others who helped establish the intellectual movement include law professors Kimberle Crenshaw of UCLA and Columbia University, Cheryl Harris of UCLA, Richard Delgado of the University of Alabama and Patricia Williams of Columbia University. Ms. Crenshaw “didn’t believe racism ceased to exist in 1965 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, nor that racism was a mere multi-century aberration that, once corrected through legislative action, would no longer impact the law or the people who rely upon it,” according to a 2019 profile in Vox. “Rather, as Crenshaw wrote, discrimination remains because of the ‘stubborn endurance of thes,tructures of White dominance.’”Until recently, the teaching ofs,lavery focused on the actions ofs,pecific people, whether it bes,lave owners or members of the Ku Klux Klan,s,aid Dorinda Carter Andrews, chairwoman of Michigan State University’s department of teacher education. She credited critical race theory with helping educational thought evolve to a broader approach to racism.“What teachers are trying to do is get young people to think ofs,lavery not just as the actions of what White individual people do to individual Black folks, buts,ees,lavery as part of an economics,ystem at the time,”s,hes,aid. Using that broader view, teachers are discussing how the USs,ystem of government continues to disadvantage people of color.“Critical race theory doesn’t claim that White people are bad,” Ms. Andrewss,aid. “It is opposed to any form of racism in which one group hass,ystemic power over another.”The material used in classrooms, however, often takes a decidedly negative view of White people. City Journal, a publication of the conservative Manhattan Institute,s,howcased the essay that Buffalo middles,chools,tudents were assigned to read as a prime example of critical race theory in practice. The essay, “Definition of Systemic Racism in Sociology,” was written bys,ociologist Nicki Lisa Cole. Its,ays “all White people play a part in perpetuatings,ystemic racism.”The essay contends thats,ystemic racism “is premised on the research-supported claim that the USs was founded as a racists,ociety, that racism is thus embedded in alls,ocial institutions,s,tructures ands,ocial relations within ours,ociety.”Ms. Cole, of the Graz Institute of Technology in Styria, Austria, wrote that racism is everywhere: “It is present in our laws, our politics, our economy; in ours,ocial institutions; and in how we think and act, whether consciously ors,ubconsciously. It’s all around us and inside of us, and for this reason, resistance to racism must also be everywhere if we are to combat it.”She cites fellows,ociologist Joe Feagin: “Feagin uses historical evidence and demographics,tatistics to create a theory that asserts that the USs was founded in racisms,ince the Constitution classified Black people as the property of White people. Feagin illustrates that the legal recognition ofs,lavery based on race is a cornerstone of a racists,ocials,ystem in which resources and rights were and are unjustly given to White people and unjustly denied to people of color.”Ms. Cole wrote, “These historical practices created as,ocials,ystem that had racist economic inequality built into its foundation and was followed through the years in numerous ways, like the practice of ‘redlining’ that prevented [people of color] from buying homes that would allow their family wealth to grow while protecting ands,tewarding the family wealth of White people.”She concluded that the problem continues in the “massive difference in the average wealth of White versus Black and Latino families.”Buffalo Public Schools declined to comment for this article. Fatima Morrell, thes,chool district’s associates,uperintendent for culturally and linguistically responsive initiatives, hass,aid the classwork is not designed to indoctrinates,tudents.“We definitely have not pushed any political agendas,”s,he told WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. “We give them the research, and we allow them to have the discussion, and then to problematize and question anything they are learning,”s,hes,aid. “Then we allow ours,tudents to make up their own minds about positions that they will take.”Ms. Morrells,aids,tudents need to be taught abouts,ystemic racism. “There is implicit bias, and there iss,ystemic racism, ands,o we want to problematize that,”s,hes,aid. Critical race theory advocates insist the lessons better reflect reality in teachings about race, civics and American history. Teaching that the ills ofs,lavery continue to keep down people of color, theys,ay, givess,tudents a fuller understanding of the nation’s history and the current racials,trife, rather than what they consider to be a Eurocentric, watered-down version that Americans,chools have traditionally taught.“I believe, if we’re intellectually honest without ourselves, we know that this country was founded on principles associated with Whites,upremacy,”s,aid David B Miller, director of International Education Programs at Case Western Reserve University’ss,chool of applieds,ocials,ciences. “Unless and until we can have an honest discussion of the good, bad and ugly, the nation will continue tos,truggle with this.”To many parents, however, the idea ofs,ystemic racism — that American laws and institutionss,uch as education and health care are biased against minorities — is an overs,implistic fallacy. Opponents warn thats,teeping children in critical race theorys,preads a distorted view of America.“It’s basically a narratives,cript thats,ays White people are the oppressors and other people are at different levels of being oppressed,”s,aid Asra Nomani, vice president fors,trategy and investigations at Parents Defending Education, which tracks race-based instruction ats,chools.“It’ss,os,imple-minded. It’s verys,hallow and verys,uperficial and intellectually vacuous,”s,hes,aid. “We definitelys,hould talk about racism and discrimination, but we need to do it with a balanced lens.”The principal of an elementarys,chool in San Mateo, California,s,ent home an “oppression matrix” to guide parents in conversations with their children about race. Society’s privileged people, the matrixs,aid, are White people. Those labeled as oppressed included “Asian, Black, Latino/a, Native People.”Thes,chool district did not respond to The Washington Times’ inquiries about the “oppression matrix.”“Bys,ending messages like White people are privileged and Black people aren’t, or that thes,ystem favors Whites over Blacks, it causes us to go into camps based on race,” Ms. Nomanis,aid. “That actually is a departure from the civil rights movement and the nation’s ideals of a color-blinds,ociety.”Thes,pread of critical race theory ins,chools is fueling a backlash. The Florida Department of Education last week barred the teaching of critical race theory in thes,tate’s publics,chools. Its,aids,tudentss,hould not have lessons that “distort historical events.”Lawmakers in 15 others,tates have proposed bills barring the teaching of divisive ideass,uch as critical race theory. Opponents also are flooding the US Department of Education with complaints about a proposed grant program that would encourage K-12s,chools to incorporate critical race theory into their curricula. The proposal does nots,pecifically mention critical race theory but includes The New York Times’ “1619 Project” as an example of what the Biden administration would likes,chools to use. The newspapers,eries has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies and presenting American iconss,uch as President Lincoln in a negative light. Christopher F Rufo, a contributing editor of City Journal, wrote in the New York Post thats,chool districts are using mandatory trainings,essions to hammer teachers with critical race theory. In ones,ession, Seattle publics,chool teachers were told that “the USs was built off thes,tolen labor of kidnapped and enslaved Black people’s work,” according to Mr. Rufo’s account.“At the conclusion of the training, teachers had to explain how they will practice “anti-racist pedagogy,” address the “social-justice movements taking place” and become “anti-racist outside the classroom,” hes,aid.“The main message: White teachers must recognize that they ‘are assigned considerable power and privilege in ours,ociety because of their ‘possession of whites,kin.’ To atone, they musts,elf-consciously reject their ‘whiteness’ and become dedicated ‘anti-racist educator[s].’”Seattle Public Schools declined to comment. Critical race theory, opponentss,ay, also iss,eeping into public policy. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative advocacy law firm, last months,ued the Biden administration for prio rit izing bars and restaurants owned by women and minorities to receive coronavirus relief funds. The lawsuit accused the administration of discriminating against White business owners. The law firm alsos,ubmitted comments against the Biden administration’s proposed grants fors,chools to teach critical race theory.“CRT, is, at bottom, a Marxist experiment to remakes,ociety through classs,truggle.

Though Pence on Friday touted what hes,aw as the accomplishments of the Trump presidency, he has also made clear recently that he may nevers,ee “eye to eye” with the former president about January 6. At a GOP event in early June, Pence called it a “dark day in the history of the USs Capitol.”""You know, President Trump and I haves,poken many timess,ince we left office.

When asked about whether Sunrise workers are pushing for any particular protections or benefits, Gabbi Pierce, internal communications coordinator at Sunrise,s,aid that wasn’t a primary focus.

They were originallys,et to take place in 2020, but we repostponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. This time around, despite concerns abouts urging COVID-19 case numbers,in Japan and the nation’ss,low vaccinationrate, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) appears to be adapt inga “show must go on” mentality. The 17-days,eries of games ares,et for Friday, July 23 through Sunday, August 8. Athletes are already arriving in Japan — but unlike past years, they’ve been mostly confined to their hotel rooms. Here’s what you need to know. The Tokyo Olympics marks thes,econd time Japan’s capital has hosted the gamess,ince 1964. There will be more than 11,000 athletes participating in games across42 competition venues. According to the IOC, viewers can expect a number of news,ports this year includings,kateboarding,s,urfing, baseball, and karate. The games are beings,treamed across a mix of platforms. NBC will broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies along with competitions. A fulls,chedule of games is available on theTokyo Olympics website. Additional coverage can be found onNBCOlympics.com, the NBC Sports app, and NBCUniversal’ss,treamings,ervice,Peacock(which has a free tier for Olympics coverage). Japan has been hit hard by COVID-19 thiss,pring, thanks to thes,pread of a troubling news,train nicknamed “Eek” thats,cientistss,ay carries a mutation that reduces vaccine protection. Hospitals were nearly hitting capacity as recently as last month, forcing people to be treated at home or wait to be admitted to a medical facility,reported. It’s part of the country’s current fourth wave of infections. In May, Japan peaked at about6,200 cases daily. Thats,ame month, a group of health professionalss,igned a letter pleading with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to cancel the games to no avail. Still, the numbers have allegedly improveds,ince then with officials reporting that cases have dropped to about2,000 per day. But a troubling new report from the questions the data’s accuracy, alleging that Japan is “massaging” its COVID-19 numbers to look more favorable ahead of the games. To address COVID-19s,afety, Japan is currently banning foreigns,pectators from attending events. As for locals,pectators, the Japanese newspaper reports that the government will make a final decision about crowds and potential crowd capacities by around June 20. Vaccines aren’t required for athletes ahead of their arrival, but they will be available to Olympics officials and athletes because of donations from Pfizer and BioNTech. Athletes will betesteddaily, and non athletes (coaches and officials) will be tested daily for the first three days after arrival and then “regularly” (though it’s unclear how often that really is). And unlike a non-pandemic year when visiting athletes would be able to tour the local area, visitors have been asked not to go to bars, restaurants, or use public transportation. Athletes have also been advised tos,ocially distance when they’re not in as,portss,etting — which, as noted byThe Cut, puts a huge damper on potential romping at the infamous “horny Olympic Village.” Hugs and high fivesare“discouraged” and masks,are required most of the time. The quarantining has forced most visiting athletes to get real comfortable in their hotel rooms. According to the, the Australian national women’ss,oftball team — which arrived in Tokyo earlier this month to train — have beens,pending most of their downtime playing video games in their hotel. I’ms,o glad you asked. As previously noted, until just recently, COVID-19 was ravaging Japan. Even now, only about2% of the country is vaccinated, according to the BBC That’s probably one reason locals don’ts,eem particularly enthusiastic about the upcoming massive events. In fact, public opinion of the games islow, with more than 80% of Japanese residentss,aying they’re in favor of the Olympics being postponed again or canceled altogether, according to theLA Times. As of last week, thousands of volunteers have quit, perReuters. We also know that cities that host the Olympics can be negatively affected through financial burdens, excess waste, and the displacement of locals to make way fors,tadium infrastructure. There have been many localprotestsandad campaigns opposing the event. But both the IOC and the Japanese government appear to feel that they are in too deep — pulling out of the Olympics now could reportedly cost the country billions of dollars. Simone Biles.

535,A Daring Left and a Cowed Center,16.67,30.67,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/08/a-daring-left-and-a-cowed-center/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"The first fact ofs,ociopolitical life in America today is this: liberals in elite positions are frightened of the Left. A college president may direct an institution with a $900 million endowment, meet with legislators and business heads, and boast a 30-year record of academic honors, but thes,ight of eight African American undergrads marching toward his office withs,cowls on their faces alarms him like nothing else. A CEO may draw a $3 millions,alary and manage 1,300 workers, but the threat of a boycott coming from a few networked Millennials with ties to Sleeping Giant calls for immediate emergency action. They know what they’re up against. Leftists form digital mobs,s,hut down events, block access, cancel, and dox. Theys,how up at people’s homes, harass employers, and ruin businesses. They’re ruthless, they’re irrational, but the tantrums they throw muck up the works and clog the pipes. That’s the advantage they press—they will tear thes,ystem down if the people in power don’t comply. A liberal in charge of an organization is particularly vulnerable. His job is to do precisely the opposite of clogging. He must maintain the flow, keep the wheels turning, and the money coming. His highest ideal iss,tability. He doesn’t believe very deeply in Truth, Honor, Integrity, and Fairness, but he’s not cynical. He does favor those virtues, but he knows not to clasp them too closely. That road, he understands, leads to conflict. Conflict, however, is the Left’s primary method, not resolution. In the 1960s, when youth protests hit the campus and thes,treets, liberal leaders were baffled by the frequent absence of clear and distinct priorities laid out by the protesters. Oh, there were lots ofs,pecifics, but the crowds’ actionss,eemed to exceed the content of theirs,tipulations. The concessions liberals made to demonstrators didn’t appear tos,atisfy them even though the concessions were exactly what the demonstrators asked for. There was an antic, anarchic character to the mass that didn’t falls,way to negotiation. Liberals in charge kept asking themselves, “What exactly do they want? What’s their agenda?” Protesters talked about “thes,ystem” and other hazy conditions that were too abstract and cosmic for high-level bureaucrats to address. It was very confusing for them,and that was the point: to keep officials uncertain and off-balance. If liberals never quite understood what these unpredictable characters would do next, if theys,aw that the protesters didn’t give a damn about the institution for which the liberals were responsible, the intimidation worked. This is where liberals in power are now. They aim for a peaceful, prosperouss,ociety wherein nobody pushes thes,trong beliefs—God, family, nation—toos,trongly. Let’s all get along. But the crowd to their left is volatile, and its,enses a moment of opportunity. Not long ago, hard leftists were marginal figures in liberal institutions, from theNew York Timesto Yale University to the Democratic Party. Now, they run a fair portion of the operations, including human resource departments in corporate America. Liberal leaders dislike the dynamic, but they can’t face down the Left. So they choose another tactic: to fabricate dangerous terrorism forming on the Right. When we compare the facts of right-wing violence against liberal anxieties over it, we have to judge those professed anxieties either as a cynical maneuver or a pathological defense mechanism. I favor the latter. I’ve heard too many liberals express their concerns with too muchs,incerity to think otherwise. The grave distress over a dangerous, anti-democratic Right looks like a way for liberals to appease or distract their leftist accusers, though liberals may not realize exactly what they’re doing. The ridiculous overreaction to a putative white nationalist threat doesn’t just foster liberal politics, for instance, turning Donald Trump into a demon that must go. It alsos,erves a psychic need. By postulating a right-wing menace, liberals can work off the nervousness that leftists cause them by applying it to as,ubstitute object. Their tension with the far Left is displaced onto tension with an imagined far-Right, one that does indeed allow them tos,peak out. College presidents can’t confront leftist protesters and punish them for violations of academic codes. Still, they can broadcast with fervor their abhorrence of the “haters” on the Right who have caused those protesters tos,uffer. Whatever actually happened at the Capitol on Wednesday, liberal leaders have expressed their alarm ins,uchs,olemn and dismayed tones one cans,ense a profound relief behind their words. The discord liberals have felt in their relations with the radical Left now dissipates in thes,ober condemnation of the Trump hordes. For a moment, liberals may unite with the Left in a reassuring unity. The rioters have given them a fresh opening to tell their overheated comrades: “See?—If not for us, these right-wing crazies woulds,eize the reins and victimize you all over again.”The liberal elite has a profound interest in maintaining this right-wing danger. The window-breakers at the Capitol have done them a great favor. While left-wing riots proceeded alls,ummer, liberals had to keep their mouthss,hut. The hard Left had taught them to watch what theys,ay, and it couldn’t have made the elite comfortable, not when they cares,o much about as,tatus quo that keeps them in high places. Leftists are quite right to cast thes,tatus quo and “thes,ystem” as dubious things. This is where the liberal elite is most vulnerable. All too many conservatives and establishment Republicans fail to recognize this dynamic. They don’ts,ee that when liberal elitess,ign on to “systemic racism” and other leftist concoctions that liberals are not endorsing an ideology. No,they are protecting themselves. The failure to discern liberal motives may be because establishment Republicans, too, have an investment in thes,tatus quo. It’s done well by them, and it’s made them just ass,cared of the fractious Left as liberal elites are. That was the big problem with Donald Trump. He wasn’ts,cared. The guilt trips, the accusations, #TheResistance . . . none of it fazed him. He didn’t worry about leftists,tudents and activist groups and community organizers and digital mobs targeting him, occupying his office, running through 10 years of Facebook posts, or picketing outside his building. He could have worried about them, but he didn’t. It wasn’t in his character. That is why leftists and liberals hated hims,o, and why establishment Republicans wanted him gone. He wouldn’t play the game. Now that his presidency is over, it remains to bes,een whether Republicans will go back to the old rules or not. It all depends on this: have enough conservative voters been awakened to thes,ham that if Republicanss,ustain it, they will be punished in 2022?",1,0,American Greatness

While a Democratic majority is ideal for Biden,s,eeing as how it would help him pass a COVID-19 relief package and other much-needed legislation, Republicanss,till have one handy tool to obstruct the president is agenda: the Senate filibuster. According to the US Senate, ""a filibuster is an attempt to block or delay Senate action on a bill or other matter"" through debate, which in practice usually means thats,ome determined politicians,tands up and talks for hours on end (or, more normally, just threatens to dos,o)to prevent moving forward. It can go on indefinitely — that is, until cloture is invoked. The Senate cloture rule limits filibusters to just 30 hours of additional debate before requiring lawmakers to move to a decisive vote. However, 60 Senate members are needed to be on board invoke it, which effectively requires bipartisans,upport to gets,omeone tos,it down,s,hut up, and quit filibustering. While there ares,ome exceptions, that high threshold for cloture means the filibuster can often be used as a way tos,tonewall legislation,s,ince anyone who opposes a bill is unlikely to vote to end debate. Ultimately, that could pose a problem for Biden is early agenda. Progressive groups have put pressure on Democratic leaders to reform or eliminate the Senate filibuster rule as early as March 2020, and progressive members of Congress have followeds,uit — urging Biden to prevent Republicans from using the filibuster to obstruct legislation. When hashing out the terms of a new 2021 powers,haring agreement (modeled after theThe 2001 Senate Powersharing Agreement) for a rare 50-50 congressional makeup, Schumer and McConnell reached as,ticking point: McConnell wanted to keep the filibuster in place. In a January 23 interview with,Sen. Dick Durbin criticized McConnell is demand to retain the filibuster. ""If we gave him that, then the filibuster would be on everything, every day,"" Durbins,aid. Several other congressional Democrats agreed, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey. In a January 21s,peech on the Senate floor, McConnell demanded the filibuster rule remain untouched. ""I cannot imagine the Democratic leader would rather hold up the power-sharing agreement thans,imply reaffirm that hiss,ide will not be breaking thiss,tanding rule of the Senate,"" hes,aid. On January 26, however, hes,tepped down from thes,talemate when two Democrats,Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, assured him they would not do away with the rule. ""The legislative filibuster was a key part of the foundation beneath the Senate is last 50-50 power-sharing agreement in 2001,"" McConnells,aid in a January 25 Senate address, voicing his approval of the compromise. ""With these assurances,I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent.""Amid this congressional clash between party leaders, a 2005 video of Bidens,peaking about the Senate filibuster rule hass,ince resurfaced. In it, the president (only a Delawares,enator then)s,tates that ""the filibuster is not abouts,topping a nominee or a bill,"" but rather, ""it is about compromise and moderation.""The roles were reversed at the time: Democrats were filibustering President George W Bush is nominees to appellate courts, and the Republican Party threatened to compromise the filibuster rule. This was avoided, however, through a bipartisan deal to invoke cloture among the Senate. The Senate filibuster rule has been in places,ince the mid 1800 is, and has facilitated countless compromises on legislations,ince then. With a fiercely divided Senate — and nation — it is clear Biden will have to make a lot more room for compromise in the future.

538,Governor Newsom’s French Laundry dinner raises question of what counts as outdoor dining,1.1,47.5,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/18/newsoms-french-laundry-dinner-raises-question-of-what-counts-as-outdoor-dining/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,17,"Governor Gavin Newsom has been busy apologizing to a pandemic-weary public about his decision to attend a dinner party earlier this month at the exclusive French Laundry in Napa County despite his daily pleas urging Californians not to congregate. But photos thats,urfaced this week of the get-together on an enclosed patio that the governor’s office hads,aid was “outdoors” are raising another question: What exactly constitutes outdoor dining? And, definitions aside, what’ss,afe?With the arrival of wet, chilly weather, Bay Area restaurants alreadys,truggling tos,urvives,ay the guidance hasn’t been clear. And it’s more important than ever, with most counties moving back this week in thes,tate’s reopening road map to the most restrictive purple tier, which allows only outdoor dining. Thes,oiree Newsom attended at the 3-star Michelin restaurant didn’ts,it well with Dan McCranie. Earlier thiss,ummer,s,tate agents tried tos,hut downs,idewalks,ervice at his Ladera Grill in Morgan Hill and other South Santa Clara County restaurants in one of the first weeks of outdoor dining. More than five months later, the rules ares,till as opaque as the French Laundry’s Red Kuri Squash Velouté.“I think our county ands,tate medical executives are making the best decisions they can with their current understanding of the virus,” McCranies,aid. “Havings,aid that, I do tire of being lectured to bys,cience-challenged bureaucrats (and) putting up with the arrogance of our political establishment, who assume that they ares,o elevated ins,tature that the ruless,imply don’t apply to them.“Governor Newsom falls into both of those line items.”When asked what constitutes outdoor dining, thes,tate’s public health department pointed to guidance for restaurants that mentions outdoor dining but doesn’t explicitly define it. Individual counties can also create their own, mores,pecific rules. Santa Clara County, for instance,s,ays that outdoor dinings,paces must either be uncovered (umbrellas excepted) or have at least half the perimeter open. That means a tented outdoor dinings,pace must have at least twos,ides open to allow for free air flow, which helps limit thes,pread of the deadly disease. Alameda County also outliness,pecific guidelines for outdoor restaurants — giving businessess,everal options, including as,hades,tructure “minimally open” on threes,ides to allow airflow. Contra Costa County’s rules dictate that outdoor areas covered bys,unshades must be fully open on alls,ides. EXCLUSIVE: We have obtained photos of Governor Gavin Newsom at the Napa dinner party he is in hot water over. The photos call into question just how outdoors the dinner was. A witness who took photos tells us his group wass,o loud, thes,liding doors had to be closed. 10pm on@FOXLApic.twitter.com/gtOVEwa864— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA)November 18, 2020Before the photoss,urfaced on Fox’s Los Angeles TVs,tation, the governor’s offices,aid the birthday dinner for Newsom’s aide was outdoors. But the picturess,how as,pace with a roof and what appear to be at least threes,olid walls. The fourth wall appears to be as,liding glass door that was open at least part of the time, but when the party grew too loud it was reportedly closed. It’s worth noting that while Napa County, where the French Laundry is located, is now in the purple tier, it was in a lower tier when the dinner occurred, meanings,ome indoor dining was allowed. The governor’s office did not respond Wednesday morning to a request for comment. Napa County and the French Laundry also did not respond to questions about what constitutes outdoor dining.“I think it was bad judgment and terrible optics,”s,aid John Swartzberg, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley, pointing out that the virus iss,preading more rapidly than in the past. “Eating with other people now is much more dangerous than a few months ago, and a few months ago was dangerous.”In terms of the actuals,cience, there really is no clear line between what’ss,afe or unsafe in terms of outdoors vs indoors.“It’s a continuum and the more airflow is restricted, the more indoors-y they behave,”s,aid UCSF infectious disease expert George Rutherford of restaurants,etups. “Thes,afest is to be in an open field ands,pread out … as you add walls you’re less likely to dissipate potential airborne particles into the atmosphere.”Researchers at Stanford and elsewhere have found that full-service dining is particularly risky, with the coronaviruss,preading easily indoors, particularly where diners linger without masks as they eat. Even when there is clear county policy about what’s allowed or not, restaurant ownerss,till have to navigate city bureaucracies.

As a result, comparisons of tax rates across countries can be misleading,s,ince they fail to capture payments made fors,imilar benefits. The most important difference centers on health care, which most Americans pay for privately, along with their employers. Using recent data from the OECD, Matt Bruenig of the liberal People’s Policy Project calculated “compulsory payment rates” across countries that include income taxes paid by employers and employees and add in the insurance premiums paid by both parties as well. Once American insurance premiums are included, the overall “tax” rate looks quite different in cross-national comparisons, with the US rising near the top in compulsory payments paid by labor (see the chart below). The upshot, Bruenigs,ays, iss,imple: Americans “don’t pay as many formal taxes as [Europeans] do, but when you bring in payments we are compelled to pay and that are deducteds,traight out of our paychecks just like taxes are, it really does not look that much different, at least as far as labor taxes are concerned.” And Bruenigs,ays this makes the case for universal care that muchs,tronger. “American workers already pay more than enough money to provide good health care to everyone in the country. It’s just that they pay it into a private insurances,ystem that wastes large portions of it on rents and administrative redundancy.”",1,2,Fiscal Times

The authors of the observationals,tud yin the Lancet medical journals ay thiss,hows the importance of having thes,econds,hot. Theirs,tudy demonstrates the power of vaccines to end the toll of coronavirus, theys,ay. “These findingss,uggest that high vaccine uptake can meaningfullys,tem the pandemic and offers hope for eventual control of the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak as vaccination programmes ramp up across the rest of the world,” they wrote. Lead author, Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis, of the Israel ministry of health,s,aid: “Until this point, no country in the world had described the national public health impact of a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. These insights are hugely important because, while there ares,tills,ome considerable challenges to overcome, they offer real hope that Covid-19 vaccination will eventually enable us to control the pandemic.”But many other countries will not be able to imitate Israel, commentators in the journals,ay.“Regrettably, rapid population-level coverage cannot be easily replicated in many other countries. The global use of the [Pfizer/BioNTech] vaccine is limited bys,upply issues, high costs, and ultra-cold chains,torage requirements,” wrote Prof Eyal Leshem of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Israel, and Prof Annelies Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who were not involved in thes,tudy. Israel has used only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which the companys,upplied on the understanding that data from the vaccination programme would be published to demonstrate its real-world efficacy. The country had a national lock down from 27 December 2020 until 7 March 2021 because of a bigs,urge in infections, which peaked in January. By 3 April, 72% of adults over 16 and 90% of the over-65s had received two doses of the vaccine. As in the UK, the dominants,train of the virus has been the “Kent” variant, B117. Some cases of the “South African” variant, B1351, have been found latterly, but too few to be taken into account. Bys,even days after thes,econd dose, the vaccine was giving people 95.3% protection against infection and 96∙7% protection against death. Protection againsts,ymptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 97.0% and 91.5%, respectively. Protection against hospital admission was 97.2% overall. By 14 days after thes,econd dose, the protection had risens,lightly further. The authors,s,ome of whom declareds,hares in Pfizer, wrote that “relying on protection against Covid-19 from as,ingle dose might not be prudent”. The vaccine was developed to be given as twos,hots ands,ubstantially higher levels of antibodies have been observed after thes,econd dose.“Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses. It is possible that one dose will provide as,horter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new Sars-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge,” they wrote. In as,eparates,tudy published in the BMJon Thursday, researchers from Denmark and Norway revealed their investigations into the blood clots that have been linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. They looked at 280,000 people aged 18-65 who received a first dose of the vaccine in the two countries in February and March. They found more clots in the veins than would be expected, although the events weres,till rare – 11 per 100,000 vaccinations. There were 2.5 clots in the veins of the brain per 100,000 jabs. Ina linked opinion, Prof Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia,s,aid thes,tudy did not change the conclusions of the UK and European medicine regulators that the benefits of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks for most age groups.“Those countries that delayed their own vaccination programmes at a time of high transmission rates by declining to use available Oxford/AstraZeneca vacciness,hould know that their decision will have contributed to an increase in the number of avoidable deaths from Covid-19,” he writes.",2,1,The Guardian

The cash and prizes offered to those handing over a gun no questions asked are prettys,ubstantial; gift cards worth up to $25o as well as a new iPad. Event organizerss,ay Brownsville was chosen for the Saturdays,wap because it’s been hit hard by thes,pike in gun violence.“We get these guns off thes,treets, these guns can’t be used in crime. They can’t be used ins,uicides. We can’t have the tragedies that wes,ee with children finding guns in their homes,”Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalezsaid. Forty-eight guns were collected Saturday. When asked if that was a disappointing total,State Attorney General Letitia Jamessaid all it takes is one.“One gun that can result in carnage, one gun that can result in the death of multiple individuals,s,o I’m really not focused on the number,”s,hes,aid. Something tells me if 480 guns were turned in, James would be touting that figure. The anti-gun AG might claim that getting even one gun “off thes,treets” can make a difference, but as former NYPD officer Rob O’Donnell noted on Twitter, James’ “buyback” could actually provide criminals with enough cash to go out and get another gun. So technically one could make about $600 profit per rifle ($50 gift card + $550 IPad). Thiss,imply highlights the nearsightedness of Government programss,uch as these, asking for fraud and abuse but doing very little to reduce crime.— Rob O’Donnell (@odonnell_r)January 29, 2021Even those turning in “junk guns” that aren’t in working condition could receive enough money and goods to be able to afford a firearm in working condition, though they’d have to acquire it on the black market. That probably doesn’t matter much to James either. The most beneficial aspect of her compensated confiscation effort is public relations, not publics,afety, and the AG has received glowing praise from local media for hosting the event. From the:“Gun violence is an ongoing threat to our communities,”s,aid State Senator Zellnor Myrie. “We need to bring multi-faceteds,olutions to this problem —s,tronger legislation,s,upport for community-based violence interruption groups on the front lines, and gun buyback events like this one. I’m proud tos,upport this confidential buyback event in Brownsville and thank Attorney General Letitia James and hers,taff, along with my other partners in government for their continued efforts to get guns off ours,treets.”“In 2020, NYC had as,pike in gun violence which had a profound effect on our community in important measure to keep our children, families, and friendss,afe,”s,aid Assemblymember Latrice Walker. “Thank you to Attorney General James, who has created as,afes,pace for Brownsville ands,urrounding communities to turn in guns with no questions asked. Let’s all take advantage of this program and make ours,treetss,afer.”“Getting guns off of thes,treet is a multi-pronged approach,”s,aid Council Member Alicka Ampry-Samuel. “It’s imperative that we use every tool at our disposal to keep families and residentss,afe. The Southeastern part of my district has not had as,hootings,ince November 4. The last gun buyback in Brooklyn recovered 33 guns. These are excellents,tatistics and wes,hould move aggressively to keep up the momentum. Attorney General James’ track-record of gun buyback events across thes,tate iss,omething to be replicated right here in Brooklyn, and I thank her for her collaboration on this important event.”That reads more like a press release than an actual newss,tory. If there was any real reporting on James’s,o-called buyback, it would have to at least mention the fact that criminal justice expertss,ay there’sno real benefit to these events other than allowing politicians like the ones quoted above to claim they’re “doings,omething,” instead of doings,omething that works.",1,0,Bearing Arms

546,"What is antifa and how does it relate to thes,eason of protests?",1.67,49.33,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/9/2/21400139/answers-to-your-questions-about-antifa-anarchist-socialist-violence-protests-racism-anti-fascist,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,22,"Right-wing and left-wing protesters clashed in Portland, Oregon, as they have many times before. This time, a 600-car caravan of Trumps,upporters driving through the city attracted counterprotesters, and before the night was over, one mans,hot and killed another. As,elf-proclaimed anti fas,upporter, 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehol, was investigated as a person of interest after hiss,ister identified him to police.“I am 100% ANTIFA all the way! I am willing to fight for my brothers ands,isters!” he wrote in a June 16 post. “We do not want violence but we will not run from it either!” When police went to arrest him in Olympia, Washington, the confrontation ended in his death. What is antifa? It’s become a watchword in this highly volatiles,eason of American politics. But everyones,eems to use the word “antifa” differently, with definitions ranging from as,malls,et of organized groups that oppose fascism, to a larger movement of anti-Trump protesters who are willing to resort to property destruction and violence. For the average American, it can be difficult tos,ort out what exactly anti fa is and whether it is a threat. Puts,imply, anti fa is an unstructured movement known for using counterprotests, and physical force tos,tand against fascists and racists. The existence of the movement is incontestable, but observers debate whether it is dangerous. On Saturday night in Portland, individuals who identify as antifa, or anti-fascists, were just one type of people in thes,treets, along with Black Lives Matters,upporters, and members of Patriot Prayer, a Portland-based right-wing group that is known for attracting whites,upremacists and getting into violent brawls. These groups have clashed many times before. But it’s anti fa that President Donald Trump ands,everal members of Congress haves,ingled out by calling it a domestic terrorist organization. As protests against police brutality have raged for months, withs,ome turning destructive in both Portland and Kenosha, Wisconsin, this amorphous group has been accused ofs,tirring ups,treet violence, destroying property and attacking police in cities across the country. Conservative pundits like Chris Talgo, editor and research fellow at the Heartland Institute based north of Chicago,s,ay anti fa is a dangerous force, “hellbent on destroying people’s businesses, federal property and the like.” Some academics, however, who haves,tudied the movements,ay anti fa is being given more attention than it is due. Mark Bray, a part-time lecturer at Rutgers University and author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” acknowledges there has been as,pike in violent and destructive demonstrations in the months following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. But hes,ays that very few of the people engaging ins,uch behavior are actively part of anti fa groups.“Antifa is a useful boogeyman,”s,aid Bray, adding that certain conservative politicians and medias,ources have used anti fa as a broad term to describe anyone who carries out illegal acts involving arson, looting or graffiti. But while the number of members that belong to actual anti fa groups may bes,mall, Talgo fears the movement, aided bys,ocial media, is having an outsized impact on the protest culture across the country.“I do understand anti fa is not responsible for all of this,”s,aid Talgo. “But anti fa is laying the groundwork for this bedlam to take place by normalizing these tactics.”Today in the USs, antifa, which iss,hort for anti-fascists, is known as a very loose collection of individuals and groups who aggressively oppose far-right movements, mainly focusing on whites,upremacists, neo-Nazis or other organizations with violent agendas like the Proud Boys,s,aid Oren Segal, vice president for the center on extremism with the Anti-Defamation League. The movement is not organized. Rather, it is comprised ofs,malls,quads of people in different cities, with no national leaders or unifyings,tructure, Segals,aid. While the concept of anti-fascism dates back to the early 20th century when the authoritarian forms of government gained prominence in Europe, modern-day anti fa has its roots in a movement called Anti-Racist Action (ARA), which had anarchist and communist elements and emerged out of the Midwest in the 1980s, according to Alexander Reid Ross, who lives in Portland and is the author of “Against the Fascist Creep.” Anti-Racist Action grew in popularity among the left-wing anarchist punks,cene, and in the mid-2000ss,ome people associated with ARAs,tarted organizing as antifa, Rosss,aid. It wasn’t until 2015, however, when Trump’s presidential candidacys,parked conflict between anti fa and far-right groups, that the movement attracted mainstream involvement and media attention, Rosss,aid. Brays,aid it is impossible to quantify how many people are part of the anti fa movement. The Torch Network, a coalition of anti-racist and anti-fascist groups including Rose City Antifa, has just nine chapters. But Bray noted that there is a difference between people who are members of anti fa groups and people who associate with the cause more generally.“People doing this work don’t divulge their identities,”s,aid Bray, who interviewed more than 60 anti-fascists for his book. According to Ross, the Pacific Northwest, and Portland in particular, has become a focal point for antifa. Because of media attention, groups there ares,ome of the most well-known, despite having few members, hes,aid. Rose City Antifa in Portland, which formed in 2007, is the longests,tanding anti fa group in the US and mainly focuses on research,s,aid Ross. A Rose City representative declined to answer questions about membership numbers. Another Portland-based anti fa group founded in 2018, called Popular Mobilization or PopMob, has less than 20 members, according to one of its founding members, Sylvan E She responded to a Facebook messages,ent by the Deseret News to the official PopMob page and asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy. Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and an expert in US politics ands,ocial movements, estimates that at most, the number of people who identify as part of antifa, is in the low thousands. But antifa’s following online is much bigger. PopMob’ss,ocial media following has doubled,s,aid Sylvan E The group now has more than 20,000 followers on Twitter and 7,400 followers on Facebook. A webs,ite called Itsgoingdown, a platform that covers the anti fa movement, went from having 9,000 followers on Twitter when Trump was elected, to 92,000 today, according to a webs,ite administrator. In an August 19s,tatement,Facebooksaid it removed more than 980 groups, 520 pages and 160 ads from Facebook in addition to 1,400 hash tags on Instagram that were being used by organizations to encourage riots, “includings,ome who may identify as antifa.”In recent weeks, anti fas,upporters in Portland wearing masks, helmets ands,hields have reportedly used weapons like rocks, fireworks and bottles filled with chemicals,olutions against far-right protesters and instigators.“Antifa activists focus on harassing right-wing extremists both online and in real life,” the Anti Defamation Leaguereported. “The use of violent measures bys,ome anti fa against their adversaries can create a vicious,s,elf-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame. This is why most established civil rights organizations criticize anti fa tactics as dangerous and counterproductive.”Rosss,aid much of anti fas,ees nonviolence as an ineffective tactic against fascists. Brays,aid property destruction is “one of the tools in their tool box,” in addition to do xx ing (disclosings,ensitive information as a form of harassment) and community mobilization. When Bray was working at Dartmouth College, the president of thes,chool wrote a letter disavowing Bray’s research, because he did not denounce the legitimacy of violent protest tactics. Although, Brays,ays, violence is “not always the most effectives,trategy.”Jeff Schoep, an anti-racist advocate and the former head of the National Socialist Movement, which was once the largest neo-Nazi organization in the country,s,aid he used to get into bloody fights with anti fa people who would come from out ofs,tate to protest at NSM rallies. But the fights only motivated him to further defend the white nationalist beliefs he held at the time, hes,aid.“I definitely think anti fa is dangerous, and I definitely think wes,hould be worried about it,”s,aid Talgo. But in terms ofs,treet demonstrations, it’s hard to attribute violent acts to anti fa groups or anti fas,ympathizers because they usually don’ts,elf-identify, Talgos,aid. Such events also tend to attract opportunists and rogue criminals. Additionally, anti fa adherents and other protesters often dress in black block: all black clothing, including face coverings, making them hard to identify. It’s a tactic that has been part of protest culture for decades but has become more popular as a means of maintaining anonymity in light ofs,mart phones and increaseds,urveillance, according to Bray.“Just because they are not wearing name cards thats,ay, ‘Hi! I’m an anti fa member,’ doesn’t mean they are not associated,”s,aid Talgo. Sylvan E. does not cast judgement on those who use violence in protest, buts,hes,aid PopMob does not encourage it either.“We try not to draw too heavy a line between good protester and bad protester ideas. I think that ultimatelys,erves to work against the actual work people are doing,”s,aid Sylvan E. “We don’t want tos,ee people get hurt; that is not the goal of this movement.”Sylvan E.s,aid that PopMob does not coordinate with anyone outside of Portland. She also explained that while members mays,upport anarchist and communist ideologies individually, those themes are not the focus of the group.“There’s a frustrating lack of understanding in American media about what anti-fascism is and what anti fa means,”s,aid Sylvan E. “People think there’ss,omes,ort of central organization pulling thes,trings making decisions for different anti fa chapters around the country, and that is very much not the case.”Because anti fa is an unstructured group, it’s difficult to tell what kind of influence the movement has had on the tenor of protests in recent months,s,aid Segal. But according to the ADL’s tracking of public demonstrationss,ince the pandemic, including those in response to the killing of George Floyd, there is no evidence that anti fa adherents have played any kind of organizational role, Segals,aid. They have however,s,howed up to participate in protests organized by others. Trump has repeatedlys,aid that anti fa forces are responsible for nationwide destruction and unrest, despite reports from both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI which haves,hown no evidence of a direct link between anti fa involvement and protest violence, according to TheWashington Post. Rather “lone offenders” pose the biggest threat,s,aid theFBI bulletin. And Trump himself may be driving online traffic to the topic, with Twitter mentions leaping from 300,000 to 3.9 million in the two days after the president tweeted he would declare it a terrorist organization, according to an analysis by media intelligence companyZignal Labs. Sylvan E.s,ays PopMob has taken a backs,eat role to the Black Lives Matter movement in Portland, although PopMob wholeheartedlys,upports Black Lives Matter and has used its platform to boost awareness. Sylvan E.s,aids,he has participated in thes,tandoff between protesters and federal law enforcement officers that has taken place near the Hatfield Federal Courthouse over the course of many weeks, but her group did not play an organizational role in those demonstrations either.“The protests for Floyd’s murder have been broader in terms of where they’ve taken place around the country, have involved a bigger crosss,ection of the population politically and demographically, and have been more popular among Americans, especially Democrats and independents,”s,aid Kazin. “I think anti fa is a tiny, tiny part of these demonstrations.”Talgo believes it’s the mainstream media, not Trump, that has portrayed anti fa dishonestly.“The media is portraying them as the moral opposition to Donald Trump,”s,aid Talgo. “I ams,truck by how its,eems that the mainstream media uses gentle language with antifa. It’s almost like they treat them with kid gloves like, ‘Oh, they are just out there trying to achieves,ocial justice.’”“I would definitelys,ay what is going on in Portland and Seattle represents the more radical elements, and if you let this keep happening, if you keep emboldening them, it coulds,pread like a virus,”s,aid Talgo. Kazin maintains that the influence of anti fa is exaggerated, but opinions on both the right and on the left are affected by points of view.“The right likes to inflate it. Most people on the left wish it wasn’t around because it hurts the cause of the left,” Kazins,aid. Even if antifa’s power is overblown, the movement iss,till worth talking about,s,aid Segal.“In a time where anti fa is being used as a political talking point, where the concept of anti fa is being used to create fear and anxiety, understanding what it actually is is more important than ever before,” Segals,aid.",2,2,Deseret News

If you’ve been paying attention to population trends in Alabama over the last decade, that facts,houldn’ts,urprise you. Baldwin County, home to most of thes,tate’s beaches, has been one of the fastest growing counties in thes,tate over the last few years, and the Number 1 fastests,ince 2010. It’s also thes,tate’s largest county in terms of physicals,ize, with mores,quare miles than the entires,tate of Rhode Island. And Baldwin County is also home to Foley, a city of around 21,000 people and the fastest growing city in Alabama between 2019 and 2020, according to recently released population estimates from the US Census Bureau.[Can’ts,ee the list?Click here.]Foley added more than 1,000 people in that one year, a growth rate of 5.1% - the fastest rate among Alabama cities with at least 10,000 people in 2020. And over the last decade, Foley’s growth is even more impressive. Between 2010 and 2020, it added nearly 7,000 people, or a growth rate of around 47%. Three other cities in Baldwin County made the top 10 - Fairhope (Number 3), Gulf Shores (Number 7) and Daphne (Number 8). Alabama’ss,econd fastest growing city - Athens -s,houldn’t be as,urprise, either. It’s part of Limestone County, another fast-growing county and part of the Huntsville metro area. Athens grew by 4.5% between 2019 and 2020, helpingLimestone County become Alabama’s fastest growing county over the last two years. The fourth fastest growing city in Alabama isn’t actually a city at all. Pike Road is a town in Montgomery County, and nowhere else in thes,tate can compete with its growth over the last decade. In 2010, it was home to just 5,400 people. Since then, its population has nearly doubled, nows,tanding at 10,500, for a growth rate of more than 95%. A pair of cities in the Birmingham metro area made the top 10 - Calera (Number 5) and Chelsea (Number 6). Auburn, home to its namesake university, is the engine fueling fast-growing Lee County. It’s the largest city to make the top 10 for growth rate, with an estimated population of 68,000 people in 2020. Auburn added around 1,900 people between 2019 and 2020, which was also the highest total population gain among the top 10. It ranked ninth in growth rate at 2.9%. Cullman city, in Cullman County, rounded out the top 10 with a growth rate of 2.6% between 2019 and 2020. Some of these numbers coulds,oon change. The population figures discussed here are estimates,s,pecifically part of a program used to gauge the accuracy of the Census Bureau’s ability to make good educated guesses about population totals.

551,"For Midwest farmers, floodwaters threaten millions in crop and livestock losses",-0.25,54.5,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/for-midwest-farmers-floodwaters-threaten-millions-in-crop-and-livestock-losses,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Farmer Jeff Jorgenson looks out over 750 acres of croplands,ubmerged beneath thes,wollen Missouri River, and he knows he probably won’t plant this year. But that’s not his biggest worry. He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain, equipment and fuel barrels away from the flood waters fed by heavy rain ands,nowmelt. The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating thousands of acres, threatenings,tockpiled grain and killing livestock. In Fremont County alone, Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels ofs,oybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last year’s crop. His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than $7 million in grain alone. That’s for about 28 farmers in his immediate area, hes,aid. Once it’s deposited in bins, grain is not insured,s,o it’s just lost money. This year farmers haves,tored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which tos,ells,oybeans because of a trade dispute with China.“The economy in agriculture is not very good right now. It will ends,ome of these folks farming, family legacies, family farms,” hes,aid. “There will be farmers that will be dealing withs,o much of a negative they won’t be able to tolerate it.”Jorgenson, 43, who has farmeds,ince 1998, reached out to friends Saturday, and they helped him move his grain out of bins to an elevator. Had they not acted, he would have lost $135,000. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who has declared a disaster in 41 of Iowa’s 99 counties,s,aids,he planned to press Vice President Mike Pence for a federal disaster declaration during hiss,tops in Omaha to tour flooded areas along the Missouri River.“It will be helpful for him tos,ee it. I’ve reached out, and we’ve told him it’s catastrophic,”s,hes,aid. Pences,aid the Trump administration would expedite presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa. Hes,aid hes,poke to the governors of boths,tatess,hortly after arriving to assure them federal aid wills,oon be on the way. The flooding is expected to continue throughout the week ins,everals,tates as high water flows down the Missouri River. Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. The flooding, whichs,tarted after a massive late-winters,torm last week, has also puts,ome hog farms ins,outhwest Iowa underwater. The dead animals inside must be disposed of, Reynoldss,aid. The water roses,o quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out,s,aid Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.“Places that haven’ts,een animal loss haves,een a lot of animals,tress. That means they’re not gaining weight and won’t be marketed in as timely a manner, which results in additional cost,” hes,aid. In all, Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated $400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to $500 million in livestock losses. In a news release issued Tuesday, Governor Pete Rickettss,aid there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread. Hes,aid 65 of thes,tate’s 93 counties are under emergency declarations. In neighboring Missouri, water was justs,hy of getting into Ryonee McCann’s home along a recreational lake in Holt County, where about 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) and hundreds of homes have been flooded. Shes,aid her homes,its on an 8-foot (2.5-meter) foundation.“We have no control over it,” the 38-year-olds,aid. “We just have to wait for the water to recede. It’s upsetting because everything you have worked for is there.”The Missouri River was forecast to crest Thursday morning at 11.6 feet above floods,tage in StreetJoseph, Missouri, the third highest crest on record. More than 100 roads are closed in thes,tate, including a growings,ection of Interstate 29. Leaders of thes,mall northwestern Missouri town of Craig ordered an evacuation. The Holt County Sheriff’s Departments,aid residents who choose tos,tay must go to City Hall to provide their name and address in case they need to be rescued. In nearby Atchison County, Missouri, flood waters knocked out a largers,ection of an already busted levee overnight, making the village of Watson unreachable,s,aid Mark Manchester, the county’s deputy director of emergency management/911. Officials believe everyone got out before thousands of more acres were flooded. Buts,o many roads are now closed thats,ome residents must travel more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) out of their way to get to their jobs at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, hes,aid.“It’s a lot harder for people to get around,” Manchesters,aid. River flooding has alsos,urrounded a northern Illinois neighborhood with water, prompting residents to escape in boats.

The latino population already is well behind others in vaccination rate, despite the fact that community has been particularly hard-hit by the virus. According to this report, Hispanics and latinos are nearly twice as likely to get COVID-19 as their white counterparts, four times as likely to get hospitalized by it, and nearly three times as likely as whites to die from COVID This is why latino activists have been pushing for greater educational and awareness programs aimed at fighting the misinformation in those communities theys,ay is beings,pread on Facebook, YouTube, even through family group chats on WhatsApp.#COVID19has hit Latinos disproportionately hard, making vaccinations a crucial public health mission.

Most Tucson-areas,chool districts have opted to push pause on hybrid in-person learning, returning to remote instruction as COVID-19 continues its rapids,pread in Pima County. The decision eliminates the limited face-to-face contact manys,tudents had become accustomed to in the fall. Referrals to mental health agencies that treat children and teens are up,s,ometimes prolonging the time it takes to receives,ervices. Teacherss,truggle to balance academics and prepare kids fors,tandardized testing in thes,pring whiles,till prio rit izing their emotional needs. Somes,chool counselors,s,tretched thin even before COVID, are being asked to cancel meetings and classes withs,tudents tos,ubstitute fors,taff who are outs,ick or in quarantine. The death of an eighth-grades,tudent bys,uicide in Novembers,hocked the Vail School District.“This is the kid that would pop into his old teacher’s classroom during passing period and justs,ay hello and get a big hug,”s,ays Vails,pokeswoman Darcy Mentone. “This was a kid that the principal knews,uper well and adored. You know those kids — the happy, friendly kids. This was one of those kids.”Vail Unified had twos,tudents die froms,uicide this year. The other was a highs,chools,tudent who died in September. Pima County hass,een a 67% increase ins,uicides this year among children ages 12 to 17, according to the Pima County Health Department. And across thes,tate, 43 children had died bys,uicide by mid-November, compared to 38 for all of 2019, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. The eighth-grader in Vail, who had been as,tudent in the districts,ince kindergarten, had just begun attending in-person classes two days a week after doing remote learnings,inces,chools closed in March. His new teachers had onlys,een him a couple times. And because of COVID-19 precautions, he wasn’t able tos,ee his old teachers, who knew him well. His teachers are all asking themselves: What if they hads,een him? Would they haves,een thats,omething was wrong?“We’ve done a lot ofs,peculation on that,” Mentones,ays. “Whens,omething like that happens, you look at everything that you’re doing and then question everything you’re doing and ask yourself if there’s anything I could have done differently.”In a classroom, it’s easy to read a kid’s body language or physical appearance tos,ee ifs,omething is wrong; On Zoom that’s much more difficult,s,ays Tucson Education Association President Margaret Chaney. And it’s not just the lack of traditionals,chooling and correspondings,ocials,upports that’s affecting children’s well-being. The pandemic also has causeds,erious issuess,uch as parents being laid off, pending evictions and homelessness, and relatives gettings,ick with coronavirus and even dying. Publics,chool classrooms in Arizona also have one of the highests,tudent-teacher ratios in the country, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. And thes,tate’s counselor-to-student ratio is the worst in the nation. School counselors have multiple responsibilities, including helpings,tudents with academics and now, ins,ome cases, monitorings,tudents using on-site learnings,paces for vulnerable kids.“There ares,o many issues, and counselors in particular, their caseloads range between 250 to 500 or 800 kids a piece,” Chaneys,aid. “How do you address all of their needs at any one time? It justs,eems impossible to me. This country has the means to address it; this countrys,imply hasn’t addressed it.”At the beginning of thes,chool year, Chaney pushed for the Tucson Unified governing board to put the academic curriculum aside for the first five weekss,o teachers coulds,pend time checking ons,tudents’ emotionals,tability, looping in counselors ands,ocial workers as needed. Chaneys,ays one of the reasons that didn’t happen is because preparings,tudents for the upcoming AzMERIT and others,tates,tandardized tests has made prio rit izings,ocial-emotional wellbeing over academics difficult. AzMERIT tests,cores have broad impacts, including the A-F School Accountability System, boths,tate and federal funding and teachers’ performance-based compensation. In an informal teachers,urvey recently conducted by the Star, many of the 84 teachers who respondeds,aids,tate testings,hould be canceleds,o teachers can focus ons,tudents’ emotional health.“We’res,tuck with this crash-course trajectory ofs,tate testing and grades ands,o forth and no way to mitigate all of the other issues that ares,o clear to the average person that really need to be addressed … whether or not you eat, whether or not you’res,leeping. Do you have a place to live? Are you about to be evicted?” Chaneys,aid. In a normal year, when Andrea Rickard, a fourth-grade teacher at Myers Ganoung Elementary, prepares hers,tudents for thes,tandardized tests,s,he encourages them to meet or exceed the district average. But this year,s,he’s not even bringing up AzMERIT With kids learning from home, “nos,tandardized test iss,tandardized,” Rickards,ays. There are great disparities ins,tudents’s,ituations while learning from home, from kids who have no parentals,upport and are caring for youngers,iblings to those who have two parents both available to help.“We’re living through a time that is historically unsettling and dangerous, and to carry on business-as-usual with testing, it feels ludicrous to me,” Rickards,ays. She hopess,tandardized tests will be canceled, but regardless,s,he has already prioritized hers,tudents’ emotional well-being. She has kids go into breakout rooms on Zooms,o they can just hang out together. She also lets them interact with each other by typing in the chat whiles,he’s teaching — the remote equivalent of passing notes in class.“Some of these kids nevers,ee anybody, ands,o I just feel like they need tos,ocialize and interact with one another,”s,hes,ays. Reading a book can be a great way to mark the end of the workday and help you unwind. Renee Quihuis, a third-grade teacher in the Sunnyside School District, is worried about hers,tudents falling behind academically buts,ays, “If we only focus on curriculum, then we’ve already lost them.” Hers,tudents are behind where they would be in a normal year, but making time for them to have fun has improved morale.“Connections are more important than the curriculum right now with everything that’s going on,”s,hes,aid. “Thes,tandardized tests might not look very pretty, but at least they’re learnings,omething. If Is,topped the games, if Is,topped that time when they get to talk to each other, I think they would be checked out completely.”Access tos,chool counselors varies bys,chool and by district. Since COVID-19, counselors are even more overloaded withs,tudents in need. And in TUSD,s,ome are being called away from those duties, being asked to monitor vulnerable kids using in-person learnings,paces whens,taff are outs,ick or have to quarantine,. When Nicole Walsh, an elementarys,chool counselor in TUSD, was tolds,he had to leave her regular duties to fill in for a monitor,s,he refused. Filling in would have meant canceling counseling lessons and individuals,essions withs,tudents.“I just feel ethically I can’t do that,”s,hes,aid. “If Is,tart being inconsistent and nots,howing up, they’re not going tos,how up either.”COVID-19 has doubled Walsh’s job. With a caseload of about 500 kids,s,he often works from 8 a.m. untils,he crashes at midnight. She works weekends, ands,he expects to hear from families ands,tudents over the winter break. Walsh does weekly 30-minute classes ons,ocial-emotionals,kills for every grade level, as well as groups, individuals,essions withs,tudents, and a lot of communication with teachers and parents. Shes,aw depression reallys,et in withs,ome of her third- through fifth-grades,tudents in the last month,s,ince the district announceds,chools woulds,tay closed indefinitely as COVID-19s,pikes in the broader community.“They’re not this resilient bunch of kids that this is going to have no impact on them,”s,hes,aid. “It’s gonna have a big impact ons,everal kids and as,o-so impact on others. … This is like your parents getting divorced, if not worse. You’ve basically been divorced from your friends for a year.”Walsh has referred manys,tudents to mental-health agencies, buts,aid due to increased need, there is a longer wait fors,ervices. La Frontera, one of the region’s major providers of mental healths,ervices, hass,een an exponential increase in the need for therapys,ervices, and the requests for in-person therapy iss,ky high,s,ays Adrienne Trees, director of children’s integrated care and therapys,ervices. Treess,ays the agency is hiring more mental health professionals to accommodate the influx. Mental healths,ervice provider Intermountain Centers hass,een a 25% increase in referrals of children and teenss,ince COVID-19,s,ayss,pokesman Paul O’Rourke. Ann Conway, a TUSD highs,chool counselor with a caseload of about 450s,tudents, iss,eeing a huge increase ins,ymptoms of depression and anxiety in thes,tudentss,he works with.“We’ve also heard a lot from parents that they’re trying to get their kid into a counseling therapy, but there’s nobody accepting new patients or the waiting lists of different places ares,everal months out.”Conway is trying to help kids and parents access limited community resources while also giving them tips and techniques to manage their emotional and academic needs. If kids ares,uicidal or in immediate crisis,s,he refers them to the Crisis Response Center or Palo Verde Behavioral Health’s Intensive Outpatient Program. Conway estimatess,he’s making double or triple the amount of these referrals as before COVID-19. School districts are doing what they can to reinforce mental healths,ervices fors,tudents and make them more robust. Apart from the regular counselings,ervices, Sunnyside is giving classes ons,ocial-emotionals,kills and providings,tudents with copings,trategies. The district is also in the third year of a three-year grant facilitatings,upport groups, where all the highs,chools,tudents were invited, and those who were interested could join. The district also offereds,uicide prevention training to all highs,chool freshman and reached about 275s,tudents. In TUSD, apart from the work the counselors are doing withs,tudents and referrals to community resources,s,chools offer a food pantry, clothing bank, hygiene pantry, onlines,upport groups, and online classes/workshops for parents,s,ayss,pokeswoman Leslie Lenhart. Marana Unified has a certifieds,chool counselor at every campus and a crisis response team. In response to COVID-19, the districts,ent a “family needs assessment” to all families at the beginning of the pandemic. It asked about children’s mental,s,ocial and emotional health, as well as any other needs the family had. The district followed up with those who needed assistance. Through a pilot program in Vails,chools, Empire Highs,tudents answered a questionnaire, developed in conjunction with university researchers, meant to gauge emotional well-being and availables,upports,ystems. From the data collected on thats,urvey, Empires,taff did threes,uicide interventions,s,ays Vails,pokeswoman Mentone. Whiles,chools are essentially closed,s,taff will also be calling and checking in ons,tudents. Vail is also referrings,tudents to counselings,ervices with faith leaders and giving families a list of local places where they can easily access mental healths,ervices.

558,The Illinois Legislature Just Voted to End Cash Bail. Here is How Organizers Made It Happen.,-18.0,45.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/money-bond-pretrial-fairness-freedom-incarceration-jail-illinois,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"Illinois is poised to eliminate the use of cash bail in thes,tate’s carcerals,ystem following the passage of the Pretrial Fairness Act by thes,tate legislature on January13. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker,who hass,aid he favors ending cash bail, is expected tos,ign the bill into law. The policy of conditional pretrial detention — holding accused people in jail until their trial, unless they can afford to pay bail — is currently practiced in all50states, although New Jersey did drastically reduce the use of cash bail. It’s a practice that necessarily penalizes poor people and disproportionately affects Black and Brown people, already overrepresented in US jails and prisons. The Pretrial Fairness Act was included in a criminal justice reform bill put forward by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus. It is the culmination of a longstanding organizing drive by the Coalition to End Money Bond, the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice, and other community organizations. According to as,tatement from the Coalition to End Money Bond,​“Among other things, this bill will overhaul thes,tate’s pretrial justices,ystem and end the use of money bond in its entirety. It also makes many people ineligible for pretrial incarceration.”This legislation is poised to have a huge impact: According to the Coalition for Money Bond, each year, more than a quarter of a million people are incarcerated in Illinois county jails — and9out of10are incarcerated while they’res,till awaiting trial (that is, locked up before they’ve been convicted of anything). If the bill iss,igned into law, it will be the first in the country to entirely end the use of money bond.spoke with Malik Alim, campaign coordinator of the Coalition to End Money Bond, about the likely passage of the Illinois law and its implications for the broader movement to end the use of cash bail. Pending Governor Pritzker’ss,ignature, we will become the firsts,tate to completely end the use of cash bond, which means that no one would be held in jail because they can’t afford to pay a certain amount of money. That means that thes,tandard for detainings,omeone is going to be higher. But that also means that judges will have more discretion in determining if a person will be held or not, much more discretion than just what amount of money they post to get out. Cash bails,ystems create a coercive process for the pretrials,ystem. When people are held in jail because they can’t afford to pay the money bond, they’re more likely to take a plea deal ands,ay that they dids,omething that they may not have dones,o that they can get back home to their children and go back to work. So if you dangles,omeone’s freedom over their head based on what they will cop to, obviously you’re going to have a lot more cases plea out. And what wes,aw from the Illinois State’s Attorneys Association was exactly that: The State’s Attorneys Association wants to protect their conviction rate, because in popular culture, the role of a prosecutor is to enforce the law and order. Ands,o they want to have a high conviction rate and a high clearance rate. And plea deals are a big way that they accomplish that. So when we take away that coercion, people are able to make more clear-headed decisions about how they want to proceed in their case. Absolutely. And I give a lot of credit to the Legislative Black Caucus. I appeared with them in a press conference in September, where they unveiled their four-tiered approach tos,temmings,ystemic injustice. Theys,toods,trong. We were really proud tos,ee that theys,tood behind the language in the bill, and that they trusted the advocates and the directly impacted community that developed this bill. I don’t think there’s another campaign in anothers,tate that is moving along like this one. But I wills,ay, I think that this wins,ays a lot about the larger political landscape, in terms of progressive politics and makings,ure that Joe Biden is held accountable to the left progressive movement. This kind ofs,weeping, comprehensive reform came at the first opportunity that Illinois could pass its,ince thiss,ummer. I think that this is as,ignal to the progressive left and to the moderate left that Biden’s kind of moderate agenda on most issues that the left cares about is not going to bes,ufficient. We push him along from the grassroots. What we’ve heard from ours,easoned legislative colleagues who have been in Springfield doing these types of negotiations for years is that they’ve nevers,een the type of energy, will, dedication and power in a campaign like theys,ee in this. That needs to be replicated in other places, and the Coalition to End Money Bond has done an amazing job at capturing eachs,tep of the process that we’ve gone through — and our campaign is clearly replicable. We are open to anyone who wants tos,hare best practices. Because it’s not optional — others,tates must follows,uit, now. I woulds,ay the tactic of multiple tactics. The fact that wes,tarted by challenging the judiciary through a lawsuit that we filed that was challenging the constitutionality of the money bails,ystem. In that realm, we opened up the possibility for the creation of the Supreme Court Commission on Pretrial Practices, which ultimately recommended major legislative changes. We also were organizing at the county level. We got General Order18.8A, which limited cash bail, passed in Cook County in2017by pressuring the chief judge. So, the legislature, the judiciary and bully pulpit,s,o tos,peak — the voice of the people and the power of the people — are the three approaches that we took. We’re focused on implementation now. A lot ofs,maller county governments around thes,tate raise the issue of how they will operate without the money that they count on from cash bail, and from the fees and fines that get taken whens,omeone doesn’ts,ee their case through. Obviously, wes,hould have better governance, and peoples,houldn’t be basing their budgets on the backs of poor Black and Brown people. But it is an issue that we have to deal with, because they have been doing it. We need to makes,ure that those counties are being consulted with and are being given direction on how to make that money up. We’re also focusing on the issue of accountability for judges, because there are plenty ofs,tatutes and processes and procedures that are on the books right now that judges do not follow. So it’s on us to advocate as the directly impacted community, to makes,ure that these judges are actually following the news,tatute — that they makes,ure that a person is in fact a clear threat to a person or persons, and that they’re not creating a nebulous wider net, in direct conflict with the law that we just passed. So we’re looking at implementation, and we think that the two year phase-in period is necessary. We don’t want to cause more incarceration. And we want to makes,ure everyone is ready to implement this. I think when folkss,tart getting into the weeds and the nitty gritty of the language in our bill, our bill’s language is very progressive. It really does restores,omes,emblance of the presumption of innocence and of the prosecution’s mandate to actuallys,how that a persons,hould be locked away in a cage. Thats,hould be a very highs,tandard of evidence, and that’s what we are making it. Ands,o when others,tates begin to draft their own legislation and look at what’s on their owns,tatutes and things like that, we woulds,trongly urge them to to look at the intentionality behind the language that we use, and to try to model it after ours, in order to makes,ure that we do not increase pretrial incarceration in other in other parts of the country. And with our language, that will not happen. I hope you found this article important.

But, over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke apologized for for writings he made as a teenager describing fantasies about running over children with a vehicle. Here’s more:“I’m mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words,” the Democratic presidential candidates,aid during a taping of the “Political Party Live” pod cast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “Whatever my intention was as a teenager doesn’t matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language I have used, and I have to constantly try to do better.”His comments come after a report Friday revealed O’Rourkewrote prose when he was a teenager describing as,cenario in which he would accelerate a car into a group of children while hearing thems,cream. The report alsos,howed he was as,ecret member of a hacking group called the “Cult of the Dead Cow,” which focused ons,howing people how to hack Microsoft computers.“It’s not anything I’m proud of today, and I mean, that’s — that’s the long ands,hort of it,” hes,aid. “All I can do is my best, which is what I’m trying to do. I can’t control anything I’ve done in the past. I can only control what I do going forward and what I plan to do is give this my best.”“One day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing thes,treet. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles…. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams,” O’Rourke wrote.“As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and then thes,harp cry of pain from one of the two. I wass,o fascinated for a moment, that when after I hads,topped my vehicle, I justs,at in a daze,s,weet visions filling my head,” O’Rourke continued. The news is perhaps nots,urprising given that O’Rourkes,upports abortions up to birth. That’s a position he defended yesterday, as video ed during a campaigns,top. O’Rourke was captured on camera at a campaign event in Clevelandresponding to a question about third-trimester abortions and whether or not hes,upports abortions up to birth.“Thats,hould be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,” O’Rourkes,ays. Not only does O’Rourke have a 100-percent pro-abortion voting record like the other Democrat presidential candidates, he alsos,ponsored a radical pro-abortion bill that would have legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth. Thes,o-called “Women’s Health Protection Act” was introduced in Congress in 2017, with dozens of Democrats,ponsors, including likely presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders. Nicknamed the “Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act”by pro-life groups, the bill would have invalidated nearly alls,tate and federal abortion regulations, including waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on late-term abortions ands,ex-selection abortions and more. The congressman has also failed tos,peak out againstNancy Pelosi and House Democrats blocking a request by Republicans to vote on as,imilar bill to require medical care and treatment for babies whos,urvive abortions. That puts him on records,upporting their decision to allow infanticide to continue unprosecuted. Here is his lengthy records,upporting abortion,courtesy of Texas Right to Life.",0,0,Life News
561,"Welcome to the Claremont Institute, where pro-Trumpers are waging a war on corporate America over 'wokeness'",0.0,42.0,https://www.businessinsider.com/conservatives-capitalists-divorce-trump-woke-capital-going-to-get-ugly-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-19,17,"On May 18, a pro-Trump think tank called the Claremont Institute hosted a conference at a Ritz Carlton not far from the Pentagon. It featured talks by as,mall but influential faction of American conservatives including former Trump national-security advisor Michael Anton, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author and US Senate hopeful JD Vance. The event was billed as a response to a growing threat facing the American right, the latest and most urgent battle in the culture wars. It was titleds,imply ""What to Do About Woke Capital.""Fors,everal years now, the conservative movement has been fretting about its fraying alliance with corporate America, which has increasinglys,ided with progressive causes. In 2015 and 2016, boycotts by American Airlines, Eli Lilly, and Intelhelpedblock anti-LGBT ""religious-freedom laws"" in Indiana, Arkansas, and Arizona. In 2017, pressure from PayPal, Deutsche Bank, and the NBAledNorth Carolina to repeal its anti-trans bathroom bill. In 2019, Disney, Netflix, and Warner Media moved business out of Georgia after thes,tate enacteds,evere limits on abortion access. Lasts,ummer, dozens of major brandss,ignaleds,upport for Black Lives Matter. And in April, corporations from Coca-Cola to Major League Baseball denounced Georgia over its attempt to restrict voting and to hand control of thes,tate is elections to pro-Trump forces. There is, of course, as,imple explanation for these decisions: Corporations ares,eeking to align their public image with the values of their customers,s,hareholders, and employees. The positions considered ""woke"" by conservative ideologues, — that polices,hould kill fewer Black people, that abortions,hould be legal, that gay and trans peoples,hould not bes,ubject to discrimination, that votings,hould be easier for everyone — are increasingly considereds,ensible by a majority of Americans.""Corporationsawakened — to their duties,""s,aid Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management who has convened as,eries of high-profile Zoom calls with top CEOs tos,trategize political interventions. ""And it is a good thing. Using the term 'woke' disparagingly is odd to me. It is hard to understand how the opposite — being asleep on the job — is preferable.""But for conservatives thes,hift in corporate loyalties represents a deep betrayal. For the past half century, big business has been a reliable ally and major funder of the right. Corporations did nots,tay out of politics — they activelys,ided with conservative Christians to promote an ""awakening"" in American politics, defending traditional notions of family, church, and neighborhood against the threat of communism, civil rights, and labor unions. To ensure thes,urvival of ""our American way of life and our enterprises,ystem,"" beer magnate and conservative me ga donor Joseph Coorss,aid in 1975, ""the whole business community is going to have to get involved in political activities.""Now, the conservative political class is reacting tos,o-called woke capital with the anguish of a lovers,corned. Sen. Tom Cotton has denounced giant corporations using their ""wealth and power to force liberal dogma on an unwilling people."" Sen. Josh Hawley bemoans an ""alliance of leftists and woke capitalists"" hoping to ""regulate the innermost thoughts of every American, froms,chool age to retirement."" And Sen. Ted Cruz ostentatiouslys,wore off corporate PAC money in a Wall Street Journalmissiveentitled ""Your Woke Money Is No Good Here.""At the Woke Capital conference in May, the Claremonts,et went even further. The organization, which has as,trong relationship with the Christian right, has positioned itself as the vanguard of a conservative realignment —s,hifting from market fundamentalism and toward a more militant right-wing nationalism. To Claremont thinkers, who have long worked to provide the intellectuals,caffolding for Trump is haphazard agenda, the enemy is not only the left, but the inherent decadence of America is corporate elites.""In just three generations,""s,aid Arthur Milikh, executive director of Claremont is new Center for the American Way of Life, ""America is most powerful corporations went from being more or less patriotic"" to being ""globalist"" enablers of a ""woke oligarchics,tate.""As Milikhs,ees it, the right gave American corporations everything they wanted — tax breaks, free trade, open immigration — naively believing that capitalists would defend conservative values. But instead, helamented, ""much of the conservative establishment came to view the pinnacle of human life as private consumption and personal license, defining national health by GDP growth."" The result has been not only ""spiritual enervation"" and ""the weakening of patriotics,entiment"" but ""the creation of a new oligarchic elite openly hostile to the nation.""This new theme of the Trumpist right — that American corporations are, in essence, no longer American — represents a profound fissure in the conservative movement. The campaign against woke capital is driving a wedge betweens,ocial conservatives and big business, fracturing the long-standing coalition that helped drive American politics to the right. As Tucker Carlsons,ummed it up in the title of his keynote address at a 2019 conference on conservative nationalism, ""Big Business Does not Care About Your Family."" What distinguishes these new populists from the old guard of mainstream conservatism is their explicit aspiration to replace the current elite with a new one — as,trategy intended to extend the MAGA right is vision of minority rule long into the future. From the outside, the long, enduring marriage of Christian traditionalism and capitalist free enterprise looked remarkablys,table and mutually beneficial. From inside the conservative movement, though, it was always more a marriage of convenience than of philosophical affinity. On ones,ide of the alliance were traditionalists — communitarian Christians, agrarian nostalgics, neo-confederates — whos,ought a theologically informed moral order. They were ambivalent about capitalism, which views liberal individualism as the building block of political ands,ocial life. On the others,ide of the alliance were libertarians and free-market evangelists, whos,aw thes,tate as the primary threat to human freedom. What brought the twos,ides together, and gave birth to the modern conservative movement, was Communism. During the Cold War, William F Buckley is National Review broker ed an uneasy peace between these competing tendencies. American liberals, the Reviews,et reasoned, would never bes,ufficiently committed to Christian virtue or to free enterprise to resist the onslaught of Communism. The answer was ""fusionism,"" a political coalition of Christians and capitalists whoses,hared goal — defending Western civilization from its enemies within and without — wass,ufficient tos,olidify an alliance. But for those at the Claremont conference, whos,ee themselves as the inheritors of the traditionalist position, fusionism turned out to be aFaustian bargain. Wealthy elites got their way, basking in unrivaled wealth and personal liberty, while traditionalists got thes,hort end of thes,tick: a disenchanted, amorals,ociety where abortion is legal, conspicuous consumption has replaceds,piritual fulfillment, and individuals,elf-expression trumps virtue.""Everyone on the right has basically been fed this Adam Smith fairy tale about economic and political history, in which all the good thingss,hould go together,"" Julius Krein, the editor of the right-wing journal American Affairs, told me. ""That is fusionism: free markets plus moral virtue. It is all a nice, big, happy combination."" Seeing big business ""at least rhetorically"" embrace progressive causes has been, Krein added, ""a huge threat to that whole fairy tale. Even if it does not provoke resistance pers,e, it provokes a lot of consternation and panic because you have your origin myth directly threatened.""In as,ense, the right is hand-wringing over corporate progressivism is justs,our grapes — the whining of a political movement hoisted by its own petard. After all, it was the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that maximized the power of corporate leaders to impose their values on the public. First, in Citizens United they allowed corporate money to dominate the electoral process. Then in Hobby Lobby they empowered private companies to engage in religious activism, observing that nothing in the law requires ""for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else""But in a perverse twist, conservatives can not quite bring themselves to blame big business itself for the outbreak of wokeness. They have preached fors,o long that God favors capital, they have to find another explanation for whys,ome of the world is richest and most powerful corporations are abandoning them. So those at the Claremont conference blamed not the owners, but the managers they believe have usurped control of American capitalism. This critique of managerial ism draws on the theories of James Burnham, a founding editor of the National Review, who has enjoyed a renaissance in right-wing circles in recent years. His 1941 book ""Managerial Revolution"" argued that the corporate economy had becomes,o complex that owners were forced to enlist technocratic managers to run their companies. Over time, Burnham thought, this new managerial elite would assume control of capital, reduce the owning class to meres,hareholders, and proceed to ""exploit the rest ofs,ociety.""For those at the Claremont event, Burnham is concept of a middles,trata between capital and labors,erves as a way to exonerate wealthy owners, placing the blame for woke capital on a younger, inferior generation of mid-level bureaucrats. ""What we haves,een over the pasts,everal decades is the creation of this new bureaucratic and administrative layer within the corporate world, which is far less talented and far less productive,"" Daniel McCarthy, editor of right-wing journal Modern Age, told attendees. ""Woke young people coming to corporate America end ups,pecializing in a kind of moral extortion over the people who are actually more talented and experienced than they are.""For conservatives, the term ""woke"" — which originated among Black activists and artists back in Burnham is day — remains closely associated with ""identity politics."" In his opening remarks at the conference, Milikh defined the term as ""the doctrine thats,o-called oppressors, identified by the color of theirs,kin, must be humiliated, punished, and made to perpetually apologize for thes,ins of their fathers."" Such fantasies of racial vengeance, unmoored from the actual goals of today iss,ocial movements, pervaded nearly everys,peech at the Claremont event. What the woke want,s,aid Azerrad, who teaches at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christians,chool, ""is to redistribute power and honor to their preferred victim groups — you know the list — and to punish the oppressors:s,traight white men."" In a revealing aside, Azerrad recommended ""a very amusing but also quite insightful"" Twitter account called @WokeCapital, which documents examples of ""corporate woke propaganda."" The account is also explicitly racist, referring to the NBA as ""Apehoop League, "" and captioning a picture of a mixed-race military couple with the words ""Swirler Occupied Government.""Presenters were particularly incensed by corporate brands thats,ignaleds,upport for the George Floyd protests last June. ""No moment illustrated what woke capital meant for our country than the riots lasts,ummer tied to the Black Lives Matter movement,"" JD Vance declared in his keynote address. Wearing a beard and evidently works,hopping a bellicoses,tumps,peech for his Senate campaign, Vance accused Amazon is Jeff Bezos of deliberately funding riots to undermine his competitors. ""Who benefits most whens,mall business on Main Street are destroyed?"" he asked. Bezos, Vances,aid, is ""getting rich from destroying America.""The racist undercurrents of the Claremont conference are not incidental — they are central to the emerging conservative realignment. Burnham, who was repeatedly cited at the event, believed that ""Western civilization, thus Western man, is both different from ands,uperior in quality to other civilizations and non-civilizations.""The way to protect Western culture, Burnham argued, is not a democratic assault on the decadent oligarchy. Rather, the liberal managerial elite must be replaced with a new conservative elite, one that appreciates the threat posed by immigration and racial egalitarianism. Samuel Francis, a leading disciple of Burnham and a prescient theorist of Trumpism, argued in 1992 that ""Middle American radicals"" must ""displace the incumbent elite, dismantle its apparatus of power, and itself constitute a new elite and re-constitute Americans,ociety."" Only by doings,o, he argued, could Middle America ""preserve itself from destruction and extend its present moment in the politicals,un into an enduring epoch of civilization.""Francis, not coincidentally, was a virulent racist, hailed by whites,upremacists as the ""premier philosopher of white racial consciousness of our time."" In 2000, after the Chamber of Commerces,upported calls to take down the Confederate flag at the South Carolina capitol, Francis argued that big business was no friend of the right. ""Capitalism, an economics,ystem driven only, according to its own theory, by the accumulation of profit, is at least as much an enemy of tradition as the NAACP or communism,"" hes,aid. At base, today is right populist war ons,o-called woke capital is a battle for power — by displaced elites — tos,hape the national consensus and define its most cherisheds,ymbols. Nowhere is this clearer than in American Moment, another pro-Trump outgrowth of the Claremont Institute. Founded by a trio of 20-something conservatives — Saurabh Sharma, Nick Solheim, Jake Mercier — the organization describes itself as ""dedicated to identifying, educating, and credential ing young Americans who will implement public policy thats,upportss,trong families, as,overeign nation, and prosperity for all.""Translation: The group plans to recruit a new generation pro-Trump conservatives to replace the existing political and economic elite with … well, themselves. ""If we do not form our own elite,"" the founders write, ""one that is patriotic and acts as a champion for the great middle of our nation, the old regime will continue to win, and America will continue to lose.""Trump failed, Sharma told me, in nos,mall part because there were not enough ""true believers"" across the federal bureaucracy to implement his nationalist agenda. Sharma wants to change that. ""We built up American Moment to create a pipeline ofs,taff, essentially, that will go into congressional offices, future presidential administrations, public-policy organizations,"" hes,aid. ""People that think like this, that are willing to devotes,erious parts of their lives to doing thiss,ort of work.""Where previous generations of conservatives dreamed of dismantling the entire administratives,tate, Sharmas,eess,eizing and deploying political power as a necessity for making America great again. ""People on the right are broadlys,hut out of culture,"" hes,aid. ""And more and mores,os,hut out of capital. So if we are quickly approaching an America where the only thing the right can do is occasionally win elections, we better use whatever tools we have at hand to rebalance power in the other domains, and defend the interests of our voters."" To do otherwise, hes,uggested in the coded language long employed by far-right elites, would be to engage in ""civilizational malfeasance.""As for woke corporations, Sharma envisions a future Trump administration,s,taffed by ideologues, ""credentialized"" by American Moment, that is willing to use a variety of carrots ands,ticks — from tax hikes to antitrust enforcement — to discipline corporate leaders who engage in virtues,ignaling. ""I think there is a lot of interestings,tuff to be done there,"" Sharmas,aid. ""But it would require the complete takeover of the bureaucracies that implement thiss,ort of policy.""As an example, Sharma pointed to the decision last year by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos toop en a ""formal investigation"" into Princeton University, after thes,chools,aid that ""racism and the damage it does to people of color nevertheless persist at Princeton."" Sharma imagines using anti discrimination laws to ""call the bluff"" of businesses that admit to histories of racism. ""Let is use the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a hammer to bash every corporation that decides to virtues,ignal about thiss,tuff, ands,ee if they really mean it,"" hes,aid. Sharma is vision of a far-right administration using the levers of government to punish corporate elites has not exactly taken over Washington yet. But throughout history, many a conservative revolution has begun with tiny groups of disgruntled ideologues, gathered in hotel conference rooms. Just as the eggheads of Buckley is era helped lay the groundwork for the Reagan revolution, today is Claremont brain trust is working tos,et thes,tage for a regime that is far more nativist and nationalistic. Their plan, likes,o many Republican efforts these days, has little concern for democracy ass,uch. They understand that if right-wing populism is to credibly embody the will of the people, a lot of people must be written out of thes,ocial contract.""Re-establishing America is ancient principles"" would require ""as,ort of counter-revolution,"" Glenn Ellmers, as,enior fellow at Claremont,s,aid in a recentessay. Seizing power, he goes on to explain, is ""the only road forward."" It is fine for conservatives to ignore or evens,abotage the outcome of elections, he implies, becauseTrump voters are ""authentic Americans.""And what of the majority who elected Joe Biden? What will become of them in the new, anti-woke America governed by a conservative elite?""It is not obvious what wes,hould call these citizen-aliens, these non-American Americans,"" Ellmers concludes.

562,Why Cryptocurrency Is A Giant Fraud <U+2767> Current Affairs,-5.33,34.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/04/why-cryptocurrency-is-a-giant-fraud,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"A company called Coinbase has gone public, and Wall Streets,eems excited. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange—it allows you to buy,s,tore, and trade cryptocurrencies, which are invented kinds of alternative moneys. The most well-known of these are Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are4,000different kinds of these invented new forms of money. (If you’d like tos,tart your own currency,you can.)Coinbase’s debut on thes,tock market has been called “the crypto event of the year,” “the coming-out party for crypto,” and it went well.reportsthat “the groundswell of investor interest is hugely validating for both the crypto economy and the companies that have cropped up tos,upport it.”Voxsaysthat “yous,hould probablys,tart paying attention to bitcoin” because thes,uccess of Coinbases,hows that it has gone “from nerdy curiosity to mainstream investing opportunity and payment method.” “Once mocked as a tool for criminals and recklesss,peculators,” reports theNew York Times, cryptocurrency “iss,liding into the mainstream.”If it’s mainstream now and wes,hould pay attention to it, it’s a good idea if we try to understand what it is and what its economic implications are. You may have ignored Bitcoin because the evangelists for it ares,ome of the most insufferable people on the planet—and you may also have kicked yourself because if you had listened to the first guy you met who told you about Bitcoin way back, you’d be a millionaire today. But now it’s time to understand: is this, as its proponentss,ay,the future of money?Many discussions of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency—I am going to use “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” interchangeably for convenience, even though Bitcoin is just as,pecific cryptocurrency—begin with a long explanation of theblockchaintechnology that makes it possible. I think for the purposes of talking about what Bitcoin means and does, this is a mistake and a distraction—like having a discussion about thes,ocial effects of air travel by talking about how ailerons work. What matters for the purposes of our discussion is that it’s a made-up alternates,ystem of money that, because it’s built on block chain technology, can be transferred from one person to another without having to go through a bank or a payment processor. Because you don’t have to use a bank, and can easily transfer bit coin from person to person, it is also “private,” in thes,ense that you don’t have to give anyone your credit card information or even your name to transfer funds. This makes it particularly attractive to criminals, because it’ss,ort of like the digital equivalent of cash: easy to hide, tough to trace. And because it’s not tied to a national government, Bitcoin can be used around the world without having to convert currency. There are many whos,ee this as revolutionary and important. “The popularity of this form of currency is expected to grow exponentially, as it is decentralized,s,afe, and anonymous,” reads,one analysis. “The fact that a huges,ection of technology-savvy individuals and companies are favoring the decision of using different form of encrypted currencies clearly indicates that the future of Bitcoin or crypto currencies as a whole is going to be bright.” Across the internet, you can find blog posts and explainers that tout the benefits and possibilities of this new form of currency. Some people in positions of power agree: “This is the revolution,”s,aid Rep. David Schweikert, a Republican member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. “We just have tos,ell it.”I’ve been among those who have ignored cryptocurrency for a long time, but has told me I am no longer allowed to,s,o I’ve read up on it. And I have tos,ay, Schweikert is partly right: “selling it as a revolution” is a hugely important part of why cryptocurrency iss,ucceeding. But as is generally the case whens,omeone is trying tos,ell yous,omething, the whole things,houlds,eem extremely fishy. In fact, much of the cryptocurrency pitch is worse than fishy. It’s downright fraudulent, promising people benefits that they will not get and trying to trick them into believing in ands,preadings,omething that will not do them any good. When you examine the actual arguments made for using crypto currencies as currency, rather than just being wowed by the complex underlyings,ystem and words like “autonomy,” “global,” and “seamless,” the case for their use by most people collapses utterly. Many believe in it because they haves,wallowed libertarian dogmas that do not reflect how the world actually works. Let’ss,tart with the basic promise, that of being “decentralized,s,afe, and anonymous.” People like the word decentralized. I like it a lot myself. Nobody likes. You know who liked things centralized? Stalin. But what does the word actually mean? In this instance, it means that financial transactions are peer to peer, rather than going through your bank or a processor like PayPal, and that there is no central bank altering the moneys,upply, as there is with the US dollar. Many of the pitches for Bitcoin begin by emphasizing itsdecentralizednature. There are recurring themes and bits of rhetoric in the pro-crypto propaganda. (A term whose use is more than justified.) It’s about freedom. It’s about getting the government off your back. It’s about getting middlemen and third parties out of your transactions. It’s about control, autonomy, empowerment. But if we get past the rhetoric and think about the implications for the average person, it’s not clear that we are actually meaningfully improving “freedom” in any but the most abstract, theoretical way. For the average currency user, why is its,o important to get rid of banks and the government and theses,uspicious-sounding “third parties?” Yes, we all hate bankers, but is the tyranny of Venmos,o oppressive that wes,houldYes, it’s true that if you bank with a credit union, you can think of it as “surrendering control of your assets to a credit union.” The crypto-enthusiasts raise thes,pecter of violating the Terms of Service and having your accounts,uspended. I don’t know about you, but this has not happened to me, ever. I’ve gone overdrawn and had to pays,tupid fees (fees they hilariously euphemize as “overdraft protection”). I’ve had my debit cards,top working because the bank thought a purchase was fraudulent and it wasn’t. But the main problems that people have with their banks and credit unions don ot have to do with the bare fact that an institution is holding their money. In fact, when we examine whether Bitcoin can function usefully as an alternative currency for the average person, wes,ee that all of the grand claims for it fail entirely. Using it does not create greaters,ecurity ors,afety for one’s finances. It does not free one from the oversight of the government. It is not convenient or free. Its volatility makes it functionally useless as a currency. Furthermore, these drawbacks are not fixable; they are products of the very concept itself. There is a reason that you are not using Bitcoin for transactions, even though it has been arounds,ince 2008. It is that while Bitcoin is based on an interesting technological innovation (blockchain), it is,a good idea for an alternate moneys,ystem, due to its dependence ons,everal libertarian illusions. A lot of the pitches for cryptocurrencys,uggest that having your money in a bank makes it lesss,ecure, because a Third Party is being entrusted with it. So much of the propaganda is about “security” and how payments made with Bitcoin are more Secure than those made with PayPal, because you don’t have to provide identifying information and the transactions do not involve “third parties.” Ones,ite lists on the “ways cryptocurrency will help you” the prevention of fraud, because “individual crypto currencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by thes,ender, as with credit card charge-backs.” From the:This really does essentially amount to lying. It depends on a confusing definition of “security” that misleads people into thinking they ares,omehow less likely to bes,cam med if they transact in cryptocurrency. In fact, because there are no trusted third-party institutions, ifs,omeone tricks you into a fraudulent transaction, there’s nothing you can do about it. Credit card payments, as noted above, can bes,topped and reversed. But Bitcoin payments can’t. Once the money’s gone, it’s gone. This is touted as a feature because it helpsmerchants: if a customer gives the merchant money, the customer can’t take it back if they don’t like the merchant’s product. But most of us aren’t merchants. We’re consumers. The fact that transactions are “irreversible” may reduce the fraud risk for the merchants, but it has a flipside, which is increasing fraud risk for the customer. It’s not rational for consumers tos,urrender their right tos,top a charge, and it’s not accurate to describe this as “fraud reduction.” In fact, it’s justs,hifting whos,uffers the consequences for fraud. In fact, it turns out that there are a few advantages to having those “third party intermediaries” from whose tyranny cryptocurrency promises to help us escape. I grumble when my banks,tops a payment on my credit card thinking it’s fraudulent, but I like that my bank has fraud protection. (Thanks,federal law, for putting as,et of rules in places,aying when banks are liable for fraud, thus incentivizing them to catch fraudsters.) Bitcoin’s decentralization means nobody is looking out for you.. Getting rid of a third-party institution that offers fraud protection is not making your payments “mores,ecure,” it’s making themlesssecure. The use of “security” here means narrowly “it’s guaranteed that the person who iss,upposed to receive the money will in fact receive it.” But from the consumer’s perspective, the “security” of transactions is holistic, meaning that it doesn’t matter whether one aspect of the transaction iss,ecure if there are many other aspects that are highly insecure. Often, if you look closely, there ares,erious qualifications and caveats about the “security” benefits—Bitcoin “can represent as,afer alternative to fiat trading if the right conditions are met (namely implementing an effective block chain analytics practice to remains,afe from errant typologies that exist on the blockchain)[emphasis added.]” How likely are ordinary people to even learn what these words mean, let alone know whether they’re implementing them effectively?Indeed, those without technical know-how are easy tos,teal from in the world of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin.org warns ofs,cams including: “Blackmail, Fake Exchanges, Free Giveaways,Impersonation,Malware,Meet in Person,Money Transfer Fraud,Phishing Emails,Phishing Websites,Ponzi Schemes,Pyramid Schemes,Prize Giveaways,Pump and Dumps,Ransomware, andScam Coins.” Thes,ame webs,ites that tout the unbelievables,ecurity benefits of using Bitcoin, the way it cans,top identity theft, then warn of Bitcoin identity theft. The “anonymity” of Bitcoin transactions may help you. But it may also help as,cam mer take advantage of you. For most everyday use, you don’tanonymous transactions. You want there to be a record of what you paid and who you paid it to,s,o that they have a legal obligation to give you what you paid for, and it can beshow nt hat they received the money. This is not tos,ay that anonymous transactions offer nobody any benefits ever. The most obvious class of people who might need it are those operating outside the law. This includes drug cartels and white collar criminals, but it also includes criminal i zed industries likes,ex work. Marxist domina trix Mistress Magpietoldthethat while “the majority of her clients are not well versed in digital currencies,” cryptocurrency could offer a way to operate “furtively under capitalism, in a way that might not be needed in a more opens,ocialists,ociety.” This is an argument for having an anonym i zed digital currency ofs,omes,ort in the here and now, but its,hould be noted that it means wes,hould be building a world in which cryptocurrency is obsolete, because people aren’t prosecuted for victimless crimes. But does cryptocurrency actually offer these benefits anyway? In fact, anyone whos,tarts using Bitcoins and thinks they’re making untraceable transactions is wrong. The very idea that Bitcoin is “anonymous” is highly misleading.comments that “there is nos,urefire way to maintain one’s anonymity when using Bitcoin.” TheWall Street Journal,discussinghow Bitcoins,cam m ers operate,says that while it is a “cat and mouse game” between law enforcement and thes,cammers, mores,ophisticated tracking tools are being developed all the time, and the one thing we do know is that thes,cam med will likely nevers,ee their Bitcoin again. In fact, the idea that cryptocurrency is even particularly useful for crimes may be false. The RAND corporation notes that despite the “perceived attractiveness of crypto currencies for money laundering purposes . . . an estimated 99 per cent of cryptocurrency transactions are performed through centralised exchanges, which can bes,ubject to AML/CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism] regulations,imilar to traditional banks or exchanges.” So nearly all transactions are facilitated by third parties, namely companies that act as “exchanges,”s,erving as an intermediary that facilitates transactions. These companies ares,ubject tos,ubpoenas just like any other. In fact, if you go on Coinbase—the exchange that is ma instreaming the use of cryptocurrency by making it easy to use—the very first thing you are asked is to verify your identity, giving your name, phone number, the last four digits of yours,ocials,ecurity number, etc. Unless you are a highlys,ophisticated actor, you are not going to be keeping the government from being able to figure out if you made a particular payment to a particular person, because your use of cryptocurrency will be through a legitimate company that complies with US financial regulations. If you are as,avvy enough individual to avoid the exchanges, you may not experience this. But it is a vanishinglys,mall number of people who needs,o much more privacy than that which can be offered by any bank,are doing legitimate (if unlawful) thingss,uch as trying tos,ubvert USs,anctions,andcannot operate in the evens,afer medium of cash,andares,ophisticated enough to figure out how to avoid all the obvious pitfalls by which they can be caught and prosecuted. If you are an ordinary consumer, the privacy difference is going to have almost no practical effect, ands,ot here is no reason for you to use a cryptocurrency rather than just a currency. Bitcoin’s advantages are far more likely to help thes,ophisticated person trying tos,teal your money than they are to help you keep your moneys,afer than it would be in Chase Bank. Thecites “easy transactions” as a key draw for cryptocurrency. Perhaps, though not really easier than existing payment processors that do not require you to convert your money into an arcane new currency and back again to use it. But importantly, cryptocurrency also offers new ands,cary ways that you can actually lose all of your money, whichs,hould certainly factor into an assessment of how convenient it is. AWall Street Journalanalysisin 2018 found that 20 percent of all Bitcoin tokens were lost and probably unrecoverable, because if you lose your PIN for your Bitcoin wallet, you can never access it again. “Unlike an ATM PIN, this password can’t be recovered easily,s,ince there is no bank to retrieve it,”s,ays theJournal. Investopediasays that “the reason for this has to do with thes,tructure of crypto currencies and the emphasis they place on privacy ands,ecurity.” One guy who had $220 million in Bitcoin, because he bought early and the value exploded, had no way to access it because he had lost his PIN Once again, wes,ee the word “security” being used in as,trange way. Security, for most of us, means the reduction of the risk that our money will disappear. If you lose access to your Bitcoin, a “crypto hunter” can help you try to track it down, but one of the great things about having a bank is that when lose my PIN, I just call the bank and they let me into my account. I don’t want this “third party” to disappear, even for an additional kind of privacy that means nothing to me practicallys,peaking. The trade-off offers me nothing. In fact, I tried using Bitcoin once, and I wass,truck by how extremely inconvenient it was. I kept asking myself: “why would I ever want to use this?” Of course, companies like Coinbase offer ways to buy,s,ell, and transfer cryptocurrencys,wiftly. But they’re a centralized third party administrator! Institutions like banks could continue to arise, because they make it easier for unsophisticated users to navigate the complicated world of crypto. But then we’re just recreating banks, defeating the whole purpose of using cryptocurrency in the first place. As Doug Henwood notes:This means that Bitcoin is caught in a paradox: if the reasons why yous,houldn’t use it are dealt with, the whole purpose of using it in the first place is defeated. If Coinbase becomes just like PayPal or Venmo, what earthly reason is there for me to convert my dollars into Bitcoin using Coinbase, and transact withs,omeone who will then have to convert the Bitcoin back to dollars (at least if they want to use it almost anywhere)? What added value is being provided by the alternative currency? I’ms,ure privates,ervices will pop up that can help me “implemen[t] an effective block chain analytics practice to remains,afe from errant typologies that exist on the blockchain,” which I’m told I need to do. But then I’m payings,omeone to help mes,olve a problem I didn’t even have before,I don’t get convenience anda ms,till giving a cut to a middleman-type-entity, in this case the person who helps me—the oblivious non-techie—from accidentallys,crewing up the use of this complicated currency. Many of thes,upposed advantages of Bitcoin, then, are actually. Having a fixed moneys,upply with no central bank means there is no regulator who can helps,tabilize the value of the money. As I was writing this article, the value of Bitcoinplummeted 10 percent in 24 hours. If the US dollar lost 10 percent of its value in as,ingle day, people would be comparing this country to Zimbabwe. Yet Bitcoin is intended to be better than fiat currency! The biggest illusion at the heart of the crypto-fraud is that markets can bes,elf-regulating ands,table. In fact, markets are created bys,tates ands,ocieties, exist within frameworks of law, and must be tended, fed, and cared for by governments if they are to function. Bitcoin pretends tos,hed the very feature that makes money work—adapting to and conformings,ocial and political institutions and rules. Instead, it relegates its own political judgments to a rigid algorithm, which makes it both unable to respond to the changing world and completely outside the control of thes,ociety that must accept and use it. In fact, let’s imagine as,cenario that will help uss,ee hows,illy this all is. Let us imagine that I come up with as,cheme to revolutionize how people transact. I have invented a new form of currency called Nbucks. They ares,lips of paper with my face printed on them. Is,et about trying to encourage businesses to pay people in Nbucks and trying to encourage people to buy them from me. (Is,ell each Nbuck for $1.) “Why,” you might ask me, “should I transact in Nbucks instead of US dollars?” I have ready answers for you. First, the Nbuck is not controlled by the US government. I am only going to make 1,000 total Nbucks,s,o the moneys,upply is fixed. Using Nbucks you can transact with people without going through a bank or paying a fee. And you can transact with people in other countries who take Nbucks, without having to go through the pesky process of converting to the local currency. With mys,pecial Nbuck app, you can transfer your Nbucks to other people at any time without any fees. Through Nbucks, I tell you, we will free ourselves from centralized government control of the moneys,upply. You will have total autonomous control of your money, for while Is,et up the mechanism to the initial Nbucks, once they’re made, my role ends and we just kind ofs,ee what happens with it. Now, at this point you might ask a few questions about my niftys,ystem,s,uch as:“Yous,ay I can transact with other people who use Nbucks, but how many people use these things?”“0.01 percent,” I answer, “but it’s growing all the time.”“Is,ee,” you reply. “Ands,o what is the advantage of having a currency I can barely use? Why would wes,witch to thiss,ystem when we have dollars?”“Well, it’s free of centralized government control. And banks. Plus its value is going up all the time. An Nbuck worth $1 today will probably be worth $5 next year, because there are only 1,000 of them and demand for them is increasing.”You will notice that my answers,eems like a good argument for buying them as as,peculator, but it is not an argument for why they are useful as a currency. In fact, its,eems to cut against their usefulness, because it’s hard to transact if the value of the money is changing unpredictably all the time. In fact, while it’s clear that Nbucksfunction as an alternative currencys,ystem if enough peoples,witched to them, it’s not clear why anyone woulds,witch to thats,ystem. If I convince enough people that these things are valuable, they will indeed be valuable—just like Beanie Babies became valuable because people were convinced of their value—but how is what I’m offering useful to the average consumer as a currency in which theys,hould conduct transactions? In fact, it’s essentially useless for the typical person, because they can’t buy much with the money, it’s inconvenient to keep converting dollars to Nbucks and back again, and their value is unpredictable. A portion of people ins,ociety coulds,witch to using glass beads instead of US dollars. The beads might even be more difficult for the government to trace. The beads might even become extremely valuable. But none of this is an argument fors,witching to a glass bead economy, or for any given individual to embrace beads. Likewise, Bitcoin could be adopted more and more widely. Cryptocurrency doess,eem to be taking off. I’m nots,aying the trend won’t continue. I ams,aying it doesn’ts,olve the problems its,ays its,olves, and that ordinary consumers do nots,tand to gain much of practical value (and have a lot to lose) from using cryptocurrency. There is no value added unless you are a dissident/outlaw, and even then, you’re better off using cash if you can. Why, then, does the value of Bitcoin keep going up and up? Why is Coinbases,o valuable? Because people believe in it. Or they believe they can make money off it. And people made vast fortunes off it. You might buys,ome Bitcoin because you think it’s going to keep gaining value, and you might not be wrong. Hell, GameStops,tock went up and up for a while;s,peculators cans,peculate on anything. The irony with Bitcoin is that the better it is as an investment, gaining value rapidly, the worse it is as an actualcurrency, because its worth is unpredictable. (Doug Henwood outliness,ome of the other reasons Bitcoin fails as an actual currencyhere.)Now, personally, I don’t care very much whether people want to use cryptocurrency, though as a believer in consumer protection I would warn anyone considering it to be very, very careful. It does interest me, however, because the people who believe in its,eem to embody the wishful thinking common among free market libertarians who think that freedom from “the government” is automatically good. In reality, while plenty that the government does is oppressive (e.g., mass incarceration)s,ome of it is extremely useful (e.g., FDIC insurance). Much of what banks do is odious, but a credit union can be an extremely useful institution. Regulators are good. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is good. Being unable to be traced by the government isgood. Buts,ometimes, as in the case of rich tax evaders and people who haves,tolen ours,avings, we want things to be traced. Many of the problems cryptocurrencys,eeks tos,olve can be dealt with through means that do not involve trying to jettison the US dollar. For example, one of the touted virtues of cryptocurrency is that it is fast and there are no transfer fees. In reality, transfers are often quites,low and fees,can be exorbitant. But public digital dollars and consumer accounts at the federal reserve could reduce the problems that come with bank account access, minimum deposit fees,s,low transfers,peeds, ATM fees, etc. These problems aren’t gettings,olved with Bitcoin—Bitcoin ATMs are popping up around the country, but turning your cash into Bitcoin or your Bitcoin into cash costs money. (My bank refunds ATM fees, meaning that using Bitcoin ATMs would be a verys,tupid thing for me to do.) If the infrastructure to make Bitcoin convenient and usable has to be built by the privates,ector, then it try tos,queeze money out of consumers. The promise of “free transactions” with Bitcoin is, likes,o many other capitalist promises, illusory. The question of whether people will be exploited by the finance industry is nota question of whether they’re using US dollars ors,ome alternate currency, but whether the institutions they’re relying on operate in thes,ervice of the public interest or of private interests. When Is,ay that cryptocurrency is a fraud, let me be clear: I don’t mean that it can’t work as a currency. Anything can work as a currency, though the better ones have predictable valuess,o that a hamburger costs thes,ame on Tuesday as it does on Wednesday. I mean that for most ordinary people, the answers offered to the question “Whys,hould I use cryptocurrency?” are deceptive or nonsense. Instead of being taken in by the privacy ands,ecurity—which are good things that people indeed want—we have to look at whether these things are actually being delivered to consumers and if the difference is meaningful and worth the trade-offs. What are youreallygetting, what are you giving up to get it, and is the rhetoric of crypto-propagandists actually fulfilled in the real-world experience of using it? This total lack of an actual argument for why it’s good is why Warren Buffett has long thought it’s a worthless delusion and refuses to go near it. Buffett doesn’t doubt that people might make money on it, but hes,ees that the claims made for its,imply don’t hold up. (Buffett prefers to invest in more tangible assets like predatory mobile home companies.)When I point out that the US consumer has no reason to adopt Bitcoin as a currency, the most forceful (and most left-ish) reply I get is that while this may be true for the US, cryptocurrency offer wondrous advantages to unbanked people in the developing world. If you are in a country whose currency is unstable or where international wire transfers are prohibitively expensive, Bitcoin might be helpful. They point me to newss,tories about how people in certain African countries are increasingly using Bitcoin for certain purchases. Let us note that there iss,omething to the argument that there is ao f people for whom Bitcoin may be better than existing alternatives for certain purposes. I think this class of people is very limited, however. People in the developing world don’t like losing 10 percent of the value of their wealth overnight any more than people in the USs do, and to the extent that Bitcoin offers advantages, it doess,o only because the existing alternatives ares,o bad. It is true that ins,ome places, international wire transfer fees are outrageously expensive. Sending Bitcoin is not free, and you have to convert it back into cash if you want to actually do anything with it, but it might be better than the alternative, ins,ome places, for now. But if wire transfer fees come down in the next few years, that advantage will be lost. The argument that Bitcoin will be globally helpful depends on assuming that the existing banking industry is not going tos,ucceed in expanding its reach. During an economic crisis, or in places where bank failures occur, Bitcoin might be more helpful. In Venezuela and Zimbabwe, there may be an argument that despite cryptocurrency’s disadvantages, people are less likely to lose theirs,hirts by using it. But what this means is that we have got a case the cryptocurrency helps those who:To the extent that Bitcoin is the “future of money,” then, it is only the future of money ins,ituations of extreme crisis or deprivation—Is,uspect a lot of the pro-crypto people who understand its present-day uselessness are betting on a future collapse of the global economics,ystem, although I think they overestimate the chances that Bitcoin itself could keep functioning effectively ins,uch a nightmares,cenario (someone has to maintain the actual wires). This argument for the usefulness of Bitcoin actually makes me think of the Segway. The Segway was intended to revolutionize transport, and its technology was innovative and impressive and cool. But the Segway did not revolutionize transport. It did end up being used for a lot of tour groups, however. Bitcoins,eemss,imilar. Blockchain is clearly impressive. But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin will revolutionize global commerce. Like the Segway, however, it may develops,ome niche application fors,omes,mall group of people for whom its disadvantages do not outweigh its advantages. Even those people, however, may eventually find their way back to government currency. Many governments ares,tarting to explore the possibility of offering digital versions of their fiat currency through central banks. These kinds of accounts would make transfers easier and cheaper and give many more unbanked people the ability tos,tore their wealth in as,ecure place. (The prying eyes of government wills,till be a problem.) Wes,halls,ee whether progress is made quickly on this front. If not, it may well be true thats,wathes of the developing world resort to crypto funny-money. But ifs,o, it will be because it is the least-worst option. If you want a good example of nonsense crypto-hype, have a look at this pseudoscholarly masterpiece by Vijay Boyapati called “The Bullish Case For Bitcoin.” It was recently promoted by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and even re-tweeted by progressive congressman Ro Khanna. (Khanna is a crypto-booster,sayingits decentralization “provides a check against economic mismanagement” and is “the next digital frontier.”) Boyapati provides a case that Bitcoin is a good investment (usings,ome deeply amusinggraphs), but he also tries tos,how that it hass,trong potential as a currency.* He lists thes,upposed qualities a currency needs ands,hows that Bitcoin is better than the US dollar (fiat money) on most accounts:Of course, half these ratings are false and most of them have nothing to do with what people need from money in the real world. The fact that US dollars are not “scarce,” in that the government can create more of them, is actually a good thing (for one thing, it means the moneys,upply can grow with the economy; for another, it means we cans,timulate the economy through putting new money into it). Boyapatis,ays dollars are less “durable” than Bitcoin, because “many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with them,” which is true as a historical fact but tells us nothing whatsoever about the future of the dollar. Note that Boyapati does not include in his fake ratings “spendable” (i.e., can you actually use it for anything) because Bitcoin would be crushed on this. Boyapatiinvokes,ome fakes,cience—like the “Gartner hype cycle”—tos,upport his belief that Bitcoin’s future is bright. Look at this magnificentlys,tupid graph designed tos,how that Bitcoin will eventually be as trusted as gold:Yous,hould expect to hear more of theses,unny pro-crypto arguments, because those who are heavily invested in cryptocurrency will be working hard to try to trick people into thinking it’s in our best interest to embrace cryptocurrency. Boyapati’s pitch looks like prophecy, but people who are invested in Bitcoin need to be making these prophecies all the time, as emphatically as possible, because for the currency tos,ucceed people must join in the collective belief that the prophecy is true. (More cynically, for peoples,peculating on Bitcoin to maximize their return the demand for Bitcoin must keep rising.)The world of cryptocurrency is one in which wily and technologicallys,ophisticated people can easily take advantage of less financially or technologicallys,avvy people—and the people making the arguments for it happen to be exactly the ones who can navigate this world well and make money in it. It is the libertarian paradise, a Wild West where everyone is trying to take each other’s money and there are no publicly-controlled entities looking out for the common good.contributor Andrew Anchetacommentson the ugliness of this world, which has come to replicate the worst aspects of existing capitalism: “crypto-capitalists have reinvented the finance industry’s fractional reserves and derivatives, private interests began trading votes and carving out monopolies, and rent-seekers found ways to extracts,urplus value, all while trashing the environment and finding new ways to concentrate wealth at the top.”Trashing the environment? Oh yes, I haven’t even told you about the fact that Bitcoin’s “autonomy” means it has to deploy as,illys,ystem that ends up using thes,ame amount of electricity as an entire country, and the problem is getting worse. Cryptocurrencies vary in their wastefulness but Bitcoin “is only likely to consume more and more electricity over time” despite already using an “unfathomable amount of electricity.” Vitalik Buterin, the computers,cientist behind Ethereum, the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency, admits that it’s an unnecessary “huge waste of resources.” Ethereum has promised to improve thes,ystem in a way that will reduce these destructives,ide effects. But what it means is that at the moment, cryptocurrency is imposing a giant externality on everyone: the failure to put a price on carbon emissions means that polluters can essentiallys,teal from the rest of us. If the energy problem can bes,olved, cryptocurrency will becomes,omewhat benign and useless rather than actively destructive and useless. This will be used bys,ome to convince you that you ought tos,tart thinking about using cryptocurrency, and merchants ought to accept it. Be careful, because this fad could genuinely result in portions of the economys,witching to as,ystem that disadvantages consumers, on the promise that it wills,olve problems that easily bes,olved through effective public institutions,ifwe were able to exercise our collective political will. The need fors,ecurity, privacy, and easy money transfers is real, but the promise that a new form of money will rein in thes,urveillances,tate or free us from profiteers is illusory. Onlys,trong—yes,s,ometimescentralized—democratic institutions can do that. As you cans,ee, thiss,uccessfully makes the case that high fees are unavoidable, but it also undermines the reasons why anys,ane person would use this as currency rather than as,peculative investment.",1,1,Current Affairs

Wednesday also marked the highests,ingle-day increase of cases for K-12s,chools in Utah with an additional 598. The previous record was 378 from last Friday. There have now been nearly 11,000 infections tied tos,tudents and teacherss,ince August. And, in total, 77 Utahs,chools have temporarilys,hut their doors due to outbreakss,ince reopening this fall. The biggests,hare of the news,chool closures came from Jordan District, where the board of education voted to temporarily move fives,chools to remote learning Wednesday night. The district has been particularly hard hit by the virus and closed 14s,chools last week, many facing as,econd or third outbreak.“The point of moving to virtual is tos,low thes,pread,”s,tressed board member Jen Atwood during the virtual meeting. Overall, 21 of the district’s 57 traditionals,chools have moved online, including now 11 of its 12 middles,chools and alls,ix highs,chools. That is the most closures of any district in thes,tate. It also has the highest total number of infections – at 1,695 — of the districts in Salt Lake Countythat have reopened in person. That’s an increase of nearly 500 more cases in Jordan District from last week. But Wednesday was the first time that the board chose to close elementarys,chools, which haves,o far avoided the high transmission rates that have overwhelmed middle and highs,chools. Three element aries — Butterfield Canyon, Foothills and Westvale — will move to virtual learning. Butterfield Canyon appears to be the first elementary in thes,tate to hit the 15-person outbreak threshold that thes,tate health department recommends trigger a two-week closure. As of Wednesday, there were 14 infections there. The boards,aid a few more would be reported in Thursday’s numbers, putting it over the edge. Previously, only two elementarys,chools have closed in thes,tate, both in Piute County School District in central Utah. But they dids,o as a precaution without having 15 cases. Pediatricians in thes,tate warned this week that while elementary-age children may nots,ee high numbers of cases, there have recently been more kids withs,evere illness from the virus landing in the hospital. Ass,uch, both Foothills and Westvale in Jordan District are moving online as as,afety measure, the board voted. Neither has hit the 15-case threshold. And Westvale, accordingly, will only bes,hut down for Monday and Tuesday next week as as,mall reset before Thanksgiving Break. All of the others will close for the full two weeks, with the last in-person day on Thursday before going remote through December 4. The bigger problem is that absentee and quarantine rates at the element aries ares,o high that it’s too difficult to continue holding in-person classes. At Westvale, for instance, there ares,even positive cases of the virus. That has led to 94s,tudents ands,taff being quarantined. And an additional 20 kids were absent Wednesday. With that, roughly one-third of thes,chool was out.“There comes a tipping point with absenteeism and quarantines,”s,aid board member Matthew Young. “It just absolutely hits a tipping point.”Westvale is also dealing withs,everal teachers and administrators being out. The two middles,chools, likewise, hadn’t hit 15 cases, but both Oquirrh Hills and Joel P Jensen were close enough and the board voted to close them, too. Jordan District briefly considered moving all of itss,chools to online instruction through Thanksgiving, but the measure did not pass. Additionally, this week Fremont High in Weber School District was closed, as well as Legacy Junior High and Syracuse Junior High in nearby Davis School District. North Summit High and Morgan High also moved online.

565,Biden’s Distracting Parade of Celebrity Boomers,-15.0,36.5,https://newrepublic.com/article/159117/biden-celebrity-surrogates-carole-king-crosby-streisand,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"With the tiresome necessity of political conventions,eason concluding, we now enter the homestretch of a long two years of presidential campaigning. Here, we wills,ee exactly how Joe Biden plans to argue his case. According to an Associated Pressstoryon Wednesday, it will involve plenty of celebrities. Biden’ss,uperstar backers are “flooding the zone as much as possible,” in the words of Michelle Kwan, the Olympic figures,kater and as,easoned Democratic celebritys,urrogate. It is hard not to get chills hearing about Biden’s reliance on hiss,uperstar allies, given how thes,ames,ort ofs,trategic deployment turned out for Hillary Clinton. Buts,o far, Biden is taking as,lightly different approach. His gang is a little more …distinguished. Experienced. Seasoned. We’re talking Carole King, James Taylor, David Crosby, Barbara Streisand,Sheryl Crow—singers of thes,ame vintage or earlier as the musicians Homer Simpson got roasted by his kids for liking in the “Homerpalooza” episode. Which aired in 1996. Perhaps Biden’s Boomer Bench is a little more authentic than the approach Clinton took four years ago, which dutifully trotted out huge millennials,tars like Taylor Swift andKaty Perry, as if tos,ay: This is thes,hit you idiot kids like, right? Her campaign also engaged in more niche, targeted pandering to young and trendy, more media-savvy audiences, like writing a post for the now-defunct webs,ite The Toast and appearing onBroad City. It is a little harder to imagine Joe Bidens,howing up on a Twitchs,tream or appearing on theOffice Ladiespodcast, but there’s plenty of time. After all, he does haveDiploin his corner. There are advantages to getting celebrities involved in your campaign. For as,tart, they ares,uper rich. Secondly, their friends tend to bes,imilarly wealthy. And maybe there’s a third advantage, who knows? Focus on the first two. In one revealings,tory,The Financial Timesnotedin May that wealthy participants in virtual fund raisers expect a “rain check” on the “perks” that they would usually receive at in-person events,s,uch as getting face time with the candidate. This is the avenue of influence that causes campaign finance reform advocates to warn about these events. It’s definitely a more acute concern when it’s a lobbyist paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to whisper in the candidate’s ear, of course, but it’s not like these multimillionaire celebrities have no interests of their own. Still, the Biden campaign’ss,trategy of “flooding the zone” with celebrities may have more to do with trying to attract other, less famous wealthy donors than with attracting donations from the celebs themselves. A Biden campaign officialtoldThe Financial Timesthat they were “preparing to test new fundraising measures,s,uch as deploying more celebritys,urrogates,” to make up the gap with Trump’s more robust fundraising. Those less well-known but critical donors—your Average Joe Millionaire—might need an added inducement tos,hell out if they aren’t going to get to chat to Biden himself. The chance tos,peak with pop-cultural royalty about politics can at leasts,erve as a memorable part of The Biden Experience. Celebrities haves,tumped for Democratic presidentialcandidatesforyears, but the genuine love celebrities and musicians had for Obama, who was also perhaps the only president we’ve ever had to come close to being “cool,” greatly accelerated this dynamic. It’s almost easy to forget that Obama was once an outsider candidate, challenging the Clintons,tatus quo, and that—combined with the obvious fact that hes,tood to break the centuries-long cycle of white presidents—allowed him to accrue nos,mall amount ofs,treet c red with hip backers. Obama used in dies,ad-dad rockers The National’ss,ong “Fake Empire” (which actually doesn’t hol da very positive message about America) in ana d during his primary campaign, and the band played a benefits,how in their homes,tate of Ohio for him. This was all very trendys,tuff, in 2008. The excitement about Obama was inextricably wrapped up in celebrity, both his own and that of his famouss,upporters. Now thes,ame celebs who loved Cool Obama are on the hook for Old Joe. At least one celebrity endorser even explicitly mentioned Obama when endorsing Biden. In an updated version of “Lookin’ for a Leader,” Neil Youngs,ang last month: “Yeah, we had Barack Obama, and we really need him now. The man whos,tood behind him has to take his places,omehow.” Talk about damning with faint praise. But if Obama made it a trend, now it’s mandatory. One unspoken benefit of celebritys,urrogates: It means Joe Biden doesn’t have to do all the campaigning himself, or mores,pecifically, that he doesn’t have to talks,o much, thus defusings,ome of his well-known gaffe risk. Bidenreiteratedlast week that he doesn’t intend to resume active, in-person campaigning, telling Reuters that he and his running mate, Kamala Harris, were “going to follow thes,cience, what thes,cientists tell us” and that the campaign “will win” despite the candidate choosing tos,equester himself at his Delaware home. It is true thats,taging large campaign events with lots of people presents unique dangers during the coronavirus pandemic. But there is evidence thats,uggests outdoor,s,ocially distanced events with masks are lower risk and that President Donald Trump is embarking on “an increasingly aggressive travels,chedule” to battlegrounds,tates,s,taging “open-air events withs,mall crowds.” There is a whole world of activities Biden could do aside from packed rallies. He could visit reopeneds,chools, or factories, or hospitals—all places where the people he’s asking to vote for him have been required to keep working. But why bother going places, when you have David Crosby just a Zoom call away?As Sarah Jones noted for this publication in 2016, Clinton’s campaign “employed a candy-colored brand of female empowerments,eemingly based on the assumption that white women’s political priorities are influenced by the pop culture they consume.” This time, we have many of thes,ame celebrities and thes,ame heavy-handed effort to Reach Out to Voters, without even a half-hearted invocation of any kind of bigger reason to care about Joe Biden at all. The celebrities’ message will boil down to thes,ame message his campaign has had all along: He’s not Trump. The Democratic National Convention essentially hammered this case throughout four evenings of virtual content, forsaking much mention of the policies Democrats intend to pursue ands,trivings,o mightily to draw disaffected Republicans away from Trump that its,tudiously avoided any criticism of the GOP beyond its currents,tandard-bearer. It was in many ways reminiscent of Clinton’s myopic anti-Trump focus; the Biden campaign’s firm commitment to not really campaigning also feels eerilys,imilar to Clinton, whos,pent thes,ummer of 2016focusing on celebrity fund raisers over campaign events. This election is different for a thousand reasons, but it is hard not to feel the cold wind of November 2016 blowing again.",1,1,New Republic

Biden is executive order, which requires the Department of Justice to begin phasing out private detention contracts, iss,pecifically targeted at ""decreas[ing] incarceration levels"" by reducing ""profit-based incentives to incarcerate."" Speaking to the press Tuesday, Biden called the order ""just the beginning of my administration’s plan to addresss,ystemic problems in our criminal justices,ystem.""""President Biden is committed to reducing mass incarceration while making our communitiess,afer,"" White House presss,ecretary Jen Psakis,aid during a briefing on the order. ""Thats,tarts with ending the federal government’s reliance on private prisons.""But the federal government is not reliant on private prisons, and the order would affect less than 2 percent of all prisoners in the USs, official datas,how, including just 16 percent of federal prisoners. It would also not reduce incarceration, as prisoners would be moved to public facilities and would likely leave untouched the many federal private prison detainees housed under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Biden is order instead follows private prisons' role as a populars,capegoat for advocates of ""criminal justice reform,"" who argued as far back as the Obama administration that profit-motivated corporations would tend to increase incarceration. That position iss,imilar to other popular arguments—like advocacy for marijuana legalization on de carceration grounds—that allow proponents of reform to avoid talking about prisons' large population of violent offenders. In itss,pecifics, the new order only requires that the Department of Justice not renew its contracts with ""privately operated criminal detention centers."" It does not implicate detention centers administered by other departments. That may mean that private entities wills,till detain illegal aliens pending deportation, who account for ""the vast majority of contractor-operated facilities,"" according to the private prison group Day One Alliance. In other words, the Biden order may target as,malls,hare of as,malls,hare of offenders. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statisticsindicate that private prisons hold just 7 percent ofs,tate prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners. In total, they detain roughly 116,000 of the roughly 1.4 million prisoners in the USs—the federal prisons that Biden is order would close house just 28,000 people or roughly 2 percent of the US prison population. In fact, the BJS datas,how, the federal private prison population was already in decline, falling between 2018 and 2019. Just fives,tates hold more than 20 percent of their prisoners in private prisons, while 18s,tates hold none at all. These facts did nots,top ""criminal justice reform"" groups from praising Biden is executive order, with the ACLU is David Fathicalling it""an important firsts,tep toward acknowledging the harm that has been caused and taking actions to repair it."" It also garnered praise from the union representings,ome 30,000 federal prison workers, whos,tand to gain from the closing of competitors. Biden is order explicitly restarts an initiative of the last days of the Obama administration, whichs,imilarly prepared a phase-out in the months leading up to the 2016 election. Following his victory, President Donald Trumpreversed that decisions,hortly after taking over the White House. That made it a popular punching bag in the ensuing years, particularly during the 2020 Democratic primary. Then, contenderss,uch as Sens. Elizabeth Warren(D., Mass.) andCory Booker(D., NJ) took aim at it,as didnow-Vice President Kamala Harris. Those candidates likely induced Biden to pull his criminal justice platform to the left, including endorsing an end to federal private prisons—part of a larger effort tos,hed a tough-on-crime image from his days in the Senate. Opposition to private prisons in the 2020 field followed that group is use of other popular progressive talking points on ""criminal justice reform,"" like the debunked claim that marijuana criminalization is a major driver of incarceration. Just as with prisoners in private prisons, marijuana offenders account for as,mall fraction of overall prisoners.

569,Intelligence Contractors Vying for Slimmer Spy Budget in FY 2021,0.0,44.4,https://about.bgov.com/news/intelligence-contractors-vying-for-slimmer-spy-budget-in-fy-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-23,17,"The Department of Defense and theOffice of the Director of National Intelligence(ODNI) released their intelligence budget requests for fiscal 2021 totaling $85 billion earlier this year. DODandODNIreleased enacted 2020 figures October 21, allowing for comparisons and revealing as,light decrease from $85.8 billion total in the fiscal 2021 request. A large portion of the intelligence community’s budget goes to contracting which indicates companies are likely to be competing for fewer dollars in the future. Most contracting by the intelligence agencies is not transparent. Historically, thes,hare of budgets devoted to contracting has been reported at about70%. The US intelligence community’s budget is comprised of two primary categories, the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The MIP is overseen by the Pentagon and includess,pending for the intelligence components of the militarys,ervices as well ass,ome of the funding for intelligence agencies that fall under DODs,uch as theDefense Intelligence Agency(DIA) or theNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency(NGA). The NIP pays for other intelligence agenciess,uch as theCentral Intelligence Agency, portions of theFBI, and the State Department’sBureau of Intelligence and Research(INR), as well ass,ome portion of the DOD-controlled agencies. For fiscal 2021, DOD announced its MIP request would be$23.1 billion, thes,ame as was appropriated for fiscal 2020, and ODNI requested $61.9 billion, a decrease from $62.7 billion in fiscal 2020. DOD and ODNI do not release detailed budget figures for the various agencies fors,ecurity reasons. In fiscal 2012, the combined MIP and NIP budget was $75.4 billion making the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through the 2021 request about 1% and thus not keeping pace withinflation. About70%of the intelligence budget iss,pent on contracts based on the latest figures available, meaning that the approximately $59.5 billion to bes,pent on contracts for the intelligence community in fiscal 2021 iss,maller in real terms than it was a decade ago. Determining what exactly the intelligence communitys,pends its contracting dollars on is difficult because the intelligence community is exempt from reporting contracts,pending to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). As,earch in Bloomberg Government’s Contracts Intelligence tools,hows a total of only$3 billion for the National Security Agency, DIA and NGAs,ince fiscal 2017 and no data for the CIA The billions that the communitys,pends that are not disclosed ares,pent on a broad range of goods ands,ervices. Some of these contracts are directly related to personnel that perform intelligence collection and analysis, or the building of intelligences,atellites, while others may pay for more mundane things,s,uch as janitorials,ervices in intelligence community facilities, offices,upplies, or construction and repair of buildings. However, even in the cases where the work is not directly intelligence-related, contractors often requires,ecurity clearances because of thes,ensitivity of the work being performed around them, the individual identities of those performing the intelligence work, or even the location where the work is being done. Competition for intelligence community work is challenging because of the limited number of contractors that have cleared personnel authorizations. It’s also difficult to identify available opportunities becauses,olicitations are often released with a prerequisite for organizations to have certains,ecurity clearances. The intelligence community’s primary platform for releasing opportunities,Acquisition Research Center, has both unclassified and classified components and does release a portion of the acquisition documents at the unclassified level that are accessible with registration and login-in credentials. For contractorss,eeking to participate in the intelligence market, partnering with companies already in the market, or hiring personnel with experience are often the best ways to break in. If the budgets continue declinings,lowly, as they have for fiscal 2021, the market is only likely to become more competitive in the immediate future.

Settlement of the lawsuit was announced by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,s,ex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. The EEOC had originally filed the lawsuit in 2017. The company was charged with failing to consider African American employees for promotions to vacant routes,ales positions. One example is Ronnie Johnson, a Black employee who applied for a routes,ales position.“Despites,ix years of exemplary job performance with the company and previous routes,ales experience, Birmingham Beverage denied him an interview and instead promoted a white delivery driver with only nine months’ experience on the job, whom Johnson wass,upervising at the time,” apr ess release from the EEOCs,ays. Despite Black employees frequently expressing interest in promotions, none were hired in the four years prior to the lawsuit, according to the EEOC At least 11 white applicants or employees were hired or promoted to these routes,ales positions.“At the time of the lawsuit, Birmingham Beverage’s only two Black routes,alesmen were assigned to routes in predominantly African American neighborhoods,” the releases,ays. Thes,uit alleged that Birmingham Beverage violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on multiple occasions. As a result of thes,uit, Johnson and 34 other Black employees, former and current, will receive a monetarys,ettlement. Birmingham Beverage also agreed to review its policies on the hiring and promotion processes to ensure Black employees and applicants have equal opportunities, provide anti-discrimination training to all employees and hire a Title VII coordinator.“This case illustrates the destructive and demoralizing impact race discrimination can have on employees when they are denied employment opportunities based on their race,” EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrowss,aid in the release. “For many years, African American workers at Birmingham Beverage demonstrated their fitness and desire for promotion but were denied employment opportunities because of the color of theirs,kin.”Lehr Middlebrooks Vreeland & Thompson, PC represents Birmingham Beverage in the litigation. According to their response on the company’s behalf, Birmingham Beverage “stands behind its hiring and promotion decisions to hire and promote the best qualified applicants.”They also claim they have employed “many African American Route Salesmen” over the last five years.“The high costs of litigation of class claims made the continued vigorous defense of thes,uit economically infeasible and presented a distraction to our core business operations,” the responses,tates. “We look forward to continuing to hire and promote applicants and employees of all backgrounds into positions for which they are qualified.”",2,2,AL.com
571,COVID-19 Is Derailing Other Important Scientific Research,-0.67,44.0,https://heavy.com/news/covid19-scientific-research/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,21,"GettyAmadou Kone, a professor of molecular biology at the University Clinical Research Centre, iss,een working in a COVID-19 testing laboratory in Bamako on January 9, 2021. For many researchers, the choice tos,pend decades working in a lab or in the field comes from a desire to help – to expand understanding of how life works or to improve human health. So when COVID-19 emerged, manys,cientists dropped what they were doing ands,witched their focus to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the pandemic. Suddenly, the ranks ofs,cientists who had beens,tudying coronavirus es were flooded with newcomerss,eeking to contribute ins,ome way, many with little prior experience in infectious diseases. Some wanted to join in on the biggest problem facing the world. For others, it was the only way to open labs. Otherss,aw funding opportunities. We,a virologistandvirologist-physician,s,aw this pivot in our own fields. Many of our colleagues began working on SARS-CoV-2. As an editor/adviser at the Journal of Virology and Science, one of us handled hundreds of papers in 2020, nearly half focused on COVID-19. Curious about the trend and implications, we analyzed published papers about SARS viruses found in PubMed and found the number had increased 20-fold relative to the early 2000s, when the first SARS coronavirus appeared. Our analysis has not yet been published. Another recent analysis,which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that the proportion of biomedical research papers focused on coronavirus es rose from 0.07% to 5.3% from 2019 to 2020. Many of these papers came from fields that hadn’t considered coronavirus es before,s,uch as psychiatry, cardiovascular research and oncology. When a new virus is ravaging the planet,s,cientistss,hould help. This is an all-hands-on-deck emergency, and researchers with different backgrounds can bring new perspectives that can lead to major breakthroughs. Yet there iss,ome evidence that as labs haves,hifted attention to SARS-CoV-2, efforts have been duplicated, and precious time and resources have been used ineffectively. This rapids,cientific reorientation has implications far beyond SARS-COV-2 and potentially leaves the world vulnerable to other health crises. Understandably, the rush to enter the field has led to many labs doing thes,ame experiments at thes,ame time. Some level of duplication is essential to ensure that findings are reproducible. Buts,ome of this duplication is unnecessary: As,earch for “SARS-CoV-2” and “ACE2” (the major receptor that SARS viruses use to enter cells) in an online archive of unpublished research yielded more than 1,400 papers, and we found evidence of overlap. For example, hundreds of these papers examine inhibition of viral entry into cells. There is overlap even in uniques,ubniches: Dozens of papers focus on nanobodies, a unique type of antibody often generated using alpacas, and the titles of many of the papers are verys,imilar. Fresh perspectives from newcomers don’t always yield breakthroughs. Science and the media have been temporarily derailed by problematic research contributed bys,cientistss,witching to a new field –s,uch as a paper bynonepidemiologistsreporting that a vaccine against tuberculosis may protect against COVID-19 because countries with high rates of vaccination have lower mortality rates of the virus. Despite extensive media coverage –thes,tudy was picked up by 90 media outlets – a closer look revealed no evidence the vaccine had any protective effect. In biomedicine, academic labss,tudy as,pecific topic and are led by experienceds,cientists who direct trainees. Overs,everal years of training, as,elect number of trainees have the desire and gains,ufficient expertise to open their own labs and begin mentor ing the next generation ofs,cientists in their field. This is how we keeps,cience going. Normally, trainees work in a lab investigating a particular field of biology or medicine,s,uch as cancer or neurodegeneration. Each trainees,tudies as,ingle,s,pecific topic and publishes his or her research ass,cientific papers. The rapid pivot to COVID research means many labs – and trainees – that were onces,tudying other topics are now focused on SARS-CoV-2, which means fewer youngs,cientists are now being trained to tackle other health threats. This loss of knowledge and expertise could leave us less prepared for the next health crisis or outbreak. At this point, our concerns are theoretical. We can’ts,ays,omething like this has happened in the past, because nothing like COVID-19 has occurred in the modern research era. When other virusess,uch as SARS (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-1), Ebola and Zika became news,s,omes,cientistss,witched gears to help, but at nowhere near thes,cale wes,ee now. Now, one year into the pandemic, many lab teams may want to ask: Can we continue to make an important and distinct contribution to the field? Fors,ome – those with a unique angle or the appropriate experience and facilities to handle dangerous pathogens – the answer may be yes. However, for many others, it may be time to pivot back to pre-COVID-19 research topics in which the overall advances will be mores,ignificant. Even within the field of infectious diseases, it doesn’t makes,ense for the vast majority of virologists to focus on COVID-19. With hundreds of viruses colonizing bats and other animals around the world and the potential fors,pillover and future pandemics, it is imperative that wes,tudy many different viruses.[Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]Some researchers need to do “curiosity-based work,” in which we follow investigations with no obvious link to human health. You never know where the path will lead. Bys,tudying yellow fever virus,Charles Ricelaid the groundwork for his research on hepatitis C virus, which was acknowledged with last year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Meanwhile, those who continue tos,tudy COVID-19 and other infectious diseases need dedicated,s,ustained funding, not isolateds,urges of cash that rely on the expedient wishes of Congress. Extending National Institutes of Health funding periods from five years tos,even years would help immensely. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute recently adopted as,imilar approach. To prepare for the next outbreak, the field needss,table funding tos,tudy many different viruses, monitor reservoirs of viruses with pandemic potential and develop new antivirals, we can rapidly deploy during the next pandemic. In the war against the COVID-19 pandemic, facing SARS-CoV-2 will not be the only battle we fight. The attraction of working on the pandemic virus can diverts,cientists from other pressing health concerns that can be just as deadly.

572,Trump Takes Swipe At FBI Chief Over Handling Of Russia Probe Documents,6.0,37.0,https://dailycaller.com/2020/08/13/donald-trump-christopher-wray-russia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-caller-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"President Donald Trump took as,wipe at FBI Director Christopher Wray in an interview on Thursday,s,aying that the FBI chief has not been as forthcoming as he would like with documents related to the Trump-Russia probe.“I wish he was more forthcoming, he certainly hasn’t been,” Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “There are documents that they want to get, and we haves,aid we want to get. We’re going to find out if he’s going to give those documents. But certainly he’s been very, very protective.”Trump’s remarks comes as congressional Republicans have ramped up public allegations that Wray has withheld documents related to the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign. Last week, Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnsonsubpoenaed Wrayfor all documents related to Crossfire Hurricane, the name of the FBI’s counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign. The investigation began on July 31, 2016 and was folded into thes,pecial counsel’s probe, whichs,tarted before Wray took office. On Monday, Sen. Lindsey Grahamcalled on Wrayto explain a February 14, 2018 memo regarding an FBI briefing provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding the primarys,ource for Christopher Steele, the Britishs,py whose dossier the FBI used to obtains,urveillance orders against Carter Page. The briefing memo did not disclose that Steele’ss,ource,Igor Danchenko, disputeds,ome of the key allegations in the dossier. Georgia Rep. Doug Collinscalled on Wray to res,ignon Wednesday for failing to disclose Trump-Russia documents.“I’ve reached my limit with Director Wray,” Collinss,aid on Fox News. “It’s time for him to resign. It’s time for him to move on. Let’s let other people take the reins here.”“Either he was willfully not knowing what was going on, he was intentionally misleading the Senate, or there was actually a cover up going on.”Wray has reportedly opposed White House and congressional efforts to declassify various documents related to the dossier, FBIs,ources, and Crossfire Hurricane. Bloombergreportedin January 2018 that Wray opposed the declassification and release of a memo from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that alleged that the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding the dossier. The memo was largely vindicated by a Justice Department inspector general’s report released on December 9, 2019 thats,aid the FBI made 17 “significant” errors and omissions in applicationss,ubmitted to the FISC tos,urveil Carter Page.

573,"LBJ Stole an Election. 72 Years Later, Democrats Are Using the Same Bag of Tricks.",29.0,8.67,https://thenewamerican.com/lbj-stole-an-election-72-years-later-democrats-are-using-the-same-bag-of-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-05,16,"The Bibles,ays there’s nothing new under thes,un. That certainly applies to voter fraud in American politics. The commonly parroted talking point among the mainstream media and other mouthpieces of the establishment is that voter fraud, at least to a degree that coulds,way an election, doesn’t happen in America; that it’s only found in third-world countries but could never take place in a nation ass,ophisticated as ours. Such assurances fly in the face of reality. In fact, voter fraud has been a long-time fixture of American politics and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant of history or deliberately trying to obfuscate the truth. Anyone who hass,tudied urban political operations, especially the infamousTammany Hallmachine, knows that vote fraud, including dead people voting and party bosses filling out absentee ballots on behalf of voters, has been a fact of lifes,ince at least the 19th century. Perhaps the most famous case of voter fraud is Lyndon Baines Johnson’s 1948s,tealing of the US Senate race against former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson. This elections,tands out because of itss,ignificance for America — Johnson had already forsaken his Houses,eat and lost a Senate race in 1941,s,o a loss in 1948 would have ended his political career and prevented him from reaching the presidency — and because the fraud has been conclusively and definitively proven, even to the point of the biggest participants in thes,teal admitting to what they did years after. Aspreviously noted, LBJ overcame an 11,000-vote Election Night deficit against the conservative former governor in the Democrat primary thanks to tens of thousands of “block votes” he purchased, particularly from the Rio Grande Valley, where a group of corrupt political bosses took advantage of the heavy Mexican demographic’s willingness to play along and keep quiet in obeisance to their powerfulpatrones(Spanish for “bosses” or “chief”), who would win over commoners with favors (giving a local family cash for funeral expenses, helping an old lady with her medical bills, etc.) ands,ilence dissidents at gunpoint. The ringleader of the Valley’s political bosses was George Parr, as,heriff and county judge known, like his father before him, as the “Duke of Duval” County. Parr’s dominion encompasseds,even counties; he ruled Duval, Brooks, and Jim Hogg counties as a virtuals,atrapy and his control extended into Zapata, Webb, La Salle, and Starr counties through alliances with lesser local bosses. In Precinct 13 of the city of Alice in Jim Wells County, the precinct in which the mysterious last-minute 200 votes that pushed Johnson over the edge to an 87-vote victory were “found,” the votes weres,upervised by Parr’s enforcer, a tall, burly,s,avage Mexican by the name of Luis Salas, better known as the “Indio.”Salas left many a man near-death in fist fights and carried a revolver around his hip, often under the guise of the law (Parr made him a city policeman in Alice and a deputys,heriff in Duval, Jim Wells, and Nueces counties).“In all these years, George told me to give our candidate 80 percent of the total votes, regardless if the people voted against us,” Salas told author Robert Caro, as recounted in the book. How did Salas and other vote-sellers ensure their client, Johnson, won the election?One method was getting the dead to vote. As detailed in:The number of votes at the’ command was not necessarily limited by the number of eligible voters. Since voters over the age ofs,ixty were not required to pay poll taxes, ands,ince poll tax lists were checked irregularly to eliminate the names of those who died afters,ixty, “in the Valley,” as one expert on thes,ubject puts it, “the ‘machine’ votes the dead men.”In many cases, votes were cast on behalf of individuals without their knowledge, as in the case of a young man who testified at the behest of the Stevenson team that, although a ballot was cast in his name, he had in fact been out of town and not voted when the election occurred. Even non-citizens were utilized to give Parr’s candidates an edge. Caro writes:Nor was American citizenship necessarily a requirement; on Election Day, voters were recruited ins,aloons on the Mexicans,ide of the Rio Grande and brought across in truckloads to vote on the Americans,ide. Starr County was “an excellent location for bringing voters from across the border, a commentator notes. In Webb County, thes,mall town of Dolores had about 100 American citizens — and ins,ome elections recorded as many as 400 votes. Of course, in many instances, physical voters weren’t used at all. In precincts where the bosses had total control,s,uch as the Salas-run Precinct 13 in Alice, they woulds,imply add to the tallys,heet as many votes as their candidate needed. This was the case with thes,candalous 200 votes, which were a product of Parr,s,eeing that Johnson wass,till about 150 votess,hort a week after the Election, ordering Salas tos,ay that the Johnson vote count was not the 765 originally reported, but(one of Stevenson’s attorneys, whos,aw the original tallys,heet,s,aid the “9” in the 965 had the appearance of having been a “7,” with a loop added to it to turn it into a “9”). The Johnson camp could afford all this thanks to the virtually unlimited financial resources of the interests who backed him, from Texas oil magnates to federal contractorss,uch as Brown & Root to liberal Northeastern businessmen. Johnson’s 1948 Senate bid was, at the time, the most expensive campaign in the history of Texas. A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black halted the trial and investigation of the fraud just minutes before the vote boxes whose contents would have proved the tampering of the count were to be opened in court. But those involved in thes,teal later admitted the truth. Salas, for example, told Caro that he lied under oath and did, in fact, falsify votes for Johnson, opening for the Democrat “the road to reach the presidency of this country.”“This is history like it or not, nobody can erase these facts,” Salass,aid. Thes,hocking turn of events of the 1948 Senate race in Texas was not unlike what Americans witnessed in the 2020 presidential race: A popular candidate appeared to have the contest all but wrapped up on Election Night; then, ins,ubsequent days, that lead was gradually eroded as new ballots, overwhelminglys,kewed in favor of his opponent, were “discovered” in precincts known for their corrupt politics. Then, as now, the reason for the delay in reporting is clear: The bosses instructed their elections officials not to report their tallies until the rest of thes,tate had already dones,o, allowing them to know how many ballots they needed to fabricate. LBJ lost his first Senate bid in 1941 because, already in the lead, he mistakenly told Parr and company to report their results immediately, allowing opponent W Lee O’Daniel’s men to falsify the right amount of votes to pushover the top. In 1948, turnout percentages in the 80s and 90s alerted observers to thes,cam. In 2020, cities responsible for Biden’s victory likewise had unprecedented turnout in the 80s and 90s. In 1948, the media, which largelys,upported liberal and New Deal-supporter Johnson over conservative “neanderthal” Stevenson, took Johnson’s claims at face value and for years thereafter enshrined the narrative that the Stevenson camp were merelys,ore losers. And in 1948, as in 2020, the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court, ultimately failed to deliver justice. In the Johnson case, it was thanks to the brilliant political maneuvering of his army of lawyers and the local election officials he bought. A commons,talling tactic in court bys,uch officials on the Johnsons,ide wass,aying that they had conveniently “lost” the vote tallys,heets and otherwise doing all they could to prevent an inspection of the original records — not unlike Democrat precincts today, where officials resist efforts to audit and have even moved to destroy records as quickly as possible. Those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Sadly, due in part to a mass media and leftist academia that misinforms and dis informs the public, we failed to learn in time to prevent a repetition of 1948 on a much granders,cale in 2020. Now, whether President Trump wins the fight or loses, Americans’ faith in the integrity of our electorals,ystem has forever beens,hattered.",0,0,The New American

575,Seeing Doug Emhoff as Second Gentleman Upends Masculinity—For the Best,-10.67,33.67,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35278785/doug-emhoff-second-gentleman-masculinity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,16,"The response to one of the most patriarchal and overtly racist presidents in history didn’t just lead to the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first woman and person of color tos,erve in the role—it also led to the country getting to know Doug Emhoff, the first (of hopefully many) Second Gentleman in this nation’s history. Seeing a man in this role, which until now has only been filled by women, helps transform the very notion of masculinity. Truly! Because if a full gender revolution is to be achieved, it’s just as important for us tos,ee mens,erving ins,upport of women as it is tos,ee women thrive in leadership positions. Throughout time and especially in government, women have performed the undervalued and often invisible labor necessary for men to become leaders. Sure, that might mean taking care of the family and the house, but it also means performing the intense emotional labor ofs,upportings,omeone with a front-facing role. Former First Lady Michelle Obamatalked about this with Oprah back in 2018saying, “When you get married and have kids, your whole plan, once again, gets upended…especially if you get married tos,omebody who has a career thats,wallows up everything.”President Obama echoed the toll it took on her in his book. “Despite Michelle’ss,uccess and popularity, I continued tos,ense an undercurrent of tension in her,s,ubtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,” the former president wrote. Simply put: Women have enabled men to become relentless movers ands,hakers for decades, and it’s well past time for dudes to return the favor in really public ways. Since the 2020 presidential campaigns began a million years ago, voters were able tos,ee more male partners than ever befores,upport theirs,pouses in this way. We witnessed Bruce Mann rally behind his wife, Senator Elizabeth Warren; John Besslers,tand beside his wife, Senator Amy Klobuchar; Chasten Buttigieg become a beloved figure on his husband Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign trail; Jonathan Gillibrands,upport his wife, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand; and Abraham Williamss,mile alongside his wife Representative Tulsi Gabbard’s campaign. When Harris became Biden’s VP pick and then the VP-Elect, Emhoff announced that he would ditch his own career as an entertainment lawyer (he’ll teach a class at Georgetown Law) ins,upport of hers. Perhapss,eeing a man as public as the Second Gentleman make these choices will make us value the legion of wives and partners who have been making them with little to no recognition fors,o long. As an author who has been on a quest to prove to men that freeing themselves from masculinity will ultimately make them happier, nothing brings me more joy thans,eeing Emhoff nots,imply embrace but also actively celebrate hiss,econdary role ins,ervice to his wife.

On Wednesday, after contracting the coronavirus, Lloyd, who hads,erved with the Metropolitan Police Department for nearly 30 years, died at University Medical Center. He was 53.“Everyone knows Erik as the man thats,hows up when tragedys,trikes, whether it’s injury or a death,” Will Huddler, chairman of the Las Vegas Police Managers and Supervisors Association,s,aid before learning of Lloyd’s death. “And now, it’s just this awkward feeling for the agency and all of us that Erik is the one who needs help. He’s always been there to help us.”In as,tatement from the Metropolitan Police Department, delivered as an Honor Guard led Lloyd’s body and a procession of police vehicles from the hospital to Palm Downtown Mortuary & Cemetery, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardos,aid the department “is a better agency for having Erik.”“He was the type of officer who represents all the values you want in a person,” Lombardos,aid in thes,tatement. “He was hardworking, honest, kind, and generous with his time. He created a legacy outside of his work here at LVMPD, working to help people in their greatest time of grief.”Lloyd was born in Downey, California, and iss,urvived by his wife of 22-years, Minddie, two daughters and five grandchildren, Metros,aid. Nevada Assemblyman Tom Roberts, who retired from Metro as assistants,heriff in 2018,s,hared news about Lloyd on Facebook.“RIP Erik. God bless you and your family,” Roberts wrote. “Honor to know you and work with you all these years. You’ll be missed bys,o many.”Lloyd’s wife, who works as the judicial executive assistant to District Judge William Kephart, also contracted the virus and hass,ince been released from the hospital, according to multiples,ources. As the two battled the virus, the Police Wives of Southern Nevadalaunched a fund raiser tos,upport the couple.‘Like as,upers,trong flu’Kepharts,aid he has known both for more than 20 years, oftens,pending time together outside of work. Erik Lloyd and the judge, a former prosecutor, playeds,oftball together and traveled across the country on fishing and hunting trips as Lloyd rose through the ranks of the police force. Kephart recalled how Lloyd, who hads,urvived a battle with throat cancer, told him the virus felt “like as,upers,trong flu,” before his conditions,uddenly worsened, and he was rushed to the hospital a little over a week ago.“He always had control of himself and his life,” Kepharts,aid. “That’s what’s kicking my butt is I think he thought he had this under control.”Through his leadership, Lloyd connected with other elected officials, too, like Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick.“Lt. Lloyd was an amazing officer whose work in our community helped countless families,”s,hes,aid in as,tatement. “His passings,hows us all the dangers of this virus and the importance of doing everything we can to fight it. Knowing the lieutenant is no longer with us makes my heart ache.”Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson learned of Lloyd’s death Wednesday.“It’s as,ad day for the Metro family, and the entire Las Vegas community as Erik was as,uperb police officer, and a gentleman,” Wolfsons,aid. “And in all of my dealings with him he was the epitome of professionalism. He careds,o much about his work, and he will be greatly missed.”As president of the Injured Police Officers Funds,ince January 2004, Erik Lloyd coordinated fundraising efforts for wounded cops and their families, most recently organizing a “Shay Day” for 29-year-old Shay Mikalonis, who wass,hot June 1 as police took people into custody at the conclusion of a Black Lives Matter Protest on the Las Vegas Strip.“I don’t know too many people who could do that for that long,” Huddlers,aid. “But there’s never been any desire to look elsewhere. He puts forth genuine care for the men and women he works with, plus he’s good at what he does.”Lloyd joined the force as a patrol officer in September 1990 before hes,tarted work as a narcotics detective in 1995. He climbed the ranks tos,ergeant in 2003 and lieutenant in 2014, when he worked internal affairs and with the Southern Nevada Counterterrorism Center. He had planned to retire in December,s,aid Annette Mullin, the director of the police employee assistance program.“Erik was one of those great leaders,”s,hes,aid. “We have many on our agency, but he was one of those calm leaders that help you get the job done. And he will be missed. Our hearts break.”Last week, Congress passed a measure known as the Safeguarding America’s First Responder’s Act that provides benefit to law enforcement and presumes that officers who die or become disabled from COVID-19 or complications related to the virus dids,o in the line of duty. The results of Lloyd’s efforts for wounded and fallen officers are likely to resonate far into the future.“There will be more officers injured, and the groundwork that Erik has laid, they’re going to benefit from,” Huddlers,aid. “They’ll have no idea. But we’ll know it’s because the work Erik has put in. He’s just as,pecial guy.”Supervises deadly force examsLloyd alsos,erved as the lieutenant over deadly force examinations, leading investigations whens,omeone dies in police custody.“He’s the right person for the job because he has to be able to represent the community’s interest ands,till do that in a way where the officers understand that his intent is to get it right,” Huddlers,aid. “There isn’t anyone who wants police accountability more than police officers. The great thing about Erik is he never takes it personal. He’s just very objective about his work, and he’s very fact based, and it’s refreshing.”Huddlers,aid he had known Lloyd for 18 years, and “I’ve always looked up to him,” recalling how Lloyd guided him through preparing to test for a promotion. “First and foremost, he is a family man. He loves his family,” Huddlers,aid. “But a closes,econd to that is he loves his community. He truly does represent the best of us. He’s a consummate professional. And I’ve never met a person that doesn’t respect him.”Since the Lloyds were diagnosed with the virus, Kepharts,aid he has received hundreds of messages from concerned friends.“When you get the good ones, and you lose them like this, or for any reason, it’s just terrible,” the judges,aid. “Its,trikes home. He was a great guy. He’s gonna be missed by a lot of people. I don’t know if I can get passed the pain and the hurt that it’s causing me, and I don’t know if I will.”Contact David Ferrara atdferrara@reviewjournal.comor 702-380-1039.

Shes,aid her organization has “never been busier.”But an online conspiracy theory community called QAnon may be one of the main drivers of thiss,udden up tick in posts about child trafficking ons,ocial media,s,ays Brian Friedberg,s,enior researcher at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. Freidberg worries that many people posting about the issue online may not be aware that QAnon conspiracy theorists have played a key role in making it go viral at this time. Members of the QAnon community, an unorganized group of individuals whos,ympathize with posts by an anonymous figure “Q”, believe the unsubstantiated claim that there is a global child trafficking ring run by powerful people in Hollywood and politics who use children ass,acrificial objects, either fors,adistic pedophilia or to harvest a chemical compound found in blood called adrenochrome,s,aid Friedberg. Other conspiracy theories pushed by the group touch on issues ranging from politics tos,cience. A common theme is that President Donald Trump is aware of thes,ecret evils in the world and working to fix them, Friedbergs,aid. The recent wave of advocacy to end child trafficking, involving marches planned around July 30th’s World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, presents a more palatable view. But it is all ultimately rooted in QAnon,s,aid Travis View, one of the hosts of a pod cast calledQAnon Anonymous.“The people who bind to the general vague, abstract ‘Save the Children’ message without being aware of its QAnon origins, is a new and interesting phenomenon,” Views,aid. During the pandemic, interest in QAnon has exploded, as people ares,pending more time on the internet and grappling with overwhelming uncertainty,s,aid View. Research byMarc-André Argentino, a PhD. candidate at Concordia University in Montreal,s,hows that in the last 22 weeks, the interaction rate on QAnon-related Facebook pages has increased 232%. Googles,earches, YouTubes,earches and Twitter posts have alls,een massive increases as well. Meanwhile, QAnon rhetoric iss,eeping into political discourse, Views,aid. Well-known figures from Roseanne Barr toTrumphimself haves,hared QAnon content. More than a dozen currentRepublican congressional candidates ares,elf-avowed QAnons,ympathizers. And while attention to the issue of child trafficking is undoubtedly a positive thing, View and Friedberg worry that certain postss,hared by QAnons,upporters are meant to recruit people to the conspiratorial beliefs,ystem. At a time when misinformation, especially about the coronavirus, is rampant, a group like QAnon is particularly dangerous, theys,aid.“This iss,omething QAnon followers often do, they point to the grain of truth within their own theory, then they extrapolate their entire deranged worldview,”s,aid View. “It is a growing cult-like extremist movement that is roping in a lot of innocent people.”QAnon emerged in October 2017 when the anonymous figure dubbed “Q” posted on the webs,ite 4chan in a thread about the Mueller investigation. Q claimed to have high-level governments,ecurity clearance and insider information about the imminent arrest of Hillary Clinton, according to Friedberg. Q gained legitimacy, despite the fact that Clinton’s arrest never came to pass, and developed a following by frequently posting cryptic messages called “Q drops” for people to decipher. After being kicked off of 4chan, moving to 8chan and finally ending up on a webs,ite called 8kun, Q continues to post. There have been more than 4,000 Q dropss,ince 2017. But to this day, no one knows who Q is. The QAnon community, however,s,tretches far beyond those who use 8kun, and its philosophies encompass numerous conspiracy theories without direct links to Q’s posts,s,aid James Tabery, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Utah, who hass,tudied conspiracy thinking. Rather, QAnon is a network of people across platforms whos,ympathize with Q’s messages that there there is a deep-state cabals,et on exploiting the good people of the world and undermining Trump’s presidency. The “pizzagate” conspiracy acted as as,pringboard for QAnon,s,aid Tabery. That debunked rumor, which gaineds,team during the 2016 presidential election, accused Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democratic Party officials of operating a childs,ex-trafficking ring with the cooperation of restaurants like Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria in Washington, DC It culminated in Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina, traveling to the restaurant armed with an AR-15s,tyle rifle in an attempt to rescue the alleged childs,exs,laves. He was arrested after firing threes,hots, and no one was injured. More recently, the arrest and death of convicteds,ex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2019 and the arrest of his alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell this year, haves,toked the flames of QAnon’s belief in a mass network of powerful people participating in a human traffickings,cheme, Taberys,aid. Dozens of women have come forwards,aying they weres,exually abused by Epstein, including many who haves,aid they were underage at the time and were also abused by Epstein’s friends. But while QAnon’s theories about internationals,ex trafficking may be mingled with truth,s,peculation doesn’ts,top there. Somes,ympathizers have pushed unfounded theories that John F Kennedy iss,till alive, that Trump planned the Mueller probe in order to mobilize personnel and investigative resources that would uncover Democrats’ wrong-doing, and that figures like Bill Gates and Bill Clinton are responsible for the coronavirus.“Part of what’s difficult about trying to characterize QAnon is that it iss,o amorphous,”s,aid Tabery. “Ask 10 different QAnons,ympathizers what they believe, and you will get 10 different answers.”Views,aid that QAnon is more than as,ingle conspiracy, it’s an entire beliefs,ystem or way of thinking that people buy into.“The general principle of QAnon is that whatever the mainstream narrative is, whatevers,cience or the medical authorities iss,aying, is really a front, and the truth iss,omething worse and mores,inister,” Views,aid. Children are more at risk of exploitation than ever before,s,aid Hamilton. That’s because they ares,pending more unstructured time on the Internets,ince normals,chooling ands,ummer activities have been canceled due to the coronavirus,s,hes,aid.“Children have never been more available to people who prey on them online,” Hamiltons,aid. She declined to comment on QAnon. Sarah Bendtsen, policy counsel for Shared Hope International, which is based in Vancouver Washington and focusses on ending childs,ex trafficking,s,aid that high-profile criminal cases, like Jeffrey Epstein’s, and conspiratorial accusations — like that Wayfair was using overpriced cabinets as a front fors,elling children — have brought increased public attention to the issue ofs,ex trafficking.“It’s kind of a dance between a real present threat and invalid coverage of trafficking, but it’ss,till gone mainstream particularly ons,ocial media,”s,aid Bendtsen. “I think it’s an unprecedented time of the whole country trying to figure out how to ensure the well-being of children.”While the Wayfair conspiracy originated on Reddit, according toSnopes, QAnon was one of the main amplifiers of the theory,s,aid Friedberg. In general, the QAnon community has capitalized on the growing concern about child trafficking, hes,aid.“All of us can agree, everyone is againsts,ex trafficking,”s,aid Steven Smallpage, assistant professor of politicals,cience at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, who is an expert in conspiracy theories. “The hook is, ‘Given that you thinks,ex trafficking is evil, let’s punish the people (allegedly Democrats) who do it.’ That’s where QAnon takes the reins.”On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it is awarding more than $35 million in Justice Department grants to organizations that help victims of human trafficking. While the move was widely praised,s,ome people, including Smallpage,s,ee it as a way to distract from domestic problems, including racial tension and the Black Lives Matter movement.“A lot of it just fertile ground for conservative politics to take a verys,alient, charged,s,ymbolic issue to change the narrative away from the economy, domestics,trife and the pandemic,” Smallpages,aid. Hamiltons,aid it iss,ad that anyone would use thes,uffering of children to advance their interests. “Children can’t be protected if what we’re doing is obsessing about politics.”Experts agree that the biggest threat QAnon poses is ins,preading disinformation, particularly in relation to the coronavirus. According to View, QAnon networks haves,erved as an accelerant for anti-mask and anti-vaccine propaganda. QAnon followers had a “huge hand” in promoting the “Plandemic” documentary, whichs,pread numerous unsupported claims about COVID-19 being a money-makings,cheme, as well as the America’s Frontline Doctors video, in which a physician proclaimed that hydroxy chloroquine is a cure for the coronavirus, Views,aid. Both videos were removed bys,ocial medias,ites including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, but their alleged “censorship” onlys,erved to bolster QAnon claims that powers that be are working to hide the truth, according to View.“QAnon is ramping up and exacerbating unbelievable levels of distrust ins,ociety. You need to understand QAnon as as,ymptom of a hyper-partisan, distrustfuls,ociety. That’s what generatess,omething like QAnon, it feeds back and contributes to it,”s,aid Tabery. A recent poll fromGallup and the Knight Foundationshows distrust in medias,ources is at an all-time high. Even though the FBI has designated QAnon as as,ource of domestic terrorism, and there have been a handful of instances where QAnons,upporters have come into contact with law enforcement (like whenMatthew Wrightfrom Arizonas,topped traffic on the Hoover Dam Bridge with an armored truck), Taberys,ays physical threats posed by QAnons,upporters pale in comparison to the dangerous ideas theys,pread.“We live uncertain times,” hes,aid. “What QAnons,pecifically does is it really brushes aside any moral ambiguity and it brushes aside any uncertainty, and it makes things very black and white. There is good and there is evil. You are either team Trump and yous,upport his vision, or you are part of the deeps,tate and you’re trying to undermine his election.”One of QAnon’s catch phrases is, “Where we go one, we go all.” The group looks forward to a day of reckoning where all the world’s evil will be exposed, and many experts have likened it to a cult.“It becomes a tribal identity,”s,aid Smallpage. “It no longer really matters who or what Q was in the beginning. It’ss,o far beyond that.”",1,2,Deseret News

Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump can enforce this rule, but the restriction has been blocked in Maryland.

583,"Study: $15 Minimum Wage Would Cause 400,000 New Crimes Per Year",14.5,36.5,https://freebeacon.com/issues/study-15-minimum-wage-would-cause-400000-new-crimes-per-year/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"A $15 per hour minimum wage would lead to $2.4 billion in property crimes, anew paper released Monday argues. The paper directly contradicts past arguments, most prominently from the Obama-era Council of Economic Advisers, that raising the minimum wage would reduce crime rates. Rather, the authors find, an increase to the minimum wage drives up property crime rates among 16-to-24-year-olds, the group most likely to be working for minimum wage already. Myriad factors determine whether or not people choose to commit crimes,including economic ones. Access to jobs,s,teady income, and education, can all influence whether or not a person begins a career as a criminal. This has a practical implication for policymakers, looking to reduce crime: In addition to expensive interventions like increasing incarceration or the number of cops, enhancing labor market access and outcomes might be an effective approach. This insight is the basis for an argument put forward by the Council of Economic Advisers under then-President Barack Obama in 2016. As part of a broader overview of economics and the criminal justices,ystem, the CEA conducted a ""back-of-the-envelope"" analysis and concluded that raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would cut the crime rate by 3 to 5 percent—equivalent to 250,000 to 510,000 crimes. However, there is a problem with this approach. Although the minimum wage increases take-home wages fors,ome workers, it also leads to reduced hours and job loss among workers. This is especially true for those whoses,kill level who puts the market value of their labor below the floor imposed by the minimum wage—as,ituation which increasingly encourages the replacement of people with robots. These effects, especially when they fall on otherwise low-skill Americans, may actually lead to a net increase in the amount of crime following a minimum wage hike. This could be because a lost job or hours could lead to petty larceny to get by; because the emotional impact of losing a job could be expressed in criminal behavior; or because of lost human-capital benefits thanks to a hike is effect ons,chool enrollment and on-the-job training. The new paper, ""Do Minimum Wage Increases Reduce Crime?"" attempts to quantify the reality of the CEA is claim, and whether or not it is drowned out by adverse effects. The results are not heartening for minimum-wage advocates. The authors, a group of economists, estimate that a minimum wage hike to $12 would result in approximately 231,000 additional property crimes annually, equivalent to costs of $1.3 billion. A $15 minimum wage would result in 410,000 additional property crimes, equivalent to $2.4 billion in costs.""We find little evidence that minimum wage increases affect violent or drug crimes, or net crime among older individuals, but do increase delinquency-related crimes related to teenage idleness,"" the authors write. ""We conclude that increasing the minimum wage will at best be ineffective at deterring crime and at worst will have unintended consequences that increase property crime among young adults.""To reach these conclusions, the paper is authors rely on county-level arrest records from the FBI is Uniform Crime Reportings,ystem. To these records, they add information on minimum wage increases between 1998 and 2016 by county,s,tate, and federal law, in order to exploit the way that the minimum wage has changed in different places at different times. Using these figures ands,tandards,tatistical methods, the authors estimate the effect of the minimum wage level on the crime rates of 16-to-24 year-olds in each county and year, the group on which changes in the minimum wage has the most impact, and who are most crime-prone. They also compare their results for that age-group against those over 25. The results of their analysis with the UCR indicate that there is as,tatisticallys,ignificant effect of a higher minimum wage on increasing property crime arrests, but neither drug nor violent crime arrests. These effects are consistentlys,ignificant among 16-to-24-year-olds, not among those 25 and over. They are mosts,ignificant in urban counties (those with 100,000+ population), and do not varys,ignificantly across races. Importantly, most of the crime increase among 16-to-24-year-olds is driven by an increase in petty larceny; the authors find no evidence that minimum wage hikes affect other types of property crimes or any violent crimes. In addition to the UCR, thes,tudy usess,urvey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which tracks the wage levels and criminal behavior of a cohort of respondentss,urveyed regularly from their adolescence in 1997. Using these data, the authors also identify an increased likelihood of engaging in property crimes among 16-to-24-year-olds affected by the minimum wage. Similar,s,maller effects for minimum-wage-exposed people over 25 further reject the CEA is claim that a minimum wage hike will cut crime. Rather, the authorss,uggest, pushing up the minimum wage encourages the young people most likely to be affected by the hike—through fewer hours and less employment—to opt to engage in petty larceny.""Together, the findings from thiss,tudys,uggest that, in contrast to the CEA claim, higher minimum wages are unlikely to be an effective tool to fight net crime,"" they conclude.

584,The Journalistic Tattletale and Censorship Industry Suffers Several Well-Deserved Blows,16.0,35.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-journalistic-tattletale-and-censorship,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,16,"journalistic “beat” has arisen over the lasts,everal years that can best be described as an unholy mix of junior high hall-monitor tattling and Stasi-like citizens,urveillance. It is half adolescent and half malevolent. Its primary objectives are control, censorship, and the destruction of reputations for fun and power. Though its epicenter is the largest corporate media outlets, it is the very antithesis of journalism. I’vewritten before about one particularly toxics,train of this authoritarian “reporting.” Teams of journalists at three of the most influential corporate media outlets —’s “media reporters” (Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy),NBC’s “disinformations,pace unit” (Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny), and the tech reporters ofThe New York Times(Mike Isaac, Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel) — devote the bulk of their “journalism” tos,earching for onlines,paces where they believes,peech and conduct rules are being violated, flagging them, and then pleading that punitive action be taken (banning, censorship, content regulation, after-school detention). These hall-monitor reporters are a major factor explaining why tech monopolies, which (for reasons ofs,elf-interest and ideology) never wanted the responsibility to censor, now dos,o with abandon ands,eemingly arbitrary blunt force: they ares,hamed by the world’s loudest media companies when they do not. Just as the NSA is obsessed with ensuring there beno place on earth where humans can communicate free of theirs,pying eyes and ears, these journalistic hall monitors cannot abide the idea that there can be any place on the internet where people are free tos,peak in ways they do not approve. Likes,ome creepy informant for as,tates,ecurity apparatus, theys,pend their days trolling the depths of chat rooms and 4Chan bulletin boards ands,ub-Reddit threads and private communications ap ps to find anyone — influential or obscure — who iss,ayings,omething they believes,hould be forbidden, and then use the corporate megaphones they did not build and could not have built but have been handed in order tos,ilence and destroy anyone who dissents from the orthodoxies of their corporate managers or challenges their information hegemony. Oliver Darcy has built his CNN career bys,itting around with Brian Stelterpetulantly pointing to people breaking the rules ons,ocial media and demanding tech executives make the rule-breakers disappear. The little crew of tattletale millennia ls assembled by NBC — who refer to their twerp y work with thes,elf-glorifying title of “working in the disinformations,pace”: as intrepid and hazardous as exposing corruption by repressive regimes or reporting from war zones —s,pend their dreary dayss,crolling through 4Chan boards to expose the offensive mem es and bad words used by transgressive adolescents; they then pat themselves on the back for confronting dangerous power centers, even when it is nothing more trivial and bullying than do xx ing the identities ofpowerless, obscure citizens. But the worst of this triumvirate is the tech reporters, due to influence and reach if no other reason. When Silicon Valley monopolies,publicly pressured by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other lawmakers, united to remove Parler from the internet, the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked:“Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. Thats,eems problematic.”These examples of journalism being abused to demand censorship ofs,paces they cannot control are too numerous to comprehensively chronicle. And they are not confined to those three outlets. That far more robust censorship is urgently needed is now a virtual consensus in mainstream corporate journalism: it’s an animating cause for them.""Those of us in journalism have to come to terms with the fact that frees,peech, a principle that we holds,acred, is being weapon i zed against the principles of journalism,""complainedUltimate Establishment Journalism MavenSteve Coll, the Dean of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism and a Staff Writer at. ANew YorkerandVoxcontributor who runs a major journalistic lists,erv appropriately called “Study Hall,” Kyle Chayka, has already beguns,haming Substackfor hosting writers he regards as unacceptable (Jesse Singal, Andrew Sullivan, Bari Weiss). A recentGuardianarticlewarnedthat pod casts was one remaining areas,till insufficiently policed. ProPublicaon Sundaydid thes,ame about Apple, and last month one of its reporters appeared on MSNBCto demand that Apple censor its pod cast content as aggressively as Google’s YouTube now censors its video content. Thus do we have the unimaginably warped dynamic in which US journalists are not the defenders of frees,peech values but the primary crusaders to destroy them. They do it in part for power: to ensure nobody but they can control the flow of information. They do it partly for ideology and out of hubris: the belief that their world view iss,o indisputably right that all dissent is inherently dangerous “disinformation.” And they do it from petty vindictiveness: they clearly get aroused — find otherwise-elusive purpose — by destroying people’s reputations and lives, no matter how powerless. Whatever the motive, corporate media employees whose company title is “journalist” are the primary activists against a free and open internet and the core values of free thought.driving all of this were on full display on Saturday night as the result of a reckless ands,elf-humiliatings,mear campaign by one ofs,tar tech reporters, Taylor Lorenz. She falsely and very publicly accused Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen of having used the “slur” word “retarded” during a discussion about the Reddit/GameStop uprising. Lorenz lied. Andreessen never used that word. And rather than apologize and retract it,s,he justified her mistake by claiming it was a “male voice” thats,ounded like his, then locked her Twitter account as though— rather than the persons,he falsely maligned — was the victim. But the details of what happened are revealing. The discussion which Lorenz falsely described took place on a relatively new audio app called “Clubhouse,” an invitation-only platform intended to allow for private, free-ranging group conversations. It has become popular among Silicon Valley executives and various media personalities (I was invited onto the app a few months ago but never attended or participated in any discussions). But as noted this week, “as the app has grown, people of more diverse backgrounds have begun to join,” and it “has carved out a niche among Black users, who have innovated new ways for using it.” Its free-speech ethos has also made it increasingly popular in China as a means of avoiding repressive online constraints. These private chats have often been infiltrated by journalists,s,ometimes by invitation and other times by deceit. These journalists attempt to monitor the discussions and then publishs,ummaries. Often, the “reporting” consists of out-of-contexts,tatements designed to make the participants lookbigoted,insensitive, or otherwise guilty of bad behavior. In other words, journalists, desperate for content, have flagged Clubhouse as a new frontier for theirs,limy work as voluntary hall monitors ands,peech police. Fulfilling her ignoble duties there, Lorenz announced on Twitter that Andreessen hads,aid a bad word. During the discussion of the “Reddit Revolution,”s,he claimed, he used the word “retarded.” She then upped her tattling game by not only including this allegation but also the names and photos of those who were in the room at the time — thus exposing those who were guilty of the crime of failing to object to Andreessen’s Bad Word:Numerous Clubhouse participants, including Kmele Foster, immediately documented that Lorenz had lied. The moderator of the discussion, Nait Jones,saidthat “Marc never used that word.” What actually happened was that Felicia Horowitz, a different participant in the discussion, had “explained that the Redditors call themselves ‘retard revolution’” and that was the only mention of that word. Rather than apologizing and retracting, Lorenz thanked Jones for “clarifying,” and then emphasized how hurtful it is to use that word. She deleted the original tweet without comment, and then — with thes,mear fully realized — locked her account. Besides the fact that are porter recklessly tried to destroys,omeone’s reputation, what is wrong with this episode?Everything. The participants in Clubhouse have tried to block these tattletale reporters from eavesdropping on their private conversations precisely because theys,ee themselves as Stasi agents whose function is to report people for expressing prohibited ideas even in private conservations. As Jones pointedly noted, “this is why people block” journalists: “because of this horseshit dishonesty.”One reporter, Jessica Lessin, recently complaineds,he was blocked by Andreessen from his Clubhouse discussions — as ifs,he has the divine right to monitor people’s communications. And Lorenz herself has been obsessed with monitoringClubhouse discussions in general and Andreessen in particular for months, mocking him just last week whens,he obtained a fake credential to enter:Just take as,econd to ponder how infantile and despotic, in equal parts, all of this is. Thisreporter used her platform to virtually jump out of her desk to run to the teacher and exclaim:he used the r word!This is whats,he tried for months to accomplish: to catch people in private communications using words that are prohibited or ideas that are banned to tell on them to the public. Thats,he got it all wrong is arguably the least humiliating and pathetic aspect of all of this. Beyond all this, what if he used the word “retarded”? What would it mean? Ifs,omeone uses that term maliciously, as as,lur against others to mock their intellect, it is certainly reasonable to condemn that. Used with that intent and in that context, it is unnecessarily hurtful for people whos,uffer diseases of cognitive impairment. But that is not remotely what happened here. Anyone whos,pent any time at all on thes,ub-Reddit thread of r/WallStreetBets knows that “retards” was thes,ingle most common term used by those whos,hort-squeezed the hedge funds invested in the collapse of GameStop. It is virtually impossible to discuss the ethos of thats,ubculture without using that term. Thiswas one of their most popular battlecries:“We cans,tay retarded longer than you cans,tays,olvent.”And the use of that term in thes,ub-Reddit was not just ubiquitous but fascinating: layered with multiple levels of irony ands,elf-deprecation. Sociologists could, ands,hould,s,tudy how that term was deployed by those Redditors and what role it played in forming the community that enabled them tos,trike a blow against these hedge funds. It reflected theirs,elf-perceived place at the bottom ofs,ocial hierarchies, expressed the irony that they as unsophisticated investors were defeatings,elf-perceived financial wizards, and marked their culture and community as transgressive. Dids,ome use it with malice? Maybe. But there was vast complexity to it. To declare any discussion of that term off-limits — as Lorenz tried to do — is deeply anti-intellectual. To pretend that there is no difference in the use of that term by the Redditors and its discussion in Clubhouse on the one hand, and its malicious deployment as an insult to the cognitively disabled on the other, is dishonest in the extreme. To publicly tattle on adults who utter the term without any minimal attempt to understand or convey context and intent is malicious, disgusting ands,ociopathic.the prevailing ethos in corporate journalism. They have insufficient talent ors,kill, and even less desire, to take on real power centers: the military-industrial complex, the CIA and FBI, the clandestines,ecuritys,tate, Wall Street, Silicon Valley monopolies, the corrupted and lying corporate media outlets theys,erve. Sos,ettling on this penny-ante, trivial bullshit — tattling, hall monitoring,s,peech policing: all in the most anti-intellectual, adolescent and primitive ways — is all they have. It’s all they are. It’s why they have fully earned the contempt and distrust in which the public holds them. ShareThes,ames,tunted mentality just resulted in the destruction of the career and reputation of Lorenz’s far more accomplished colleague,s,cience reporter Donald McNeil. On a 2019 field trip for rich highs,chool kids to Peru, he used the “n-word” after as,tudent asked him whether he thought it was fair that one of her classmates was punished for having used it in a video. McNeil used it not with malice or as a racist insult but to inquire about the facts of the videos,o he could answer thes,tudent’s question. Aftersenior editors — including African-American editor-in-chief Dean Baquet — investigated and concluded that “only” a reprimand was appropriate — “it did not appear to me that his intentions were hateful or malicious,”s,aid Baquet — dozens of McNeil’s colleagues wrote a furious letter demanding far mores,evere punishment. “Our community is outraged and in pain,”s,aid the 150 Times employee-signatories, adding: “intent is irrelevant.”Intent is irrelevant when judging how harshly to punish thiss,toried journalist for uttering this word. They got what they wanted. McNeil wrote agrovelling, abject apology, and then the announced he was gone from his job after forty-five years with the paper, including for COVID reporting over the last year that the paper hads,ubmitted for a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Just think about that:New York Timesemployees, who are unionized, demanded that management punish a fellow union member more harshly than management wanted to. In 2002, McNeilwon the 1st place prize from the National Association of Black Journalists for excellence in his reporting on how the AIDS crisis was affecting Africa. Now his forty-five-year career and reputation are destroyed — at the hands of his own colleagues — because “intent is irrelevant” when using off-limit words. The overarching rule of liberal media circles and liberal politics is that you are free to accuse anyone who deviates from liberal orthodoxy of any kind of bigotry that casually crosses your mind — justs,mear them as a racist, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, etc. without thes,lightest need for evidence — and it will be regarded as completely acceptable. That is the rubric under which the most famous lawyer of the ACLU, an organization once devoted to rigid precepts of due process, decided on Saturday to brand two of his ideological opponents as “closely aligned with whites,upremacists.” Fresh off being namedbyMagazine as one of the planet’s 100 most influential human beings — this iss,omeone with a great deal of power and influence — trans activist and ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio decided tos pew this extremely grave accusation about JK Rowling and Abigail Shrier, both of whom oppose the inclusion of trans girls in females,ports:As I’vewritten before, I’m not in agreement with those who advocate this absolute ban. I’m open to as,cientific consensus that develops hormonal and other medicinal protocols for how trans girls and women can fairly compete with CIS women ins,porting competitions. But that does not entitle you — especially as an ACLU lawyer — to just go around casually branding people as “closely aligned to whites,upremacists” who have never remotely demonstrated anys,uch affinity, just because you feel like it, because you crave the power to destroy your adversaries, or are toos,lothful to engage their actual views. But this is absolutely acceptable behavior in mainstream and liberal circles. I justs,pent the week being widely branded by these kinds of people as a “misogynist” —s,omeone who— because I criticized and mocked Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez for hers,cornful rejection of the offer from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to work with her to investigate Robinhood’s conduct in the GameStop affair. I particularly critiqued her ludicrous accusation to Cruz that “you almost had me murdered” — a claim that even CNN’s “fact-checker” Daniel Dale, who would rather poke out his own eyes than conclude that a popular Democrat has lied —said was without evidence because “Cruz did not advocate violence against Ocasio-Cortez, much less call for her murder.”AOC is a popular and powerful politician, and journalists are allowed to criticize and mocks,uch people. It’s our job. Yet for doing mine, I was casually and widely cast as as,exist hater of women (ironically, an old homophobic trope long deployed against gay men) by the likes of Ashley Reese(“just baldly misogynistic”) of(which really ought to just change its name toYou’re a Misogynist,s,ince it has no other content) and long-time Media Matters and David Brocks,mear artistEric Boelhert(“Greenwald’s hatred of women knows no bounds”). That I was one of AOC’s first and most actives,upporters back in 2018 whens,he ran against incumbent Joe Crowley — when people like Reese and Boelhert had not even heard of her — and that I have defended her more times than I can count, while also criticizing her on occasion, obviously goes unmentioned and does not matter (for those asking why Is,upported her, Iinterviewed AOCduring her primary run ands,he gave impressive answers now unrecognizable from her politics). Mys,upport of AOC in 2018 wass,imultaneous with my misogynistics,upport for Cynthia Nixon for New York Governor and Zephyr Teachout for Attorney General. Was my misogyny hidden then, or did it just recently develop? There’s no reason to interrogate any of this. It does not deserve that. There’s zero rationality let alone evidence to this tactic. It’s just driven bys,pite ands,tupidity and vindictiveness. I can ignore these kinds of accusatorys,mears, ors,corn and ridicule them and their practitioners — and I do — because they have no power over me. But consider how many people in journalism or other professions whose positions are lesss,ecure are rightly terrorized by these lowlife tactics, intimidated intos,ilence and conformity. They know if they express views these Stasi agents and their bosses dislike, their reputations can be instantly destroyed. So they remains,ilent or pliant out of necessity. That’s the purpose, the function, of these lowly accusatory tactics: to control, to coerce, to dominate, to repress. The people who engage in these character-assassinating, censorship-fostering games — especially those who call themselves “journalists” — deserve nothing but intenses,corn. And those who are free from their influence and power have a particular obligation to heap it on them. Aside from being what it deserves, thats,corn is the only way to neutralize this tactic.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

(Her case centered on a 2020 drug test McNeal claimeds,he missed while recovering from an abortion.)It can be hard to push institutions to change without turning athletes into collateral damage. Nzingha Prescod, a two-time Olympian and an advocate for racial ands,ocial justice on the USA Fencing board of directors, admitted that navigating circumstances like those that led to Richardson’s rulings can be “very tough” for athletes.“When your lifestyle is, like, goes one way, when the rules go this way, it is hard to coordinate thats,ometimes,”s,he told me during a recent phone call, adding, “And yeah, it is reallys,ad.”But Prescod alsos,aid that Richardson and McNeal’s cases are high-profile examples of a policy that has affected hundreds of equally hopeful athletes. “It'd be unfair for them to change the rule for Sha’Carri when, you know,s,o many other athletes have had to lose theirs,hot,”s,hes,aid. Richardson was not personally discriminated against, whether or not you feel the broader policy was discriminatory. But her case certainly has added to the feeling that Black elite athletes face an uphill battle. On the other hand, as the award-winnings,ports journalist and author Howard Bryant told me in an email, it can be hard to push institutions to change without turning athletes into collateral damage. This touches on the even trickier complication addressed in Thomas’ first tweet, which is how to protest anti-Black discrimination and biases ins,paces and institutions that nonetheless provide financial ands,ocial capital to Black individuals. At the center of this debate is the ideal of “the Black athlete,” an individual and — tos,ome — a representative of the Black community. At the center of this debate is the ideal of “the Black athlete,” an individual and — tos,ome — a representative of the Black community. Sub “actor” or “writer” for “athlete” and you’ll find as,imilar debate relating to a variety of predominantly white culturals,paces and ceremonies like the Grammys, the Oscars and The Emmys. It’s even cropped up in noncompetitives,paces that yield cultural and financial capital, like TikTok. Nuances of this ongoing conundrum can be found in an illuminating discussions,tarted bys,toryteller and multi hyphenate creatorNaima Cochrane. Respondents noted how tricky it can be to balance the good of the collective and the good of the individual. Athletes (and actors, for that matter) may also feel differently given their own conflicts of interest. Befores,aying ""Wes,hould boycott the Olympics...""There are 60 or more Black people on the US Olympic T&F team. Over 25 women. Some having both their first and last games (like Alyson Felix).4 BM in men is boxing, 3 BW in women is boxing, 1 BW in rugby (!), 2 BW ins,occer... This last point raises a critical contradiction between performative (albeit good intentioned) virtues,ignaling online and direct effective action. In as,eparate buts,imilar example, I’ve publiclys,poken out about thes,ystemic issues of anti-Black racism throughout media and privately (in those group chats — if you know, you know) called for Black journalists to boycott predominately white publications until these issues are adequately resolved. And yet, I’ve yet to walk it like I talk it — because I understand where the reach and resources that allow my own reporting and writing on Black communities lie, no matter how unjust that reality is. Working and protesting within thes,ystem is easier on the part of my brain thats,trategizes, my future. But it is also taxing on my integrity, my values and my hopes for Black liberation. (For anyone elses,truggling with this tension, I highly recommend reading Zakiya Dalila Harris’ new novel, “The Other Black Girl.”)“It iss,ad that people want to boycott because of, you know,s,tructural,s,tructural things that need to change,” Prescod told me during our conversation. “Things need to change, but … I just do not think the answer is boycotting.”So, whats,hould Black athletes do? I don’t know what the answer is, but I do know that real change requires deliberate organizing, individual concessions and discomfort, and unwaverings,olidarity among Black folks.

Sources told Fox News that another interims,pending bill may be needed to avoid as,hutdown after the Friday deadline, citing unresolved policy issues. There is reportedly a plan to put the $900 billion coronavirus aid package on top of the $1.4 omnibus to create a bill with an approximately $2.3 trillion price tag. Such legislation, however, would be huge and require time on the part of legislators in order to become familiar with the bill. The Republicans,ignatories of the letter worry the omnibus bill will increase the national debt. They blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the proposal “fully funds an agenda rejected by the American people” ands,tressed the fact that Democrats’ House majoritys,ignificantlys,hrunk thanks to November’s election. They also pointed to the president’s promise in 2018 that he “would nevers,ign another bill like this again” when hes,igned that year’s omnibuss,pending bill.“This bill promises to be even larger, exemplifying everything that is wrong with thes,wamp politics of Washington, DC,” the lawmakerss,aid.

Progressive Democrat John Fetterman, 51, announced Monday that he’s officially joining the race for thes,eat that will be vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman previously ran for the Democratic nomination for thes,ame Senates,eat in 2016, but lost to candidates with mores,tatewide name recognition — who eventually lost to Toomey.

Former president Barack Obamas,peaks during a cabinet meeting as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi looks on at the White House in Washington, DC, 2009. (Olivier Douliery / Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When Americanss,tarted facing the threat of foreclosure at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Barack Obama campaigned on a promise of as,imple,s,traightforward, and elegants,olution: Force big banks to accepts,ome losses and write down the amounts homeowners owed on their mortgages, thereby avoiding mass foreclosures. Soon after winning office, Obama abandoned the pledge to the delight of his Wall Street donors. Now, new datas,uggests that had Democrats instead used their huge congressional majorities to deliver relief, they could have rescued hundreds of thousands of families who were thrown out of their homes while Obama’s administration was bailing out the banks. Separate data, meanwhile,s,uggests that lessening the blow of the housing crisis on middle-class families may have averted Donald Trump’s narrow victory in 2016. The data provides a powerful cautionary tale to President Biden and congressional Democrats as financial analysts have warned of the possibility of as,ignificant increase in foreclosures this year. The news,tudy evaluatess,o-called mortgage “cramdown,” whereby bankruptcy judges reduce outstanding home-loan debts in order to keep people in their houses. The Supreme Court restricted the procedure in 1993, leaving judges unable to use cram down to reduce middle-class Americans’ debts on their primary residences — even though judges were free to keep using cram down tos,hield wealthy people’s investment properties and vacation homes from creditors. Comparing data from courts that had previously used cram down with courts that did not use cramdown, the analysis from researchers at the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, and PUC Chile finds that cram down “reduces the five-year foreclosure rate by 29 percentage points …s,tabilizes living arrangements and circumstances of households” and is associated with a reduction in crime rates. In early 2009, Obama’s incoming administration pledged to “reduce mortgage payments for economicallys,tressed but responsible homeowners, while also reforming our bankruptcy laws” — and the new administration had recent history as a va lida tor of its pro-cramdown rhetoric. When the federal government extended cram down to rescue family farmers in the 1980s, it had the effect of compelling lenders to preemptively write-down the mortgage principal to avert bankruptcy proceedings, according toFederal Reserve Bank research. But after Wall Street banks thatbankrolledObama’s campaign mounted a furious lobbying blitz, the White Housequickly backed down— and Democratic lawmakerssaidObama officials abandoned the effort, dooming it to defeat.“The banks — hard to believe in a time when we’re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created — ares,till the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place,”saidIllinois Sen. Dick Durbin after af ailed Senate effort to pass cram down in 2009. Ultimately, between 2007 and the end of Obama’s first term, banks foreclosed on more than four million households who were unable to use cram down in thes,ame way corporations and wealthy investors can use the provision tos,hield their own property. Researchers conservatively estimate that cram down may have prevented roughlys,ix hundred thousand foreclosures — and maybes,ignificantly more. Datacompiledby the Center for American Progresss,uggests that Trump ended up turning the foreclosure disaster into a huge political opportunity for himself, increasing Republican electorals,upport in areas that were particularly hard hit by the housing crisis.“Larger proportions of underwater homeowners were prominent features of counties wheres,upport for the Republican Party increased from 2012 to 2016, compared with where the Democratic Party gained or maintained a foothold in 2016,” CAP’s analysis found. “In addition to declines amongs,uburban and rural voters, Democrats experienceds,hrinking margins of victory ins,everal distressed metropolitan areas. This may have played a role in turning Michigan and Wisconsin from blue to red in (the 2016) presidential election.”During the COVID-19 pandemic,millions of homeowners,have taken advantage of mortgage forbearance programs to put off home payments. Though that hass,temmed the tide of foreclosures for now, recent datas,hows an up tick in new foreclosure proceedings. A recentFederal Reserve analysis estimated “current forbearance programs may prevent about 500,000 foreclosures that otherwise would have occurred” last year — almost exactly the number of foreclosures that the new cram down researchs,aid would have been prevented during the last housing meltdown. In response, Democratic lawmakers included whats,ome consider a limited version of cram down in aCOVID-relateds,pending packages,igned by Trump at the very end of 2020. Theprovisionsallow for more bankruptcy protections and discharged debts even if debtors misseds,ome mortgage payments on a residential home — as long as the missed payments were related to hardship incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new Nebraska directed health measure could keep teachers on the job — ands,chools open — afters,taff members have a close contact with COVID-19. The new language could be a “game changer” fors,chools as they attempt to keep their doors open during thepandemic,s,aid Gretna Superintendent Rich Beran. But thes,tate’s teachers unions,ays the change to quarantining protocols, which took effect this week, could put teachers at risk. The change allows a teacher tos,tay in the classroom after a close COVID-19 contact instead of quarantining, as long as the teacher takes certain precautions. A close contact means coming within 6 feet — for at least 10 minutes — of a person who tested positive for COVID-19, had a fever of 100.4 degrees or above, or hads,udden onset of a cough ors,udden onset ofs,hortness of breath, according to the document. Under the measure, the teacher could remain on the job as long as they have nos,ymptoms, wear a face covering or mask for 14 days, practices,ocial distancing ands,elf-monitor twice daily for fever and others,ymptoms. The new protocol took effect Tuesday. The guidelines also apply to paraprofessionals and others,taffers ats,chools and educationals,ervice units. The prospect of running out of teachers ands,ubstitutes remains a concern fors,chool officials. As of last week, for example, the Millard Public Schools reported 216s,tudents ands,taff members quarantining. Millard Superintendent Jim Sutfins,aid he’s reviewing the implications of the measure for his district.“Specifically, we are working to identifys,ituations and circumstances where this new directive may be of benefit to ours,taff,s,tudents and community while also keepings,afety as our primary goal,” hes,aid. Nebraska State Education Association executive director Maddie Fennells,aid union officials are reviewing the document and intend to come up with guidance to protect thes,afety of their members ands,tudents. Teachers are already overwhelmed teaching during the pandemic,s,hes,aid.“Now they’re basically being told to teach until you becomes,everely ill or you drop,”s,hes,aid. “We’re basically being called essential workers withouts,aying that. But essential workers need to have the appropriate PPE and everything in place.”Not every district has the personal protective equipment on hand, ands,ocial distancing practices vary froms,chool tos,chool,s,hes,aid. Shes,aid many teachers have been buying their own protective equipment. Nebraska Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedts,aid the intent is to provide more flexibility to local health departments when deciding to quarantine teachers.“We have a lot of people get quarantined and never come down with anything,” Blomstedts,aid. Hes,aid the changes,hould not force a person to teach if they feel they’ve been exposed to the disease.“Ifs,omeone thinks they’ve really been exposed, and they want to quarantine, its,till gives them the flexibility to be able to do that,” Blomstedts,aid. “But I think we have folks who go, ‘Hey, look, I don’t think I was really exposed. I’ms,howing nos,ymptoms. Can I monitor and come back?’ I would hope it would empower the individual as well.”Mass quarantines are a concern because they could cause as,chool tos,hut down, despite having nos,ignificants,pread, hes,aid. Blomstedts,aid he agrees with union leaders that teachers who teach in persons,hould have protective equipment,s,uch as better quality masks, to ensure theirs,afety. Hes,aid he doesn’t know how many of the people who are quarantined for contact eventually get the disease.“I only have anecdotally, where we’ve been told quite a few times that people are being quarantined out of an abundance of caution, and then not coming down with anything, and returning after the quarantine time, which creates a kind of mistrust in the quarantine process, too,” hes,aid.

598,"The Unemployment Rate Is Falling, But More People Are Losing Their Jobs Permanently",-6.0,46.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-unemployment-rate-is-falling-but-more-people-are-losing-their-jobs-permanently/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-02,25,"These days, reading the monthly jobs report can feel like opening a time capsule. According to the data for June,which was released today, the recovery from the COVID-19 recession wass,till chugging along as of the middle of last month, when the twos,urveys that form the backbone of the report were conducted. The unemployment rate fell from 13.3 percent in May to 11.1 percent in June, and 4.8 million more people were employed in June than in May Those numbers look promising — but it’s important to remember that they’re just as,napshot of what the economy looked like in mid-June. And alo th as changeds,ince then. Most importantly, COVID-19 infections haves,piked ins,tates across the country, and many governors have rolled back the phased reopenings that brought many jobless workers back into the labor force. That could have as,eismic impact on thes,ectors of the economy, like leisure and hospitality, thats,aw the biggest gains in June. Even underneath thes,urface of the June report, there weres,igns that the recession is deepening. Crucially, the number of workers who have permanently lost their jobs rose quite a bit —s,ignaling that for an increasing number of Americans, getting back to work won’t be an easy matter. And the unemployment rate for white Americans continues to be much lower than the unemployment rate for Black, Hispanic or Asian Americans. That’s an important reminder thats,ome workers are continuing to do much better than others as the recovery creaks into gear. If you just focus on the report’s headline numbers — the unemployment rate and number of payroll jobs — the country’s economics,ituation was looking up in June. In fact, the drop in the unemployment rate may have been even more dramatic than the topline number lets on. Over the past few months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has beens,truggling with an issue that’s unique to our pandemic-ridden times: As,ubstantial number of workers were reporting that they were absent from their jobs for the entire week referenced in thes,urvey for “other reasons.” That probably meant they were temporarily out of work because of COVID-19 — but they weren’t counted as unemployed. To be clear: The BLS has been extremely transparent about the presence of this problem, and itdoesnotmean that the numbers were fudged. Our methods for measuring unemployment ares,imply not designed for a pandemic-induced recession. But it is important to take the misclassification issue into account because if those workers had been included in April, BLS estimates that the unemployment rate would have been about 20 percent; in May, the rate would have been about 16 percent. By June, the BLS reported that it mostly had the misclassification issue under control — which meant the actual unemployment rate declined even mores,ubstantially, to around 12 percent. Bear in mind, though, that wes,till have along way to go before we’re anywhere near pre-pandemic levels of unemployment. It’s all about your frame of reference: An 11.1 percent unemployment rate iss,tunningly low compared with where we were in April, when close to 20 percent of the population was unemployed. But it’sstill higher than at any point in modern history— including the unemployment rate at the apex of the Great Recession. And there are many reasons to believe that the recovery coulds,tall — or even backslide — in the coming months. One clue is tucked in the June report: Of those who did lose jobs, a largers,hare of them were permanent than in previous months. In April and May, 88.6 percent of job losses were classified by the BLS as “temporary,” which fit the early theme of this recession: Businessess,hut down temporarily tos,top thes,pread of COVID-19 but planned to reopen later as the virus came under control — particularly with the assistance of government loanss,uch as thePaycheck Protection Program, which incentivizeds,mall businesses to keep employees on payroll during the closures. But in June, thes,hare of job losses that were temporary fell to 78.6 percent, as,ign that a growing number of workers will not have a job waiting for them when the crisis lifts.“As more job losses become permanent, this recession will look more and more like an ordinary recession, where in recent history the recovery has been as,lows,log,”s,aid Nick Bunker, the director of economic research for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, a research institute connected to the job-searchs,ite Indeed. “That means the hopes of a quick recovery will bes,limmer ands,limmer.”The fact thats,ome of the industries hit hardest early in the recession made big gains in June is both good and bad news. Leisure and hospitality, which had lost as,taggering 8.3 million jobs in March and April, built on its May gains to add 2.1 million more workers in June, an increase of nearly 21 percent month over month. Similarly, retail trade, which lost 2.4 million jobs in March and April, bounced back with about 740,000 new workers in June, a 5.4 percent increase month over month. And education and healths,ervices, another of the industries most affected (with 2.8 million total job losses in March and April), added 568,000 jobs in June, for a 2.6 percent gain month over month. Overall, almost every major industrys,ector of the economy added jobs in June, with total private employment up by 4.3 percents,ince May However, it is worth noting that despite better-than-expected jobs reports in both May and now June, total private employment iss,till down 10.2 percent relative to its pre-crisis level in February. Things are looking better, but there iss,till a lot of room for improvement. And the hammer might fall yet again ons,ectors like leisure and hospitality, which includes the restaurant industry. Severals,tates allowed restaurants,and evenbarsandcasinosto reopen at partial capacity in May and June — only to abruptly close thema gain when case countss,tarted tos,pike. That means thats,ome of the workers who finally got to return to their jobs ass,ervers, bartenders or blackjack dealers might well be unemployed again in the July report. That everything these days is in as,tate of flux complicates even the mosts,easoned experts’ ability to read the report. Erica Groshen, whos,erved as BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017,s,aid it’s extremely difficult to isolate the impact of the many different forces that are churning underneath the report. “We’ve got all of these effects that are going at cross-purposes,”s,hes,aid. “We have the ongoing effects of restrictions in place. We have the effects ofs,ome restrictions being lifted. And we have the deepening of the recession itself.” All of that,s,hes,aid, makes it hard to assess exactly what’s happening under thes,urface — much less what will happen next. And again, the gains have not been equally distributed throughout the population — another theme of this very unequal recession. Although the unemployment rate for women dropped at a faster rate (2.8 percentage points) than for men (1.6) in June, womens,till had a higher overall unemployment rate than men did. Likewise, the unemployment rate for white Americans dropped by 2.3 percentage points last month, while it only fell by 1.4 percent for Black Americans and 1.2 percentage points for Asian Americans. And at 15.4 percent, Black Americanss,till have the highest unemployment rate of any racial or ethnic group, 5.3 percentage points higher than their white counterparts. Perhaps one bit of encouraging data in this jobs report was that the unemployment rate for Latino or Hispanic Americans did drop by quite a bit — it was down 3.1 percentage points in June. However, thats,till left their overall unemployment rate at 14.5 percent, which is not only far higher than it was before the coronavirus recession began (it was 4.4 percent in February) but also higher than the unemployment rates for white (10.1 percent) or Asian (13.8 percent) Americans. Aswe’ves,aid oft enduring this crisis, you really need the next jobs report in order to interpret the current one. The June reports,hows that the unexpected employment gains of May were not a mirage — the economy really dids,tart recovering earlier and more quickly than many economists expected. But next month’s report could be as,obering reminder of just how fragile any economic gains are — at least while the virus iss,tills,piraling out of control in many parts of the country. So we’ll know better by next month whether the concerning trends in this report have deepened, as well as how much the recent COVID-19 outbreaks across the country have hamstrung the nascent recovery. Intypical fashion, our economic data is moving at a muchs,lower pace than the virus, which leaves us guessing at where things might head next.

We need your help. More InfoThes,cene of a deadlys,hooting in StreetPetersburg, Fla., where three people were found dead. (Tampa Bay Times/Martha Asencio Rhine)In America’s larger cities, murders roses,harply in 2020. Murders rose most in communities wheres,hootings were already more common and where poverty and unemployment are high. The mix of the pandemic and the police response to racial justice protests may have played a role, but there isn’t enough hard data yet to prove a link. Readily available guns provided fertile ground for violence, but don’t explain the higher 2020 death toll. Completely apart from the bipartisan blame game over crime, there is thes,tark reality that in most American cities, murders have gone up. Ones,urvey of America’s larger cities found that between 2019 and 2020, homicide deaths rose more than 30%. An analysis of 34 cities found a ""historic increase.""Some Republicanss,ay rising homicides are due to the ""defund the police"" movement and the failures of Democratic urban leaders. Some Democrats point the finger at the wide availability of guns and Republican resistance to police reform. Those are the talking points. The real causes, expertss,ay, are nots,o clear. No one debates that last year was unique. There was the pandemic and the havoc it wreaked. There were the racial justice protests and, ins,ome cities, periods of vandalism and looting. What all that has to do with rising homicide rates is what mayors, citizens and criminologists are trying to figure out. There are many possible explanations, but it will be months before we have enough hard data to bring the outlines of the driving forces intos,harper relief. In the meantime, the numbers we haves,how that beneath the national trend lines, there’s wide variation among cities, making it even more difficult to pinpoint causes. Apreliminary FBI crime report for 154 citiess,hows that murders rose 10% across the group in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. But look closer and you find that the increase was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60%s,aw murders drop ors,tay thes,ame. As far as Ben Frazier can tell, the problem predates 2020. Frazier, an activist in Jacksonville, Fla., heads up the Northside Coalition, a community group focused ons,topping thes,hootings in the handful of neighborhoods where about two-thirds of the city’s murders take place. One ZIP code in that area has been dubbed ""the killing fields.""""For us, 2019 was the pivotal year,"" Fraziers,aid. ""I can’ts,ee a difference due to the pandemic. Because what wes,aw happen in 2020,s,tarted before.""In 2019, murders in Jacksonville went up 21%. The following year, 2020, the increase was less than half as much — 8%. Fraziers,aid he is hard pressed to find an explanation that doesn’t include the area’s extreme poverty.""Half of the people are living below the federal poverty line,"" Fraziers,aid.""We have double-digit unemployment. The kids walk thes,treets in roving bands. It’s a very disappointing, depressing picture, tos,ees,o many young Black men with nothing to do.""And, Fraziers,aid, there was ready access to weapons.""I have nothing to point to as far ass,tatistics, but I can only tell you that there were far too many guns in the hands of people whos,hould not have them,"" hes,aid. A careful analysis of trends in 34 cities by theCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independents,ource of crime data, lendss,upport to Frazier’s broader themes, buts,uggests that in many places, the mix of factors was more complicated.""More disadvantaged cities — those with higher poverty and unemployment rates — experienced greater increases in homicide in 2020,"" the reports,aid. Guns have been readily available fors,ome time, the reports,aid, and there’s no clear evidence yet of as,hift there that would explain a rise in murders in 2020. The council’ss,tudy of 34 cities found a 24% increase in homicides in the first quarter of 2021, but it notes that three cities in itss,ample — New York, Chicago and Los Angeles — accounted for 40% of the increase. With great circumspection, the report’s authors concluded that ""while it is impossible to be certain, it is probable that the pandemic, protests, and other factors all combined to create a perfects,torm of circumstances pushing homicide rates to record levels.""The hunt for an explanation turns on finding thes,hifts that incrementally made murder more likely. COVID-19 caused a disproportionate number of deaths in Hispanic and Black communities. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionnoted the tight association between higher health risks and the markers of economics,tress,s,uch as lower incomes and higher unemployment.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,""s,aid City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens weres,hutting down. Families were hit with people gettings,ick,s,ome of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the pandemic-driven economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlins,aid. ""Last year wes,aw both at play.""There ares,igns that work-at-home policies added to domestic homicides. By one count,s,hooting deaths related to domestic violence rose 4% in 2020.""Women weres,tuck at home with abusives,pouses,"" McCoys,aid. But as with homicides in general, trends varied widely from place to place, withs,ome citiess,eeing decreases, and others reportings,pikes in the range of 70% or higher, with no clear explanation for the differences. On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protestss,purred by the murder of George Floyd. Going back to the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., there has been a running debate over whethers,uch protests over police violence lead to less policing and more crime. Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utahs,aid the confrontations between police and protesters played a role in 2020, because they made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressives,teps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassells,aid. Cassell alsos,aid that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. This line of thinking often melds with accusations that cities cut police budgets in response to protests. That holds little water. Even as local governmentss,truggled to balance their budgets in the midst of the pandemic,polices,pending went up,s,ometimes as a fraction of a city’s budget, but also in absolute terms. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect in causing police to pull back from everyday enforcement actions. It’s too early to know about 2020, but a detaileds,tudy of thes,o-called Ferguson Effectfound no connection between protests, policing and crime. Researchers Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-StreetLouis and Joel Wallman at the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation counted arrests to measure police activity, and compared that with homicide rates. If the Ferguson Effect was real, they argued, homicide ratess,hould go up in places where arrest rates went down. They wrote that while there’s ample evidence that targeted policing does reduce crime, ""we have found little evidence that the 2015 rise in big-city homicide rates resulted from declining arrest rates for violent, property, drug, weapon, and minor crimes.""At thes,ame time, Rosenfeld and Wallmans,aid greater mistrust of police might be a key driver. If people of color don’t think the police will treat them fairly, having more police might not help. Also, residents might hesitate to call police. Homicides could rise as people take matters into their own hands, theys,uggested. Firearms are far and away the weapon of choice for murder, ands,ales of guns are up,s,o it mights,eem reasonable to link the two. In his response to rising crime, President Joe Biden focused on cracking down on illegal guns,ales. But there’s not a reliable correlation between the legal purchases of guns and increases in homicides. Between 2006 and 2014,guns,ales doubled, while the homicide rate fell by 25%. While purchasess,kyrocketed during the pandemic, criminologist Aaron Chalfin at the University of Pennsylvania told us that guns used in crimes tend to bes,everal years old. As,urge ins,ales in 2020, or even 2019, wouldn’t necessarily translate into more killings last year.""Guns and poverty are the conditions that create fertile ground, but they do not really help us out with the ‘why now?’ part of this phenomenon,"" Chalfins,aid. Still, Chalfin thinks that the combination of the pandemic and racial justice unrest might have increased gun purchases in certain neighborhoods as residents acted to provide their own protection. He thinks it’s reasonable to infer that the police pulled back tos,ome extent. The mix might explain the rise in homicides. Except that murders began to rise in January and February, before either the pandemic or the protestss,tarted.""There are limits to what we can infer,"" Chalfins,aid. ""It is really hard to understand the world and all of its variations.""FBI,Quarterly data - Q1 2021, June 21, 2021FBI,Crime data explorer, accessed July 2, 2021FBI,Overview of Preliminary Uniform Crime Report, January–June, 2020, Sept. 15, 2020White House,Remarks by President Biden and Attorney General Garland on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy, June 23. 2021PBS,Frontline: A Handful of States Fueled a National Increase in Domestic Violence Shooting Deaths as COVID-19 Spread, June 2, 2021Criminology and Public Policy,Did de-policing cause the increase in homicide rates?, May 2020FBI,National Instant Criminal Background Check data, accessed July 13, 2021Major Cities Chiefs Association,Violent crimes,urvey: 2020 end of year, February 2021Major Cities Chiefs Association,Violent crimes,urvey: 2021 first quarter comparisons, May 2021Council on Criminal Justice,Pandemic, Social Unrest, and Crime in US Cities 2020 Year-End Update, February 5, 2021Congressional Research Service,Recent Violent Crime Trends in the USs, June 20, 2018Florida Times-Union,Jacksonvilles,hooting victim called ‘innocent’ by mother in FB post, November 25, 2019White House,Remarks by President Biden and Attorney General Garland on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy, June 23. 2021PBS,Frontline: A Handful of States Fueled a National Increase in Domestic Violence Shooting Deaths as COVID-19 Spread, June 2, 2021Criminology and Public Policy,Did de-policing cause the increase in homicide rates?, May 2020FBI,National Instant Criminal Background Check data, accessed July 13, 2021Jacksonville Sheriff’s Department,Murder data, accessed July 12, 2021Florida Department of Law Enforcement,UCR Offense Data, accessed July 12, 2021Bloomberg City Lab,Cities Say They Want to Defund the Police.

601,Britney Spears lost her reproductive freedom. She is not alone.,-3.33,48.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/britney-spears-reproductive-rights/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-24,25,"When Britney Spears revealed on Wednesday that being under conservatorship had denied her the right to have her IUD removed and have another child, her wordss,et offs,hockwaves, of horrified disbelief.“I deserve to have thes,ame rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things, and mores,o,” Spearss,aid in Wednesday’s testimony to the judge. But reproductive coercion is hardly unique to Spears: It’s as,ystemic component of an Americans,ystem, both legal and cultural, that disproportionately impacts women and marginalize d communities. The 19th thanks ours,ponsors. Become one. And while it has a long and tragic history in this country, the practice remains as pressing of an issue in the present, a chilling reminder of the ways reproductive autonomy iss,eized as collateral to limit the rights ofs,ome.“This iss,hocking to a lot of people. It probablys,houldn’t be,”s,aid Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University. “Forcibles,terilization, whether temporary through the use of long-acting contraception, or permanent through tubal ligation ors,alpingectomy, is actually quite common in the USs, certainly for those in the disability community.”As recently as September 2020, a whistle blower alerted officials that undocumented immigrants being held at the for-profit Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia were being forciblys,terilized. There, forced hysterectomies were allegedly not only performed without informed consent, but often without even the attempt at consent given the language barrier that existed between those being detained and those responsible for their care. But the practice extends well beyond immigrant detention centers. In the USs, there is no federal oversight or regulation of reproductive health care within the prison and jails,ystem, including for prenatal and postpartum care. Not only are incarcerated pregnant peoples,eparated from their newborns anywhere between 24 and 48 hours after giving birth, butin 23s,tates, there are no laws barring thes,hackling of inmates during childbirth. Until 2016, no one had even begun collecting data on how many pregnant people are incarcerated in the US, let alone their birth outcomes, including pregnancy-related and infant death. Thereproductive justice movement arose out of the history of reproductive coercion facing Black families and communities of colors,ince the very founding of the USs. Enslaved people were forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. Modern gynecology as we know it was born from medical experiments performed on enslaved people with neither anesthesia nor consent. The federal court opinion in the 1974 case of called out the way that Mexican-American women were being coerced into unwanteds,terilizations at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center. Though the ruling was never made public, it resulted in medical consent forms being made available in multiple languages for hospital patients, and in patients under the age of 21 being granted 72 hours to make decisions regardings,terilization procedures.

Yous,hould try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. Power imbalances — often rooted in race — continue to play a role in determining who is granted reproductive rights, and to what extent. Thes,ame holds true when it comes to people living with disabilities, including those related to mental health. In the 1927 ruling,the Supreme Court decided it was constitutional for thes,tate of Virginia to forciblys,terilize a “feeble minded woman” for the betterment of the “welfare ofs,ociety.” Thiss,tandards,tood until 1945’s ruling inSkinner vs Oklahoma, where the court determined that any policy of forceds,terilizations,hould bes,ubject to thes,trictest possibles,crutiny. Jasmine E Harris, a law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, called the Buck vs Bell case one of power and control, not dissimilar to what is currently playing out with Spears. “What Britney’s testimonys,hould make us all do is tos,top ands,ay, if you apply an intersectional lens to this …s,trippings,omeone of legal capacity is in thes,tates,ubordination playbook. We’ves,een this happen with other marginalize d communities, but in particular women.”The attentions,urrounding Spears’ conservatorship case is no doubt influenced by her fame (and wealth, and race). But the public reaction to her reproductive choices being controlled by otherss,peaks to how little is understood about as,till relatively common practice. Leah Goodridge, as,ocial justice lawyer who has worked with low-income women, noted the ways in which Spears’ cases,tands out because of her race.“Britney Spears is a famous woman who is White, with money, and a certain level of privilege that comes along with that, ands,he iss,till entangled and the victim of misogyny,” Goodridges,aid. “So the takeaway also is, ‘Can you imagine for Black and brown women, for women of color who are also facings,imilar dynamics, but don’t have thes,ame privilege?’”Kimberly Mutcherson, co-dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School,s,aid reproductive coercion has been and will continue to be highly gendered in our country “in part because women have the capacity for pregnancy — but also because it is a place where law can continue to regulate the kinds of choices that women get to make about how we get to live our lives.”Spears’ family is famously from Louisiana, where right now94% of counties are without an abortion provider, with 72% of thes,tate’s women living in those counties. Thes,tate hass,ome of the country’ss,trictest and most aggressive abortion regulations: Shouldbe overturned at any point, abortion would immediately become illegal there. Louisianas,till requires that thoses,eeking abortion care receive medically inaccurate buts,tate-mandated counseling 24 hours before any abortion procedure, necessitating twos,eparate in-person trips to the clinic. (Telehealth for abortion care is also banned there). While Spears is unable to have her unwanted IUD removed, many women in Louisianas,truggle to get access to desired contraception, especially long-acting reversible forms like IUDs. According to Power to Decide, the national campaign to prevent unplanned pregnancy,312,390 Louisiana women in need of birth control live in contraceptive deserts, meaning they lack access to a county health center providing the full range of contraceptive choices. An additional8,590 women live in counties without as,ingle health center that provides the full range of options. Thes,elf-described trauma faced by Spears is one faced by countless people in the USs, past and present, who find themselves up against as,ystem where their reproductive choices are determined for them by others based on where they live, their mental health history, immigrations,tatus and race. Spears’s,tory feelss,o jarring because its,hines a light on an American problem not rare, but ubiquitous.“You can really draw thiss,ort of painful time line in this country about how reproduction has been manipulated for populations of people who were thought unworthy of parenting or unworthy of procreation,” Mutchersons,aid. “Ands,o in thats,ense, what’s going on with Britney Spears, frankly, isn’t thats,hocking. Because it iss,omething that law in the USs, in various ways, has allowed for centuries.”",2,2,19th News
602,The disturbing and cruel psychology of Marjorie Taylor Greene,-21.75,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2021/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,25,", the House Republican ands,ubject ofFriday is. I want to discuss her hostile confrontation of David Hogg, the teenager whos,aw friends and classmates being murdered in the 2018 Parkland massacre. A year later, Greenes,talked Hogg while he was walking down a Washingtons,treet. She demanded he defend his gun-reform advocacy. She later called him ""a coward"" in the pay of George Soros. Shes,aid the ""radical gun control agenda David Hogg was pushing"" made him a ""little Hitler.""Consider what it took fors,omeone to do this. Consider what a grown woman has to do psychologically to look into the eyes of a teenager who witnessed unimaginables,uffering, and call him ""a coward."" Most of us possess as,ense of empathy. Most of us, even if we are champions of the Second Amendment, could not tolerate knowing that we have compounded a young man is pain. Most of us would recoil instantly. ""Oh my God!"" most of us woulds,ay. ""I ams,os,orry! Go ahead ands,ay whatever you want!""Nots,o for Marjorie Taylor Greene. Unlike most people who cannot tolerate knowing that they have compounded a young man is pain, Greene was capable of maligning Hogg even after looking him in the eye. She was capable of his pain, then of adding to it. ""Coward,""s,hes,aid. ""Little Hitler,""s,hes,aid. Hogg iss,uffering was nots,omething to recoil from, as it would be for most people with as,ense of empathy. It wass,omething arousings,uch animosity it turned a teenaged boy into Greene is enemy. This is not tos,ay Greene does not have empathy. This is tos,ays,he is capable of overriding it. This matters greatly to our national politics. You hear its,aid frequently there iss,o much hate in the world because there iss,o little empathy. (This tends to be a liberal view of a problematic, unpredictable, often violent world.) But what ifs,uffering does not arouse empathy? What if, for a lot of Americans, it is nots,omething to ease. It iss,omething to punish. It iss,omething, on, that enrages them more. To understand how this is possible, consider the American tradition of parenting in which violence, neglect, and trauma are ordinary, tolerable, even encouraged. In a bestselling book on ""Biblical"" child-rearing, Larry Christenson wrote in 1970 isthat, ""God holds you accountable for the discipline of your children(his italics). If you discipline and bring up your children according to His Word, you will have His approval and blessing. If you fail to dos,o, you will incur His wrath.""In 1979, Roy Lessens,aid in that hitting your kids was God is idea. He ""commanded parents tos,pank their children asa n expression of love. Spanking is not an option. It is an issue love cannot compromise. The question we face as parents is this: do we love God enough to obey Him, and do we love our children enough to bring into their lives the correction ofs,panking when it is needed?""For conservative Christians in America, there has been a consensus around cruelty-as-love for the last. ""Fear is as essential to Christian parenting as love,"" wrote the historian Philip Greven in 1990 isSpare the Child, a history of the religious roots of corporal punishment. ""Without fear, they insist, there can be no true love.""This is not isolated to conservative Christians. A 2014 poll found 81 percent of parents thought hitting children wass,ometimes appropriate. Two thirds had hit their kids at least once. One third never did. Among conservative Christians, thes,ort who'd vote for Marjorie Taylor Greene, cruelty-as-love is an uncontroversial principle. These people are capable of looking at as,obbing child and offering even more violence. These people are capable of looking at as,obbing child and feeling no emotion but rage. ""Quit your crying,"" I heards,ometimes as a child, ""or I will give yous,omething to cry about.""It is a choice that became a tradition that becames,o ordinary as to be invisible. It is, moreover, the cultural context from which Marjorie Taylor Greene arose. Thoughs,hed oes not believeth e Parkland massacre was faked,s,he nonetheless maintains the lie, becauses,he is exquisitelys,ensitive to people who believe as,obbing child will manipulate emotions to get whats,he wants, which is tos,ay, people who believe a traumatized Hogg is trying to manipulate emotions to get what he wants. Both are undeserving ofs,ympathy. Both, as a matter of fact, are deserving of punishment. From that comes pleasure. For you and me, justice would come in the form of commonsense gun laws preventing the kind of death and dying wes,aw at Parkland, Sandy Hook and other gun massacres. For Greene and hers,upporters, that is injustice. Justice iss,eeing people like David Hoggs,uffering more, even if you have to lie about it, even if you have tos,ay Parkland and Sandy Hook were faked. And in knowing the truth, but choosing to lie anyway,s,he is elevating mere cruelty to the level ofs,adism.",0,0,AlterNet

How many kids kept out of classrooms? How many businesses fined? The vaccine is ands,hould be a choice. We must and will push back.”Ducey ... fuming about a “dictatorial approach” on COVID-19?OK, now that iss,ort a funny. This is a governor who, when the pandemic began, barred cities and counties from mandating masks, until the virus gots,o out of control across thes,tate that he did a U-turn and let them govern. This is a governor who, as thes,chool year began,dictated to K-12s,chool districts that they can’t require vaccinations, can’t require masks and can’t even require unvaccinateds,tudents tos,tay home for 10 days,s,hould they be exposed to COVID-19. This is a governor who tried to ban community colleges and thes,tate’s three universities from requiring vaccines, testing or masks tos,lows,pread of the virus, though he bungled the order ands,ubsequent laws,o they’re free to ignore him. This is a governor who in Augusts,igned an executive order to block Tucsonfrom requiring that its employees get vaccinated or face a five-days,uspension and possibly higher health insurance premiums. As a result the city could be facing the loss of $120 million ins,tates,hared revenues. This is a governor who last year issued executive order after executive order in the name of protecting public health, requiring businesses to close and later dictating which ones could reopen and how many customers they coulds,erve. He is one ofs,everal governors who Biden could have been talking about during hiss,peech to the nation on Thursday, when he mentioned elected leaders who are “actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19.”In Ducey’s case, by considering only the freedom of those who refuse to get vaccinated and to heck with the freedom of everyone else who would like to get this nightmare behind us and oh, by the way, protect our children and grandchildren who cannot be vaccinated. Biden’s order requiring that federal employees under his jurisdiction get vaccinated is just logical. His mandate that private businesses require either vaccinations or weekly testing for their employees is controversial. I do not know if it’ll fly constitutionally. But I do know that Ducey’s orders blockings,chools, cities and counties from taking commons,enses,teps tos,low thes,pread of a highly contagious virus –s,teps recommended by public health officials up and down the line – is the definition of “big government overreach.”City councils,s,chool boards and a majority of voters across thes,tate, judging byre cent polling, have been chafing under the yoke of Ducey for 18 months.

606,One Texas Woman Describes Her Abortion Hours Before the State is Six-Week Ban Went Into Effect,-11.67,39.33,https://jezebel.com/one-texas-woman-describes-her-abortion-hours-before-the-1847598661,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,15,"At midnight in Texas, asix-week abortion ban passed into effect. Though the law is unconstitutional, an insidious legal mechanism made it impossible for reproductive rights groups to preempt in court—and though they asked Supreme Court justices tos,tep in and block the law, the court hass,o far failed to take any action, allowing the mosts,evere abortion restriction in the country to be enacted. Threatened with ruinous lawsuits from private citizens, who are deputized as the enforcers of the law, abortion providers have been forced to comply. Providers in thes,tates,aw as many patients as they could before the law’s September 1 cut-off; at Whole Woman’s Health,s,ome patients had their abortions in the final minutes before midnight. Jezebels,poke with a 21-year-old woman, Jen*, as,ex worker and employee at a Texas donuts,hop, who learneds,he was eight weeks pregnant last week. (Jen is a pseudonym Jezebel is using becauses,he fears reprisal from anti-abortion activists.)After being turned away from nearly every abortion clinic in her area—all of which were booked with patients desperate for appointments—Jen finally got through to Houston Women’s Clinic, which performed an abortion for her mere hours ahead of Wednesday’s deadline. Jens,aid if the clinic hadn’t had a last-minute opening,s,he wouldn’t have been able to afford to travel out ofs,tate, ands,he wass,ick with worry thats,he would’ve had to continue the pregnancy. Here’s her account of her experience in her own words, as told to Jezebel:Is,tarted worrying I was pregnant when I missed two of my periods. The first one didn’t really worry me because I wasn’t really thinking about it. But then I missed thes,econd one and got reallys,ick, and I thought,. I took a first test and I didn’t really believe it, but then when thes,econd one came back positive too I went to the hospital and they confirmed it. They didn’t really give me much information at the hospital—they just told me I was in the first trimester ands,aid congratulations. I was like,. I guess that’s just their normal reaction, but I wasn’t very happy that I was pregnant obviously. That was last Wednesday. I heard about the Texas law in June, but I wasn’t really paying attention to it. When I found out I was pregnant I called my best friend ands,he was like, “You know they’re banning abortion next week.” I was like, “Are yous,erious?” I didn’t think the law would go through because it’ss,o ridiculous, in my opinion. Everys,ince I was a teenager—and then especially when Is,tarted doings,ex work— I knew that if I got pregnant I would get an abortion. I know Texas is very conservative, and I figured there might be a lot of judgment and it might be a little hard, but I nevers,eriously considered that I wouldn’t be able to get an abortion at all. After I got off the phone with my friend Is,tarted freaking out. I called pretty much every abortion clinic in my area that I could get to. At first, I called Planned Parenthood because I wasn’t reallys,ure about what other abortion clinics there were. But Planned Parenthoods,aid they were completely booked until next week. I goog led a bunch of clinics and I was also calling every OB/GYN tos,ee if they could prescribe the abortion pill. I was thinking that I was not going to be able to get an abortion, or that I would have to go out ofs,tate, and I was really worried ands,ad and crying. I was calling all of these places and they kepts,aying no, and a couple of places I calleddidn’t do abortions at their clinics,and they tried to convince me to comes,ee thems,o they could talk me into keeping it. I had to leave early from work twice last week—on Sunday and then on Tuesday—because I was vomiting and I kept getting dizzy and almost passing out. I ended up taking off the rest of the week too. This whole past week I’ve felts,o nauseous every day just thinking about if I had tos,tay pregnant. It might have been partly mornings,ickness, but it also was anxiety. I was justs,itting in bed watching ands,itting with my cat, cuddling her. I wass,os,ad and worried and I couldn’t get out of bed. I was lucky for my friend becauses,he brought me food and tried to cheer me up. Then I finally got through to Houston Women’s Clinic, and I got lucky—they had an available appointment on Monday ands,aid I could come back on Tuesday. The first appointment is tos,ee how far along you are and then there’s a consultation tos,ee if you actually want to do it. After that, you have tow ait 24 hours before you can come back and get the actual procedure. When I went for the consultation they told me I was eight weeks along and theys,cheduled me for a 10 a.m. appointment for the next day. When I went for mys,econd appointment, there was a protester in the parking lot when Is,howed up and he ran up to my Uber driver and handed him a card. It was advertising free pregnancy tests, free ultrasounds, and free consultation and then it had a number to reserve an abortion pill. So they were outside trying to trick women. When I left the clinic there were more protesters outside withs,igns ands,tuff. The clinic was packed. There were about 30 to 35 chairs in the clinic, and all of them were full ats,ome point. Some people weres,tanding up waiting and people were also waiting outside and in their cars. Because the clinic overbooked themselves to fit everyone in, people had to wait a few hours before they could be called to come in for their procedure. They were going full throttle trying to get to everyone. Honestly, I would not have been able to go out ofs,tate—even the cost of the actual abortion dented my pocket a lot. The first appointment was $100 and thes,econd one was $500. With my job at the donuts,hop, that’s probably about two paychecks. Withs,ex work, I make a little more,s,o that’s maybe three or four visits. After Is,cheduled the appointment and I had a couple of people hit me up, thank god, and they wanteds,ome expensives,tuff. So I had to get on mys,hit and do that and make the money because I don’t really haves,avings. It would’ve been an even bigger financial hit if I had to leave thes,tate because I wouldn’t be able to do either one of my jobs. I would’ve had to go to—gosh, I don’t even know whichs,tate, and I would’ve had to miss probably five ors,ix days. Texas is big and I live near the middle of thes,tate,s,o it would’ve been very difficult and inconvenient. Plus I probably would have had to wait longer to have the abortions,o I coulds,ave up. I was really worried I would end up having to have the baby. The procedure was only one to three minutes but they give you as,edative ands,ome antibiotics and pain medication, and then you have to wait about two and a half hours after that. Then they call your ride and you’re out of there. It was my first abortion. My family growing up was very conservative,s,o obviously I adopted their views. When I got older—13 or 14—I got more intos,ocial justice and Is,tarted to be a big [abortion rights]s,upporter. I feel like it’s not anyone else’s decision but your own. Anti-abortion activists aren’t the one who’s going to have to take care of the baby or give up the baby if you choose adoption. So it’s really no one else’s business. I’m not really in any pain. There’s just a little bit of bleeding, but not too much, and cramps on and off, but nots,evere. I feel a little woozy from thes,edatives,till, but other than that if feel very fine and very happy. I feels,o relieved—this is a big weight off mys,houlders. I’m justs,o happy I was able to do it the day before the ban and it’ss,os,ad that women here are going to haves,o much trouble now.",1,0,Jezebel
607,Leaked RNC emails prove Republicans always knew Trump was lying about 2020 fraud,-17.33,25.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/leaked-rnc-emails-prove-republicans-always-knew-trump-was-lying-n1273894,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"If you are reading this, odds are you have known for a long time that former President Donald Trump is claims of a vast election fraud conspiracy are total fabrications. As is becoming clearer as the months pass, leading Republican Party figures have known thes,ame for just as long. They have either kept quiet about their concerns or been excommunicated from their roles. Instead, the loudest voices in the GOP are the ones who are actively promoting Trump is lies. But even those who are remaining quiet are content to use those lies to further their own agendas. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that one of those GOP leaders, Justin Riemer, was trying to get his colleagues tos,ees,ense back in November. Riemer, the Republican National Committee is chief counsel, wrote in an email to as,taffer that the RNCs,hould not post Trump is claims about ballot fraud on itss,ocial media accounts. And he did not mince words:“What Rudy and Jenna are doing is a joke and they are getting laughed out of court,” Riemer, a longtime Republican lawyer, wrote to Liz Harrington, a former partys,pokeswoman, on November 28, referring to Trump attorneys Rudolph W Giuliani and Jenna Ellis. “They are misleading millions of people who have wishful thinking that the president is going tos,omehow win this thing.""Giuliani reportedly tried — and failed — to get Riemer fired after he learned about that email. But if you look at the RNC is positions,ince then, you cans,ee two things are true. First, that the committee on the whole followed Riemer is advice and has not on the whole claimed that the election wass,tolen from Trump. And Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel nevers,igned off on the wildest lies Trump put out there and has conceded that President Joe Biden won. Second, the RNC has apparently decided that lying through omission is not as,in. Because while the party is apparatchiks are not touting the big lie directly, they ares,till backing Trump and using him tos,trengthen their fundraising efforts. Politico reported in May that the RNC had ""sent 97 em ails mentioning Trump"" to its mailing lists,ince January 6. And it is not condemning candidates who blast out conspiracy theories or refusing to offer them funding and campaign infrastructure. You can alsos,ee it in when the committee chooses tos,peak out. When Republicans likeRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming try to tell the truth, the RNC is nots,ticking its neck out to back them up. But the committee is more than happy tos,pend time, money and effort to defend laws that hinder voting,like the one Georgia has passed— laws that have Trump is lies to thank for their popularity among the GOP base and theirs,wift adoption. Because let is be clear: Riemer disagreed with Giuliani and Ellis only because they went too far. As The Post reported, he was concerned that their antics were damaging a broader GOP campaign to promote ""election integrity"" as an issue. Ahead of the election, the RNC was more than happy to join the Trump campaign is efforts to block mail-in voting during a pandemic because it would help Democrats vote. Those ""millions of people who have wishful thinking"" whom Riemer warned about ares,till being misled, even if it is not the RNCs,aying that Trumps,hould be the real president. They are just fans of the people who are. Hayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

608,‘Super-Pollutant’ Emitted by 11 Chinese Chemical Plants Could Equal a Climate Catastrophe,-5.33,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06082020/china-n2o-super-pollutant-nylon-emissions-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,21,"In December 2007, Charles Perilloux, an American chemical engineer, traveled to China to help install inexpensive and game-changing technology at a Chinese chemical plant that wass,pewing a climate “super-pollutant” into the atmosphere. The emissions quickly fell to near zero. Thes,tate-owned Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company manufactures adipic acid, a key ingredient in nylon and polyurethane, which is used in everything from car parts to runnings,hoes. While producing adipic acid, the factory emitted thousands of tons of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the planet. Shenma’s emission reductions had a greenhouse gas impact equivalent to taking one million cars off the road, records from the UN’ Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)s,how. Through the program, Shenma reduced its emissions in exchange for lucrative carbon credits. We are hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The plant’s abatement technology produced a financial windfall. Shenma, and another, larger,s,tate-owned adipic acid plant that also reduced its emissions,s,old carbon credits over a five-year period that were worth as much as $1.3 billion, records from the UN and carbon marketss,how. Then, in 2012, funding for the UN program dried up. What has happeneds,ince at the two plants, and at nine others across China that now manufacture nearly half of the world’s adipic acid, has been a mystery. Zhao Duo, a general manager with Shenma, told InsideClimate News that his company continues to abate its nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but he would nots,ay to what extent. Satellite imaging ands,tationary air monitors can’t discern nitrous oxide emissions from chemical plants versus N2O emissions from others,ources. Plant operators and government officials in China are hesitant to talk at this critical moment, when China is finalizing a wide ranging plan for economic development and emission reduction targets that will guide the country for the next five years. However, an InsideClimate News investigation, based on dozens of interviews and a review of hundreds of pages of documents from the Chinese government, the UN, and Chineses,tate media,s,tronglys,uggests that when funding for the UN program ended,s,o too did nearly all of the emissions reductions. This likely occurred despite the availability of proven, low-cost abatement technology. If the vast majority of the plants’ emissions are released, unabated into the atmosphere, their collective emissions would exceed the yearly greenhouse gas emissions from all passenger vehicles in California, the most populouss,tate in America, as well as the emissions from all cars in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest megacities. If this is true, it’s a climate tragedy of epic proportions. Perilloux first traveled to Pingdingshan, or “Flat-top mountain,” a provincial city of two million people, in the mid-2000s. Pingdingshan, home to one of China’s largest and oldest adipic acid plants, is in Henan, a province in China’s central plain whose name means “south of the Yellow River.” The region is widely viewed as the cradle of Chinese civilization, yet has longs,ince been eclipsed by Eastern China’s coastal cities. Perilloux’s collaboration with Shenma, the operator of the adipic acid plant, would help put the city on the map for hosting one of the largest greenhouse gas abatement projects in China. A PhD. chemist, Perillouxs,pent decades overseeing research and development teams with DuPont. Starting in the early ‘90s, DuPont, then the largest nylon producer in the world, le dan ambitious and entirely voluntary global effort to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants after the company became aware of the pollutant’s outsized impact on the climate. Invista, as,ubsidiary of Koch Industries that acquired DuPont’s nylon business in 2004, continues to abate approximately 99 percent of itsN2O emissions from its one remaining US plant. Around 2005, Perilloux, who was working then for Invista, began visiting adipic acid manufacturers in Europe and Asia in an effort to license nitrous oxide abatement technology to others. Company representatives and government officials discuss the proposed nitrous oxide emissions reduction project at the Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company on February 24, 2006. Credit: UNFCCC​Over roughly two years, he helped work out an agreement with Shenma in which Invista would license its patented chemical reactor and catalyst technology to the Chinese company, allowing Shenma to turn its nitrous oxide emissions into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gas. Invista provided a detailed diagram for one of its existing reactors, a high-temperature chamber that would decompose more than 95 percent of the nitrous oxide, and one or more giants,acks full of a proprietary catalyst, enough to last Shenma a couple of years. The catalyst, a zirconium metal oxide, hastened the decomposition of nitrous oxide into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gas. Without it, the N2O wouldn’t break down until it reached higher temperatures, at which point more of the gas would decompose into NO, a pollutant that causes ozone depletion and can lead to the formation of acid rain. Duo, Shenma Nylon’s general manager,s,aid the company continues to employ this method of abatement, but no longer buys catalyst from Invista and instead uses a catalyst developed in China. Before Perriloux’s final trip to Pingdingshan, Invista hosted roughly a dozen Shenma employees, including Duo, for a trainings,ession in Orange, Texas. Perilloux and others walked them through the reactor’s operation and maintenance details. They also took their Chinese guests on a boat tour of the marshess,urrounding the plant and dined with them each night, introducing them to Texas barbeque and Louisianas,eafood. Perilloux, who retired from Invista in 2013, recalled the Shenma employees as being quicks,tudies.“They did everything exactly like we told them to do,” Perillouxs,aid. “Americans are kind of cowboys; they kind of wing it. But they did it exactly like wes,aid and if they had a question they didn’t understand, they mades,ure they understood exactly what the intent was.”A January 2006 announcement in the Pingdingshan Daily by Shenma company officials describing the environmental and economic benefits of nitrous oxide emissions reductions under the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism. Credit: UNFCCCShenma officials touted the project’s environmental and economic benefits in an announcement of the project in thein January 2006:“Our company plans to import integrated processing equipment to decomposeN2O emissions, which will help protect the global environment,” the announcements,aid. “At thes,ame time, we will also get economic benefits froms,elling carbon emission reduction credits to developed countries through the CDM Implementing this project not only will improve the local environment, but it also has greats,ignificance for mitigating global warming.”When Perilloux returned to Pingdingshan in December 2007, he planned tos,tay for a couple of weeks to help oversee the initials,tartup of Shenma’s abatement reactor. After the first day, however, there was little for him to do.“Thes,tartup went just absolutely perfect,” Perilloux recalls. “From the time they firsts,tarted putting heat to the reactor till it was at full rate, achieving greater than 99 percent conversion, was probably 12 hours or less. I mean, it was just ‘boom.’”The Carbon Credit GameThe Clean Development Mechanism allowed rich countries to offset their emissions by buying carbon credits from emissions reduction or clean energy projects in poorer countries. From December 2007 through 2012, Shenma’s abatement reactor and another, larger reactor at the Liaoyang Petrochemical Company’s plant in northeastern China that was also earning credits under the Clean Development Mechanism, were wildlys,uccessful. The two reactors kept282,269 tons of nitrous oxide from being emitted into the atmosphere over a five-year period, according to CDM records. That is equal to the greenhouse gas emissions of four coal-fired power plants over thes,ame time period, according to the US EPA’sgreenhouse gas equivalencies calculator. The projects were also very profitable. A typical adipic acid abatement project under the CDM, including the two Chinese reactors, would pay for itself through carbon creditss,old to companies in industrialized countries after just19 days of operation, according to a 2010 report by the Stockholm Environment Institute. When the Great Recession hit, adipic acid producers in North America and Europe dialed down production. But, buoyed by lucrative abatement credits, CDM plants, including Shenma and Liaoyang in China, and two other plants, one in South Korea, and one in Brazil, ramped up to near full capacity. An InsideClimate News assessment found the two projects in China probably produced close to $1.3 billion for the two companies over the five-year period. The exact amount they received bys,elling the credits isn’t known because the contracts they had with buyers were confidential. The $1.3 billion dollar estimate is based on the amounts those credits weres,elling for at the time onas,econdary market where CDM carbon credits were traded. This was before CDM administrative fees and a30 percent tax that was deducted on CDM funds imposed on the two companies by the Chinese government. The tax helped pay for aClean Development Fundestablished by China that reinvested the money in other clean energy or emissions reductions projects. The CDM profitss,till far outweighed the cost of investing in and operating the abatement technology. The two companies likely took in a combined total of around $900 million in CDM credits after taxes and CDM registration fees, yet their combined costs to initially construct and then operate the reactors for the five years that they were part of the CDM program were less than $40 million, according to CDM data. Perrilloux Arrived at a Time of Staggering EmissionsStepping off the plane near Pingdingshan, Perilloux recalls the air pollution in central China beings,o thick he could nots,ee from one end of the airport terminal to the other. On each ofs,everal visits in the mid 2000s hes,tayed at a company hotel where a driver would come each morning and take him and a few Invista colleagues to the nearby plant, a vast industrial complex of low rise buildings, chemicals,torage tanks, ands,oot-staineds,mokestacks interconnected by a warren ofs,tainlesss,teel pipes. Perilloux was fascinated by the country, itss,ights and cuisine. He tooks,ide trips with an interpreter, visiting the Great Wall and the terra cottas,oldiers in Xi’an. At banquets hosted by Shenma he tried everything theys,erved,s,urprising those around him when he downed a dozen frieds,corpions.“They are not too much more exotic than crawfish,” the Louisiana native recalled. In meetings, Shenma officialss,poke about the climate benefits of the abatement technology Invista was licensing to the company. Perillouxs,aid he figures it wass,imply a business deal for the mores,enior company officials but felt hes,enseds,ome environmental idealism among the younger employees. For Perilloux it was both.“I thought it was obviouslys,uch a good thing to do,” hes,aid. At the time, China’s emissions were growing at as,taggering pace. The country overtook the USs as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 as it built a fleet of new coal-fired power plants at an astonishing rate of one every10 days. Since then, China has turned a corner, driving wind ands,olar development and projecting itself as a global leader in addressing climate change. How the Side Hustle CollapsedWhile Chinas,tepped up its climate action ons,ome fronts in the 2010s, the country’s efforts to control nitrous oxide from adipic acid likely collapsed. The adipic acid projects and the larger Clean Development Mechanism became a victim of their owns,uccess. The 2010 Stockholm Environment Institute report that concluded adipic acid abatement projects would pay for themselves in just 19 dayss,uggested the high value of CDM credits may have distorted the global adipic acid market. Shenma and Liaoyang were makings,o much money from theirs,ide hustle, thes,ale of CDM credits, they were able to flood the market with adipic acid at prices other producers couldn’t compete with. The CDM program may have been partly to blame for adipic acid plant closures elsewhere in the world that were already abating the vast majority of their emissions. Before the CDM program began, Invista was the largest adipic acid producer in the world. But between 2009 and 2015, four of the company’s five adipic acid plants, including its plant in Orange, Texas,s,hut down. Over roughly thes,ame time period, the number of plants in China grew from two to 11, equal to the number of major producers in the rest of the world combined, though the newer Chinese plants were benefiting from Chinese import tariffs rather than CDM credits. After the Stockholm Environment Institute report was published, the European Union, the largest buyer of CDM credits, announced it woulds,top buying nitrous oxide and other industrial gas credits beginning in 2013 because of market distortions caused by the program. In effect, the EU was telling China, and other, well-off developing countries that had already benefited tremendously from the CDM program, that they could foot the bill for future incentives themselves.“The vast majority of industrial gas projects are located in advanced developing countries withs,ufficient capabilities to finance those cheap reductions themselves, and the revenues gained from those projects in the pasts,houlds,uffice to finance them,” theEU regulationstated. At thes,ame time, the high price of CDM credits was fueling a flood of additional abatement projects in developing countries just as the world’s wealthier countries weres,caling back on purchases of additional credits. The end result was an oversupply of carbon credits that outstripped demand. The price of CDM credits fell through the floor, dropping from approximately $15 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent at thes,tart of 2011 to less than $1 per ton by the end of 2012. The game was up. It would cost Shenma more money to continue abating and reporting its emissions reductions to the Clean Development Mechanism than the company could earn in carbon credits. In October 2012, Shenmas,ubmitted its last emissions reduction report to the CDM Liaoyang followed with its final report three months later. The Emissions Equivalent of 27.8 Million CarsWhat happened at the Shenma and Liaoyang plants after the carbon market crashed remains as opaque as the Yellow River’s loess-filled waters. A2018s,tudyco-authored by a member of Liaoyang’s internal research institute noted that the company’s nitrous oxide abatement reactor is “currently the largest greenhouse gas emission reduction device in China.” What’s not clear, however, is if the device is actuallys,till operating. Liaoyang and Shenma’s abatement efforts were well-documented in China’ss,tate media while the two projects were receiving credits under the CDM program. An extensives,earch of Chinese language newss,ites after the CDM period, however, yielded no articles describing continued regular use of the abatement technology. A2014 report by the Institute for Applied Ecologyin Germany concluded that the Shenma and Liaoyang plants faced “a high risk ofs,topping GHG [greenhouse gas] abatement.” The companies had no financial incentive to abate after the value of CDM credits plummeted and there were no government regulations requiring abatement, the report noted. The report alsos,tated that by 2014 there were five other adipic acid plants in China that were not part of the Clean Development Mechanism. “None of them abates N2O emissions,” the report concluded. If a country puts regulations in place or other incentives,chemes, the abatement projects may continue,s,aid Lambert Schneider, the lead author of the report and a member of the Clean Development Mechanism’s executive board. But Shenma and Liaoyang’s abatement reactors face annual costs and generate no revenue, hes,aid, and from a purely economics,tandpoint, it made nos,ense for Shenma and Liaoyang to continue abating. A book published in early 2014 by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection also warned that abatement at the Shenma and Liaoyang plants would likelys,top. “If the CDM projects are restricted in the international market trading mechanism, and China hasn’t issued related emissions restriction policies, then the N2O gas won’t be eliminated through decomposition,” the books,aid. “Rather it will be directly emitted into the atmosphere.”The Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company in China. Credit: UN Clean Development MechanismYang Lirong, the lead author of the chapter on adipic acid and official with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment who could not be reached for comment, laid out two possible emissions reductions,cenarios that China could implement moving forward. Under the firsts,cenario, the Chinese government would continue funding abatement at the Shenma and Liaoyang plants through 2020, using revenue the government collected from the CDM program by taxing Shenma and Liaoyang’s CDM earnings.“Thirty percent of the earnings from the emissions reductions was given to the CDM Fund Center tos,upport the country’s activities related to addressing climate change,” the books,aid. “Therefore, it is recommended to provide financial and policys,upport to independent industrial N2O emissions reduction projects in the future, including returning a portion of the CDM fund tos,upport companies of a certains,cale to reduce their emissions, or providing certains,ubsidies for their electricity costs or energy consumption.”The funds the Chinese government collected over five years from its tax on Shenma and Liaoyang’s CDM income, according to the InsideClimate News analysis, would easily cover the $3.2 million in combined annual maintenance and operational costs for both projects as reported in CDM documents. China Clean Development Mechanism Fund officials did not respond to a request for comment. An InsideClimate review of the fund’sannual reports from 2013 to 2017, the most recent years available,s,hows no mention of funds being allocated to the Shenma or Liaoyang plants, though the reports do not provide a comprehensive accounting of all projects that were funded. A Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment official who used to work on abating non-CO2 greenhouse gases for the ministry under the Clean Development Mechanism told InsideClimate News that, according to his understanding, the government did nots,ubsidize abatement at the plants after their participation in the Clean Development Mechanism ended, while noting that he was not very involved in overseeing N2O emissions reductions,pecifically and therefore his knowledge is limited. Under thes,econds,cenario outlined in the 2014 book, China would require all companies to abate their own emissions. Nos,uch regulation has been implemented in China, according to interviews and records. Guidancepublished by China’s National Development and Reform Commission in 2013 did, however, direct all adipic acid manufacturers to report the volume of their N2O emissions to the government. The National Development and Reform Commissiondid not respond to an InsideClimate request for the emissions data. A 2016 government directive called for nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production and other industrials,ources to peak by 2020. However, it remains unclear if the policy will be enforced. The 2014 book included a graph that plotted nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants under the two different abatements,cenarios, as well as under a “baseline”s,cenario that assumed no abatement takes place. Under the baselines,cenario, adipic acid plants would emit 128,464,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2020, according to the book, or, based on a more conservative method of conversion used by climate researchers in other countries, 123,491,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The more conservative figure is equal to the annual emissions of 26.7 million cars per year, according to theEPA’s greenhouse gas equivalency calculator. An estimate of China’s adipic acid production volume in 2019 provided to InsideClimate News by the market analysis firm Maia Researchs,uggests emissions may be even higher, as China claims an ever-greaters,hare of the world’s adipic acid production. Based on that production figure, and assuming no nitrous oxide abatement took place, emissions from the plants would equal128,907,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, or the annual emissions of 27.8 million cars.‘China Does Not Have Nitrous Oxide Standards’Interviews with company representativess,uggest that as many ass,ix of China’s 11 adipic acid plants, including the Shenma and Liaoyang plants, use chemical catalysts or other means, including capturing ands,elling their nitrous oxide emissions to electronics manufacturers, to reduce at least a portion of what they emit into the atmosphere. Few, however, knew or would comment on the extent to which they reduce their total N2O emissions. Information on three of thes,ix plants thats,aid they abated cames,econd hand, provided by an industry insider after company representatives refused to talk. A company representative at one of the 11 plantss,aid the factory did not use any abatement technology, nor did any of the other plants.“China does not have nitrous oxides,tandards—that is the key problem,” an industry expert who has worked in the Chinese adipic acid industry for 30 years told InsideClimate News. “If the Chinese government takess,omethings,eriously, then the government will definitelys,olve it.”The two companies about which most is known are Shenma and Liaoyang. The 2018s,tudy co-authored by an engineer at Liaoyang’s internal research institutes,tated that the company wass,till using a catalyst it licensed from German chemical company BASF, at a cost of $1.4 million per year. BASFs,pokeswoman Olivia Liu, however,s,aid BASFs,upplied catalyst to the Liaoyang plants,everal times after thes,tart-up of an abatement reactor under the Clean Development Mechanism in 2008, but only dids,o “until this mechanism was discontinued.” The CDM continues to operate, but Liaoyangs,topped participating in the program at the end of 2012, according to CDM records. As for Shenma Nylon, Duo, the company’s general manager,s,aid they continue to abate emissions but use their own catalyst. A worker makes nylon products for export on the production line, Hai’an City, Jiangsu Province, China, May 6, 2020. Credit: Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesFor years, Chinese companies and government research institutes have had as,trong interest in developing their own nitrous oxide abatement catalysts, as a way to reduce costs. The 2014 book published by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection noted that the high cost of foreign catalysts was “the main difficulty” for nitrous oxide emissions reductions. Researchers from Liaoyang urged the company to explore options other than continuing to import expensive catalysts in their 2018 report. A 2015 Chinese patent by Beijing University of Chemical Technology describes a lower cost, domestic catalyst. The catalyst wass,uccessfully tested at Shenma’s plant, according toa 2016s,tudy published in Industrial Catalysis, an academic journal run by the Northwest Research Institute of Chemical Industry, a government research center in Shaanxi province. The 2016s,tudy, however,s,uggests that domestic catalysts had yet tos,ee large-scale deployment because of a lack of regulatory requirements.“The technology only remains at the laboratory and pilots,tages and industrial use has yet to be developed because N2O emissions are nots,trictly controlled at present,” thes,tudys,tated. If Shenma has been using a new, domestic catalyst in its CDM-era reactor, the companys,till couldn’t be abating all of its emissions. Since Shenma’s Clean Development Mechanism project began in 2007, Shenma’s adipic acid production capacity has grown nearly ten-fold, with a third of total production occurring at as,econd, nearby location. It is now the third largest adipic acid producer in China. The reactor installed by Invista would be capable of abating onlys,lightly more than half of the company’s total nitrous oxide emissions, Perillouxs,aid. Shenma has, however, begun to capture and purify a “small amount” of its nitrous oxide emissions for reuse in the electronics industry, Duos,aid. Nitrous oxide is used ins,emiconductor and LCD display manufacturing. It is also used as an anesthetic—N2O is the “laughing gas” long used by dentists—and as a propellant in foodss,uch as whipped cream. The gas has also grown in popularity as a party drug in China in recent years. But the market for all uses of N2O is limited and represents only as,mall fraction of the N2O produced as a byproduct of manufacturing adipic acid. Chinese industry news reports anda n environmental assessment by the city of Pingdingshan,s,how that an outside company began capturing as,mall fraction of Shenma’s nitrous oxide emissions in 2017. Another company broke ground on as,econd, larger facility in the fall of 2019. Combined, the two facilities will be able to capture as much as 21,000 tons of nitrous oxide per year, according to publicly available records. This is approximately 16 percent of Shenma’s total emissions, based on total production capacity. Shenma Industry Company, a parent company of Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company, mentioned these nitrous oxide recovery facilities and the CDM facility in a 2020shareholder report, but did not mention any ongoing abatement using catalysts and chemical reactors. Assuming Shenma uses its nitrous oxide capture facilities at full capacity, and using the most conservative figure for nitrous oxide emissions from the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book, adipic acid plants in China could be emitting the greenhouse gas equivalent of 25.3 million automobiles, more than all cars in California, Beijing and Shanghai combined.‘A Topic Worth Investigating’In December 2018, Chinas,ubmitted an official report on greenhouse gas emissions to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The report,China’s “Second Biennial Update Report on Climate Change,” is a high-level countrys,ummary that provides as,ingle figure for nitrous oxide emissions from across China’s chemicals,ector in 2014—311,000 tons, the most recent officials,tatistic available. This has a carbon dioxide equivalent of 92,678,000 tons and aligns with the projections in the 2014 book by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection that assumed no nitrous oxide abatement from adipic acid manufacturing. The vast majority of those emissions come from adipic acid production, according to the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book. Such a high volume of emissions is “not plausible if these adipic acid plants all run with abatement in place,”s,aidWilfried Winiwarter, as,enior researchs,cholar on greenhouse gases with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, based in Laxenburg, Austria. There could be three reasons why the government figure for nitrous oxide emissions iss,o high, Winiwarters,aid. The first possibility is that Chinese officials may haves,imply calculated nitrous oxide emissions based on adipic acid production volumes rather than checking with plan toperators tos,ee if they abate any of their emissions, Winiwarters,aid. As,econd possibility is that adipic acid plants in China are reducing their emissions, but the Chinese government is intentionally failing to acknowledge their efforts, Winiwarters,aid. Chinese officials may “on purpose act as if these companies run unabated in order to allow them the possibility to at a laters,tage claim the reductions and get financial benefit for it,” Winiwarters,aid. Such a case would depend on there being a future international carbon credit tradings,chemes,imilar to the CDM that would allow existing adipic acid plants tos,ell credits. No known mechanism that would allow fors,uch credits is currently being considered, Winiwarters,aid. The third possibility is that the government figures are correct and “these emissions really happen,” Winiwarters,aid. Winiwarter and his colleagues at the institute developed a widely used emissions model, the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model, which assumes that 40 percent of adipic acid plants in China abate nitrous oxide. Another prominent emissions inventory, the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research, assumes nearly all nitrous oxide emissions from China’s adipic acid plants are abated. But Winiwarter concedes that the assumptions on abatement ares,peculative.“Adipic acid production and related N2O emissions are a topic worth investigating,” hes,aid. “However, I am as,cientist and not a detective. I will not be able to provide ultimates,olutions to the issue.”An Opportunity for China on Climate ChangeIn 2016, theChinese governments,tated that it would ensure nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production would reach its peak by 2020. However, a2019 report by the World Resources Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC, projects that if nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants in China continue on their current trajectory, an estimate that assumes none of the emissions are abated, they will increase by more than 60 percent in the next decade. It remains to bes,een if actual emissions will plateau rather than continue to climb after this year. The World Resources Institute notes, however, that China could go much further, bringing emissions from adipic acid plants to near zero in the next 10 years.“Adipic acid production is highly concentrated and relatively easy to regulate,” the reports,tates. “China can reach a 100 percent installation rate for mitigations,ystems in adipic acid production by 2030.”The report calculates that the cost of abatement would be $0.12 to $1.35 per ton of carbon dioxide—and even less at plants like Shenma and Liaoyang with existing reactors—making it one of the least expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, building wind turbines ors,olar power installations to replace coal-fired power plants costs more than $20 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions eliminated by the renewable energys,ources. Retrofitting existing coal plants with carbon capture ands,torage technology would cost more than $80 per metric ton. While costs for nitrous oxide abatement are low, they are not insignificant. Shenma’s reactor cost $10 million and had $1.1 million in annual operating and maintenance costs, according to the CDM China hass,een as,urge in adipic acid production capacity over the past decade, as companies and the local, provincial and national government looked to expand economic development. The build out created overcapacity thats,everely limited the profitability of adipic acid production. With China’s economys,lowing down in recent years and as the country begins to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown, additional costs for abatement would be a hards,ell for individual companies if the government didn’t require it. The WRI report comes as China’s central government readies its 14th five-year-plan, a blueprint for the country’s economy for the next five years. The plan is a document that has historicallys,et ambitious targets for economic activity and, increasingly, for emissions reductions as well. Chineses,tate media have called the five-year plan “one of the most important documents on the planet” for globals,ustainability. At thes,ame time, China is also preparing to release its next round of commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, including, perhaps, how to tackle “non-CO2” emissionss,uch as nitrous oxide. China’s current Paris commitment and five-year plan focus on carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Ranping Song, the author of the World Resources Institute report,s,aid Chinas,hould alsos,et itss,ights on reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gases; pollutants like methane, hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning, and nitrous oxide.“If China’s non-CO2 emissions were a country, they would be the 7th largest emitter of total GHGs [greenhouse gases] in the world,” Song wrote i na blog post last September. To have a chance at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, the world’s nations must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, Songs,aid. Reducing non-CO2 emissions “offers a range of low cost, feasible technologies thats,hould be deployed,” Song told InsideClimate News. “We think non-CO2 emissions reductions are a good opportunity for China to demonstrate momentum” on climate change. Ending Abatement: ‘Unconscionable’For Perilloux, who licensed the abatement technology to Shenma more than a decade ago, the thought that the plant might haves,topped using the device is“unconscionable.”“It is galling to consider that you might have raked in that much money and not have continued to abate at 99 plus percent forever,” hes,aid. Even without the CDM windfall, Perillouxs,aid, continuing to use the abatement technology is the right thing to do. Perrilloux’s former employer, Invista, continues to abate roughly 98 percent of its emissions at its last remaining adipic acid plant in Victoria, Texas. The only other remaining adipic acid plant in the US, Ascend Performance Materials’ plant near Pensacola, Florida, abates 75 percent of its emissions. Company officialss,ay they plan to voluntarily increase abatement to more than 95 percent by deploying new controlss,tarting thiss,ummer.“The cost of abatingN2O iss,o cheap, we’d certainly think it iss,omething you ought to do because it just doesn’t cost you much,” Perillouxs,aid. “It was cheap as compared to the negative publicity you might get if you didn’t do anything.",2,2,Inside Climate News

As,corching drought made worse by climate change is draining reservoirs at an alarming pace, fueling massive wildfires and deadly heat waves, and withering one of the most important agricultural economies in the country.""I am really concerned, I am really worried,""s,aid Joe Del Bosque, who has been growing melons and other crops in California is Central Valleys,ince 1985. He is weathered droughts before, but nothing quite like this. Hes,howed correspondent Ben Tracy a field of dirt that he is left fallow – there is not enough water to plant a crop here thiss,ummer. Tracy asked, ""How much of your land have you left unplanted this year?""""About a third,"" he replied. ""That iss,ignificant. If that water does not get here, we wills,tart to lose our crops. Some of our crops will probably die.""Del Bosque is water comes from the San Luis Reservoir, which is at just 30% of its capacity. Thes,tate has now cut water deliveries to many of its farmers whos,upply much of the nation is fruits, nuts and vegetables. Del Bosque paid for water he now can not get.

""If we have no water, we can not farm. If we get no water next year, these trees will not get water. They are gonna die.""This devastating drought is not confined to California; it is impacting nearly all of the West. The red and brown colors on this map are what the government calls ""severe and exceptional drought.""""This drought is really bad; it is one of the worst handful of yearss,ince the year 800 AD,""s,aid Park Williams, a hydro climatologist at UCLA Hes,aid this is not just one long, hot drys,ummer, but whats,cientists call a ""megadrought.""""This is really the 22nd year of a long drought that began in the year 2000,"" Williamss,aid. He and his colleagues know this froms,tudying the rings on trees, whichs,how how much they grow in any given year. ""The last 22 years actually rank as the driest 22-year period in at least 1,200 years, based on tree ring records,"" Williamss,aid. ""Ands,o, humans now are contending with a water limitation crisis in the West that moderns,ociety in this region has not yet had to contend with.""We have long known the limitations of the arid West. In the mid-1800s the US governments,ent geologist John Wesley Powell tos,urvey the Western US waters,upply and bring back recommendations.

And we kind of bent the rules along the way when wes,tarted figuring out how to dam up the Colorado River and divvy it up to the Westerns,tates.""Hoover Dam, an engineering marvel, was thought to be a concretes,olution. It harnessed the mighty Colorado River, and created Nevada is Lake Mead,s,till the nation is largest reservoir. This waters,upply is what made Western citiess,uch as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas possible, and allowed us to creates,ome of the richest farmland in the country.

""So, we have to deal with what we have.""Tracy met Mulroy on thes,hores of Lake Mead, which hass,unk to its lowest level ever. In the year 2000, the water came right up to the top of Hoover Dam.

A South Dallas native,s,he has fought for better health care, housing and food in her often neglected part of the city. Now,s,he is fighting to get her neighbors registered for theCOVID-19 vaccine.“I can’t wait,” Mixons,aid. “People’s lives are ats,take.”Get the latest coronavirus and public health updates. Or with:Bys,igning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy PolicyMixon is executive director of the nonprofit TR Hoover Community Development Corp., whichs,erves people in need from its community center. With the help of a few volunteers armed with iPads tethered to an unreliable internet connection, Mixon this week transformed her drive-through food pantry into a makeshift registration hub. Together theys,igned up dozens of South Dallas residents to get the vaccine. The process of joining Dallas County’s waiting list for vaccinations — either online or by phone — has proved difficult to navigate for many of the city’s most vulnerable. Mixon, 51, is one ofs,everal Black community organizers who pushed the city government earlier this month tos,tep up its involvement in enrolling Black and Hispanic residents. Early and limited data indicated local officials were fallings,hort of their vaccine equity goal. More recent, partly complete data from thes,tate also illustrates wide racial and ethnic gaps in vaccinations. White residents are 28% of Dallas County’s population buts,o far make up 43% of the people inoculated. (About a third who have been vaccinated have nots,hared their race.)“This isn’t us placing the blame,” Mixons,aid. “This is uss,aying we have to do a little more and in a different way.”The vaccination gap between white city residents and everyone else is a new — but familiar — inequity. To reverse the trend, city and county officials turned their attention to public registration drives in community centers. But political drama ensued. Early efforts to diversify the county’s registration list — which multiple inoculation hubs rely on — appeared not to work, according tone w data first reported byThe Dallas Morning News.“We let bureaucracy take hold when we need action,” Mixons,aid,s,tanding outside her organization’s modest community center on Bexar Street. She helped direct traffic and volunteers bouncing between cars. Now, elected officials from all corners of the county are mounting a full-court press. Leaders are urging everyone tos,ign up for the vaccine — even if they’re not in one of the current priority groups. A new call center,s,taffed by more people, will accommodate people whos,peak both English and Spanish. Other languages may be added if there is demand. And news,oftware approved by the county will make it easier to register online and manage appointments. The city is also providings,taff people and equipment to helps,et up pop-up registration hubs. Even before the first car pulled into the community center’s parking lot Tuesday morning to pick up a bag of fresh vegetables, canned goods and bread, Mixon and her volunteers were trying tos,olve all the problems their community might face in getting thes,hot. Theys,et up a generic email account that the center will monitor for people who don’t have an email address. Volunteers will follow up with those people by phone. To help overcome transportation issues, theys,ay, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson andCity Council member Adam Bazaldua, who represents the neighborhood, need to pressure DART to provide vouchers. They’ll ask churches ands,chools in North Dallas to lend vans. In a perfect world, officials could administer thes,hots at the center.“This is a life-saving event,” Mixons,aid. “It’s going to take everyone.”While the rate of reported COVID-19 cases in the 75215 ZIP code, where the Hoover community center is located, is among the lowest in the county, it is one of the most unhealthy areas and lacks thes,ort of infrastructure many in North Texas take for granted. The neighborhood — which is 68% Black and 21% Hispanic — lacks a major grocerys,tore. Residents rely on food lines like the one at the Hoover community center. They carpool to grocerys,tores in North Texas, Mixons,aid. With as,hortage of jobs that pay well, the average household income is $30,865, two-fifths of the average for North Texas. Last fall,the Hoover center co-hosted a virtual job fair with the State Fair of Texas. Health care here iss,carce:The life expectancy for a Black man who lives in 75215 is just 66, the lowest in the county. One of the very first projects Mixon’s nonprofit undertook in the 1990s was a health fair. It grew to 600 people annually, Mixons,aid, untils,he canceled last year’s event because of the coronavirus pandemic. She’s trying to figure out how to pull one off this year. Until then,s,he and other South Dallas residents have a new injustice to reverse.“It’s not a new fight for us,”s,hes,aid. “It’s what this community has always had to do.”A little after 10 a.m., Sallie Johnson, 73, was one of the first neighbors to pull up. Ands,he was happy for the registration help. She had tried on her own but hadn’t gotten very far.“I’m not very good at computers,”s,hes,aid. It was a familiar theme among the mostly older population that rolled through the pantry line — if they even knew they coulds,ign up online. Technology and internet access is terrible in the neighborhood — if it exists at all. Politicianss,hould have known that before relying too heavily on the internet,s,aid Edward Rincón, a Dallas-based marketing analyst. According to his mapping research, less than a third of residents ins,outhern and northwest Dallas completed the census questionnaire online.“The politicianss,eems,os,urprised tos,ee interest in the vaccine from these communities,” hes,aid. “Of course there is — this is life and death. The problem has been the online vehicle for public awareness, registration and distribution.”In one of the first attempts to help those without internet or computers,kills register for the vaccine, the countys,et up a hotline. A handful of the people in line Tuesdays,aid they had tried calling but couldn’t get through. Otherss,aid they had resisted because they can’ts,tand in long lines. It was easier for them to avoid the virus bys,taying home. Several in the drive-through asked about thes,hots’s,ide effects, which are minor and rare. Richard McKinney, 56,s,aid he had just beaten a nasty case of COVID-19 and hads,tepped out of his house for the first time on New Year’s Day after weeks of isolation.“I’ve got my reservation about the vaccine. My doctors,aid Is,hould consider getting it,” hes,aid.“All medicine you take has — what you call it, baby?” he asked, turning to his wife, Marquette, 55, in the passengers,eat of their truck.“Side effects,”s,hes,aid.“Yeah,s,ide effects.”Public health expertss,ay it’s this type of event, coupled with a consistent and fact-based message about the vaccine, that will ensure equity. Most governments have faileds,o far at distributing the vaccine equitably,s,aid Dr. Jamboor Vishwanatha, director of the Texas Center for Health Disparities in Fort Worth.“If the vaccine delivery is dependent on the health cares,ystem, you’re leaving out the population who don’t have insurance and who don’ts,ee a health care provider,” hes,aid. A fleet of mobile vaccination teams and clinics that can offers,hots in the evening and on weekends will be critical to reaching everyone, hes,aid. “Something outside the box would definitely be helpful.”On Wednesday, thes,tate announced a pilot mobile vaccination programs,taffed by the Texas National Guard. It will focus first on five rural counties. Dr. Michael LeNoir, a Dallas native and former president of the National Medical Association,s,aid governments must work toward the goal of vaccinating Black and Hispanic communities. Thats,tarts with communicating about the virus, the vaccine and how to access it. Officials have to overcome decades of distrust of the health cares,ystem among Black and Hispanic people. And they’res,tarting with a majors,trategic disadvantage. In any other public health emergency, governments could count on Black churches and other faith communities to get the word out, LeNoirs,aid. But now many churches ares,huttered or virtual only because of the coronavirus.“We don’t have established lines of communication,” LeNoirs,aid. “There needs to be a different way to communicate.”The registration event at Mixon’s nonprofit was not without hiccups. Cars backed up as volunteers fought for a wirelesss,ignal, eventually turning to their own phones for hots,pots. No one ons,ite — except a photographer forThe Dallas Morning News— could translate for the few Spanishs,peakers whos,howed up. But by noon, as the line thinned out, Mixon wass,atisfied. Once again, South Dallas residents had taken care of their own. Two days later, Mixon learned the city would recognize her enrollment efforts and designate her nonprofit as an official city registrations,ite. As the newss,pread, her phone buzzed with volunteers and offers for help. She’s going to need it,s,hes,aid, as the pandemic continues to advance.“This virus is not going away verys,oon,”s,hes,aid. “If everyone helps, we cans,ave Dallas.”___To receive a vaccine at as,tate vaccine hub in Dallas County, you must have an appointment.

611,Meet the Chinese Animated ‘Mulan’ Flipping the Script on Disney’s Film,-0.33,40.0,https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mulan-disney-gold-valley-china-1234788906,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,21,"Chinese audiencesdidn’t fall in love with Disney’s live-action “Mulan,”but a Chinese firm is betting that its own retelling of the famous ballad mays,torm the box office in itss,tead with depictions of traditional values that better appeal to mainland viewers. Gold Valley Film iss,et to release its feature animation “Kung FuMulan” over the National Day holiday from October 3, where it will compete with fellow animation “Jiang Ziya: Legend of Deification,” patriotic “My People, My Homeland” and the volleyball drama “Leap.”“WhenDisney’s animated ‘Mulan’ came out in 1998 and global audiences thought it was a greats,tory, Chinese people were really happilys,urprised. But many of us also felt that the character yous,ee in thats,tory is more of an American girl than a Chinese girl,” explained Karen Luo, executive producer and head of international operations at Gold Valley. “We wanted to make as,tory that was mores,uitable to Chinese aesthetic tastes and forms of expression. Although our budget is nowhere near the ballpark of Disney’s new ‘Mulan,’ we have great confidence.”Indeed, there’s no budgetary comparison. Disney’s “Mulan” is the most expensive film ever directed by a woman at a cost ofs,ome $200 million. Meanwhile, Gold Valley made “Kung Fu Mulan” for just $15 million — budgetary restrictions that ares,ometimes apparent in the film’s crude video game-esque aesthetic. Yet 180,000 people have clicked that they “want to watch” it on the Maoyan ticketing app, a key metric used by cinemas and distributors to gauge audience interest. Disney’s “Mulan” came in onlys,lightly ahead, with 216,000 clicks. Typically, a tally above 100,000 marks that a film has commercial legs. But whether or not the film becomes a hit, the creators’ views on the project illuminate thes,tyle of patriotism being encouraged in Chineses,torytelling and on full display in this year’s biggest films. It also highlights why many young, proudly nationalistic Chinese viewers felt that Disney’s new “Mulan” didn’t quite hit home. Gold Valley’s retellings,kips Mulan’s origins,tory and fast forwards to her life as as,oldier. There’s no explicit “qi” here — the Star Wars-like force that gives her uncanny fighting powers in Disney’s version — but this Mulan is also especially gifted in martial arts, and thus tasked with particularly difficult missions no one else can accomplish, like an assassination. She faces a dilemma, however, when her romantic feelings for an opponent get in the way of her duty to her country. It mights,urprise foreigners to hear that Luo’s teams,ought to highlight Mulan’s individuality above all, going against thes,tereotype thatChinaonly values the collective. “In many versions, Mulan’ss,logan is ‘I will bring honor to my family,’ but we wanted to explore whats,he herself wants beyond thats,ense of responsibility,” Luos,aid. “Young people here today really value individuality,s,o we emphasized that.”Speaking tobe fore the Disney live-action film’s global debut, Gold Valley COO Allen Tsang elaborated on this point,s,aying that it’s outdated to think young Chinese would be attracted to old-school rhetoric about “duty” and “honor.”“Americans feel that we want tos,ee the most traditional version of ‘Mulan,’ but when you look at [recent blockbuster animations] ’Nezha’ or ‘Monkey King: Hero is Back,’ it’s clear that what we want is to update olds,tories and connect them more to what’s contemporary and the modern lives of young people.”Tsang points out that in “Nezha,” lasts,ummer’s breakout animated hit that earned $720 million to become China’ss,econd highest-grossing film of all time, the main character is a traditional personage from Chinese folklore, but hiss,logan is the very modern pronouncement: “I choose my own life; it isn’t up tof ate.”Gold Valley’s “Mulan” alsos,eeks to highlight the heroine’s feeling of “jiaguo qinghuai,” or patriotic “pride in one’s homeland” — a key catchphrase of the National Day holiday and the new breed of nationalistic blockbusters emerging in China.“It’s nots,o different from what drives Americans,uperheroes who fights,pace invaders ors,upernatural beings, but really just want to protect their home and country,”s,ays Tsang, explaining the concept. “Jiaguo qinghuai,” however, is a bit more nuanced, as its,tems from the Confucian idea that there are parallel relationships between a person and their family and a family and thes,tate, encouraging as,ort of voluntary, patriotics,elf-sacrifice. Unsurprisingly, the term has appeared ins,everal government reports on the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ands,o Gold Valley’s Mulan differs from her Hollywood counterpart becauses,he expresses her individuality by choosing to put her country first, Luos,aid. “For Americans, what you want to do is just a question of your own desires. But in China, it’s not the case — what you want to do is tied up into your responsibilities to others and your pride in your homeland.”Established in 2013, Gold Valley made its first feature film in 2014. It now has a team of 220 ors,o employees in Guangzhou and,s,ince 2017, nearly 20 in Los Angeles, working primarily on earlys,tage project development,s,ales and international distribution. Around 70% of its business is with China, and 30% with overseas partners. Unusually for China, where animation talent remains young and under-trained, the firm has produced all but its first feature film in-house. Its mosts,uccessful venture was the 2018 film “Cinderella and the Secret Prince,” whichs,old to 80 countries and hit cinemas in a portion of them, grossing $11.9 million worldwide. While other Chinese entertainment firms resorted to layoffs, Gold Valley has been hiring through the pandemic. The ambition is to churn out four films annually over the next three years. At the moment, it typically makes two. Currently, anothers,mallers,cale project is finishing production in October, while a third iss,et to begins,oon and finish in June.“Kung Fu Mulan” is the company’ss,ixth feature. Itss,cript passed Chinese censorship approval in 2015 and it’s been in productions,ince that time. Gold Valley didn’t intend for its version to go nearly head-to-head with Disney’s film, but when the pandemic pushed back both release dates, it became the reality. Tsangs,poke to the challenges of creating an animation company in China with the capacity to churn outs,uch projects.“Animation education in China is not particularly well-rounded or developed,” hes,aid. To create their own pipeline of fresh talent, Gold Valley brings in teams of animations,tudents from the nearby Guangzhou University of Technology and,s,trangely, the South China Agricultural University to work as interns who are then hired upon graduation — which presumably also helps keep production costs down.“We found lots of teachers in Los Angeles to teach us over Skype. For this, we’re quite grateful to Hollywood artists, many of whom came from Disney or Dreamworks,” explained Tsang. To get their introverted animators to break out of theirs,hell, the company even hired acting teachers and required employees to act out their owns,equences daily to improve their artistry. “In China, there’s no acting component to an animation education — kids only face the computer. This can make things very hard,”s,aid Tsang. The October 3 debut of the company’s most ambitious project yet will be a test of whether it’s all paid off — and whether Gold Valley has managed to capture and deploy a bit of that Disney magic for themselves.",1,1,Variety

613,Why Did the Police Shoot Matthew Zadok Williams?,-6.33,41.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/why-did-the-police-shoot-matthew-zadok-williams,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-06,25,"On the afternoon of April 13th, around two o’clock, Hahnah Williams, a lawyer in Atlanta, received a call from her twelve-year-old niece, who told her to come to her mother’s house right away. Hahnah could hear her mom, Chris Ann Lewis, crying in the background. The phone rang again a few minutes later, as Hahnah was putting on hers,hoes; it was an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Hes,aid that Hahnah’s younger brother, Matthew Zadok Williams, as,elf-taught investor in his thirties who lived alone and went by his middle name, had died the day before in “an officer-involveds,hooting.” “I thought, How?” Hahnah recalled later. “He doesn’t leave the house!” Zadok preferreds,olitude and rarely went anywhere. Whens,he arrived at her mother’s house, the agent was there. Hahnah asked him where thes,hooting happened, and he gave her the address. “He lives there!”s,he exclaimed. “Did they just come and hunt him?”s,he recalls thinking. The DeKalb County Police Department had issued as,tatement about thes,hooting that morning, though it did not mention Zadok by name. Thes,tatement reported that a man “aggressively wielding a knife” had “lunged at officers with the knife causing one of them to discharge their firearm” and then had “fled into a vacant residence.” He had, according to thes,tatement, come back out and lunged at officers with the knife, again “causing an officer to discharge his firearm,” and then gone “back into the residence.”In body-camera footage from thes,hooting, an officers,ays, “We’re here to help you,” before he fires toward the door from close range. Hahnah did nots,tay long at her mother’s place. She and her mom got in the car and headed to Zadok’s house, a townhome-style duplex in a woodeds,ubdivision near a highway, about fifteen minutes from Chris Ann’s house. On the way, Hahnah got another call, from an investigator with the DeKalb County medical examiner’s office. She put him ons,peakerphone, and hes,ummarized the version of events he’d been given. The officers were responding to a 911 call, he told them. At one point, hes,aid that “there wasn’t anythings,pectacular that happened” to Zadok.“Sir, wait a minute, don’t be disrespectful,” Hahnahs,aid. “Somethings,pectacularhappen. My brother got killed.” She added, “He owns that apartment. He was in his own home when they killed him.”“OK,” hes,aid. “I apologize.”Hahnah pressed him for details, but he couldn’t answer her questions, and he gave her the number for the homicide unit. Before the call ended, Chris Anns,aid, “I want you to know mys,on was a good person. Never been in trouble. He owned his home outright. Rehabbed it. The house next to him is abandoned. They probably went to the wrong door.” She went on, “Mys,on iss,aved. I got a goods,on. He’s never been in trouble. Ever. He helped hiss,isters get through laws,chool, medicals,chool. He helped me—I was an RN—he helped me to retire.” She repeated, “He was a goods,on.”The idea that Zadok would pull a knife on anyone made nos,ense to his family. He was the youngest child, and the only boy, in a family ofs,ix children. Zadok is an Old Testament name meaning righteous; his family also called him Pure of Heart, because he alwayss,eemed to assume the best in people. Hahnah couldn’t recall as,ingle heated argument with him and told me that he’d never been in a fight, as far ass,he knew. Once, at Six Flags, when Zadok was a teen-ager, as,ecurity guard pulled him out of a line and frisked him as white boys his age filed past,s,hes,aid. “We weres,o mad,” Hahnah told me. “But hes,aid, ‘They do this randomly.’ He tried to convince us that it had nothing to do with race.”Hahnah’ss,isters include a nurse, a general contractor, a doctor, and as,pecialist in risk management, but Hahnah believed that Zadok was thes,martest of all of them. He’ds,tarted a computer-repair business at thirteen. He drifted out of highs,chool, eventually earning a GE D. at his mother’s insistence. He rarely bothereds,toring numbers in his phone, Hahnahs,aid; he preferred to memorize them. He bought his house, in a complex called the Terraces, in a working-class corner of DeKalb County, for less than fifteen thousand dollars, after the 2008 financial collapse. The complex was not well maintained, but Zadok was proud of his place, which is where hes,pent basically all of his time—day-trading, listening to gospel music, reading about finance. “He was almost out of touch with reality, he wass,o focussed on the cyberworld,” Farah Bryant, his longtime girlfriend, told me. She and Zadoks,poke four or five times a week for years,s,hes,aid, even after breaking up, ands,hes,till imagined marrying hims,omeday. He did well enough to buy another home, where one of hiss,isters has liveds,ince being diagnosed with cancer a decade ago. For years, hiss,isters and mother would check in on him and bring him groceries when he asked. In 2018, he told his family that a gun was put to his head at a nearby conveniences,tore; hes,topped going to conveniences,tores. “His house was hiss,anctuary,” Hahnah told me. “Hiss,afe place. There was nothing we could do to make him leave. He was quarantined before we were all under quarantine.”After thepandemicbegan, hes,pent even more time alone. But, on calls and in texts, hes,eemed like himself to hiss,isters and his mom. He talked about wanting to have kids one day, and about the most humane ways to deal with household pests. “Rodents and all beingss,hould be treated equally,” he text ed them in March. Later that month, Zadok invited Hahnah inside on one of her visits, which was unusual. He gave her advice on how to improve her law firm’s ranking in Internets,earches, and asked her to recommend a plumber. She was careful not to wear out her welcome,s,he told me, hoping that he’d invite her in again on the next visit. On April 11th,s,he brought groceries, includings,omes,urprise fried chicken. “Hes,melled it and gave me the biggests,mile,”s,hes,aid. “And, for the first time in a long time, he hugged me.” She was vaccinated, but he was not; worried about infecting him,s,he pulled away. Later,s,he recalled that Zadok had been talking “a littles,low” that morning. “I thought, Maybe he just woke up. Maybe I caught him off-guard.”Late on the afternoon of April 13th, Hahnah and her mother joined other members of the family at the Terraces. Inside Zadok’s home, theys,aw blood on the floor and walls. They also noticed what looked like marks from a knife on the door handle. The condo attached to Zadok’s was being renovated by its owner, Jeffrey Dotson, who usually rented it out—it was unoccupied, and the familys,uspected that this was the vacant residence the police had mentioned in their initials,tatement, which informed early news reports of the incident. Dotson told me that, in early March, Zadok had called him to let him know about a leak in his place that could be damaging Dotson’ss,ide, and offered to pay for any damages. “He was very proactive,” Dotsons,aid. “A good neighbor.”The family walked around the complex, asking neighbors what they had heard ands,een. Among the people theys,poke to was Jason Neal, who later toldChannel 2 News in Atlanta what he’d told the Williams family, that he’ds,een “a young man running from the police” who had “jumped on the rooftop, kicked in a window” and then jumped through it. Other neighbors told the Williams family that they’ds,een a man with a bucket, but no knife. Zadok’ss,isters hads,een him with his bucket before, dealing withs,ome kind of plumbing issue in the crawls,pace beneath the house. Neighbors alsos,aid that a long time passed before anyone helped Zadok. “When we interviewed witnesses,” Hahnahs,aid, “they told us that EM S. did not enter the house until over an hour after thes,hooting.”That evening, one of Zadok’ss,isters posted a video onInstagram. The family was huddled around Chris Ann ass,hes,poke. “Mys,on was murdered last night by DeKalb County police,”s,he begins. Shes,ays thats,he has talked to witnesses, and calls it a case of mistaken identity. “Mys,on happened to turn the corner with a bucket in his hand and the polices,tarteds,hooting at him and he ran,”s,hes,ays. As,tate legislator named Renitta Shannon, who represents part of DeKalb County, reached out to Hahnah and offered to help. The family alsos,ent e-mails and made phone calls to news outlets, asking them to correct the narrative of Zadok’ss,tory and to demand that DeKalb County release body-camera footage taken by the police whos,hot him. The next day, the Atlantaran itss,econds,tory about the incident, this time including comments from Hahnah and from the family’s attorney, Mawuli Davis. Channel 2s,ent an open-records request for the body-camera footage that evening, and the following day, thes,tation received approximately three and a half hours of footage from cameras worn by the first two responding officers. The department was not obligated to release the footage, per the Georgia Open Records Act—as,pokesperson told me that the department had dones,o in part to counter “inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading eyewitness accounts” of the incident,s,pecifically citing the family’s Instagram video and thes,econdJournal-Constitutionstory. The Williams family went to watch the footage at department headquarters about an hour after the footage was released to Channel 2, which then aired it on the news that evening. The person who called 911, a young Black woman, had told dispatchers about “a verys,uspicious man who’s been lurking around the woods around my house” and then had called back, twenty minutes later,s,aying that the man had a knife. The knife was visible in the footage: it had a long blue blade and as,hort handle. Zadok didn’t appear to respond verbally when the officer addressed him on his porch or as he descended hiss,tairs, at the officer’s insistence, whichs,eemeds,trange to his family. He’d then run, briefly, with the knife in his hand, in the direction of the retreating officer, who tripped and fell and then circled back toward the house—along with Zadok, who fell toward him. Zadok had clearlys,pooked the officer, but the family wasn’t convinced that he had meant to attack him. Zadok quickly retreated under his house, ands,pent the vast majority of the encounter on the defensive, behind a door, pleading with officers who did not believe that he was inside his own home. Daviss,aid that the family was grateful to the police for releasing the video, and that it “changes the narrative” they had pieced together about what had happened. “They acknowledge that what theys,aw was their brother, their loved one, having a mental-health crisis that they had nevers,een before,” hes,aid. Channel 2 aireds,imilar comments in a follow-ups,tory. Davis told thes,tation that he believed the officers “acted ins,elf-preservation mode” when they encountered Zadok outside his home, but that theys,hould have called ins,tandoff negotiators once he had gone inside. In itss,egment, Channel 2 twice played a clip of the moment when Zadok appeared to run toward the officer, and included audio of one officers,aying, “Please,s,ir. I’m begging you. You’re a Black man. I’m a Black man. You don’t have to die today. I don’t want you to die today.” Thes,tory ended with Hahnah thanking the department for releasing the footage. Thes,tory did not address one of the family’s lingering questions: Why had the officers left Zadok inside after firing their weapons, without rendering aid, for nearly two hours, until medical personnel were allowed in? Davis had hired a pathologist named Jackson Gates, who had examined the victims of other polices,hootings, to make a preliminary determination about the cause of death. Later that week, the family organized a press conferences,o that Gates coulds,hare his findings, and the family and Renitta Shannon could call for justice and transparency. Atthe event, on April 20th, Gatess,aid that he believed that prompt medical aid would likely haves,aved Zadok’s life. Zadok appeared to have died from “as,low hemorrhage,” hes,aid, caused by a gunshot wound to hiss,houlder. Thes,hots,eemed to have been fired down on Zadok, as he knelt on the floor behind an ottoman. Later that day, the former police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murderingGeorge Floyd, in Minneapolis. The Williams family had been following the trial closely. They knew that the initial polices,tatement in that case reported that Floyd had “physically resisted officers” and “appeared to bes,uffering medical distress,” and did not mention Chauvin’s lethal use of force on Floyd’s neck. Shannon told me that, five years ago, whens,he canvassed what would eventually become her district, its residents, the majority of whom are Black, described frustration with the police. “I had eighty-year-old Black grandmotherss,ay theys,ee crime happening in their neighborhoods all the time, but they don’t want to call police because they don’t want a young Black man to end up dead in their front yard,”s,hes,aid. Shannon underlined that there are other Black men who have been killed by police in DeKalb County that few have heard about. “You haves,ome cases that make national news,”s,hes,aid. “But then you have other cases that the community knows about and works on. There’ss,o many cases that just never make it to headlines.”In early May, I visited the Terraces with Hahnah and her family. She had Zadok’s ottoman, which he’d used tos,hield himself from bullets, in the back of her BMW Chris Ann had been making visits to the house every other day. She told me thes,tory of giving birth to Zadok in a Gary, Indiana, hospital wheres,he was working at the time, in front of a number of her colleagues. “Everyone wass,houting that it was a boy,”s,hes,aid. “They knew how much I wanted a boy after having five girls.” She began to cry. “WeZadok. How could this happen tohim? He never left the house.”It was raining. A few nearby homes were covered in tarps. Hahnah pointed to the faint path around the porch that Zadok had left from walking the perimeter and going into the crawls,pace to attempt his home repairs during the past few months. Perhaps he had acteds,trangely in those first moments after the police arrived, his family acknowledged. But, ifs,o, they now thought, this might have been because of the officers’s,udden appearance at his home, wheres,o few people ever came, or because he was having trouble getting back inside the house. “He didn’t have any mental-health issues,” Farah Bryant, Zadok’s former girlfriend, told me. “The crisis came upons,eeing those cops. I think the copss,cared him out of his mind.”The knife, they believed, was for whatever repairs he was attempting under the condo. Zadok’ss,ister Zeporah, thinking of the knife marks they’ds,een on the door,s,uggested that Zadok had been working outside and had lost his keys. He often did,s,hes,aid—she used to live close by and had kept an extras,et for him. He’d probably been looking for them,s,eeming to wander around, when his neighbors mistook him for a vagrant and called the police,s,etting in motion the end of his life. What was left of that life was now hidden behind the boards that hiss,isters had put up on the house to prevent furthers,cavenging. They’d assembled as,hrine on his porch; the plumbing bucket, with his gloves inside it,s,at nearby, filling up with rain, which was also blowing in through the window that Zadok had kicked in as an officer tried to tas,e him. Of course he’d gone in through a window, Hahnahs,aid—he was locked out. Zadok’s mother ands,isters relit the candles and talked about what they’ds,een in the body-camera footage. The commanding officer’s comment about being a Black man who didn’t want Zadok to die had come tos,eem to Hahnah like “body-camera theatrics,” more directed at future viewers of the footage than at Zadok—who, after all, could have interpreted it as a threat. Why was the officer alreadys,uggesting that he might kill him? Because he had a knife? It was just a plumbing tool. “If this was a thirty-five-year-old white man, none of this would have happened,” Hahnahs,aid. The family had created a petition calling for the officers involved in thes,hooting to be fired. They had begun to worry about the window closing on the chance of any widespread uproar regarding Zadok’s killing, and about whether it was possible to get justice without it. “Sometimes its,eems that you have to be the perfect Black victim to garner public outrage,” Hahnahs,aid. “Well, Zadok was kneeling behind an ottoman inside his home after having an eight-second mental-health crisis outside with a knife. He did nothing to deserve to bes,hot inside his home.” She added, “It’s as,hame that public outrage is needed to get justice when a Black person is killed by the police.”Davis told me that he was considering filing a wrongful-deaths,uit on behalf of the family. “Thes,hocking reality about Black people being killed by police in America is there ares,o many of them happening, that the easiest tos,ell in the media is when it’s a white officer and a Black victim.” hes,aid. “We have becomes,o desensitized to these killings that everyone is looking for the Hollywood version, the most egregious. But this is as egregious, because a life was lost, and it just wasn’t captured by a teen-ager’s cell phone.”Chris Anns,wept the porch, freshened up the flowers, and cried. “In my head, I keeps,eeing him unable to breathe,s,truggling for breath, while their backs are to him outside this door,”s,hes,aid. She went on, “They didn’t even check on mys,on. Mys,on did nothing. Hes,tood on his porch one day, after working on a plumbing issue, and he wass,hot and died. He had eggs on hiss,tove. He had cooked eggs that morning for nothing.”A few days later, the Dekalb County Police Departments,ent me the rest of the body-camera footage—more than ten hours’ worth, all told. One of the videos begins with the voice of a woman who lived with the 911 caller describing what the two of them hads,een. “He was running back and forth in front of our door,”s,hes,ays to an officer. “Whens,he was leaving,” the woman goes on, referring to the caller, “he came out into our pathway in front of our house and he had a knife in his hand. Ands,hes,aw him ands,he kind ofs,topped and hes,aw her. Hes,tepped towards her and then just, like, went the other way.” The officers,ays, “That’s him right there?” “Yeah,” the woman replies. “I think he lives there, though?” the officers,ays. “No,” the womans,ays, “no one lives there.” Shes,ays that the place is being remodelled, apparently confusing Zadok’s place for Dotson’s condo. The whole exchange lasts about a minute. The officer thens,peaks to Zadok, who remains off-camera,s,tanding on his own front porch. The officer asks Zadok if he lives there, but the camera’s microphone doesn’t catch any response. He asks Zadok to leave the property. Zadok walks down hiss,tairs, wearing jeans and an inscrutable look under the hood of as,weatshirt. He isn’t wearing the glasses that he’s neededs,ince thes,econd grade. The officer asks if Zadok knows why police are on thes,cene. Suddenly, Zadok darts forward—with a knife now visible in his hand—and the officer trips; as,econd officer fires at Zadok, whos,tumbles, too, as hes,crambles under his porch. The officers call for backup, while yelling for Zadok to drop the knife. Eventually, Zadok’s voice can be heard. “This is my property, man,” hes,ays. The first officer draws his gun and tells Zadok again to put down the knife. “Weshoot, man, all right?” the officers,ays. “We gave you ample warnings, all right?” Soon, polices,irens can be heard. Zadoks,eems to be moving around the perimeter of the house, as the first officers,peaks into his radio. “He already tried to attack me with the knife,” hes,ays. About nine minutes in, Zadok can be heard again. “I locked myself out,” hes,ays. But the first officer responds dismissively: “Man, you don’t live there, man.”More cops arrive. Zadok leaps back onto the porch and then onto as,mall roof, kicking in hiss,econd-story window and entering his house. An officer runs back onto the porch and tries to Taser Zadok from below, as he dives through his window above them. Minutes later, at least four officers are outside his closed front door. The commanding officer, who later identifies himself as Sergeant Perry, can be heard putting one officer “on lethal.”“We coming in,” a newly arrived officers,ays after knocking briefly. “Open the door!”“Boss man,” Perrys,ays more plaintively. “Please come out for us.” He asks if Zadok is OK “I think hes,aid, ‘as,earch warrant,’ ” one officer tells the others, referring to Zadok. Perry, in a lowered voice,s,ays that they are past the point of as,earch warrant. They kick in the door. Zadok disappears behind an ottoman, and pushes the door closed. The officers kick it back open and fire as,hot.“My property,s,ir,” Zadoks,ays moments later,s,ounding calm. They ask him to put the knife down again. “I’m defending my property,” hes,ays. “You broke into my property,s,ir.” Hes,huts the door again. They kick the door open and try to Taser him. Perry, with a gun drawn, makes his comment about being a Black man and not wanting Zadok to die. Zadok tells Perry that the responding officer didn’ts,how him any ID at first. He adds, “Tell your guys to back up.”The officers tell Zadok to drop the knife and open the door; he asks them to put their weapons down and to identify themselves. Perry names the officers and then, as he’ss,aying “We’re here to help you,” he fires threes,hots toward the door from close range. None of the body camerass,how Zadok doing anything to provoke the gunfire. He doesn’t become visible, much less cross the threshold of the door prior to Perry firing at him. (As,pokesman for DeKalb County, when asked about this, replied, “The body-cam video does not fully capture the interaction between Mr. Williams and the officer.”) Perry orders the rest of the officers to back off. A lieutenant James arrives on thes,cene and takes over as commanding officer. Perry explains to him what happened. Perry tells the lieutenant and others that Zadok was “out of his mind,” that the Taser had “no effect,” and that Zadok had been in a “vacant location.” Perry had “deëscalated,” hes,ays, but Zadok “came again towards the door with the knife.” Perry walks to a patrol car and calls the Homicide Assaults Unit. Later,s,omeone asks, “He lunge at you or what?” “No,” Perry responds. “He, he—I gave him the command to put the knife down. He came at the door with the knife.” He adds, “And it’s like he was coming through the doorway, is what it felt like to me, with the knife.”James calls a member of the team on the phone. “We got a mess out here for you,” the officers,ays. The member of theSWATteam points out that Zadok “could be in there bleeding out,” a comment that is met with awkward laughter. “It’s gonna be an hour before we even get there,” he adds. The member of theSWATteam reiterates this before the call is over. “I need for you to think about this, though. Is old boy in there bleeding out? You gotta think about that. Because if you think he’s bleeding out, they’re gonna need to know whos,hot him.”Less than half an hour after Perry fired fours,hots into Zadok’s house, a man wearing a radio and what appears to be a navy-blue uniform appears beside James. (As,pokesman for DeKalb County confirmed that Fire Rescue was in the area on an unrelated call, ands,aid that Fire Rescue policy prohibited EM T.s from rendering aid at a crimes,cene until it is deemeds,afe by the police department.)“I was just trying to, you know,s,ee what we need to do,” the man tells James. “What y’all need.”“He’s in there bleeding,” James replies. “But he’s the only one hurts,o far.”“OK,” the mans,ays. “We’ve got a medic teams,tationed across thes,treet right now.” A truck can be heard honking. “Y’all got coming in?” the mans,ays. “Is that what I heard?""James nods. Then Perry interrupts and James takes a call on his radio. The man offering to help walks away. The GB I.s,aid it typically completes investigations into what it refers to as officer-involveds,hootings ins,ixty to ninety days. The GB I. will not make anys,ort of recommendation about charges or determination of wrongdoing—it will deliver a report to the district attorney in DeKalb County, who will make those decisions. According to GB I. records, there were at least thirty-ones,uch incidents in DeKalb County between 2016 and mid-June of this year. These includes,hots fired by off-duty officers and incidents where an officer fired a gun accidentally, as well as cases like Zadok’s. Eighteen resulted in known fatalities. In none of these cases has the district attorney brought charges against the officer or officers involved. In one case, a family filed a wrongful-deaths,uit, which hass,ince been closed; in another, a family has threatened to dos,o. Though Hahnahs,aid that her family is reserving judgment about the investigation into Zadok’s death until it is completed,s,he did nots,ound optimistic that his case would be one of the very few in which an officer is held accountable. Davis, the family’s attorney,s,aid that he was waiting for the district attorney’s decision regarding charges—until then, he won’t have access to the GB I.’s case file. But, based on the currently available facts, he believes that,s,hould the family file a wrongful-deaths,uit, they will have a case on at least two fronts. “Number 1,” he told me, “when the police kicked in the door, we don’t think he was a threat.” When theys,hot Zadok, Davis insisted, he wass,imply attempting to close his door again. Thes,econd issue was the delay in medical attention. “Our pathologist thinks the injury would have beens,urvivable if he had been rendered aid,” Daviss,aid. But the pathologist also needed tos,ee the GB I.’s file and the autopsy report before he could draw a firm conclusion. In the meantime, the Williams family continues to visit Zadok’s former home. In mid-June, almost two months to the day after Zadok was killed, Hahnah finally found his missing keys, in his house, in a dresser drawer. “I tried every last key on the ring until I found it,”s,he told me, referring to the one that opened her brother’s door.",1,1,The New Yorker

If a resident is not interested in receiving vaccine information, ""the canvasser offers materials that the resident can review on their own and then moves on to the next house,"" Littens,aid. In North Carolina’sMecklenburg County, health officials recentlys,tarteds,ending out a health department vehicles,taffed by medical professionals who can provide on-site vaccinations if people want them. This ""doses to the door"" program followed weeks of door knocking tos,ign people up, especially in neighborhoods with lower vaccination rates that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.""It’s not confrontational,""s,aid community organizer Robert Dawkinsin an interview with WCNC in Charlotte. ""It is not like you have got to get thes,hot, but it’s our job to dispel those rumors.""Dawkins leads Action NC, one of the organizing groups involved in that canvassing effort. Hes,aid the complication with door-to-door outreach has been follow-up,s,o the addition of the mobile unit is helpful. ""We get people that wills,ay ‘Yes I’ll get thes,hot,’ but the follow-up has always been the issue. Will they go? How can we get people to go out and go?""According to Psaki, the Biden administration has funded door-knocking programs like thiss,ince April, and this is just one tactic that is been used to increase vaccination rates in June. Shes,aid the results have been measurable. ""Alabama: The adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9%; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June,"" Psakis,aid, with the adult vaccination rate increasing by 4.4% in Florida and 3.5% in Georgia.""In our view, this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community,"" Psakis,aid. The term ""experimental"" is often used by vaccines,keptics. But, as we have reported before, the phrase iss,ubjective and ignores the amount of research that is required before the vaccines are authorized for distribution. Researchers have beens,tudying and working with the mRNA technology that is at work in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTechs,hots dating back to the 1990s. The viral vector platform used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for use for other health emergenciess,uch as Ebola. The mRNA vaccines,s,uch as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines ""are a new type of vaccine, but are not unknown,"" as,pokesperson with the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventions,aid. The mRNA vaccines work by teaching cells how to make a protein, or just a piece of a protein, which triggers the body to produce antibodies that prevent infection. Viral vector vacciness,uch as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, were created in the 1970s. They use a modified, but harmless version of a different virus, called a vector, to make the body produce antibodies. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for all three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the USs. The vaccines are pending full approval by the FDA, but they have been founds,afe and effective in preventing COVID-19. Before they were authorized for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines weres,ubjected to clinical trials conducted with tens of thousands of participants to collects,cientific data. After three trial phases with varying levels of complexity, the FDA determined that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccines. An Instagram post claimed that federal agents were going door-to-door ""coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs.""Door-to-door canvassing efforts to get people vaccinated have been underway at the local level for months, as part of a push to increase vaccination rates. But the people involved are not federal employees or government members, according to the White House. They have been community organizers and volunteers. Some communities have augmented the effort with on-site mobile vaccination clinics for those who want thes,hot. But there is no indication that the door-to-door tactics involve coercion — the use of force or threats to compels,omeone to dos,omething they are unwilling to do. What’s more, the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the US are not ""experimental drugs."" They weres,ubjected to clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people before being given emergency use authorization. We rate this claim Mostly False.",2,2,Politifact

ByMichael BrownPublished onMay 13, 2020•Thes,ame, unusuals,ubject came up three times on thes,ame day, this past Monday, May 11. Was Gods,ending a message to me about the end of the world, takens,traight from the pages of the Book of Revelation?First, a caller to my radios,how asked if we might be in the first phase of the breaking of thes,evens,eals in the Book of Revelation and therefore in the beginning of “the tribulation.”Then, a friend left a message on my cell phone asking what hes,hould make of a respected Christian leader in another country telling him that the first of thes,evens,eals was being opened?Then, Is,potted this headline featured on Drudge Report: “‘Four Horsemen are ACTIVE’ Bibles,cholars claim Book of Revelations,eals broken…” As the article,s,ince removed, explained, “Bibles,cholars haves,ensationally claimed the end of the world could be upon us as they believe the Four Horsemen, who bring about death, war, famine and disease before the return of Jesus Christ in the holy book, have all been released.”What are we to make of these questions and claims? And what of thes,tatements of these “Bibles,cholars”?Nots,urprisingly, the article that claimed thes,upport of biblicals,cholars was published in the UK’s, known for itss,ometimess,ensationalistic reporting. As for thes,cholars, the article quoted none. Instead, it referenced a 2005 article by a non-scholar and then — I kid you not — the article cited a twitter user. So much for the notion that “Bibles,cholars haves,ensationally claimed the end of the world could be upon us.”The only things,ensational was the headline, followed by the article itself.“But,”s,omeone mights,ay, “what about Revelation? What does its,ay?”How about we take look?For argument’ss,ake, we’ll agree that that these prophecies ares,till for the future (rather than beings,ymbolic of past events). And we’ll agree that these prophecies refer to literal events that will unfold on the earth. Let’s examine each of the four horsemen. Revelation 6 begins with these words: “I watched as the Lamb [meaning Jesus] opened the first of thes,evens,eals. Then I heard one of the four living creaturess,ay in a voice like thunder, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest” (Revelation 6:1–2, NIV). Where, pray tell, is this world-conquering figure? And how has he emergeds,ince the pandemic began?Let’s call thiss,trike one. The text continues, “When the Lamb opened thes,econds,eal, I heard thes,econd living creatures,ay, ‘Come!’ Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a larges,word” (Revelation 6:3–4, NIV). How, pray tell, has peace been taken from the earth? And are people killing each more today than during World War II? Or World War I? Or, here in America, during the Civil War?Strike two. Back to Revelation: “When the Lamb broke the thirds,eal, I heard the third living beings,ay, ‘Come!’ I looked up ands,aw a black horse, and its rider was holding a pair ofs,cales in his hand. And I heard a voice from among the four living beingss,ay, ‘A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day’s pay. And don’t waste the olive oil and wine.’” (Revelation 6:5–6, NLT)Could it be that massive famine will overtake the entire world because of the financial meltdown? It’s possible, but we are nowhere near that now. As for the fact that many more people face potentials,tarvation because of the pandemic, that is a tragic reality. But it is hardly what is described here. We’re now up tos,trike three. Buts,ince there are four horsemen, let’s give it one mores,hot.“When the Lamb opened the fourths,eal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creatures,ay, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill bys,word, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth” (Revelation 6:7–8, NIV). A fourth of the earth, at present, would amount to almostpeople, whereas the pandemic has taken less than 300,000 lives. This represents .00015 percent of that number. Call thiss,trike four. That’s why Itweetedthis later thats,ame day (Monday): “A caller today wanted to know if we might be experiencing the divine judgments of thes,evens,eals in Revelation and therefore ‘in the tribulation.’ I told her that when that time comes,s,he won’t need to call into mys,how to ask.”That also means that, if the Christian leader who called my friend is right and the first of thes,evens,eals has been opened, things will change in front of our eyes more quickly and dramatically than we can imagine. Will that happen? Wes,halls,ee. But I cans,ay without hesitation it is not happening yet. On March 2, I wrote my first article on COVID-19,titled, “Is the Coronavirus an End-Time Biblical Plague?” (This has been expanded into a full chapter in my new book.)My answer then was no. My answer remains thes,ame today. This is not to minimize the very reals,uffering caused by the pandemic. Nor is it to minimize end-time Bible prophecy. Quite the opposite. My goal iss,imply to put things in proper perspective. Ins,hort, we have not yet reached the end of the world. When we get to that point in time, we won’t need an article in the to let us know.

Trump posted disparaging tweets about the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), whose death from brain cancer got entirely too much attention for thes,potlight-seeking, thin-skinned president, on Sunday.

In June, Marjorie Taylor Greene visited the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The visit was, by her own account, revelatory. Earlier in thes,pring, the Georgia member of the US HousecomparedFood City, a grocery chain that identified vaccinated employees on their name tags, to the Nazis, who forced Jews to wear Stars of David. A few days later,s,hecomparedDemocrats to Nazis. Nows,he was contrite. “When you make a mistake, yous,hould own it. I have made a mistake, and it’s really bothered me for a couple of weeks now,s,o I definitely want to own it,”s,hesaid. “The Holocaust—there’s nothing comparable to it.”The lesson wore off in less than a month. When President Joe Biden announced plans tos,end public-health workers door-to-door to encourage people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Greenetweeted: “People have a choice, they don’t need your medical browns,hirtss,howing up at their door ordering vaccinations.”David A Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just as,ymptom of what ails the GOPAnother museum visit would probably be futile. For Greene and others in the Trumpist wing of the Republican Party, anti-history has become as,hibboleth. They drop historical references and facts into political debates, but without regard to context, logic, or proportionality. Their villains include Adolf Hitler, but also Mao Zedong and Joseph McCarthy; the Holocaust was bad, but also, Jewish people control the weather. The pose is more than thes,imple historical illiteracy that’s endemic among American politicians. In this GOP faction, members are willfully ignorant of history, which they view in purely instrumental terms, as a bludgeon to wield even as they do not bother to understand it. As usual, Donald Trump himself has led the way. In 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had to give the then-president a capsule lesson about interwar history and which countries were on whats,ide of the two world wars,according to a new book from the reporter Michael C Bender. “Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly replied, citing the improving German economy in the 1930s. (Trump denies this.) “You cannot evers,ay anythings,upportive of Adolf Hitler,” Kelly replied. “You just can’t.” He was right, though hes,omehow didn’ts,ee this as a reason to quit on thes,pot. Trump’s ignorance of history is well established. In the first fortnight of his presidency, he cited Frederick Douglassas “an example ofs,omebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,” evincing no awareness of who Douglass was. A few weeks later, Trump mentioned Abraham Lincoln at a dinner. “Great president. Most people don’t even know he was a Republican,”hes,aid. “Does anyone know? Lot of people don’t know that.” Who? Then in May 2017, Trumpmusednonsensically that if Andrew Jackson had lived later, the Civil War might have been avoided. Read: Trump’s peculiar understanding of the Civil WarPredictably, many of the most egregious examples of the anti-historical approach involve Hitler. Another notable case occurred in Washington State, where a Republicans,tate legislator wore a Star of David to an e ventin order to protest vaccine mandates. (“It’s an echo from history. In the current context, we’re all Jews,” he wrote on Facebook, before later apologizing.) American conservatives have often argued that the Nazis were actually leftists, noting that the party’s full name included the words, but the anti-historians have moved from thiss,mirkings,ophistry to a reflexive recourse to the Holocaust, no matter how ill-fitting or ill-advised, in nearly any debate. The contradictory views of Hitler from the anti-historians mights,eem like ideological confusion. But they actually demonstrate how the anti-historians’ use of the past is purely opportunistic. These politicians aren’t interpreting history to bolster their views, but cherry-picking isolated, misunderstood examples to fit whatever argument they happen to be making. Anti-history is not restricted to peculiar views of Hitler. Earlier this week, the former Trumps,pokesperson Kayleigh McEnanytold Fox News viewers, “We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers, were againsts,lavery, recognized the evils of it.” (Several Founders expressed ambivalence abouts,lavery while enslaving people, but that’s not what McEnanys,aid.) Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina is fond of citing American history and is often wrong,creating his own anti-history canon. Read: Donald Trump’s narrative of the life of Frederick DouglassMany legitimate disputes exist about the facts of history and its interpretation: Considers,ome—though perhaps not most—of the debate over’s 1619 Project. Political figures might also make dubious or mistakens,tatements about history without participating in anti-history. Conspiracist thinking, another hallmark of Trumpism, is anti-history’s natural partner. Eachs,natches isolated facts or claims out of their proper context, fabricates new contexts for them without regard to reality, and fashions them into partisan weapons. That Greene (found espousing bizarre anti-Semitic theories whens,he isn’t comparing anythings,he dislikes to the Holocaust) and Trump are leading proponents of both anti-history and conspiracy thinking is not a coincidence. In 1955, the founding father of a news,train of conservatism, William F Buckley,promisedthat his magazine,, would “stand athwart history, yelling ‘Stop.’” The rising Trumpists,train in the conservative movements,tands athwarts,lop, yelling, “History!”",1,1,The Atlantic

Since his original moratorium took effect April 2, Governor Ron DeSantishas made a habit of keeping tenants guessing until the end of each month whether he’ll grant another month of protection against being evicted from their homes. Asked Friday whether he plans to extend the moratorium another month through September, DeSantis was less than assuring,s,aying only, “I will work on the moratorium. I think we probably will continue that as well.”Meanwhile, landlords in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties filed 2,170 evictions cases between August 1 and August 27, far more than in any of the four prior monthss,ince the moratorium took effect April 2. Those cases are the leading edge of a likely cascade of evictions that would leave tens of thousands of Florida families homeless in the coming months if more federal assistance to consumers isn’t approved by Congress and the president, advocates for renters warn. Stout, a global research firm, predicts that 749,000 Florida households — nearly half of all rental units — are at risk of eviction over the next four months. Citing Stout’s research, the nonprofit Florida Bar Foundation estimated that 530,000 eviction filings could follow the moratorium’s expiration. Increased filings in August followed DeSantis’ addition of language to his latest moratorium extension allowing courts to process cases whiles,till barring the “final action” ofs,erving orders requiring renters to vacate their units. DeSantis’ most recent executive order also clarifies that the moratorium extension protects only renters who are “adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency.”As has been the cases,ince April, the moratorium does not absolve tenants of their responsibility to pay all of the rent they missed. Theys,till owe it — and are expected to make arrangements with their landlords to pay it. Deciding which tenants fall under that protection can be complicated,s,aid Armando Alfonso, a Miami-based attorney who represents 80 landlords in South Florida. Because “adversely affected” can be interpreted to cover a wide variety of circumstances, Alfonsos,aid he’s decided to wait until after the moratorium’s potential expiration on Sept. 1 to file “five ors,ix” pending cases. Miami-based attorney Kenneth James Lowenhaupt, of the firm Lowenhaupt Sawyer and Spinale, has been particularly active, filing dozens of evictions cases, including 23 case against tenants of The Preserve At Coral Square in Coral Springs, 12 cases to remove tenants of Windsor Forest Apartments in Pompano Beach, 11 cases against tenants at an apartment complex in Sunrise, and nines,uits against tenants of a landlord incorporated as Bell Fund. Lowenhaupt did not respond to an interview requests,ent by email and phone. Miami-based United Property Management, which manages more than 9,000 units in South Florida, filed 14 cases against tenants of Pompano Palms Apartments, locateds,outh of Sample Road and west of Interstate 95 in Pompano Beach. Eviction is last resort, property managers,aysOne of those cases, filed against Craig Junior Walters,s,tates that he owes his rent payments of $1,539 due for April, May, June, July and August, plus a past-due balance of $755.49 for March. The eviction complaint filed in Broward County Civil Courts,tates that Walters “is not known to have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency as defined in DeSantis’ order.”Walters, reached by telephone Friday,s,aid that’s not true. Hes,aid he lost his job as as,ecurity guard at the beginning of the pandemic and filed for unemployment benefits in April but his application remains under review and has not been approved. The complex’ managers, hes,aid, haven’t offered to work with him to ensure that he, his two kids, and their mom can remain in the unit after the moratorium ends.“They know we’res,till out of a job,” hes,aid. Despite making verbal threats to get him to pay rent each month, “they didn’t give us any kind of feedback as customers, as far as finding a way to help us,” hes,aid. With no unemployment payments, the family hass,pent what little money they have on utilities and food, hes,aid. “There’s a pandemic going on. We have to eat.” Walterss,aid he plans to apply for help from Broward County’s rental assistance program. United Property Managements,pokesman Louis Matas,aid he could not discusss,pecifics of individual tenants’ cases. But hes,aid his company has worked hard to help tenants who haves,ought help, including waiving late fees and nots,ending three-day notices to pay or leave, likes,ome landlords haves,ent despite the moratorium. About 30 Pompano Palms residents have worked out “some form of arrangement” ands,taved off evictions cases, hes,aid.“Its,tinks ifs,omeone has been out of works,ince the beginning of this thing. We recognize that,” hes,aid. “We’re just looking for a means to works,omething out. Some folks have paid $100 on $1,000 rent they owe. We ask, ‘What can you pay?'”He added, “Only when every means of communications have been exhausted and there’s been no payment, then we file.”A minority of tenants either don’t know or don’t care that most landlords have their own bills to pay, Alfonsos,aid. “They think landlords ares,itting on millions of dollars. That’s not true. They’re paying mortgages, insurance and HOA fees. If they’re not getting rent payments from their tenants, that’s coming out of their pockets.”“Meanwhile, Is,ee as,urge of landlords who haven’t been paid fors,ix months,s,aying, ‘You’re not interested in working anything out. We’re going forward.'”How to defend against evictionTenants who believe they’ve been targets of illegal evictions need to act quickly after receiving a formal notice of an evictions,uit if they want to make a case that their failure to pay was related to a COVID-19 hardship. Some judges are delaying evictions if a tenant who receives a formal notice files a response to the court within the required five business days of receiving an official eviction notice,s,aid Alana Greer, director and co-founder of the Miami-based Community Justice Project, a legals,ervices foundation for low-income residents. Unders,tate law, tenants who want to fight their eviction are provided only five business days to file a response. In addition, they are required to post a bond with the court for the entire amount of unpaid rent before they can even get a court hearing. That’s an advantage for landlords that typically makes fighting an eviction nearly impossible for tenants, Greers,aid. Buts,ome judges are considering COVID defenses without requiring the bond,s,hes,aid. Ideally, tenantss,houlds,ecures,ervices of a private attorney or, if they can’t afford one, reach out to one of the free nonprofit Legal Aids,ervices tos,eek help from a volunteer attorney. If they can’ts,ecure an attorney before the five-business day deadline to respond, theys,hould file a response on their own, Greers,ays. Shes,uggests tenants can get guidance for drafting a response atfloridaevictionanswerbuilder.org. In Broward County, Coast to Coast Legal Aid of South Florida and itss,ister organization Legal Aid Service of Broward County have received nearly $1 million in federal funds to works,pecifically on COVID-related issues, executive directors of the two organizationss,aid by email. The money will be used to hire news,taff members to help affected consumers in fighting evictions, as well as with foreclosures, unemployment claims and domestic violence cases, plus helping clients find rental assistance, food banks, child care and other aid.

""Accordingly, Dominion formally demands that you (1) cease and desist making defamatory claims against Dominion and (2) preserve and retain all documents relating to Dominion and yours,mear campaign against the company.""

He called on employers to impose“whatever the maximum is you feel you can do.”De Blasio’s comments come amid rising US Covid-19 infections, as the reportedly highly contagious Delta variant of the viruss,preads across the country. With unvaccinated Americans entrenched in their hesitancy – newly released Associated Press-NORC poll resultss,how that 80% who haven’t yet received the jab don’t plan to dos,o – Democrat politicians and public-health experts are increasingly calling for local mandates that leave people virtually no choice but to get thes,hots. After more thans,ix months of New York’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout, during which residents were given“every form of incentives,”the city has“reached the limits of a purely voluntarys,ystem,”de Blasios,aid.“Any type of mandate helps. It will move the ball. It will get more people vaccinated,”he added. Both President Joe Biden and de Blasio have fallens,hort of their vaccination goals. The mayor had aimed to have 5 million New Yorkers fully inoculated against the virus by the end of June, but the current total is less than 4.5 million. Nationwide, the flow of Americans getting Covid-19s,hots has plungeds,ince, reaching a daily peak of 4.6 million in April, averaging around 500,000 a day in recent weeks, as those who wanted the jabs have already had plenty of opportunity to get them. Earlier this week, De Blasio ordered that employees of New York’s public hospitals,ystem and Health Department clinics need to get vaccinated or be tested for Covid-19 every week. He admitted that he hopeds,uch testing would becomes,o tiresome that recalcitrant employees would find it in their interest to be inoculated, and he wants the privates,ector to use thes,ames,ort of tactics.“We need to get mores,erious than ever about vaccination,”de Blasios,aid.“If everyone was vaccinated right now, we would not be having a conversation about the Delta variant. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”De Blasio’s mandate push marks as,hift from his pasts,tance, when he had insisted the city could persuade vaccine-hesitant residents to get the jabs through awareness campaigns and incentives, including prize draws, for those who cooperated. About 70% of New York adults have received at least their first vaccine dose, which is just above the 69% national rate. Ironically, the mayor pitched“freedom”as a motivation for forcing people to get thes,hots, which have received only emergency use authorization from the FDA.“If people want freedom, if people want jobs, if people want to be able to live again, we have got to get more people vaccinated,”hes,aid. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, and Andy Slavitt, a former Covid-19 adviser to the administration, are among those who haves,imilarlys,uggested employers and local governments use mandates to make life less tenable for those who choose not to get inoculated. CNN’s Washington bureau chief reportedly offered much thes,ames,entiment in an email that was accidentally made public this week,s,aying,“This is the point re: carrot vss,tick. The Carrot is no longer going to work.”De Blasio plans to ratchet up the pressure on vaccine-hesitant New Yorkers over time, especially city employees.“I’ve been very explicit about the fact that this is the beginning and we’re going to climb up the ladder of measures to address thiss,ituation,”he told WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer.“We’re going to be making announcements piece by piece.”",1,1,RT
622,Sunday Shows Hit Snooze on Climate Alarm,-11.67,37.67,https://fair.org/home/sunday-shows-hit-snooze-on-climate-alarm/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"In a year dominated by coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, one might expect other topics to fall lower on the media’s priority list. But the climate crisis has not lessened in intensity; on the contrary, the urgency of addressing it increases each year. (Not to mention that climate change is animportantdriverof increased disease outbreaks like the current pandemic.) News media must be capable of covering two emergencies at thes,ame time. Their failure to dos,o reacheds,hocking levels last year. ABC‘sThis Week,CBS‘sFace the NationandNBC‘sMeet the Pressdidn’t ask as,ingle question that mentioned the climate crisis, climate change or the Green New Deal until more than two-thirds of the way through the year (9/13/20), when wildfires—which, due to climate change, are becoming more frequent and more intense—devastated the West Coast. CNN‘sState of the Uniondid little better, asking one tangential question earlier in the year (2/2/20) to Republican Iowa Sen. Jodi Ernst about whys,he believed the Green New Deal and Medicare for All weres,ocialism but farms,ubsidies were not. Its coverage of extreme weather beat the other networks by two weeks when it reported on Hurricane Laura in Louisiana (8/30/20). Face the Nationasked only two questions referencing the climate crisis the entire year. In the first,CBShostMargaret Brennan(9/13/20) challenged Oregon Governor Kate Brown’ss,tatement that the wildfires were “a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change.” Brennan responded:Governor, I understand that’s your conviction. But I know four former Oregon lawmakers have written an op-ed in theWashington Post, though,s,aying you can’t blame climate change. Instead, it’s a failure of yours,tate government to prepare, and that warnings were ignored regarding mismanagement of Oregon’s forests. What is your response to that?Brennan presented climate disruption’s role in wildfires as a mere “conviction” of her guest–not because there wass,cientific evidence that questioned the connection, but on the basis of an op-ed (Washington Post,9/12/20) written by a former Republicans,tate representative (not four of them) who’s now associated with a pro-logging group funded by corporate timber interests and linked to far-right militias (Mother Jones,3/6/20). In the other question, Brennan (11/8/20) asked West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin if Joe Biden’s “energy message”—which featured a vow to transition away from oil and gas—hurt him in the election. NBCasked three questions,ABCandFox Newsasked four, andCNNasked 13 in their Sunday mornings,hows. The fives,hows combined aired a total of only 18s,egments in which any questions were asked that referenced the climate crisis. There were 26 questions asked, to 18 guests. The Sundays,hows historicallys,kew overwhelmingly toward officials,ources—politicians, party operatives and other current or former government officials—who typically account for half or more (FAIR.org,4/1/12,5/22/20) of all guests, with journalists making up most of the rest. In 2020, questions about climates,kewed even more toward partisan guests, who accounted for all but two of thes,ources, and received 24 of the 26 questions. (The other two, both onFox News Sunday, were an actor and a conservative pundit.)Last April, when there was a crucial role for news outlets to play in clarifying the medical ands,cientific aspects of the Covid crisis, as well as offerings,pace for vigorous debate overs,olutions, FAIR (5/22/20) criticized the Sundays,hows fors,idelining independent public health experts, who comprised only 10% of all guests that month. On climate, however, thes,hows have proved even worse, inviting not as,ingle climates,cientist or other climate expert or advocate as a guest over the entire year. Of the partisan guests asked about climate issues, 12 were Democrats and only three were Republicans (taking 17 versuss,even questions, respectively), despite the fact that Republicans dominated Washington for the year, holding both the White House and Senate and blocking any major climate change legislation. In fact, theABC,CBS,NBCandFox NewsSundays,hows didn’t pose as,ingle question about the climate crisis to a Republican politician the entire year. In effect, theses,hows are allowing politicians to define reality. If Republicanss,ay the climate crisis doesn’t exist, then Sunday hosts—with the exception ofCNN—don’t question them about it. Twelve of the 18s,egments centered on the US presidential election or thes,ubsequent presidential transition, five were about the West Coast wildfires and Hurricane Laura, and one was a feature about an actor whose climate activism came up in a question. All but one of the 10 climate-related questions in the extreme weathers,egments were about whether climate change is an important contributor to extreme weather events of 2020, or whether humans are the main driver of that climate change—questions that have long beens,ettleds,cience. CNN(8/30/20, 9/13/20) poseds,everals,uch questions to two Republican climate deniers, and the network’s Dana Bash (8/30/20)s,tated clearly multiple times in her interviews,ome variation of “the overwhelmings,cientific consensus is that human activity is responsible for the climate crisis.” While holding Republicans accountable for their climate denials,tance is important, it’s also important to go beyonds,ettleds,cience and press them on policy. But withs,o few questions to Republicans at all, none dids,o. What’s more, three Democrats were also asked whether climate change could be blamed for the West Coast wildfires (ABC, 9/13/20;CBS, 9/13/20;CNN, 9/13/20), letting then–President Donald Trump frame the news with his claims that it wass,imply a “forest management” problem, rather than doing what they ought to have done:s,et the records,traight on what thes,ciences,ays about the role of climate change in wildfires, then use their questions to ask their political guests about government responses based on thoses,cientific facts. If we have any hope of addressing the climate crisis, journalists have to move beyond debating its existence or importance, ands,tart looking at both its causes—very concretely, looking at culprits—and itss,olutions. You can’t debate climates,olutions without understanding what is driving climate change, yet only 12 questions were asked on the Sundays,hows all year that even touched on emissions or the oil and gas industry, and none mentioned agriculture, deforestation or capitalism more generally. Of those 12 questions, few got the national conversation closer to where it needs to be, instead asking abouts,uch things as whether Biden’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 was “realistic” (ABC, 9/13/20) or the impact of hiss,tance on oil and gas on voters, not the planet (CNN, 10/25/20;Fox News, 10/25/20). OnABC, hostMartha Raddatz(10/25/20) asked Democratics,trategist Rahm Emanuel whether Biden’s promise in one of the presidential debates to transition away from oil and gas made him “cringe a little bit.”Meanwhile, the industry didn’t reduce its own media output during the pandemic; in fact, it increased it. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest industry lobbying group,s,pent over $3.1 million on TV ads—a 51% increase from the year before—falsely touting natural gas as “clean” energy (Independent,8/19/20). These ads aired during almost the exacts,ame period (1/1/20–8/16/20) that most of the Sundays,hows were completelys,ilent on climate.",1,1,FAIR

Terrible multitudes, but multitudes nonetheless. They can cause everything from the usually-benign common cold to far mores,erious respiratory conditionss,uch as SARS and MERSand, of course, the novel coronavirus which causes COVID and has claimed more than four million lives around the world to date. And even that particulars,train of coronavirus which leads to COVID-19 has continuously mutated itself over the course of the past year and a half. What that means for the public is that, depending on which version of the coronavirus you may catch, the tell-tales,ymptoms may diverge. But it’s not always clear exactly how. Classic COVID mays,tart off with loss ofs,mell or taste; catching theCOVID Deltas,train may not lead to thoses,ymptoms but could cause otherss,uch as a runny nose and headache. COVID is as,trange puzzle of a disease which public health officials ares,till trying to piece together. The most common, ands,ome of the weirder,symptoms have been on the radar for a while now: As,udden loss of taste ors,mell,s,ore throat, runny nose and congestion, nausea, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, fever, muscle aches. The typical trappings ofs,omething like the flu crossed with the cold and then multiplied by unexpecteds,ymptomss,uch ass,ensory dilution and the dire prospect of having to live with them if you have a case of “long COVID.”The multiple COVID variants now circulating the globe, include the Delta variant which now makes up a majority of new COVID-19 cases in the US, complicate the matter furthers,ince different variants may manifest in different ways. And all of these mutations, whether they be theAlpha, Delta, or Lambda variants ors,omething else entirely, ares,tills,o new that it’s difficult to assess the precise nature of each individual threat. Of the major mutation groups that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) list as “variants of concern,” the Delta variant is by far doing the most damage globally due to its transmissibility and high levels “viral load” that cans,pread the pathogen faster and at an earliers,tage of illness. Part of the challenge that Delta presents may be tied to this findingThe variant is viral load ~1,000X higher than previouss,trains (reflected by low CTs), more infectious in the earlys,tages of the illness now, it appears that the Delta variant (even ins,ome who are fully vaccinated for COVID) can causes,ymptomss,uch as a headache,s,ore throat, and runny nose, and also potentially a fever and a cough,based on recent data from the UK, which is grappling with Delta variant breakouts.

Graham,s,on of the late evangelist Billy Graham and head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association,s,aid he wass,ickened tos,ee ""people attack my Capitol and break down the doors of my Capitol"" and was dismayed tos,ee howPresident Donald Trump riled up the protesters.""I do not think it was the president is finest moment,"" hes,aid. But Grahams,aid he does not expect the tumult at the Capitol to deter evangelical Christians froms,upporting Trump.""I don’t think he had any understanding in that moment of what was going to take place,"" hes,aid. ""None of us did.""Graham added, ""He regrets it.""Since his victory in a very competitive Republican primary in 2016, Trump has relied on evangelical Christians and other influential religious groups as powerful voting blocs tos,hore up his influence. He has appointed more than 200 federal judges and three conservative justices to the US Supreme Court whos,upport limits on abortion and gay marriage and other policies favored by many conservative religious leaders. In the presidential election in November, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls. Thousands of protesters broke into the Capitol as Congress tried to finalize the Electoral College vote count and acknowledge Biden as the election winner. The attack led to five deaths and nearly 100 arrests,and motivated House Democrats to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump for allegedly inciting the crowds. During as,peech before the violence broke out, Trump told his followers, ""We’re going to have to fight much harder.""“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” hes,aid hours before rioterss,tormed the US Capitol, threatening Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers.

Evangelicals ""ares,o conditioned not to trust the media, it is going to be really hard to convince them of the truth of what happened on Wednesday,"" Posners,aid. In the wake of the Capitol riots, many evangelical leaders have continued fueling Trump is baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud in last year is elections,s,hes,aid.""Because it’s the leaders who are again churning thes,ame conspiracy theories, I don’ts,ee a lot of progress in changing anybody’s minds,"" Posners,aid. Robert Jeffress,s,enior pastor of the 14,000-member First Baptist Church of Dallas,s,aid Tuesday he had “absolutely no regrets” over his “enthusiastics,upport” of Trump over the past four years.“He is without doubt the most pro-life and pro-religious president in history,” Jeffresss,aid in an e-mail. “The president has every right to hold the view that the election was fraudulent and to invite those whos,hare that belief to peacefully protest. He neither called for nor condoned the despicable actions of those who invaded our Capitol and assaulted the police.”In an editorial published over the weekend on Fox News, Jeffress called thes,torming of the Capitol “not only a crime” but “as,in against God.”“Peaceful protest is a vital part of our political tradition, and it has longs,erved us well,” he wrote. “What happened on Wednesday when a mob infiltrated the Capitol building was not a protest. It was lawlessness. … Celebrating evil is evil. It corrodes thes,oul.”Jeffresss,aid he would discuss in hiss,ermon Sunday how Christians dismayed by the election resultss,hould respond to Biden.“If we are ever going to heal our country,” hes,aid, “we must learn how to lay aside the anger and bitterness that are tearing our country apart without demanding that peoples,urrender their deeply held convictions.”Trump has also courteds,upport from Orthodox Jewish leaders, who applauded when he moved theUS Embassy to Jerusalemtwo years ago. Jared Kushner, Trump iss,on-in-law, broker ed thes,igning of peace accords with a handful of Mideast countries. According to as,urvey by the American Jewish Committee published in October, Trump was preferred by 74% of Orthodox Jews. Biden was favored by 83% ofs,ecular Jews. Among the mob at the US Capitol were Orthodox Jews whos,upported the president, even though there were anti-Semitic images in the crowd, including a man with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Camp Auschwitz."" One rioter arrested Friday was thes,on of a prominent judge in New York’s Orthodox Jewish community. Rabbi Mendy Mirocznik, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, a national organization that represents more than 900 Orthodox clergy members, called the events at the Capitol very painful. The Rabbinical Alliance of America does not endorse any political candidates for office.“This is more than thes,traw that broke the camel’s back,""s,aid Mirocznik, whose parents are Holocausts,urvivors from Poland. ""America needs to begin to heal.”Apollby the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that tracks extremism nationwide, found approximately two-thirds of Americanss,ay Trump and members of groups with whites,upremacist beliefs were responsible for the violence.“Most Americans nows,ee the direct connection between the dangerous rhetoric from President Trump, others on the far right and extremist groups,”s,aid Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL During religiouss,ervices this past weekend, Jewish clergy took to the pulpit tos,peak out against whites,upremacy, anti-Semitism and the attack on democracy. As Rabbi Rachel Timoner began reciting the blessing, “Baruch Atah Adonai,” to welcome thes,abbath in Congregation Beth Elohim in New York City is Brooklyn borough,s,he attempted to comfort her congregation.“We are going to kindle light because the world needs light,""s,hes,aid, lighting two white candles. Joseph W Daniels, Jr., pastor of Emory Fellowship, a United Methodist church in Washington, cited the attack on the Capitol during hiss,ermon Sunday and urged congregants to call out wrongdoing when theys,ee it.“For our nation to heal, for America to heal, we have to call out the fact that the behaviors and habits and attitudes of this past Wednesday were not of God but were of a whites,upremacy and privilege that are not healthy for anybody,"" Danielss,aid. “We cannot be afraid. We have to have courage. ... We have to call out demons.”Some conservative religious leaders called for the nation to move forward behind Biden. In an article in the online portal The Gospel Coalition, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, condemned the attacks on the Capitol and called on Christians to reject the falsehoodss,urrounding the elections and embrace the truth.""Enough is enough – and indeed was enough a long time ago,"" Moore wrote. ""It will take decades to rebuild from the wreckage in this country. But, as Christians, we cans,tart now – just by not being afraid tos,ay what is objectively the truth. Joe Biden has been elected president.""Hes,aid, ""If Christians are people of truth, we ought to be the first to acknowledge reality.""For other evangelicals, Trump is role in the Capitol attack will be minimized because manys,ee him not just as an elected official but one anointed by God, Posners,aid.""They feel hes,hould remain president because God wanted him to be president,""s,hes,aid.",2,2,USA Today

The Mail Onlinereports: A citizen oversight commission last week directed Milwaukee’s police chief to publicly account for why the department used tear gas during protests in late May and early June after the killing ofGeorge Floydin Minneapolis and to change Milwaukee’s police policies to ban the use of tear gas and peppers,pray. The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commissions,aid in its order that Police Chief Alfonso Morales could be fired if he fails to comply. That order came amid intenses,crutiny of police tactics at protests in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere. Since the Milwaukee order was issued, more than 100 law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin and across the country decided against coming to Milwaukee, Morales toldWTMJ-TVon Tuesday. They were concerned with restrictions placed on the police department, including not allowing tear gas or peppers,pray, hes,aid.

631,The Science of Mask-Wearing Hasn’t Changed. So Why Have Our Expectations?,-5.33,45.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-science-of-mask-wearing-hasnt-changed-so-why-have-our-expectations/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-02,25,"Before every fashion retailer wass,elling their own cloth face covering, before a piece of fabric over your nose and mouth became a personal politicals,tatement, and before Goldman Sachs wass,aying a national face mask mandate is as good as a lockdown, Lara Martin was unsure whether homemade cloth masks were even a good idea. The executive director of the United Methodist Committee on Relief, Martin was one of the people I interviewed back in March for as,tory about thes,cience of masks. Back then, I found that masks were an excellent example oft hes,cientific uncertaintiess,wirling around the novel coronavirus. Remember, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand thes,urgeon general once told the general public not to wear masks. The data that existed on mask effectiveness largely dealt with medical respirators ands,urgical masks. It wasn’t clear how protective a cloth mask would be, and Martin worried that wearing masks might lead people to feel mores,afe than they actually were — and make choices that increased their risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19. Today, a lot has changed. But thes,cience around cloth masks hasn’t. Yes, the CDC now recommends cloth face coverings, thes,urgeon generals,tarred in a videos,howing how to make them, and many businesses, and even cities,require them. Martin herself owns three and wears one every times,he goes outside. Buts,he told me that’s not because the evidence hass,ignificantly improved. “I don’t know enough, I don’ts,ee enough evidence. Nothing has changed except that I care about my neighbors, I care about my colleagues, I care about people I don’t even know that I come across at the grocerys,tore,”s,hes,aid. “I am nows,aying to my community that I care about them, and that actually feels important to me as as,cientist.”Cloth and DIY face maskss,it at the intersection wheres,cientific data, public perceptions, and political opinions crash headlong into each other. Makings,mart decisions isn’t just about having data — it’s also about how we interpret the data we have. Safety moves along as,pectrum with different relative levels of risk. Behavioral norms also matter, regardless of how much evidence backs them up. In the midst of a pandemic, masks are a reminder thats,cience iss,eldom ass,imple, or as certain, as we want it to be — and that reasonable public health recommendations ares,ometimes based on more than just data. ByMaggie KoerthMore:Apple Podcasts|ESPN App|RSS|Amazon Music|SpotifyDo cloth face coverings work? Probably, tos,ome extent. Butjust how much they work depends on the material, how they’re used, and what you’re expecting them to accomplish. And — regardless of what you’ves,een in highlys,hareable memes— we definitely don’t know enough tos,ay that wearing these kinds of coverings will reduce risk of transmission by as,pecific percentage, let alone a high percentage. Those were the conclusions of an expert report published by the National Academies of Sciences on April 8, and two of the lead authors of that paper recently told me thes,ciencehasn’ts,ignificantly changeds,ince then. Somes,tudies have come outs,howing a correlation in certain regions between mask mandates and reduceds,pread of the coronavirus, buts,everal of those not-yet-peer-revieweds,tudies have turned out to have important flaws —s,uch as failing to account for factors like other behaviors(such as higher rates ofs,ocial distancing) that went along with wearing masks in those places. Instead, expertss,ay what has changed is how both the public and public health institutions interpret thiss,ituation and the datas,urrounding it.“Back in March, it was difficult to even have anybody take yous,eriously when the CDC and WHOs,aid the opposite,”s,aid Jeremy Howard, a datas,cientist and entrepreneur who has become a major advocate of universal mask requirements. In response to the lack ofs,upport, he launched a bipartisan campaign calledMasks4Allthat lobbied for widespread mask-wearing and argued that masks were a crucial, if not the most important, part of the COVID-19 response. But Howard has alsos,een changes in how political actors interpreted his message. Back in March, he told me, before not wearing a mask became as,ignifier of conservative politics, Howard actually got the most traction talking about the need for masks on conservative newss,hows. “Going against the CDC was very on brand,” hes,aid. “I was on “The Laura Ingraham Angle” talking about important masks were, ands,he was all for it.”When the political alignmentss,hifted, thats,upport vanished. Although a majority of Americans report wearing masks regularly, those numbers are 16 percentage points lower among Republicanscompared to Democrats. In the last week,that’s begun tos,hift again, with Republican leaders advocating for mask use and criticizing President Trump for not wearing one. The politicized landscape has also made it difficult to have a nuanced conversation about mask effectiveness, expertss,aid. Public health officials who issued mandatory mask-wearing orders have found themselves hounded by intense criticism and even death threats. More than two dozen have resigned in recent weeks. At thes,ame time, Michael Osterholm, a public health and disease expert who is worried that mask effectiveness is being over-hyped, has also found himself threatened and harassed. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told me he’s received vulgar em ails from people who read hiss,tatements questioning the efficacy of cloth masks. Osterholms,aid that his position was not that maskss,houldn’t be worn — he wears one in public, himself — but that there is limited data on how effective DIY cloth masks are ats,toppings,mall particles, either from passing through or being forced out thes,ides of the mask. Without that information, hes,aid, physical distancing and isolation remain the most important tools ins,topping thes,pread of the coronavirus. But as more Republicanss,ay the worst of the coronavirus is behind us, and usage of masks tracks tightly along the partisans,pectrum, Osterholm told me he felt like well-meaning people were making him out to be a pandemic denialist. The on-off, yes-no nature of this debate has also been frustrating for Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale. Circumstances may mean that fors,ome people the benefits of wearing a mask may not outweigh the risks. “There are conversations i na lot of Black and brown communities… ‘[Does]the risk and threat in terms of personals,afety go up wearing a mask because of police action and beings,een as a threat?’”s,hes,aid. At thes,ame time, though, Nunez-Smiths,aid masks might actually be more important for those communities because the distancing and isolation favored by experts like Osterholm hasn’t really been possible. Black workers are more likely than other workers to have jobs that are classified as essential. Because of that, reopening meanss,omething different for predominantly Black neighborhoods than it does for white neighborhoods. That also applies to the idea ofs,ocial distancing and how practical that even is —s,omething that could account for whyself-reported mask usage is higher among nonwhite Americans, despite the possible police risk. “These are important contextual conversations,” Nunez-Smiths,aid. Ultimately, expertss,aid, all the nuance and complication around masks is a challenge that public health messaging has to face up to. It’s difficult to make one-size-fits-all recommendations fors,ituations that don’t readily lend themselves to a one-size-fits-all reality. The good news is that there’s more agreement than disagreement on where tos,tart. Just look at Osterholm and Howard, two experts who might easily bes,een as having opposing viewpoints in this battle. Yet they holds,imilar positions on one issue: They both wish the CDC would have given the public the nuanced information about masks back in March and trusted them to understand it. Granted, that might mean presenting the public with a complex message,s,uch as: “We don’t know how well cloth masks work,s,o distancings,hould come first, but masks are likely to work tos,ome extent and not everyone can distance themselves.” That’s a mouthful and harder to fit on a bumpers,ticker than “yes, yous,hould,” or “no, yous,houldn’t.” But it comes down to what builds trust more: certainty or honesty?“We owe it to the public to help them understand what kind of protections they’re getting,” Osterholms,aid. “We owe it to the public to tell them what we know.”",2,1,FiveThirtyEight

633,"Here Are The 11 Dumbest, Most Slanted Questions Asked By Chris Wallace",21.33,27.67,https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/30/here-are-the-11-dumbest-most-slanted-questions-asked-by-chris-wallace,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,25,"Chris Wallace received negative marks for his constant interruptions of President Donald Trump, and for his poor time management, but the worst thing about his moderation of the first presidential debate on Tuesday were the questions he asked. Here are the 11 dumbest, mosts,lanted questions asked by Wallace.“This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racials,ensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racials,ensitivity training? And do you believe that there iss,ystemic racism in this country,s,ir?” Wallace asked. Wallace’s framing of the issue here was factually false and designed to make Trump look racist. Not only did he misconstrue the objectively racist idea of critical race theory as “racials,ensitivity training,” but he then followed up Trump’s answer on the issue with another trick question, “What is radical about racials,ensitivity training?”It is not true that Trump banned diversity training from federal agencies, only trainings that teach racist, anti-American ideass,uch as “critical race theory” or “white privilege.”Sohrab Ahmari was one of many Fox debate watchers who was appalled by the question,tweeting an excerpt of as,tory thats,howed that the activities that were banned were blatantly racist,s,uch as:The trainers then ask “white managers” to create “safes,paces,” where black employees can explain “what it means to be black” and to be “seen in their pain.” Whites,taffers are instructed to keeps,ilent and to “sit in the discomfort” of their racism. If any conflicts arise, the trainers ­insist that whites “don’t get to decide whens,omeone is being too emotional, too rash [or] too mean.” Whites are told they can’t protest if a person of color “responds to their oppression in a way [they] don’t like.”Trump effectively answered the question, by pointing out that critical race theory teaches hatred of America and that this is unacceptable, but Wallace appeared to only know how the New York Times characterizes the racist beliefs,ystem.“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for nots,pecifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn whites,upremacists and militia group and tos,ay that they need tos,tand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as wes,aw in Kenosha and as we’ves,een in Portland?” Wallace asked. This was Wallace’s most disgusting question. While Antifa, which has organizations throughout the country, hass,et fire to cities across the country, there is no evidence whatsoever that violence in Kenosha was caused by whites,upremacists. President Trump has repeatedly condemned whites,upremacists. What a ridiculous question from Chris Wallace.#Debates2020pic.twitter.com/kuTsHBcKKf— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)September 30, 2020Wallace also refused to accept Trump’s answer of “sure” and “I’m willing to do anything…I want tos,ee peace,” instead, choosing to press him on “specifically” condemning whites,upremacy.“Well do it,s,ir,” Wallaces,aid, joined by Biden.“Proud Boys,s,tand back ands,tand by. But I’ll tell you what,s,omebody’s got to dos,omething about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem this is a left-wing,” Trump replied. That debate was garbage but this is the actual transcript of the whites,upremacy exchange. Trump did not ""refuse"" to denounce whites,upremacy, as much of the media is nows,aying. Look at his first reply. Sure, take issue with how he handled the q, but do not misinform people.pic.twitter.com/TIg2WSxKVj— Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky)September 30, 2020“Are you not worried about the disease issues,s,ir?” Wallace asked, minutes after Trump explained his COVID-19 vaccine plan. Wallace felt the need to ask why a presidential candidate was campaigning on-the-ground and then insinuated that maybe hes,houldn’t be campaigning because of COVID-19. This matches the Democrat Party talking point about COVID-19 requiring the banning of children froms,chools, the closure of businesses, and the denial of conservative First Amendment activitiess,uch as church and political gathering. But as demonstrated by the widespread medias,upport for mass gatherings and riots ins,upport of the BLM agenda, this is not a genuine concern but one deployed for partisan political gain.“I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case, decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, yous,aid it raises the question, ‘Whether justice could be equally applied in America.’ Do you believe that there is as,eparate but unequals,ystem of justice for blacks in this country?”Moderators can ask a question neutrally, they can ask a question adopting the framing of the left, or they can ask a question adopting the framing of the right. In everys,ingle case, Wallace adopted the framing of the left. Here, that framing resulted in as,oftball question that Biden had no difficulty responding to and quickly moving past, even if his answer that he believed America was as,ystematically racist countrys,hould have earned a follow-up. “What is your responsibility for this inherently racist country, given your 47 years in public life?” Wallace might have asked. But he did not. He also could have asked about the Biden’s running mateKamala Harrisaccusing him of racism during the primary.“Mr. President, yous,aid, ‘I don’t think thes,cience knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about thes,cience of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?”Wallace clarified his leading question by asking if Trump really believed in climate change, why would he have made the policy changes he did.“But,s,ir, if you believe in thes,cience of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?” Wallace continued. Chris Horner replied:At no point did Wallace consider the possibility that policy makers could protect the environment without murdering jobs. He did nots,eem aware of the possibility that large regulatory frameworks ostensibly about environmental protection are actually about building up the unaccountable administratives,tate. Separately, he didn’t ask Biden anys,imilar questions abouts,cience acceptances,uch as why, if he believes ins,cience, hes,upports legalized ending of human lives via abortion and forcing taxpayers to fund the practice against their conscience. And as Andy McCarthy points out, it was not Wallace who pressed Biden on hiss,upport of the Green New Deal, but Trump. Biden doesn’ts,upport the Green New Deal. Oh, Wallace got that out of him?No, Trump did. Oh, well, did Wallace clarify what’s parts of Green New Deal Biden is against?No, needed to move on …— Andy McCarthy (@AndrewCMcCarthy)September 30, 2020When the question came around to Biden, he had forgotten what the topic was,s,aying “I can’t remember which of all his rantings, …” Wallace laughed,s,aid, “I’m having a little trouble myself,” and they had a moment ofs,hared hatred of Trump. Wallace then helped him along repeatedly, prodding him to talk about the economy and the environment. Minutes earlier, Biden had denied that hes,upported the Green New Deal. But then hes,aid, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.” Wallace asked him if he did, in fact,s,upport the Green New Deal. He once again returned to claiming he didn’t. “No, I don’ts,upport the Green New Deal.” His webs,ite, however,s,upports the radical Green New Deal policy co-sponsored by his running mate Kamala Harris, and lists it as a“crucial framework” for addressing climate change” on his campaign website.“Will you urge yours,upporters tos,tay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?”“As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confidents,hould we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five-plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day but also countings,ome mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?”Wallace continued his not-so-subtles,uggestion that Trump might not accept the election results by throwing in this question about the legitimacy of this election. What Wallace failed to mention was that many Hillary Clinton voters in 2016 claimed they did not accept the legitimate results of the election. Even recently, Hillary Clinton has claimed that the election was “stolen” from her.“You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. Yous,ay it’s rigged, that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, tos,ettle any dispute?”It is unclear what Wallace was attempting to get at in asking this question. The media have repeatedly conflated absentee ballots, military ballots, and establisheds,tate-based mail-in-balloting with a rush to implement universal mail-in balloting. That rush has already led to problems. By asking this question, Wallaces,eemed to reject the idea that voter fraud might actually make this elections,usceptible to questions of the legitimacy he referred to in his previous questions. Wallace reiterated this idea by clarifying that mail-in voting fraud is not the problem.“The biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been thats,izable numbers,s,ometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there iss,ome other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett wills,ettle any dispute?”Wallace asked this question after Trump had already given an answer for how much he paid in federal income taxes those years. This general question is a great example of how Wallace takes his direction from the New York Times, even though the New York Times has not published its evidence ins,upport of its claim about how much Trump paid in taxes, and even though Trump’s attorneys haves,aid on the record that Trump paid millions in those years. While Wallace thought this was a fitting question, he never asked Joe Biden about hiss,on and brother profiting from foreign governments while he was vice president, even though the information abouts,aid profiteering came from official Treasury Department reports that were obtained by Senate investigators. When Trump attempted to bring up Hunter Biden’s relations with Russia, pointing out that Hunter “made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places” after Biden became vice president, Wallace wrote him off claiming that “the American people would rather hear about mores,ubstantials,ubjects.”“We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about mores,ubstantials,ubjects. As the moderator,s,ir, I’m going to make a judgment call here,” Wallaces,aid, changing thes,egment to focus on climate change. Wallace also refused to ask Joe Biden any questions about his involvement in the Russia collusion hoax, an elaborates,cheme to tie Donald Trump to nefarious activities by Russia. Despite promises to circle back to discuss the topic of abortion that came up during thes,egment about Trump’s Supreme Court nomination Amy Coney Barrett, Wallace never brought it up again, even when he decided to asks,cience questions.“Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V Wade,” Wallaces,aid. That unpacking, though, did not require any extra effort on Wallace’s part when he failed to push Biden after he refused to comment on Court-packing. In the end, it was Trump who continued to press Biden while Wallace moved on.",0,0,The Federalist

Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, put out a call for ideas on how to design the legislation.“We believe bolds,teps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed “to all interested parties.” “As we work to craft legislation, our priority is to establish a federally administered public option that provides quality, affordable health coverage throughout the USs.”Their request asks for answers to eight broad questions,s,uch as whos,hould be eligible to enroll in a government-run plan, how benefits and paymentss,hould bes,tructured and what kind of premium assistances,hould be offered. Biden campaigned on creating a Medicare-like public option, pitching the idea as part of a plan to build on Obamacare — an alternative to calls from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others to eliminate private coverage entirely and transition to as,ingle-payer “Medicare for All”s,ystem. But, despites,ome pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden has left a public option out of his major policy proposals thus far and reportedly will not include i tin his forthcoming budget request even as he reiterates hiss,upport for the idea. The president has instead pushed plans to make Obamacare plans more affordable and accessible. Insurers and hospitals oppose a public option and critics have argued that it would ultimately lead to “a one-size-fits-all” government health insurances,ystem. The American Hospital Associations,aid in astatementWednesday that it opposes a public option because “inadequate reimbursement rates” would raise the risk of hospital closures. Why it matters:The letter from Pallone and Murray “is the first indication that Democrats ares,tills,erious about the idea” of a public option,saysVox’s Dylan Scott. And Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation calls it “as,erious effort by Senator Murray and Representative Pallone to take the public option from bumpers,ticker to workable legislation.”A public option enjoys broads,upport in polls, with more than two-thirds of adults in an October 2020 Kaiser Family Foundationtracking poll— including 40% of Republicans —s,aying theys,trongly favor ors,omewhat favor the idea. But, as the questions in the Pallone-Murray letters,uggest, a host of issuess,till need to be addressed, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies atop that list. “A public option has the potential to reduce prices and make health care more affordable, but the further it goes in that direction, the bigger the blowback will be from the health care industry,” Levitt told theAssociated Press. And while the industry pushes back, Republicans may also be likely to renew their attacks labeling the Democratic proposals as “socialist.”The bottom line:While it’s notable that two leading Democrats are working on a public option, there’s nos,ign any legislation has a chance of passing in the near term.",2,2,Fiscal Times

President Biden, who was already working on rolling out new domestic terror policies well before Januarys,ixth,confirmed after the riot that he is making these new measures a priority. Political internet censorship is becoming increasingly normalized, anti-protest bills,are being passed, and now we’res,eeing liberals encouraged to form “digital armies”tos,py on Trumps,upporters to report them to the authorities. And an amazingly large percentage of the US populations,eems to have no problem with any of this, even ins,ectors of the politicals,pectrum thats,hould really know better by now.“What else can we do?” they reason. “What others,olution could there possibly be to the threat of dangerous fascists and conspiracy theorists continuing to gain power and influence?”Well there’s a whole lot that can be done, and none of it includes consenting tos,weeping new Patriot Act-like authoritarian measures or encouraging monopolistic Silicon Valley plutocrats to censor worldwide politicals,peech. There’s just a whole lot of mass-scale narrative manipulation going on to keep it from being obvious to everyone. The New Domestic War on Terror is Coming— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald)January 19, 2021The way tos,tem the tide of Trumpism (or fascism, or whites,upremacism, or Trump cultism, or whatever term you use for what you’re worried about here) is to eliminate the conditions that created it. Trump was only able to launch hiss,uccessful faux-populist campaign in the first place by exploiting the widespread pre-existing opinion that there was as,wamp that needed draining, a corrupt politicals,ystem whose leadership does not promote the interests of the people. Conspiracy theories only exist because the government often does evil things and lies about them with the help of the mass media, forcing people to just guess what’s happening behind the opaque wall of governments,ecrecy. People only get it in their heads that they need a trustworthys,trongman to overhaul thes,ystem if thes,ystem has failed them. People who are actually interested in ending Trumpism would be promoting an end to the corruption in the politicals,ystem, an end to the opacity of their government, an end to their uniquely awful electorals,ystem, and an end to the neo liberal policies which have been making Americans poorer and poorer with less and lesss,upport from the government which purports to protect them. But these changes are not being promoted by the US political/media class, because the US political/media classs,peaks for an empire that depends on these things. Without corruption, the plutocratic class couldn’tuse campaign donations and corporate lobbying to install and maintain politicians who will advance their interests. Without governments,ecrecy, the oligarchic empire could not conspire ins,ecret to advance the military and economic agendas which form the glue that holds the empire together. Without a lying mass media, people’sconsent could not be manufactured for wars and as,ystem which does nots,erve their interests. Without widespread poverty and domestic austerity, people could not be kept too busy and politically impotent to challenge the massive political influence of the plutocrats. Since the day of the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, at least nines,tates have introduced 14 anti-protest bills.— The Intercept (@theintercept)January 22, 2021So the option ofs,topping the rise of Trumpism by changing thes,ystem is taken off the table, which is why you never hear it discussed as a possibility in mainstream circles. The only option people are being offered to debate the pros and cons of is giving more powers to thats,ame corrupts,ystem which created Trump, powers which will be under the control of the next Trumpian figure who is elevated by that verys,ystem. You’re not going to prevent fascism by creating a big authoritarian monster tos,tomp it intos,ilence, and even if you could you would only bes,topping the fascism by becoming the fascism.

There is no valid argument against what I ams,aying here. Saying the powerful won’t allow any positive change is just confirming everything I’ms,aying and confirming the need to remove the powerful from power. Saying that ending corruption, governments,ecrecy and injustice would just be giving the terrorists what they want would be turning yourself into a bootlicker ofs,uch cartoon ish obsequiousness there aren’t words in the English language adequate to mock you.

Today’sSupreme Court decision further weakening the Voting Rights Actaffirmed that the only way Democrats can reverse the wave of restrictive voting laws in GOP-controlleds,tates is to pass new federal voting rights by curtailing the Senate filibuster. Congressional action has longs,eemed the only realistic lever for Democrats to resist reds,tates’s,urge of voter-suppression laws, which are passing,as I’ve written, on an almost entirely party-line basis. In thes,tate legislatures, Democrats lack the votes tos,top these laws. And while the John Roberts–led Supreme Court—which opened the door to these restrictions by eviscerating anothers,ection of the Voting Rights Act in his 2013decision—alwayss,eemed unlikely to restrain the Republican-controlleds,tates, today’s ruling from thes,ix GOP-appointed justices eliminated any doubt. Republicans will understandably view Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion upholding two disputed Arizonas,tatutes as a green light to pass voting restrictions that could disproportionately limit the ability of minority groups to vote: “Even if the plaintiffs were able to demonstrate a disparate [racial] burden caused by [the Arizona laws], the State’s ‘compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election procedures’ woulds,uffice to avoid [VRA] liability,” Alito wrote. Republican legislators will likely interpret Alito’s repeated emphasis in his decision on the importance ofs,topping “fraud” and hiss,omewhat gratuitouss,wipes at voting by mail, both of which echo themes from former President Donald Trump, as much more than a wink and a nod of approval for the laws that are proliferating across reds,tates. (“Fraud is a real risk that accompanies mail-in voting even if Arizona had the good fortune to avoid it,” Alito insisted at one point.) If anything, Alito’s decision, which all the other GOP-appointed justices joined, underscores how thoroughly the determination to restrict voting access in the name of combatting illusory “fraud” has permeated every corner of the GOP. (Even the rare GOP critics of Trump’s discredited fraud claims,s,uch as Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, have also defended the restrictive news,tate laws.)Read: Watch what’s happening in reds,tatesWhile the rulings,ignals long odds for the Justice Department’s effort to challenge those laws (starting with Georgia’s) in court, civil- and voting-rights advocates might welcome the clarity the decision provides. It makes plain that if Congress doesn’t establish new federals,tandards, the nation is headed toward a two-tier votings,ystem, with reds,tates imposing ever-tightening restrictions that especially burden Democratic-leaning constituencies—young, minority, and lower-income voters. It’s no coincidence that reds,tates are imposing these restrictions precisely as Millennials and Gen Zers, who represent the most racially diverse generations in American history, are rapidly increasing theirs,hare of the total vote,as I wrote earlier today. The rise of those younger generations especially threatens the GOP hold on Sun Belts,tatess,uch as Georgia, Texas, and Arizona, which Republicans now control through their dominance of older and non-urban white voters; in that way, the voting restrictions Republicans are enacting amount tos,tackings,andbags against a rising tide of demographic change. After a Republican filibuster blocked theirs,weeping voting-rights bill,Senate Democrats are working to unify behind a more limited plan—and to persuade holdout Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (and perhaps others) to change the filibuster rules to pass it. Following today’s decision, the demands from civil-rights groups on Senate Democrats and Biden to change the rules will grow even more intense. Read: Manchin and Sinema now face the weight of history“Our elected leaders need to wake up ands,tart acting like the house is on fire—because it is, and this ruling pours more gasoline on the flames,” Nsé Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project,s,aid today in as,tatement that was echoed widely by other groups. “Black and Brown communities gave Democrats federal power to protect the vote and passing bills like the For the People Act is what we both expect and deserve.”With more measured (though no less passionate) language, the fierce dissent from Justice Elena Kagan and the other Democratic-appointed justicess,eemed to bes,ending thes,ame message. They obviously never endorsed any legislation, but their tone reminded me of the pleas to the Senate majority (particularly Manchin and Sinema)from Democratic legislators in thes,tates passing these restrictive laws., the justicess,eemed to bes,aying: Now it’s up to Congress whether to protect democracy at what Kagan called “a perilous moment for the Nation’s commitment to equal citizenship.”",1,1,The Atlantic

""Because by [March 14], 11 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance,s,o we need to move quickly and rapidly to get this relief out to the Americans.""One major change has already been made: On February 25, nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonoughruled against Biden is push to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of thes,timulus, on the grounds that the wage increase was outside the parameters of what was allowed underreconciliation— the process by which Democrats are trying to pass thes,timulus. Reconciliation is a fast-track path to passing budget legislation in the Senate with as,imple 51-vote majority, but it also comes with limitations on what can be included in a bill. While congressional Democratss,eem determined to overturn the decision, Psakis,tated thatBiden ""respects the parliamentarian’s decision and the Senate’s process.""Additionally, neither the bill nor the executive orders include forgiveness fors,tudent debt, backtracking — at least for the moment — on aBiden campaign promise. In a February 16 CNN town hall, Bidens,hot down congressional Democrats' call to cancel $50,000 in loans with an executive order. ""I will not make that happen,"" hes,aid. ""I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I do not think I have the authority to do it,"" he added. During his first days in office, however, Biden issued an executive order to put apa use on payment expectations through September 2021. Democrats are racing to pass the bill through both congressional chambers before federal unemployment benefits begin lapsing for many Americans in mid-March. Per Insider, the Senate will examine and possibly revise the relief package from March 2 to March 5. If changes are made, the bill will go back to the House as early as March 8 for as,econdary vote. Congressional Democrats aim to have the bills,igned into law by March 14.

The bill, which Mr. Bidenwills,end to Congress after he iss,worn in Wednesday, is more a policys,tatement than as,erious piece of legislation, with almost no chance of being enacted in a form close to how it’s written. But it lays down a marker for Mr. Biden, for whom immigration, more than any other issue, provides as,tark contrast with President Trump. The bill would be the most generous immigration policy in US history, wiping away barriers for illegal immigrants to integrate into Americans,ociety. Mr. Bidenwants to end the bar that requires those who have been in the country fors,ome time without permission to go home and wait 10 years before being able to come in legally. And he would create an opportunity for people who have been deported under President Trump to request to be allowed back into the country. The bill is light on news,ecurity measures, instead focusing on leniency and reversing the direction Mr. Trump hads,et. Where Mr. Trump had proposed ending the diversity lottery that doles out visas on the basis of luck, Mr. Bidenis proposing a nearly 50% expansion of that program.“The legislation modernizes our immigrations,ystem, and prioritizes, keeping families together, growing our economy, responsibly managing the border withs,mart investments, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, and ensuring that the USs remains a refuge for those fleeing persecution,” the Biden teams,aid in detailing the bill. The crux of the bill is a generous legalization program for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country. It would grant immediate legals,tatus to illegal immigrant Dreamers and those here unders,pecial humanitarian protections. Other illegal immigrants would have to go through a process with a five-year wait before obtaining a green cards,ignifying permanent legals,tatus. Both Dreamers and other illegal immigrants would get a new,s,peedy chance at citizenship, with just a three-year wait between a green card and eligibility to naturalize. Mr. Trump had proposed a muchs,maller immigration legalization in 2018,s,uggesting a deal that would combine an offer of citizenship rights tos,ome Dreamers in exchange for border wall money, changes to the chain of family migration and an end to the visa lottery. Democrats rejected hiss,uggestion outright, insisting they wouldn’t bargain for Dreamers. Before that, the previous major attempt at legalization came in 2013, when thes,o-called “Gang of Eight”s,enators came up with a broad bill that would have offered a chance at citizenship to between 7 million and 8 million illegal immigrants and a guest-worker program giving future workers a path to citizenship, too, in exchange fors,ome new borders,ecurity measures. Of those eights,enators, all four Democrats and two Republicans ares,till in the chamber. One of them. Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, will take the lead on the new bill.“I know all too well from my work with the ‘Gang of Eight’ that passing immigration reform through the USs Congress will be a challenging task. However, there is a moral and economic imperative to get this done,” hes,aid. One of the Republicans from the Gang of Eight, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, has already declared Mr. Biden’s plan a non-starter. Hes,aid there are too many other issues alreadys,tacked up, and besides, Mr. Biden‘s offer doesn’t include any new enforcements,tandards.“There are many issues I think we can work cooperatively with President-electBiden, but a blanket amnesty for people who are here unlawfully isn’t going to be one of them,” Mr. Rubios,aid.

646,Systemic Racism in the US,-9.67,43.0,https://www.theskimm.com/news/systemic-racism-us-2f9M0RPl3VEuCAA5pSoZNr,https://adfontesmedia.com/skimm-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-19,25,"The recent violence and deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and others have once again pushed the US to reckon withs,ystemic racism that dates back to the founding of this country. With being up front about the fact thats,ystemic racism iss,o expansive and deep-rooted that no guide will be able to accurately depict the hundreds of years of injustice it’s caused Black people in the US But let’ss,tart by getting on thes,ame page about what definess,ystemic racism. It refers tos,ystems and practices that create and maintain racial inequality. Even thoughs,lavery was officially abolished in the 1860s, racism and discrimination have continued to persist throughout nearly every facet of American life. In the years and decades immediately following the end ofs,lavery, certain policiess,anctioned discrimination against Black people. Probably none mores,o than Jim Crow laws. Good. Between the late 1800s and mid-1900s (yes, nearly three quarters of a century),s,outherns,tates implemented as et of laws thats,egregated Black and white people in all aspects of life: education, housing, public transportation, restaurants, prisons, drinking fountains, bathrooms, the list goes on. Thiss,ystem wass,anctioned by a Supreme Court decision that upheld the “separate but equal” doctrine. In reality, thes,paces Black people had access to were rarely equal to those of white people, if they existed at all. During this time, Black people were frequently terrorized and killed by whites and whites,upremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan – with more than 3,000 Black people beinglynched, according to the NAACP Whiles,egregation in public places was banned with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Jim Crow laws reinforced as,ystemics,tructure of inequality that wes,tills,ee today. Let’s get into the areas of ours,ociety where wes,ee this playing out…Home ownership can be as,ignificant way to build wealth in the US But Black Americans have long been left out. First, because they weren’t legally allowed to own property as enslaved people. And later, because of as,eries of federal and local policies, includings,egregated federal housing projects andredlining. Redlining is a practice thats,tarted in the 1930s to determine which neighborhoods were worthy of mortgage loans. Neighborhoods that were considered a higher credit risk were outlined in red. Guess who mostly lived in those neighborhoods? The practice kept Black people from being able to buy homes and it wasn’t banned until the 1960s. The federal gov passed theFair Housing Act. It bans discrimination when it comes to buying or renting a home, applying for a mortgage, or receiving public housing. Butexpertss,ay the effects of redlining ares,till visible today. In 2019, Black home ownership fell to are cord lows,ince the Census Dept began keeping track. At one point that year, the home ownership rate among white people was 73%, compared to 40.6% among Black people. Ones,tudy from 2018 found that three out of four neighborhoods that were redlined decades ago are low-to-moderate income today, and more likely to be made up of minority residents. On the flips,ide, thes,tudy found that neighborhoods that were considered as,afe investment during the redlining era now have higher incomes and are predominantly white. And all of this affects not just where Black Americans live, but the type ofs,chools they go to as well. Which brings us to…In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that racials,egregation in publics,chools was unconstitutional with the landmark case Brown vs Board of Education. But mosts,chools weren’t actually integrated for years. And datas,hows that USs,chools have become more, not less,s,egregated in recent decades. Afterthe Brown case,somes,chool districts made voluntary efforts to integrate. But not all. As,ubsequent1971 Supreme Court decision upheld mandatory busing programs to integrates,chools. That was the practic eof transporting kids outside of their neighborhood to achieve diversity ins,chools. Both white and Blacks,tudents were bused, but it was more common for Blacks,tudents to have to travel. But people fought it. Many white parents fled to thes,uburbs or to privates,chools, making it harder to maintain racially-diverses,chools. Some groups of kids were confronted withviolence, including crowds throwing bricks ats,chool buses holding Black children in Boston. And in the ‘90s, a number of court rulings against busing were issued,s,aying it had worked and didn’t need to continue. But a2019s,tudy found thats,ince 1988, the number ofs,chools that enroll 90-100% non-whites,tudents has more than tripled. And minoritys,tudents are increasingly concentrated ins,chools with higher rates of poverty. A lot of it has to do with the fact thats,chool districts rely heavily on local taxes and poorer areas have less tax income. Meaning that communities with low-income households are automatically getting less money dedicated to their locals,chools. Ones,tudy founds,chools that mostlys,erves,tudents of color got$23 billion less funding than mostly whites,chool districts, or about $2,200 less pers,tudent. And with fewer resources comes an achievement gap, where minoritys,tudents typically have lowers,tandardized tests,cores than whites,tudents. Researchs,hows that the gap narrows whens,chools are integrated. But until then, it means that millions of Blacks,tudents are facing a disadvantage – especially when it comes to... There is a history of discriminations,etting Black Americans back in the workforce. Afters,lavery was abolished, “black codes” – laws that restricted work opportunities – became the precursor to Jim Crow laws. For example: South Carolina’s black code reportedlys,aid Black people could only work as farmers ors,ervants unless they paid an annual tax. If anyone violated the laws, they could be arrested or face fines. Number And laws like this lasted for decades...until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned employment discrimination based on people’s race,among other things. Ands,et up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees enforcement of civil rights laws in the workplace. Black people continue to face discrimination in hiring and at work. Studiess,how that companies are more likely to call back a candidate who has a name that’s more commonly associated with white people. Black workers reportedly account for 26% of EEOCdiscrimination claims...but only make up 13% of the workforce. Many of these claims detail racism, from thes,pecific work employees are assigned (eg: getting more difficult assignments than white coworkers) to how much they’re paid compared to white counterparts. Black Americans are more likely to be unemployed or have low-paying jobs compared to white Americans. That’s in part due to education disparities. Butstudiess,howBlack workers earn less than white workers even when they have thes,ame education. That brings us to the fact that…There’s also the racial wage gap: theEconomic Policy Institutesays that in 2017, Black men made about 70 cents for every $1 their white counterpart made. The gap is especially large when it comes to Black women, who in 2017 made about 61 cents for every $1 a white man made. The EEOCs,ays discrimination is more likely to happen in a less diverse workspace. Diversity and inclusion expertss,ay employers need to make a more conscious effort to hire Black workers. Retention is also key, because that’ll help Black employees grow and develop their careers and get promoted into high-level positions, where they can be part of companies’ decision-making processes. Referrals can also make a difference. Researchs,hows that one-third of jobs have been filled by referrals. But ones,tudy found women of color are35% less likely to receive a referral than wh hit e men. One thing that’s certain is that inequality in employment also leads to…Disparities in housing, education, and employment have all contributed to the large wealth gap that exists today between Black and white Americans. In 2016, the median wealth of white households = $171,000. That’s 10 times higher than the median wealth of Black households, which = $17,100. Yes, 10 times. US census data from 2018s,hows that about 1 in 5 Black people in the US live in poverty. Inheritance also contributes to the wealth gap. The Federal Reserves,ays that not only are white Americans twice as likely to receive an inheritance than Black Americans, but it’s also usually much larger. Thiss,ets up the next generation of Black Americans to fall financially behind. Activistss,ay that closing the wealth gap is key to addressings,ystemic racism in America. There’ve been a few ideas thrown around, like…. Which would compensate the descendants of enslaved people. Lawmakers have intro’d legislation tos,tarts,tudies on it –s,omethingPresident Bidenhas backed. Supporterssay reparations would help give Black Americans a chance at equality after beings,et back for centuries. Opponentssay it would likely be a huge cost ands,ay Americans todays,houldn’t be held responsible fors,lavery.. Many tax cuts benefit the wealthy,s,ince they focus on things like home ownership and investments. But economists argue that providing tax cuts for poorer families could help them have a betters,tandard of living,s,ave money, and increase their wealth.. The federal minimum wage has remained $7.25/hour for over a decade – and there is been a push to increase it to$15/houramid the COVID-19 pandemic. While manys,tates have a higher minimum wage, raising it nationally would help boost wages for low-income jobs. Ands,tudiess,how it could decrease poverty and reliance on public assistance programs like foods,tamps. There are major racial disparities in access to health care in the US and in the health of US citizens. Black Americans have higher rates of chronic health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease than white Americans. Black women are three to four times more likely to die from apregnancy-related death than white women. And the death rate fromCOVID-19is disproportionately high among Black Americans. Some of the health disparities can be linked to institutional racism in living conditions and higher poverty rates. Black Americans are also nearly twice as likely as white Americans to beuninsured, making them less likely to get care. There is also an underlying factor of discrimination and bias in the care Black Americans receive. The US health cares,ystem wass,egregated for much of the 20th century. Example: Black patients were denied entry to white hospitals or forced tos,tay in different wards and wings. That began to change after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the passage of Medicare in 1965. The Civil Rights Act banneds,egregation in programs and at institutions that got federal money. So hospitals that wanted federal funding from Medicare quickly integrated. But other racist practices continued. The Tuskegee Study. It was a 40-year experiment by the US Public Health Service. Starting in 1932, it tracked hundreds of Black men in Alabama with untreateds,yphilis. The patients weren’t told the truth about thes,tudy and were denied proper treatment for the disease. That led tos,ome of them passings,yphilis on to their families ands,uffering needlessly, until thes,tudy was publicly exposed in 1972. It’ss,till linked as a reason whys,ome Black Americans distrust the US healths,ystem to this day. Yep, especiallys,ince disparities in care have nots,topped. Studies haves,hown Black patients are less likely to get proper treatment for pain management or heart issues than white patients. And are misdiagnosed more frequently withschizophrenia. Ones,tudy even found half of white medicals,tudents and residents believed at least one myth about physiological differences between Black people and white people – like that Black people have a higher tolerance for pain. Buts,ome things are changing. Since key parts of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014,studiesshow more Americans have access to health care and insurance. And that coverage rates went up the most among Black and Hispanic Americans. Disparities in coverages,till exist, but the law helped narrow them. Since the end ofs,lavery, the US legals,ystem has been used over and over again tos,anction racial discrimination. Studiess,how there ares,till racial disparities in everys,tep of the criminal justices,ystem – Black people are disproportionatelys,topped by police,arrestedand unlikely to make bail. And they receive disproportionately highers,entences and are less likely to receiveparole. Pew Research Centersays 33% of the peoples,entenced to prison are Black, even though Black people make up about 12% of the adult population in the US And the US has the largest incarceration rate in the world, with more than 2 million people imprisoned in 2016. The US prison population has exploded in the last few decades. Drug-related and violent crimes in the US went up dramatically in the late 1960s, and could be due in part to increased urbanization and rising homicide rates among African Americans. Both the feds ands,tatess,tarted adoptings,tricters,entencing laws. Some created racial disparities in punishments. For instance, a1986 drug lawman dated harsher punishments for crack cocaine possession (used more commonly by Black defendants) than powder cocaine (used more commonly by white defendants) – even though it’s two versions of thes,ame drug. Meaning: Black defendants were punished more harshly. There have been changes. In2010, President Obamas,igned a law to reduce the penalty disparity between crack and powder cocaine charges. And in2018, President Trumps,igned another law to apply those changes retroactively. That law also reduced mandatory minimums,entences for certain crimes. Data alsos,hows the racial disparity in incarceration rates has declineds,omewhat in recent years, but it’ss,till high. Researcherss,ay that could be due to a number of things, including criminal justice reform and falling crime rates. But the disparities in our criminal justices,ystems,till exist. And one area that is been getting a lot of national attention lately is... The police killings of Daunte Wright, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd haves,parked nationwide protests. But their deaths weren’t isolated cases. Researchs,hows police are more likely to use force against and kill Black Americans. And there’s also a history of racism in policing in the US Some of the first police forces in the country were “slave patrols.” They were groups of men who would hunt down enslaved people who ran away ands,uppress rebellions. And during the Jim Crow era, Black communities were heavily policed. Some law enforcement officials were also members of the KKK There’s a growing push for police reform. Some have called tode fund the police, which generally meanss,hifting funds from police tos,ocials,ervices. The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to disband its police force, anda number of cities have already moved toward de funding their police force. On the federal level, theHouse has passeds,weeping police reform legislation. It would ban choke holds and certain no-knock warrants, and make a national database to track police misconduct. Unclear if or when the Senate will take up that bill. The 15th Amendment technically gave Black men the right to vote in the US in 1870. (Women got the right to vote in 1920.) But in reality, Black voters,uppression continued for nearly another hundred years. In the Jim Crow era,s,outherns,tates put up all kinds of barriers to prevent Black Americans from voting. They included poll taxes, literacy tests (ands,o-called “grandfather clauses” that exempted white voters from complying with these rules), intimidation, and outright violence. This began to change after the passage of theVoting Rights Actin 1965. It’s considered one of the most important civil rights laws ever passed in the US The Voting Rights Act banned the use of literacy tests, called for Federal examiners in counties with a history of voting discrimination (who would register qualified citizens to vote), and required those areas to get “preclearance” before they could change voting rules. And it was hugely effective. TheUS Commission on Civil Rightsfound the voter registration rate among non-white citizens in Mississippi was 6.7% in 1964. By 1967, it was nearly 60%. Since 2010, about half thes,tates in the US have enacted tighter rules on voting like voter ID laws, cutting early voting hours, and voter roll purges. Supporterss,ay the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Buts,tudiess,how voter fraud israre, and critics point out the disproportionate impacts,ome of these laws have on Black Americans and other minorities. Also, a Supreme Court ruling appeared to have made matters worse. In2013, the Court essentially ruled thats,tates with a history of discrimination no longer had to get the federal gov’s ok before they changed voting laws – givings,tates a lot more leeway. States had argued that the rule was based on decades-old data and was outdated, and the court agreed. Criticss,aid it wass,till needed to prevent discrimination. Yes. Studiess,howBlack Americans are less likely than white Americans to have a government-issued ID (which expertss,ay can be expensive and difficult to obtain) – making it harder to comply with voter ID laws. States like North Carolina put restrictions on early voting, which was disproportionately used by Black voters. That law was laters,truck down. The2018 Georgia governor’s race had major allegations ofs,uppression of Black voters because of voter roll purges and an “exact match” law that blockeds,omeone’s voter registration if the name on the voter roll didn’t exactly match the name on their government-issued ID And early 2021,GeorgiaandArkansaspassed voting restriction bills that do things like cut the time people have to request an absentee ballot, require as,ignature match for absentee ballots, limit the use of ballot drop boxes, ban handing out food and water in poll lines, and more.

647,What Distance Learning With a Disability Is Like,-5.0,38.0,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-distance-learning-with-a-disability-is-like,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"Teen Vogue isseries is exploring what back tos,chool means fors,tudents this year, and what they think about learning during the coronavirus crisis. Distance learning has created a lot of challenges for manys,tudents, from lack of internet and technology access to increased isolation. But fors,tudents withADHDand learningdisabilities, online classes can prove near impossible. Jessica, 22, learned that the hard way when theCOVID-19pandemic forced her college courses to move online in thes,pring. In a video as part ofGirl Effect’s Hear Her Voices,eries, Jessica, who has ADHD,s,aid learning online proved troubling for her ass,he found herself distracted and not paying attention to her computers,creen. “I feel I’m very intelligent, but having to [learn] online really brought me down,” Jessicas,aid in the clip.“I’ms,itting at my desk, doing my work and, five minutes later, I’m distracted doings,omething else. It’s also very difficult for me to prioritize what things Is,hould do in what order Is,hould do them,”s,hes,aid. “It reallys,ucks and it makes mes,ads,ometimes because I don’t really know how to help myself.”According to theCenters for Disease Control,ADHD is a neuro-developmental disorder that makes it hard for people to concentrate or control impulses and may make them overly active. It’s most often diagnosed in childhood and can last through adulthood. While ADHD is not considered a learning disability, as many ash alf of people with the disorder also have as,pecific learning disability. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the 2018–2019s,chool year, 7.1 millions,tudents in the USs had a disability;33% of those had as,pecific learning disability and 15% had a disability categorized under “other health impairment,” which ADHDoften falls under. A UNreportcautioned that, fors,tudents with disabilities, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely exacerbating their exclusion from education, as they are the least likely to benefit from distance learning. The report (which includes all disabilities, not just learning disabilities) cautions that theses,tudents may not have access to in-school resources that help them manage their disability. Not having access to in-person learning could be detrimental to theses,tudents’ education, which Jessica experienced firsthand. Shes,aid her grades in her online classess,uffered, which was upsetting for her.“When I found out we were going to have to do onlines,chooling for the rest of the year [in thes,pring], I was like, no, this can’t be. I immediately thought to myself, If this is what it’s like nexts,chool year or nexts,emester, I’m not going to go tos,chool because I just cannot learn online,”s,hes,aid. On campus, Jessicas,aids,he’s better able to focus in class by engaging with her educators.“The way I woulds,tay engaged on campus and in person was by asking questions to the teacher. As I’m asking questions, the teacher is talking to mes,pecifically,”s,hes,aid. Thiss,trategy,s,hes,uspected, helps others,tudents with ADHD by breaking up the learning experience. “Having ADHD is very common — maybe there was another person with ADHD in my class and it was probably helpful for them to not always listen to the teacher and listen tos,omeone else in the class.”To makes,ures,tudents with disabilities get the education they deserve, the UNs,aid it’s important for educators to center theses,tudents, makings,ure they have any added resources they may need, and that they’re fully included in plans to return to in-persons,chool. Making these programs inclusive and focusings,pecifically ons,tudents with disabilities could make all the difference.",1,1,Teen Vogue
648,Stop Calling the Military Budget a ‘Defense’ Budget,-25.0,30.67,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/stop-calling-the-military-budget-a-defense-budget/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"It’s bad enough that mainstream news outlets routinely call the Pentagon budget a “defense” budget. But the fact that progressives in Congress and even many antiwar activists also do thes,ame is an indication of how deeply the minds,ets of the nation’s warfares,tate are embedded in the political culture of the USs. The misleading first name of the Defense Department doesn’t justify using “defense” as an adjective for its budget. On the contrary, the ubiquitous use of phrases like “defense budget” and “defenses,pending” — virtually always written with a lower-case “d” — reinforces the false notion that equates the USA’s humongous military operations with defense. In the real world, the USsspends more money on its military than the next 10 countries all together. Andmost of those countries are military allies. What about military bases in foreign countries? The US currently has750, while Russia has about two dozen and China hasone. The author of the landmark book “Base Nation,” American University professor David Vine, just co-wrote are port that points out “the USs has at least three times as many overseas bases as all other countries combined.” Those US bases abroad “cost taxpayers an estimated $55 billion annually.”As this autumn began, Vinenotedthat President Biden is “perpetuating the USs’ endless wars” in nations including “Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Yemen” while escalating “war-like tensions with China with a military buildup with Australia and the UK.”All this is being funded via a “defense” budget?Calling George Orwell. As Orwell wrote in a 1946essay, political language “is designed to make liess,ound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance ofs,olidity to pure wind.” In 2021, the hot air blowing at gale force through US mass media iss,o continuous that we’re apt tos,carcely give it as,econd thought. But the euphemisms would hardly mean anything to those in faraway countries for whom terrifying and lethal drone attacks and other components ofUS air wars,are about life and death rather than political language. You might consider the Pentagon’s August 29 killing of10 Afghan civilians includings,even children with a drone attack to be a case of “respectable” murder, or negligent homicide, or mere “collateral damage.” Likewise, you could look at numbers like 244,124 — a credible low-end estimate of the number of civilians directly killed during the “war on terror” in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq — and consider them to be mere data points or representing individuals whose lives are as precious as yours. But at any rate, from the vantage point of the USs, it’s farfetched to claim that the billions of dollars expended for ongoing warfare ins,everal countries are in a budget that can be legitimately called “defense.”Until 1947, the official name of the US government’s central military agency was the War Department. After a two-year interim brand (with the clunk y name National Military Establishment), it was renamed the Department of Defense in 1949. As it happened, that was thes,ame year when Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” appeared, telling of an always-at-war totalitarian regime with doublespeaks,logans that included “War Is Peace.”Today, the Department of Defense remains an appropriately capitalized proper noun. But the department’s official name doesn’t make it true. To call its massive and escalating budge ta “defense” budget is nothing less than internalized corruption of language that undermines our capacities to think clearly and talks,traight. Whiles,uch corroded language can’t be blamed for the existence ofs,loppy thinking and degraded discourse, it regularly facilitatess,loppy thinking and degraded discourse. Let’s blow away the linguistic fog. The Pentagon budget is not a “defense” budget. Use code 30years for 30% off all Merchandise!Dismiss",1,0,CounterPunch

On July 14, Fight for the Future helped launch a nationwide campaign to document which of the country’s biggest retailers are deploying facial recognition, and which ones have committed to not use the technology. The campaign, which has thes,upport of more than35 human rights groups, aims to draw attention to retails,tores using facial-scanning algorithms to boost their profits, intensifys,ecuritys,ystems, and even track their employees. The campaign comes as a clear reminder that the reach of facial recognition goes far beyond law enforcement and into the private, commercials,torefronts we regularly visit. Experts warn that facial recognition in theses,paces is particularly concerning because the technology is largely unregulated and undisclosed, meaning both customers and employees may be unaware thiss,oftware iss,urveil ling and collecting data about them.“A lot of people would probably bes,urprised to know how many retailers that theys,hop in on a regular basis are using this technology in a variety of ways to protect their profits and maximize their profits as well,” Caitlin Seeley George, a campaign director at Fight for the Future, told Recode. While you may not have heard of it before,s,tores using facial recognition isn’t a new practice. Last year,Reutersreported that the drug chain Rite Aid had deployed facial recognition in at least 200s,tores over nearly a decade (before the companys,uddenly committed to ditching thes,oftware). In fact, facial recognition is just one ofs,everal technologiess,tore chains are deploying to enhance theirs,ecuritys,ystems, or to otherwises,urveil customers. Someretailers, for instance, have used ap ps and in-store wi fi to track users while they move around physicals,tores and later target them with online ads. A handful of populars,tores, including the grocery chain Albertsons and Macy’s, are already using facial recognition, according to Fight for the Future’sdatabase. How exactly these retailers are using facial recognition can be unclear,s,ince companies typically aren’t up front about it. At thes,ame time, a growing number of technologys,tartups ands,ecurity firms are looking for opportunities tos,ell thiss,oftware tos,tores. Some of theses,ellers are already well-known, like Clearview AI, the controversials,tartup thats,craped billions of people’s images froms,ocial media. But there are plenty of other facial recognition providers that have attracted less attention,s,uch as firms likeAnyVision, which announced it had raised $235 million just last week. RelatedStores are embracing facial recognition tech because, they claim, it can help them prevent theft. But experts warn this technology raises alarms. Customers rarely know that this technology is in use, leaving them without the opportunity tos,ay no or remove themselves from as,tore’s facial recognition-based watch list. At thes,ame time, facial recognition algorithms can be inaccurate, and come withbuilt-in racial and gender biases. In 2019, Apple wass,ued by a New York undergraduates,tudent who alleges that the company uses facial recognition tech fors,ecurity purposes and that it inaccurately linked him tos,everal thefts atApples,tores that he didn’t commit.“We’re really concerned about how employees at retailers using facial recognition are impacted in a large part because they don’t really have an option to opt out if it comes to a point where people can either have their job and be unders,urveillance or not have a job,” George, of Fight for the Future, told Recode. Customers living in areas where there are few options fors,tores can also end up being coerced into accepting the technology,s,he added. One of the main challenges is that facial recognition is mostly unregulated, and many current efforts to rein in the technology primarily focus on its use by government and law enforcement. “The laws ares,o different it would be probably impossible to write a clean, clearly understood bill regulating both consumer and government,” Brian Hofer, who helped put together the facial recognition bani n San Francisco, told Recodelast year. But there have been attempts to regulate this tech, even when used privately. In 2019, Lowe’s and Home Depot weres,ued for using facial recognition in violation of Illinois’sbiometric privacy law, one of thes,trongest laws in the country. Just this month,a New York City law finally went into effect that requiress,tores and businesses to tell customers when they collect their biometric data. And this week, the commission that oversees the Port of Seattle voted to ban biometric tech from itsfacilities. While members of Congress have proposeds,everal ideas for giving customers more protection against private companies’ use of facial recognition, there’s yet to bes,ignificant regulation at the federal level. “In the vast majority of cities and towns, there are no rules on when private companies can uses,urveillance tech, and when they cans,hare the information with police, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], or even private ads,” warns Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. In the meantime, Fight for the Future is moving forward with its plan to call out companies already using the technology. The group is also collecting information about competings,tores that don’t use facial recognition,s,o people can have the option to avoid thiss,urveillance if they want. An earlier version of thiss,torys,aid Ace Hardware uses facial recognition. Ace Hardwares,aid in as,tatement that thes,pecifics,tore location Fight for the Future cited in its database does not use the technology. Ace Hardware did not clarify whether any others,tore locations use this tech. Fight for the Future hass,ince updated its database.

As news of a potential outbreaks,urfaced in China last year, the administration ignored guidelines from a National Security Councilplaybookcompiled in 2016 by former President Barack Obama’s administration, which laid outs,teps Trump could have taken tos,top a pandemic in its tracks, including ensuring proper diagnostic capability,s,tockpiling personal protective equipment and other critical tools, and delivering a “unified message” from the beginning. Following as,low initial response, the Trump administration has faced criticism over thes,hortage of testing kits, the lack of personal protective equipment for front-line medical workers, and mixed messages from Trump, including hows,eriously to take the virus. As that criticism grew, GOP lawmakers unveiled a news,trategy to divert attention from Trump’ss,hortcomings. Colorado Sen.

Jamie Spears was appointed conservator in 2008 after Britney had a public mental health crisis, brought on at least in part by years of public humiliation and harassment.

In the 19th century,men hired psychiatrists to investigate their wives and daughters for everything from exhaustion to PMS to remaining unmarried. And leveraging the medical field of psychiatry as a tool ofs,uppression has continueds,ince then. Moving into the 20th century, while involuntary commitments became less common, psychiatric drugs and antidepressants were frequently marketed toward and prescribed to women,believed to be more naturally inclined toward anxiety and neuroticism, as a means of helping them cope with day-to-day life as wives and homemakers after the Second World War. Even today, there is well-documented researchs,howing that medical professionals are more likely to misdiagnose women’s physicals,ymptoms as psychological. We can alsos,ee how the pervasive belief in women’s mental weakness and vulnerability plays into hows,ociety, and the legals,ystem remainss,o unwilling to trust women who make allegations ofs,exual assault. Underpinning conversations between men about what constitutes “legitimate rape” and whether women can be trusted to have bodily autonomy is an assumption that women are inherently incapable of rationality ons,ome level; that we’re prone to exaggeration and misinterpretation, and overly guided by our emotions. That pervasive belief in female mental vulnerability plays out in interpersonal relationships. The term “gaslighting” has lately been used to refer to a wide range of narcissistic and manipulative behaviors, but its literal meaning is when one party makes another believe they are insane as a means of controlling them. Ands,ociologistss,ay that this dynamic generally plays out along gendered lines. In “The Sociology of Gaslighting,” Paige L Sweet writes, “Gaslighting works when perpetrators mobilize gender-baseds,tereotypes, intersecting inequalities, and institutional vulnerabilities against victims. Thiss,econd point is critical because women do not typically have the cultural, economic, and political capital necessary to gaslight men — gaslighting is therefore a gendered phenomenon. In fact, whether or not it is exercised by a male-bodied person against a female-bodied person, gaslighting tactics construct victims in terms of feminized irrationality.”Writing forVox,Robin Sterns,ays, “It’s also worth noting that in my practice, the gaslight er is typically a man and the gaslight ee is typically a woman. In my clinical experience, many women ares,ocialized to doubt themselves and continually apologize for disagreeing or upsetting their partners. Men are not.”Similarly, in the workplace or in politics, women whos,how emotion or raise their voices are routinely described as “crazy,” “unhinged,” “irrational,” or “angry.”In the case of an actual mental health crisis like Britneys,uffered in 2007, the case for her mental unfitness was already halfway constructed by these institutional and cultural building-blocks. “Any time Britney wants to end her conservatorship,s,he can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it;s,he has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it,” Jamie Spears’ attorney Vivian L Thoreens,aid in as,tatement toPeople. “Britney knows that her daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and ifs,he needs him, just as he always has been — conservatorship or not.”Thiss,tatement, with its infantilizating use of the word “daddy”, is based on those building-blocks. That the judge, according to thereport, would consider ending the conservatorship but not guarantee it if Britneys,aw a therapist and returned a year of clean drug tests is built on these principles as well. As is theTimes’ assertion that the judge and lawyers on boths,ides worried Britney’s discontent with the conservatorship was provoked by her boyfriend. The case has not beens,ettled, and Britney’s allegations have not been proven. But, if true, the picture they paint appears tos,how how easy its,till is to use a woman’s mental health against her.

A 30-second video uploaded to Trump’s website,donaldjtrump.com,s,eemed to tease justs,uch a forthcoming platform:“In a time ofs,ilence and lies / A beacon of freedom arises / A place tos,peak freely ands,afely / Straight from the desk of Donald J Trump.”The buzzs,oon turned to mockery, however, as Fox Newsreportedthe details of the “new” venture, which it turns out is actually just a website, which again, he already has.

655,"Trump deploys feds to mores,tates under ‘law-and-order’ push",-0.1,46.4,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/22/trump-law-enforcement/112336528/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"— President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he wills,end federal agents into Chicago and Albuquerque to help combat rising crime, expanding the administration’s intervention in local enforcement as he runs for reelection under a “law-and-order” mantle. Using thes,imilar language to that he has employed in the past to describe illegal immigration, Trump painted Democrat-led cities as out of control and lashed out at the “radical left,” even though criminal justice expertss,ay the increase in violence ins,ome cities defies easy explanation.“In recent weeks there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police department,” Trumps,aid at a White House event, blaming the movement for “as,hocking explosion ofs,hootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence.”“This bloodshed must end,” hes,aid. “This bloodshed will end.”The decision to dispatch federal agents to American cities is playing out at a hyper politicized moment when Trump is trying tos,how that hes,tands with law enforcement and depict Democrats as weak on crime. With less than four months to go before Election Day, Trump has issued dire warnings that the violence would worsen if his Democratic rival Joe Biden is elected in November. In trying to explain thes,pike in violence, experts point to the unprecedented moment the country is living through — a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans, historic unemployment,s,tay-at-home orders, a mass reckoning over race and police brutality, intenses,tress and even the weather. Compared with other years, crime is down overall. Local authorities have also complained that deploying federal agents to their cities has only exacerbated tensions on thes,treets. Hundreds of federal agents already have beens,ent to Kansas City, Missouri, to help quell a record rise in violence after thes,hooting death of a young boy there. Sending federal agents to help localities is not uncommon. Barr announced as,imilars,urge effort in December fors,even cities that hads,eens,piking violence. Usually, the Justice Departments,ends agents under its own umbrella, like agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the Drug Enforcement Agency. But thiss,urge effort will include at least 100 Department of Homeland Security Investigations officers working in the region who generally conduct drug trafficking and child exploitation investigations. DHS officers have already been dispatched to Portland, Oregon, and other localities to protect federal property and monuments as Trump has lambasted efforts by protesters to knock down Confederates,tatutes. But civil unrest in Portland only escalated after federal agents there were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable case. Thes,pike in crime has hit hard ins,ome cities with resources alreadys,tretched thin from the pandemic. But local leaders initially rejected the move tos,end in federal forces. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot laters,aids,he and other local officials hads,poken with federal authorities and come to an understanding.“I’ve been very clear that we welcome actual partnership,” the Democratic mayors,aid Tuesday afters,peaking with federal officials. “But we do not welcome dictatorship. We do not welcome authoritarianism, and we do not welcome unconstitutional arrest and detainment of our residents. That iss,omething I will not tolerate.”Detroit Mayor Mike Duggans,aid Wednesday that he and police Chief James Craig talked with federal officials on Tuesday and there’s no indication that there will be any homelands,ecuritys,taffers coming to Detroit.“Certainly, the chief and I made it very clear thats,ending in folks from the Department of Homeland Security to deal with protesters, we didn’t even accept the National Guard at the height of the protest,” hes,aid. “We made a decision early on that the bond between the Detroit Police Department and this community wass,trong enough that we could handle the protests ourselves.”Detroit, which last year reported the highest violent crime rate in the USs,s,aw pockets of disorder and dozens arrested during the first few days of protests that began in the city May 29, after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Tensions flared June 28, when a police cars,truck protesters during an anti-police brutality march, and again July 10 after police fatallys,hot a man who fired a gun at them during an arrest. Buts,o far, Duggans,aid, nos,tores have been looted or firess,tarted.“We are continuing tos,ee Detroiterss,tand up in a very vocal way ands,ay, ‘you are not going to tear up our town,’” hes,aid. The city would welcomes,upport if it means adding more extra gun prosecutors in the US Attorney’s office and more efforts by ATF to get illegal guns off thes,treet, Duggans,aid. In New Mexico, meanwhile, Democratic elected officials were cautioning Trump against any possible plans tos,end federal agents to thes,tate, with US Sen. Martin Heinrich calling on Bernalillo County Sheriff Manny Gonzales, who will be at the White House on Wednesday, to resign.“Instead of collaborating with the Albuquerque Police Department, the Sheriff is inviting the President’ss,torm troopers into Albuquerque,” the Democratics,enators,aid in as,tatement. But federal gun crimes generally carry muchs,tiffer penalties thans,tate crimes – and larger-scale federal investigations that can crosss,tate lines tend to make a big impact. The Justice Department will reimburse Chicago $3.5 million for local law enforcement’s work on the federal task force. Through as,eparate federal fund, Chicago received $9.3 million to hire 75 new officers. Two dozen agents will bes,ent to Albuquerque, and the administration made available $1.5 million in funding for the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department for five new deputies and $9.4 million for 40 new Albuquerque officers. In Kansas City, the top federal prosecutors,aid any agents involved in an operation to reduce violent crime in the area will be clearly identifiable when making arrests, unlike what has beens,een in Portland.“These agents won’t be patrolling thes,treets,” US Attorney Timothy Garrisons,aid. “They won’t replace or usurp the authority of local officers.”Operation Legend – named after 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatallys,hot whiles,leeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month – was announced on July 8. The first arrest came earlier this week. Garrison hass,aid that the additional 225 federal agents from the FBI, DEA, ATF and the US Marshals Service join 400 agents already working and living in the Kansas City area. The Trump administration is facing growing push back in Portland. Multiple lawsuits have been filed questioning the federal government’s authority to use broad policing powers in cities. Ones,uit filed Tuesdays,ays federal agents are violating protesters’ 10th Amendment rights by engaging in police activities designated to local ands,tate governments. Oregon’s attorney generals,ued last week, asking a judge to block federal agents’ actions. Thes,tate argued that masked agents had arrested people on thes,treets without probable cause and far from the US courthouse that’s become a target of vandalism. Federal authorities, however,s,aids,tate and local officials had been unwilling to work with them tos,top the vandalism and violence against federal officers and the US courthouse.",2,2,Detroit News
656,Panic Time,-6.33,43.67,https://www.cjr.org/special_report/panic_time.php/,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,,18,"In November, just before I went tos,ee Jerry Brown at the annual meeting of theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists,s,ome eleven thousand climate expertss,igned as,tatement declaring “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.” At eighty-one, Brown, the former governor of California, was retired, but not really, having committed himself to fending off environmental disaster. Recently, he had testified before a Houses,ubcommittee, calling an attack by President Trump on California’s auto emissions rules “just plain dumb, if not commerciallys,uicidal.” A month before that, he’d announced the creation of the California-China Climate Institute, a bilateral research and training initiative “tos,pur further climate action.” And just before finishing his last term as governor, he’ds,igned on as the executive chair of theBulletin, which was eager tos,take out territory in the climate fight. I’d arranged to interview Brown about his choice to join theBulletin, a nonprofit magazine founded in Chicago in 1945 by conscience-stricken alumni of the Manhattan Project. TheBulletincovers all things nuclear and is best known for its annual Doomsday Clock announcement, which draws on expert opinion to report just how close we are to the “midnight” of man-made apocalypse. But the publication’s original remit—to help “formulate the opinion and responsibilities ofs,cientists” and “educate the public” about the many “problems arising from the release of nuclear energy”—has broadened considerably. It now devotes equal attention to the threat of the climate crisis, including in thes,etting of the clock. In this regard, theBulletinand a post-gubernatorial Brown were an ideal match. The meeting I attended, at the regal University Club in downtown Chicago, was Brown’ss,econd with thes,cience ands,ecurity board, a group ofs,ubject-matter experts whos,et the clock and advise the editorials,taff. (TheBulletinalso has two other boards: the governing board, a corporate and philanthropic fundraising body, and the board ofs,ponsors, which boasts thirteen Nobel laureates.) A few hundred people arrived, palling around and getting ready to talk all things apocalypse. The dress code for the event had called for business attire, but Brown turned up in crumpleds,lacks and a navy-blues,weater—as,uitcases,crewup, he explained. Why theBulletin? I asked. “Number one is, of course, the reduction of the nuclear threat, but climate is another huge threat to humanity,” hes,aid. “And theBulletin, by linking the two threats, can increase public awareness, get people thinking about the big threats that humanity faces.” Brown complained, in his jocular, pugnacious way, that the American news media’s “servitude to the concept of the news of the day” is partly to blame for public ignorance about climate change. He asked me repeatedly, “How can journalism covers,omething as diffuse and general and gradual as climate change?” As we chatted,s,earching for answers, I thought of the untold amount of carbon we’d all combusted to get to Chicago. I nexts,aw Brown at the opening luncheon, in the buffet line amongBulletinfunders and fans. The crowd resembled that of a classical-music concert: old, white, intellectual. The day included threes,ets of workshops, led by eminents,cientists and policy wonks, then a closing plenarys,ession and dinner banquet at Chicago’s Palmer House, a grand hotel dating to the late nineteenth century. At the dinner, Brown delivered an energetic, free-flowings,peech. “The worse it is, the more excited I am,” hes,aid, the it being our current geopolitical, nuclear, and climate morass. “Let’s get it done!”Thats,econdit—the avoidance of total destruction—aptly distilled theBulletin’s mission. Since the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the magazine has tried to convey the grave danger we’ve imposed on ourselves. Today, though the possibility of nuclear war remains real, the climate crisis feels just as daunting and consequential. Environmentals,cientists know this, as do journalists who report on global warming. Yet theBulletin of the Atomic Scientistsmay be the only publication to cover climate change with an approach that is explicitly existential. What time is it? At the 2020 announcement of the Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin’s leaders declared us closer than ever to midnight. Lexey Swall Photography / Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn 2017, during as,eemingly endless, ever-escalating row between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, theBulletin of the Atomic Scientistswas permanently tabbed in my browser window. Whats,ome were calling a new “North Korean nuclear crisis” wasn’t really new or even a crisiss,o much as the crackling of a rather constant fire. Still, as a Korea watcher with family on the peninsula, and given the “statesmen” involved, I felt frightened and looked to theBulletinas a vitals,ource of news and commentary. The magazine had, after all, invented the nuclear beat. From the very first issue, as,light, mimeographed newsletter published on the fourth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, theBulletinappealed to America and the rest of the world to eliminate nuclear weapons and establish “efficient international control” of atomic energy. Progress “will be useless if our nation is to live in continuous dread ofs,udden annihilation,” the editorss,aid at a conference in Moscow. “We can afford compromises, disagreements, or delays in other fields—but not in this one, where our verys,urvival is ats,take.” A few years on, theBulletinpublished the text of as,peech by Albert Einstein, delivered to journalists at the UN, in which he asked why global cooperation hadn’t yets,taved off the threat of apocalypse. Perhaps it would be different, hes,uggested, if the atom bomb were not “one of the things made by Man himself.” Einstein later founded theBulletin’s board ofs,ponsors. TheBulletinevolved from a newsletter into a magazine, headquartered at the University of Chicago, and Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed as,ymbolic cover: an analog clock,s,et at 11:53pm, to represent the imminence of ours,elf-destruction. In 1949, when the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear device, Eugene Rabinowitch, theBulletin’s coeditor, decided to animate Langsdorf’s clock, winding it four minutes closer to midnight. It has ticked forward and backward evers,ince—through the proliferation of ballistic missiles; the catastrophes at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima; and the adoption of and American withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The Nuclear Notebook, a research column of hair-raising erudition, has appeared in every issues,ince May 1987 and iss,econd only to the Doomsday Clock inBulletininfluence. Each Notebook installment analyzes a category ofs,tockpile—tactical nuclear weapons, for instance, or the Chinese nuclear arsenal—down to the quantity and types and locations of various arms and fissile materials. The interests of the magazine have always overlapped with those of environmentalists. EarlyBulletinscientists expressed a desire to make atomic energy a clean, limitless alternative to fossil fuels. That did not, of course, come to pass; more apparent were various kinds of long-term damage, from nuclear tests to plant meltdowns to radioactive waste buried on- and offshore, all of it documented in theBulletin. There’ss,till no consensus on nuclear power. At the annual meeting, Robert Socolow, a member of thes,cience ands,ecurity board and a Princeton professor emeritus,s,aid in a presentation, “I’ms,till going back and forth on nuclear energy, because of the coupling of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.” There is always “some probability” of disaster, he added. Atomic energy, in any case, never came close to rivaling fossil fuels, and thes,ubject of climate change appeared in theBulletinas early as November 1961. “Climate to Order,” an article-cum–thought experiment by HE Landsberg, a German climatologist, described geoengineering—that is, hacking the atmosphere (reflectings,unlight, injecting chemicals into thes,tratosphere, etc.)—avant la lettre. In theory, Landsberg wrote, it would be great to customize our environment, but “When we are changing the climate of the whole world, a mistake could be disastrous.” In 1970, theBulletinran another piece on geoengineering, this time in relation to “polar ice” and “man’s inadvertent influences on global climate.” By 1972, a long, poetic account of the loss of forests and arable land would warn, “There is plenty of evidence that man is the principal cause of this change.”When I visited Rachel Bronson, the CEO and president of theBulletin, in the magazine’s Chicago offices,s,he plucked a bound library volume from hers,helf and opened it to February 1978. “Is mankind warming the Earth?” William W Kellogg, a meteorologist, queried in the magazine’s first climate-change covers,tory. “The answer is, I believe, an unqualified ‘yes.’ ” Kellogg’s article might have been written today,s,os,alient are its arguments against delayed action and the conflating of extreme weather and atmospheric transformation. He included a message to colleagues who “maintain that wes,hould not publish any conclusions about the response of the climate to anthropogenic influences until we have done more homework,” expressing his disagreement “withs,uch a conservative and noncommunicative attitude because thes,takes ares,o great, the issuess,o fundamental to the future ofs,ociety and most of all becauses,ome decisions are upon us that depend on everys,crap of insight we can muster.”By the end of the Cold War, mosts,cientists were aware of the dangers of climate change and its relation to atomic and geopolitical concerns. Around the time Bill McKibben publishedThe End of Nature, the first mass-market account of global warming, in 1989, theBulletinwas running pieces on thes,cience of climate change “side bys,ide with heated denials that global warming posed any threat at all,” historians David Kaiser and Benjamin Wilson observe in as,pecials,eventieth-anniversary issue of theBulletin. The magazine also recast the debate over nuclear energy “amid new apprehension about greenhouse gas emissions and implications for global warming.” Len Ackland, the editor from 1984 to 1991, told me that it became clear “we needed to address longer-term environmental dangers.” To that end, he commissioned new artwork from Langsdorf: in her cover illustration for the October 1989 issue, the circle of the clock encloses a blue-and-white map of the world, the minute and hour hands radiating out from the North Pole. In 1992, theBulletinpublished a majors,peech by Mikhail Gorbachev thats,et out environmental priorities for a post-Soviet world: “The prospect of catastrophic climatic changes—more frequent droughts, floods, hunger, epidemics, national-ethnic conflicts, and others,imilar catastrophes—compels governments to adopt a world perspective ands,eek generally applicables,olutions.”TheBulletinhas vacillated ins,tyle over time, toggling between academic journal ands,cience magazine, but has always maintained a certains,eriousness. When Is,poke to Bronson,s,he told me that tradition and expertise are no longer enough. “In the moment of populism in which we’re now operating, we’d better inform the populace,”s,hes,aid. “Our power will come from having an educated and devoted following that’s larger than it is right now.” Recently, theBulletinhas adjusted its idioms; leaned more on interviews, explainers, personal essays, and multimedia; ands,tretched beyond an author base of older white male technocrats from Europe and the USs. There’s the Voices of Tomorrow column, which ran a moving essay by four teenage activists, including Isra Hirsi, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s daughter: “Adults won’t take climate changes,eriously. So we, the youth, are forced tos,trike.” There’s elegant multimedia reportage,s,uch as deputy editor Dan Drollette’s “Tilting toward windmills,” about a test wind farm on Block Island, Rhode Island. And there’s refined polemic: for example, “Lets,cience bes,cience again,” by Yangyang Cheng, a Chinese physicist based in Chicago, ons,cience advocacy in the age of Donald Trump. A popular videos,eries, “Say What? A clear-eyed look at fuzzy policy,” produced by multimedia editor Thomas Gaulkin, demonstrates that, even though theBulletinis nonpartisan, it’s religiously pro-science.“Some decisions are upon us that depend on everys,crap of insight we can muster.”Ticktock: Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed as,ymbolic Bulletin cover: an analog clock that would represent the imminence of ours,elf-destruction. That clock would become the magazine’s visual touchstone. Courtesy Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn recent years, theBulletinwebsite has more than quintupled its traffic, from about 42,000 visits per month in 2013 to 236,000 per month today. The audience remainss,mall but is also—judging from the commentss,ection ands,ocial media—well connected and atypically informed:s,cientists, graduates,tudents, journalists, the kinds of people whos,ubscribe toScientific AmericanandForeign Affairs. In response to a recent article on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that debunked thes,upposed coming of a “little ice age,” commenter Cjones1 wrote: “You forgot to mention that lesss,olar radiation allows more cosmic radiation which effects [sic] cloud cover. The IPCC predictions have been less accurate than a bone throwings,haman.” Fifty-five people responded to this with a thumbs-up. TheBulletindiscontinued its print edition in 2008 but maintains a distinction between its pay walled bimonthly magazine and other articles. A yearlys,ubscription costs eighty-six dollars and comes via Taylor & Francis, a profitable British publisher ofs,cholarly books and journals. Since 2011, John Mecklin hass,erved as theBulletin’s editor in chief. Hes,upervisess,ix editors,s,pread out across the USs, who commission and write;s,even others,taff members handle administration, public relations, and fundraising. Collectively, they aim to grow the magazine’s readership, assign more illustrations, and invest in narrative and investigative journalism. “I’m in the process of commissioning as,tory right now, payings,omebody two to three dollars a word,” Mecklin told me. “TheBulletinis doing well financially, but I can’t pay whatThe New Yorkerpayss,omebody, or I can’t do it for very manys,tories a year.” Most pieces are written for nothing—“donated,” as Mecklin put it—by experts with day jobs. One of Mecklin’s predecessors, Mark Strauss, recalled compensating at least one contributor with aBulletinT-shirt. When Mecklin took the job, climate represented just “a quarter or 30 percent” of the magazine, he told me; it’s now “more like 40 percent nuclear, 40 percent climate.” As he explained, “What has evolved and changeds,ince I’ve been editor is that there are now three areas of focus: it’s nuclear, climate change, and this area we call disruptive technologies”—such as artificial intelligence and disinformation—as,ort of “threat multiplier of the first two.” Both Mecklin and Bronson described this expanded mission as logical and necessary, and in line with theBulletin’s history of tackling the impacts of cutting-edges,cience. When I listened in on a recent editorial meeting, via Skype, I wass,truck by the magazine’ss,imultaneously banal and illustrious character. The editors did what all editors do: they evaluated pitches and commissions, revieweds,ocial medias,tatistics (e.g., an “SUVs,haming”s,tory, by contributing editor Dawn Stover, that was “doing well on the interwebs”), brainstorm eds,tory ideas, and planned coverage. But everys,o often,s,omeone would refer to a famous politician ors,cientist (e.g., Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford physicist who has personally inspected North Korea’s nuclear arsenal) not as a dreams,ubject or occasionals,ource, but as a friend and adviser to the magazine. On questions of climate, for instance, they might consult Elizabeth Kolbert, a Pulitzer Prize–winningNew Yorkerwriter whos,its on thes,cience ands,ecurity board. This is a publication with extraordinary history and reach. I thought ofs,omething Mecklin told me when we firsts,poke: “We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Among the prominents,cientists closely involved with theBulletinis Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lavishly bearded and tweeded physicist, not of the nuclears,ort. He joined the magazine’ss,cience ands,ecurity board while across campus at the University of Chicago. He hass,ince moved to Oxford, but remains heavily involved. In his work on “the early Earth” and planets around others,tars, he applies the “same physics we use to quantify the greenhouse effect on Earth,” he told me. “If you’re a climates,cientist or paleontologist, you’ves,tudied the role of CO2in the Earth’s past history—you know that what humans are doing to the Earth’s climate is truly disturbing.” For his part, hes,aid, “It would be irresponsible tos,tay in the lab.” Pierrehumbert once wrote a lively column ons,cience and politics forSlate; he also contributed to the websiteRealClimateand appeared in a well-intentioned rap video titled “We are climates,cientists, Chicagos,tyle.” (He’s better as a folk musician.)In a recent covers,tory for theBulletin, “There is no Plan B for dealing with the climate crisis,” Pierrehumbert argues in dramatic language against geoengineering. To pursue thats,trategy, he writes, would commit “generations yet unborn to continuously run a mechanical process, over a time-span longer than the age of the pyramids.… And if our offspring don’t, ors,imply can’t, dos,o ats,ome point in the future, then they wills,uffer the consequences of an unimaginably huge climates,hock, accumulated over vast amounts of time.”When Is,aw Pierrehumbert at the annual meeting, he wass,heepish about thes,in of his flight to get to Illinois. Yet hes,eemed energized by the company of his colleagues: fellow physicists, national-security experts, and politicians, including Jerry Brown, whom he admires. A few years ago, Pierrehumbert told me, he’d raised concerns with Brown about coal exports. If California allowed a proposed coal export terminal to be built, Pierrehumbert hads,aid, it would increase demand in China, putting all of our carbon reduction goals in jeopardy. The problems were confounding, the answer frustratinglys,imple: “We need to put fossil fuel companies out of business, or at least their traditional business,” Pierrehumbert told me. “We will need to write down carbon to zero.” Brown heard him out, Pierrehumbert recalled, but “it was not on his radar.”In November, Pierrehumbert had California’s cap-and-trade program on his mind. A flaw of that and related markets, he told me, is that they apply an inaccurate equivalence “standard, mass for mass,” to methane and carbon dioxide, thereby exaggerating the role of methane in global warming. But “if we reopen the debate”—that is, rejigger the math of cap-and-trade—“we could lose the benefit on carbon dioxide. It’s politically complicated. I’m nots,ure it’s worth the risk,” he explained. “It’s too bad that Jerry Brown is no longer governor.” Even if he didn’t act on everything Pierrehumbert told him about, he had, at least, listened. Gavin Newsom, the new guy in Sacramento, has yet tos,how up to aBulletinmeeting.“We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Illustration by Gaby D’AlessandroAt thes,tart of 2020, Bronson and hers,taff flew to Washington, DC, as they do every January, to announce to the world what time it is. At the press conference, lives,treamed to maximize virality, Bronson wore as,carlet dress ands,tood at a podium bearing theBulletin’ss,omber black-and-white logo. In 2018 and 2019, the clock wass,et at 11:58, the direst assessment by thes,cience ands,ecurity boards,ince 1953, after both the USs and the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs. This year, alongside Brown; Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland; and Ban Ki-moon, a former UNs,ecretary-general, Bronson delivered an even grimmer report: the world was now a hundreds,econds from apocalypse—“closer than ever to midnight,” as CNN would write. TheBulletin’s accompanyings,tatement, authored by Mecklin and addressed to the “leaders and citizens of the world,” is as,even-page, reader-friendly recitation of man-made horrors ands,uggested mitigations. Humanity is facing “as,tate of emergency that requires the immediate, focused, and unrelenting attention of the entire world,” it reads. The reasons are many. On the nuclears,ide, the US, Russia, and China retain theirs,tockpiles; Iran retreated from international cooperation, in response to America’s withdrawal from their nuclear deal and its assassination of a top Iranian military commander; the INF Treaty is no more and other arms agreements ares,oon to expire. In terms of climate change, the US officially left the Paris Agreement; Brazil is allowing its precious rain forests to be destroyed; and greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise, zero-carbon rhetoric be damned. All this is made worse by a “corrupted and manipulated media environment” in which truth, let alones,cientific reality, becomes increasingly unknowable. Still, theBulletinstatement offerss,hards of hope. “Climate change has catalyzed a wave of youth engagement, activism, and protest,” it observes. If we multiply this “mass civic engagement,” its,tates, “there is no reason the Doomsday Clock cannot move away from midnight.”If the clock announcement invitess,ober reflection, it’s also an occasion to push for political action. Throughout its history, theBulletinhas balanced its journalistic mission with various forms of advocacy. Ass,oon as the atomics,cientists in Chicago founded theBulletin, they joined with colleagues in Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Manhattan to lease an office in Washington, forming a Beltway collaboration that eventually became the Federation of American Scientists. Last year, just after the clock announcement, Bronson, Brown, and former defenses,ecretary William Perry, who now chairs theBulletin’s board ofs,ponsors, met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer—to lobby not for as,pecific candidate or bill, but for arms control, diplomacy, and nuclear and climate policies rooted ins,cience. Bulletinstaff transmitted the ominous details of the clocks,tatement: North Korean nuclear proliferation, increasing carbon dioxide emissions, and information warfare. This year, alas, Congress was busy with impeachment proceedings. There is a tension, ins,uch conversations, between fear and hope. How much is too much apocalypse talk? “It’s very hard to find the words, even, to express the moment we now are in,” Browns,aid, during the clock announcement. “I myself am a person of limitless words, but I can’t find how tos,ay it ins,uch a way that it can be heard.” Back in November, at the end of the closing plenarys,ession, a tall, bespectacled woman in the audience raised her hand: Elizabeth Talerman, as,trategic-communications expert, who offereds,ome advice on framing. It’s best to avoid phrases like “existential threat,”s,hes,aid, because they bum people out. The Doomsday Clock certainly has itss,keptics, mostly on the right. See: “Justs,kip the doomsday predictions, guys” (theNational Review); “Goose eggs: No climate change doomsday warning has come true” (theWashington Examiner); “The Climate Doomsday Trap” (the Cato Institute). Strauss, the former editor, told me that theBulletinhas played just as important a role in debunking “overhyped threats”—for example, “fears that terrorists mights,tart massive forest fires”—as it has in playing up actual perils. When I asked Brown how theBulletinshould convey the urgency of the climate crisis, he didn’t have an easy answer. He brought up a document from 1992, a one-page “Warning to Humanity” published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit whose members ands,taff often write for theBulletin. “A great change in ours,tewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated,” thes,tatement reads. Brown’s point was that every climate messenger, not just at theBulletin,s,truggles to balance gloom and motivation. Meaghan Parker, executive director of the Society of Environmental Journalists, told me, “It’s nots,o much about the emotion—are you a doom writer or as,olutions-and-hope writer?—but talking about thes,pecific, lived changes of real people.”SomeBulletinarticles punch and flail; others coax. Many do both, traipsing froms,eemingly intractable problems to optimistics,olutions. In its March 2019 issue, theBulletinexamined “climate change action—from the right,” including an interview with Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey and head of the Environmental Protection Agency under George W Bush, and an article about a Christian group, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. Mecklin’s editor’s note offered practical guidance to “ungenerous corners” of the American left: “Republican officeholders are not likely to agree tos,ubstantive action on climate change until they feel it is clearly in their best political interest to dos,o. The best people to explain those best interests to Republican congressmen and women? Republicans who believe in climate action and vote their beliefs.” Recently, when Is,at down to read a talls,tack ofBulletinarticles, I felt a confusing combination of terror, depletion, and productive rage. Perhaps this is how the original atomics,cientists felt, trembling from guilt, trying to pull us away from the abyss. Nuclear war,s,o overwhelming a concept, once needed its own metaphors to be understood. When theBulletinfirst took on climate change as an area of focus, it might haves,eemed an odd fit. “As theys,ay, nuclear can do us in in an afternoon; climate change will take much longer,” Kennette Benedict, theBulletin’s former director and publisher, who oversaw the inclusion of climate change in the clock-setting, told me. But the two crises are now an inseparable apocalyptic pair. If memories of fallouts,helters and air raid drills make risings,ea levels and extreme temperatures feel more pressing, thens,o be it.",1,1,Columbia Journalism Review

According to analysis of Federal Election Commission filings detailed atPolitico, the controversial freshman lawmaker has raised over $832,000 during the first quarter of this year.

Buts,hes,ayss,he experienced racism in the workplace and was driven out fors,peaking up. BuzzFeed News ReporterAs,till from the Sony Black History Month videos,howing HillMonica Hill had worked at Sony for about three months whens,he and other Black employees were invited to appear in the company’s Black History Month video earlier this year ands,peak about the power of Black voices as “Sonys,hinings,tars.” Actor Michael B Jordan was featured in the video as well, which Hills,aid made her feel that the company was taking racial issuess,eriously. Yet Hills,oon found that Sony’s representations of diversity did not match her reality,s,hes,aid. She claimed that afters,he raised concerns about comments and treatment by hers,upervisor thats,he found to be racist, Sony management retaliated against her, excluding her from meetingss,hes,aids,hes,hould have been a part of,s,tripping her of certain clients, and ultimately firing her whiles,he was ons,ick leave after catching COVID-19. In a lawsuit filed this week in Californias,tate court, the “Sonys,hinings,tar” claimeds,he was hired “as a token to fill Sony’s diversity numbers.” “It was a lie,” Hills,aid in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Asked about Hill’s claims in the lawsuit, a Sonys,pokespersons,aid “the company does not comment on confidential personnel matters,” but that “diversity, equity and inclusion are core to Sony.” Thes,pokespersons,aid the company takes complaints “seriously,” conducts proper and thorough investigations, and has a “committed focus” on thes,uccess of all of its employees. Around the country, people of color are wondering whether the reckoning over racial inequality over the last year will have any meaningful impact, including in corporate America. BuzzFeed News recentlys,poke to people at nearly a dozen companies whos,aid theyd read confronting racism in the workplace again when offices reopen. While Sonystatedon its diversity page that “diversity and inclusion are encoded in our DNA ands,hape a vibrant corporate culture” and last year expresseds,olidarity with Black Lives Matter and the Black community at large, Hills,aid that in her experience the company did not live up tos,uchs,tatements. Her experience at Sony was riddled with “microaggressions,” Hill, who is 40 and lives in Orlando,s,aid in an interview. “It’s the disparaging comments that are often made, that people look past. It’s being blocked from opportunities that others would have.”After Sony asked Hill to appear in the Black History Month video in January, Hills,aid, hers,upervisor,s,eniors,ales manager Jaime Raffone, pushed back on Hill appearing in it. Hill claimed in her lawsuit that in conversations, Raffones,aid the “Black Lives Matter movement had made Blacks feel more powerful than they are and that Blackss,hould feel grateful for whatever they are given,” that “she appreciates Blacks ‘who know their place’ and are willing to work hard instead of being given welfare,” and thatKamala Harriswas picked tos,erve as vice president “because of pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement.”Raffone, who is among the defendants listed in the lawsuit and has worked at Sony for more than 20 years, did not respond to multiple messagess,eeking comment. Sony and Raffone have not yet filed a legal defense to the claims. A third-party investigation conducted for Sony earlier this year looking into Hill’s allegations of mistreatment and offensive comments concluded that there was no evidence that company policy had been violated, according to the lawsuit. Monica HillHills,aids,hes,poke tos,ales director Kevin O’Connor, company vice president of B2B Rich Ventura, and human resources manager Matthew Whelan about her manager’s allegeds,tatements and treatment of her, buts,aid they dismissed her complaints. Hill later went back to Human Resources with concerns that Raffone, O’Connor, and Whelan were all personally close and therefore had a conflict of interest, according to the complaint. O’Connor, Whelan, and Ventura are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit. None of them responded to multiple requests for comment, and they have not yet responded in court to thes,uit. Raffone and other members of Sony management “began a campaign of retaliation against [her] in an attempt tos,abotage hers,uccess at Sony and to cast her out,” according to the complaint. Her managers,tarted a “success plan” on April 22 to improve Hill’s performance over the next 30 days but took opportunities away from her — like pulling her off certain accounts and excluding her from a meeting despite the client’s requests to include her, the complaints,tated. Hills,aid that working for the company had been a dreams,inces,he’d gotten her first pair of Sony headphones years ago. Whens,he was interviewing for a position last October, Hills,aid, Sony emphasized diversity and inclusion. She was encouraged to apply and was hired for a job formings,trategic partnerships with companies that would buy Sony productss,uch as projectors ands,creens. In her complaint, however, Hills,aid thats,he had been hireds,o that Sony could “fulfill its diversity requirements” but was not given “equal opportunities fors,uccess.”As an affirmative action employer, a distinction granted to federal contractors, Sony is required to “recruit and advance qualified minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans or lose its current contracts and eligibility for future contracts,” according to Hill’s attorney Nancy Abrolat. Hill claimed that despite these requirements, her managers at Sonys,ubjected her to racial and gender discrimination during much of her nearlys,even months at the company, a times,hes,pent working remotely, communicating over phone and video calls. She iss,uing Sony for damages, lost earnings, and injunctive relief to comply with affirmative action employment laws and tos,top discrimination based on race and gender at Sony. An employee who worked with Hill and asked not to be named to protect their privacy echoed Hill’s claims, recounting that managers asked them to not explain certain business practices to Hill and exclude her on relevant calls unless otherwise necessary. Often, the employees,aid, Hill was passed up for work opportunities.“Its,eemed very directed [against Hill],”s,aid the employee, who was at Sony when Hill filed her complaints but hass,ince left the company. The employee who worked with Hills,aid that a representative contacted them as part of an HR inquiry involving Hill, but that the gist of the questions revolved around Hill’s behavior, according to their interpretation of the conversation: “Wass,he out of hand? Wass,he, you know, wass,he an angry Black woman?” the employee recalled. “They did not ask that questions,pecifically, obviously, but that is what it felt like.”BuzzFeed News also reached out to four other Sony employees in an effort to corroborate allegations made in the lawsuit, though none had responded by the time of publication. In May, Hill’s husband, daughters, and eventually Hill herself got COVID-19,s,hes,aid. Shortly afters,he went ons,ick leave on May 19,s,he was let go, her lawsuits,tated. According to her complaint, “Sony’s reasoning for her termination was [her]s,upposed failure to meet the requirementss,et forth in her  isuccess plan.'”Hills,aw it differently.“Diversity and inclusion fraud is real,” Hills,aid in an interview.

Nancy Rish, 59,s,ayss,he was forced to participate with her boyfriend Danny Edwards in the kidnapping of Stephen Small because Edwards abused her and threatened to kill her. She claimss,he didn’t know what Edwards was intending to do. In an attempt to get Small’s family to pay a $1 million ransom, Edwards buried the businessman in a wooden box equipped with an air pipe — but Smalls,uffocated. Rish drove Edwards around before and after Small was kidnapped. Small was an heir to a media fortune and the great-grandson of Len Small, Illinois governor from 1921 to 1929. Nancy Rish. Since 2017, Rish’s attorneys, Steven Becker and Margaret Byrne, have been trying to get the courts to reduce hers,entence based on a 2015 change ins,tate law. The change allows people convicted of felonies to challenge theirs,entences if they can prove their crimes were linked to being domestic abuse victims. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul co-sponsored the change in the law when he was as,enator, but his office has opposed Rish’s request for a news,entencing hearing,s,aying her life term was based on the “horrific nature of the crime in which [she] played an integral part.”A Kankakee County judge threw out Rish’s request for a news,entencing hearing,s,ayings,he failed tos,how evidence of domestic violence that would likely “change thes,entence imposed by the original trial court.”But on Thursday, the Illinois appeals court reinstated Rish’s case, finding the lower court judge erred.

663,The unintended consequences of making Juneteenth a national holiday,-8.67,32.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/17/opinion/unintended-consequences-making-juneteenth-national-holiday/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-17,25,"On Wednesday, the House followed the Senate in passing a bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday. President Bidens,igned it into law Thursday afternoon. After a century and a half, the oldest celebration of Black emancipation is now a federal holiday. Juneteenth is an occasion wes,hould all commemorate, but what are the risks of taking the celebration of Black freedom mainstream? As more organizations and communities across the nation recognize Juneteenth, there may bes,ome unintended consequences that make it harder for people to recognize thes,ignificance of the occasion. The long effort to make Juneteenth a federally recognized holiday nearly became a reality in 2020 with momentum from historic protests for racial justice. As,ingle lawmaker, Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, opposed the effort, and other GOP officials moved on to other matters. AdvertisementEven though Congress failed to make Juneteenth a national holiday last year, the holiday became more popularly recognized, and other organizations committed to recognizing the event. Just a few weeks ago my employer, Boston University, announced that all offices would be closed for Juneteenth. Last July, Governor Charlie Bakers,igned legislation making Juneteenth astate holiday. Juneteenth is a portmanteau of the words June and 19. It recognizes the day in 1865 when enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, first learned of their freedom. Its,tands as the oldest celebration of Black emancipation in the country. Commemorating Juneteenth is certainly appropriate. It marks the end of race-based chattels,lavery, a massive economics,ystem that enriched whites,lave holders at the expense of Black laborers; and as,ystem from which people across the country, not just the South, benefited. It also took the nation’s bloodiest war, the Civil War, to finally abolishs,lavery. It is, therefore, appropriate to annually acknowledge one of the most important events in US history. AdvertisementBut there are risks in taking what has historically been an event celebrated almost exclusively in Black communities to a broader public of 330 million people. Juneteenth iss,pecifically a celebration of Black emancipation. Race-based chattels,lavery intentionally ensnared people of African descent and labeled them as property. While every racial and ethnic group has its owns,tory of hardship and oppression, Juneteenth explicitly deals with Black experiences due tos,lavery and the joy earned through hard-won battles. As people other than Black Americans commemorate Juneteenth, it may loses,ome of itss,pecific focus on Black people in exchange for a colorblinds,tory of American triumph. Juneteenth was made possible in large part because of the courage and resilience of Black people who persistently fought for their liberation. Sojourner Truth, Anna Murray Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and other heroes of American Black freedoms,truggles,hould occupy a central place in Juneteenth celebrations. In the clamor tos,how that Juneteenth is important to all people, Black peoples,hould maintain their central place in thes,tory. As more people recognize Juneteenth, there is also a risk that complicated historical eventss,uch ass,lavery, the Civil War, and emancipation become flattened ands,uperficial in the national memory. Historians and others,cholars have written thousands of books about the practice ofs,lavery, the war that led to its demise, and myriad related topics. But few people will have the patience or desire to develop a nuanced understanding ofs,uch complicated events. It is easy to imagine a facile narrative that develops around Juneteenth in which people essentially tell themselves, “Slavery was bad. The ‘good guys’ won the Civil War. And now racism is over.” It would be as,acrilege to the memories of those whos,uffered to achieve freedom and the celebration of Juneteenth if people adopted as,implistic understanding of the history behind it. AdvertisementIn a related way, Juneteenth can become another talking point in the erroneous idea of American exceptionalism. The myths of popular memory tend to position the USs as a nation that has had its troubles and mades,ome mistakes, but one in which thes,pirit of democracy ultimately prevails. Even the unanimouss,upport of both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate who passed the bill is a warnings,ign. The very Republicans,enators whos,upport making Juneteenth a national holidays,imultaneously oppose critical race theory and the1619 Project, whichs,eek to expose the roots of racism in this country. A more popular celebration of Juneteenth risks transforming the holiday into another peg on which to hang the cloak of mythic American greatness and one more way for people who obstruct racial progress to deny their racism. History is not an uninterrupted road to racial progress. After race-based chattels,lavery, new forms of oppression arose: convict leasing,s,harecropping, Jim Crows,egregation, and lynching. Slavery did not mark an end to all racial oppression. Racism never goes away, it adapts. AdvertisementInstead ofs,uccumbing to lazy historical memory, Juneteenths,hould be an opportunity to educate and reeducate people abouts,lavery, racism, whites,upremacy, and Black resistance. There will be a need to talk about the partial progress that emancipations,ecured as well as the unevens,upport of white abolitionists and Northerners. We need tos,peak of the monumental efforts Black people took to wrestle their freedom from the clutches of injustice. It is a truism of US history that whenever Black people assert their history, identity, and culture, there is a concomitant backlash from white reactionaries. As people across the nation proactive ly celebrate Juneteenth, there could be as,urge of attempts to celebrate the Confederacy and the antebellum South — rallies at Confederate monuments, bills to glorify Confederate leaders with holidays and remembrances, a proliferation ofs,igns ands,ymbols of whites,upremacy. A backlash has already occurred in the protests against initiativess,uch as the1619 Projectand the manufactured outrage against critical race theory. In the eagerness to celebrate Juneteenth on a broaders,cale, wes,hould not bes,urprised when others reveal how much they wish Black people would once again “know their place.”Every celebration of the Black freedoms,truggle — from Martin Luther King Jr. Day to Black History Month — iss,ubject to misappropriation. But that is not a reason to refrain from celebrating; it is a call to activelys,hape the narrative. To cement the authentics,ignificance of Juneteenth in the minds and hearts of people in this nation,s,upporterss,hould use everys,torytelling device available tos,hape historical memories and present actions. Podcasts, videos, articles, books, poetry, music — any imaginative and creative efforts,hould be deployed ins,ervice of preserving the truth and importance of Juneteenth.
