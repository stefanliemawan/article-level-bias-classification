0,Ramming a $15 Minimum Wage Bill Through the Senate Using Reconciliation Would Be a Norm-Busting Mistake,4.33,43.33,https://reason.com/2021/02/03/ramming-a-15-minimum-wage-bill-through-the-senate-using-reconciliation-would-be-a-norm-busting-mistake/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,25,"Fittingly for someone who spent more than three decades as a member of the US Senate, President Joe Biden holds the so-called world is greatest deliberative body in high regard. Biden calls the Senate his ""second home"" in his 2007 memoirand, as that metaphor suggests, it is often obvious that the relationship is about more than just a physical place. Biden sees the Senate—with its arcane rules and combative but dignified atmosphere—as the embodiment of what government should aspire to be. When Biden stresses that Americans must learn to disagree without disrespect ing one another, as he did in his inaugural address, he is drawing on the ethos of the Senate. ""Unity requires you to eliminate the vitriol, make anything you disagree with about the other person is personality. We have to get rid of that,"" Bidensaid last month. But when it comes to passing one of the new president is first major policy initiatives, Senate Democrats are already looking for a divisive shortcut. As part of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, Biden is asking lawmakers to also pass a massive increase in the federal minimum wage—hiking it to $15 per hour from the current rate of $7.25 per hour. It is both ironic and telling that doing so might require effectively abolishing an arcane rule that is intended to encourage debate. No, I am not talking about the filibuster, though Democrats may eventually decide to do away with the rule that requires a super majority of 60 votes to cut off debate and bring a bill to a final vote. Instead, they are turning to an even less well-understood Senate rule: reconciliation. Reconciliation was invented in 1974 when Congress rewrote its rules for passing budgets. It is intended to allow Congress to quickly make changes to la ws governing federal revenue and spending by limiting how long legislators can debate bills filed under the reconciliation process. In effect, it creates a way for a simple majority in the Senate to pass budget bill sin certain circumstances without allowing the minority to hold up the process with the threat of a filibuster. According to the Congressional Research Service, a think tank housed within Congress, the reconciliation process has been used25 times. You may recall that Republicans recently used reconciliation to get the 2017 tax cuts through the Senateand that they tried (unsuccessfully) to use the process to repeal Obamacare. Here is where it gets extra confusing. To use this special filibuster-bypassing loophole, a bill must pass a multi-step test known as the ""Byrd rule""—named for the late Senator Robert Byrd (D–W Va.), who invented the test as a way to limit the use of the reconciliation process. Whether a bill comports with the Byrd rule is up to exactly one person: Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who is more or less an unelected mage responsible for interpreting the Senate is rule sand adjudicating disputes over them. In order to clear the Byrd rule, and thus be eligible to be passed with a simple majority as opposed to 60 votes, a piece of legislation contain elements that are ruled extraneous to the federal budget. There are other aspects of the Byrd rule banning legislation that inflates the long-term federal budget deficit (which is why the 2017 tax bill contained a bunch of gimmicky promises about future tax hikes) and prohibiting any changes to Social Security, but the budget mandate is the key issue at play with the proposed minimum wage increase. Most aspects of Biden is proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill would be eligible for passage under reconciliation. Boosting emergency spending or offering tax breaks to offset individuals' and businesses' losses due to the pandemic—regardless of whether they are fiscally smart policies or not—pretty clearly meet the Byrd rule is threshold.""BryBut does hiking the federal minimum wage? That is debatable. Progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) are making a roundabout argument that increasing the federal minimum wage can be done via reconciliation because it would have some knock-on effect on federal tax revenue. In other words, forcing businesses to pay hourly workers higher wages will translate into higher taxable income for those workers and thus more tax revenue for the government. Additionally, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a $15 federal minimum wage would decrease dependence on federal welfare programs b yat least $13 billion annually. But approaching the Byrd rule in that manner makes it effectively null and void. In strokes that broad, any major change to federal policy could have knock-on effects that impact tax revenues or future expenditures. For example, if Biden were to propose that the federal government mandate every household adopt a dog within the next six months, one could argue that the corresponding up tick in demand for dog food and chew toys would force businesses that produce those products to hire more workers, and that hiring (and paying) more workers would impact federal tax revenue down the road. You might even be able to argue that the resulting increase in happiness would reduce future government health care expenditures (or perhaps that it would increase them since dog owners statistically live longer). All those things might be true, but that would not make the Puppy Mandate of 2021 directly linked to the federal budget in a way that the reconciliation rules were crafted to allow. But wait, the re is one more wrinkle—because this is the Senate and nothing is ever straightforward. If MacDonough rules that the minimum wage hike ca not be passed via reconciliation, the Senate can still overrule her decision. Doing so would require a super majority of 60 votes, so that is probably not feasible—unless Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, unilaterally acts to overrule MacDonough. That is never been done before, but notes that it is technically allowed under Senate rules. For now, this whole debate could be somewhat moot. Senator Joe Manchin (D–W Va.) says he will not support a $15 national minimum wage. Instead, he isproposing to hike the minimum wage to $11 per hour. And if Democrats ca not get unified support from all 50 of their members on this issue, the n the reconciliation route is useless. All of this procedural analysis ignores the strong policy-based arguments against raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour across the entire country. Including that wage hike in what is ostensibly a COVID-19 relief bill, as is Billy Binionpointed out last week, is particularly bizarre since many businesses that would be subject to the higher labor costs are just struggling to keep their doors open right now. The Biden administration is touting a Congressional Budget Office report showing that a $15 national minimum wage would lift about 1 million workers out of poverty, but it is conveniently downplaying the fact that the same study says the change would eliminate 1.3 million jobs. It is certainly possible that Democrats will ignore that and try to ram the higher minimum wage—either $15 per hour or $11 per hour—through Congress using reconciliation. ""We are not going to take 'no' for an answer"" is how Sandersdescribed the effort to CNBClast week. If so, we could be treated to the spectacle of the Biden administration is second-in-command unilaterally overturning the Senate is rules in an unprecedented way that virtually guarantees the Byrd rule no longer serves as a significant impediment to passing any legislation via the reconciliation process—and doing it so a controversial policy change can be implemented with the support, maybe, of just 50 senators plus the vice president. After preaching about the value of unity and promising to end an era of political norm-breaking, that would be a heck of a way for Biden to demonstrate that he does not much care about any of those things.",1,1,Reason
1,Impeachment and the Democrats: How will they screw this up? Let me count the ways,-22.5,30.5,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/06/impeachment-and-the-democrats-how-will-they-screw-this-up-let-me-count-the-ways/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-12-06,25,"Thursday is announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Democrats are ready to vote articles of impeachment against President Trump — presumably on the narrowest possible terms, after a constrained and foreshortened process — is hardly surprising. It is, however, disheartening. Why they would even consider moving to a floor vote on impeachment without doing whatever is necessary to compel testimony from John Bolton, who is now a private citizen and has always been a blast-hardened neo con Republican, and who is clearly eager to roast Donald Trump is gizzard on a fork and the n eat it, is profoundly baffling. Or maybe, sadly, it is not. So far, this spectacle confirms my sense that the Democratic Party is strikingly ill-prepared for the historical role it ought to play in this moment of small-d democratic crisis. Driven as usual by fear, excessive caution and a morbid fascination with identifying the middle of the middle of the political middle (and the n veering slightly to its right), the Democrats are entirely likely to screw things up, whether morally or tactically or politically or all at once. (See alsoDavid Masciotra is excellent Salon essay last weekend.)Actually, the Democrats have already screwed it up. Let is be clear that the Republican defense of Trump is completely incoherent, because there is no defense for his actions. But on a generic or abstract level, Republicans have floated halfway-valid concerns about the process of the impeachment inquiry and the motivations behind it — which Democrats have done little to dispel. Republicans claim that Democrats have been itching for a pretext to impeach Trump since before he took office, and finally landed on one. That is at least partly true, although the Angry White People Party is too consumed by paranoid delusions to understand the ways in which it is both true and untrue, and how those reflect the deep and wide schism within the Democrats over how to respond to the Trump era. Sure, Rashida Tlaib got elected in Detroit vowing to “impeach the motherf***er,” but a whole lot of other Democrats got elected while not talking about that at all, and explicitly or otherwise espousing the “back to normal” politics that have made Joe Biden the 2020 frontrunner all year long. In case you have not been keeping score, there is no “normal” to go back to, history never flows backward and that whole approach is a dangerous delusion, as we will all learn the hard way soon enough. Biden would be a disastrous nominee and a terrible president, which is not to say the re is an obvious alternative who inspires immense confidence. But for our present purposes all that is a side issue, even if it is also a yawning abyss beneath our feet. Speaking of delusions, Republicans’ elaborate conspiracy the ories about how Ukraine and the Democrats (with the help of the CIA and FBI) faked the Russian hack of the DNC in order to launch an investigation of the Trump campaign add up to something like a masterful work of literary parody, out of an unwritten Don DeLillo or Colson Whitehead novel. It is complete nonsense, of course, but it is admirably creative nonsense, and you might say it gestures at something real, which is that the “Ukraine scandal” refers to deeply buried issues in US foreign policy that are virtually never discussed in public. Why exactly is the USs so deeply entangled in a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two bordering nations on the other side of the world — not to mention two nations with a long history of deeply fraught relations, none of which has anything to do with us? I do not claim that there are no explanations, only that no one outside the national-security priesthood of people like John Bolton and Fiona Hill (or Nancy Pelosi, for that matter) really understands them. Furthermore, no one in either political party is particularly eager to debate such questions on TV, so that while the facts of the Trump-Biden-Giuliani-Zelensky morass have more or less come out, the deeper questions beneath them are never asked, let alone answered. Before you get worked up to tweet at me about how I am spewing Putin is talking points or whatever, let me assure you that I do not exactly know what those would be, but I am pretty sure they are crap also. Putin is not my problem! What I am noticing here is Democrats’ eagerness to turn the impeachment inquiry into a display of flag-waving patriotism and unanimous agreement on what is essentially a neo con foreign-policy consensus. Nothing about the Trump presidency is more deeply perverse (to me, anyway) than the Democratic Party is abrupt rebranding as woke BFF of the national-security state. I hope people whose villages get droned in Afghanistan or Somalia are comforted by the increasing intersection ality of our WorldCop force. (People reference ""Idiocracy"" a lot to explain the Trump era, but I would also refer you to Paul Verhoeven is ""Starship Troopers,"" in which the fascist dictator of Earth is a black woman.)How many “liberals” of the so-called resistance even noticed the US-endorsed coup in Venezuela (which failed) or the one in Bolivia (which was a glorious success), let alone raised any questions about them? Former CIA head John Brennan has become a resistance hero, which if you do even minimal research on the guy is career is darkly hilarious. We have all, apparently, agreed to pretend that Abu Ghraib and the black sites are ancient, irrelevant historical footnotes or events in an alternate timeline. Here is a detour; it is somewhat relevant, I believe. There was a lot I did not understand about theSenate Watergate hearings of 1973, which I watched as a child, pretty much gavel-to-gavel, perched on my dad is moldering horsehair sofa and riveted to his black-and-white portable TV, which was normally shoved in the corner of his study like an unwelcome guest. (We had been one of those irritating no-TV families until he bought it to watch occasional baseball games and irritate my mother.)I did not know much about the Democratic Party at that time, for one thing. I certainly did not grasp that it was going through a period of remarkable internal turmoil — arguably more severe than anything inflicted by Bernie Sanders or “the Squad” — even as it tried to drive a Republican president from office. I definitely did not know that Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, the bourbon-voiced Southern gentleman who chaired that committee, was an old-line segregationist, the n making an uneasy peace with the civil rights era. Ervin was a creature of that era and not this one, so the comparison may be nonsensical, but almost any white Southern man of his background and inclinations would be a Republican in 2019. To be fair, my dad probably did not grasp those nuances either. He was an Irish immigrant who viewed the Democratic Party with an almost mystical veneration. He certainly supported some Democrats and opposed others, more on emotional grounds than ideological ones: Heartbroken by the death of Bobby Kennedy and the social schism of the Vietnam War, he had refused to vote for Hubert Humphrey in 1968. But an elected Democrat, for him, was something like a Roman Catholic priest: Whatever his (or, hypothetically,her) personal failings, he carried the authority of an institution that spoke for the people. Republicans of that time absolutely argued that the Democrats’ Watergate investigation was an illegitimate attempt to undo an election defeat, one of many echoes from that era heard in this one. (And boy howdy, had the Democrats suffered an election defeat in 1972, when George McGovern carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, losing to Richard Nixon by almost 18 million votes.) In our household, that argument rang hollow, but the n our partisan loyalty was not in question. It never occurred to me to doubt that Democrats held the moral and political high ground when it came to Watergate (and pretty much everything else), or that they had gravely and soberly embarked on a search for the truth, taking no pleasure in unmasking a low-grade criminal scheme masterminded by the increasingly paranoid occupant of the Oval Office. In the end, of course, as we are repeatedly reminded, Republicans bowed before the irresistible logic of mounting evidence and shifting public opinion. There were definitely some hard-line true believers who wanted to back Nixon to the end, and who felt their party had capitulated to the treasonous lib tar ds and the New York Times. I think the re is no doubt that the bitter, half-remembered residue of that sentiment fuels Republican intransigence to day, when the president they must defend makes Nixon look like Lorenzo de’ Medici. In any event, a few GOP members even voted for articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee, and a bunch more waffled over it. Finally a delegation of Republican senators, led by conservative godfather Barry Goldwater, went to the White House to tell Nixon the jig was up: If he did not resign, he’d be convicted by the Senate and forced from office, something that, to date, has never happened in American history and probably never will. Of course there are some striking similarities between that era and this one, but I think the differences — both grand and subtle — are more important. Any number of pundits have lamented that the Republican Party of 2019 is not remotely interested in facts or evidence, and will continue to defend Donald Trump up to and beyond a video of the president stuffing bundles of Vladimir Putin is rubles down his pants. Fair enough: The “moderate,” statesmanlike Republicans of Nixon is era, who thoughtfully crunched the ice cubes in their bourbon-and-soda at the country club, and who valued continuity and stability over raw power or loyalty to a noxious figurehead, are gone forever. But the Democrats, as mentioned above, have been changed by history too. What we are seeing now, to a significant extent, is a resurgence of the factional conflict that had been almost completely suppressed across 40-odd years of compromise, triangulation, recalibration and defeat. The actual left — meaning both the socialist Old Left and the 1960s-radical New Left — had either been purged or reduced to an irrelevant rump faction. Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio ran for president a couple of times, made no serious impact and was treated with benign condescension — which was what nearly everyone in the party expected would happen with Bernie Sanders in 2016. With the growth of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the election of the Squad — and scores or hundreds of allied office-holders at the state and local levels — a broader range of left and center-left positions is represented among Democratic elected officials than at any time since at least the “New Democrat” era of Bill Clinton. Much has been made of how diverse the House Democratic caucus is in terms of color, ethnicity and gender (which is surely important), but the renewed ideological diversity is every bit as striking. This has clearly raised the temperature of internal dialogue within the party (and not just in the tedious Twitter wars between “stan” armies), which is sometimes visible — as in the public spat between Pelosi and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earlier this year — and sometimes not. It seems apparent that dynamic is playing out behind the scenes in the impeachment debate. If Tlaib became famous for promising she was going to Washington to impeach Trump, Representative Jerry Nadler of New York, who took the House Judiciary Committee gavel last January — a CPC member who is ideologically closer to Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez than to Pelosi — was making similar promises, much more discreetly. Many House progressives, Nadler likely included, wanted to pursue an impeachment of Trump on the widest possible terms: for the corrupt and unethical conduct exhaustively detailed in the Mueller report, for his many violations of the emoluments clause and blatant self-dealing, for his usurpation of congressional appropriations to build his stupid wall, for his campaign-finance violations, for his relentless efforts to undermine or defy the constitutional separation of powers. I mean, we could keep going. That approach would have had the obvious merit of seeking full transparency and exposing a widespread pattern of criminality that would be impossible to explain away, and would not have relied exclusively on anti-Russia hysteria or the contentious “collusion” questions surrounding the 2016 campaign. It also, without doubt, would have taken a long time, quite possibly as long as the 16-month investigation of Sam Ervin is Watergate committee. For Pelosi, whose primary goal was and is preserving the House majority in 2020, that looked like an unacceptable risk. No one disputes that she is good at political arithmetic, but this kind of short-term calculus was precisely not what the moment required. AsI have argued previously, a younger speaker who was not so concerned with her legacy might have been more willing to roll the dice and stand up for a clear set of values. Pelosi is eager to protect her supposedly vulnerable House freshmen, and a lot of them are centrists who want no part of the CPC, the Squad or the left. But it is a mistake to perceive her tactics as purely pragmatic or strategic: Pelosi can call herself a “San Francisco progressive” all she likes, but ideologically she is strongly aligned with the liberal and/or neo liberal tradition that stretches from Hillary Clinton back to Hubert Humphrey, which favors incremental social-justice reforms at home (in fairness, sometimes quite significant reforms) coupled with unquestioned support for American exceptionalism, empire-building and military intervention abroad. For Pelosi, the swing-district moderates, and especially the former military or intelligence professionals sometimes dubbed the “CIA Democrats”— a group that includes Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill, all of New Jersey — are much closer to the future she imagines for the Democratic Party than are AOC and Rashida Tlaib. Maybe it does not matter why Pelosi made the deal she made. But when the Ukraine scandal almost literally fell out of the sky in late summer, she seized upon it as the catalyst for a compromise within her caucus. The lefties were eager to impeach Trump, and Pelosi got the hawkish moderate freshmen to go along as long as it was a “clean,” narrowly focused process that was all wrapped up by Christmas and provided an opportunity to grandstand about national security, roll out a bunch of witnesses with impressive credentials of patriotic service and expose Republicans as a bunch of weaselly hypocrites who have taken a vow to love Sluglord Trump more than they love America. (Which is of course accurate.)But the problem, as I have tried to explore in roundabout fashion, is that the re is nothing clean about the Ukraine scandal or this impeachment, which is why we all feel profoundly dissatisfied with it. Essentially, Pelosi and the Democratic leadership are patting the left-progressive base on the head and sending it to bed with a hastily constructed impeachment-theater skit, full of high-flown rhetoric and largely drained of meaning. I am not excusing the gangster ish conduct of Trump and his minions in any way. But here is what they did: They tried to pull a murky criminal scheme in a legendarily corrupt country where the US has played a mysterious sponsorship role ever since the Ukrainian revolution and/or coup of 2014 (reports vary!) overthrew pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. We are not, of course, supposed to think too hard about that background, or about exactly why the US is involved in this particular proxy war on the other side of the world. Why not, I guess? There are loads of others!By the way, can we stop pretending that whatever Hunter Biden was doing in Ukraine was fine and squeaky-clean and totally above board? That is all a parenthesis, of course, and the re is no evidence that his dad was directly involved, even if the optics were kind of un-good. But Hunter was getting paid a one-percenter salary to do absolutely nothing because he was the vice president is son. If you are truly committed to constructing that as “well, he did not do anything wrong,” you are either a shameless party hack or you have been thoroughly gaslit by end-stage capitalism. Probably both. Trump is Ukraine extortion campaign did not work. The Democrats’ quick and dirty impeachment will not work either. Those things are metaphors, but what the hell for? Maybe for all the deeper, darker crimes we do not know about, and all the hard questions we should ask ourselves but do not. The impeachment of Donald Trump has just started, and now it is almost over. Soon it will be just as if it never happened at all.",1,1,Salon
2,Is Inflation About to Run Wild?,-2.0,47.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/newsletter/20210526-Inflation-About-Run-Wild,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"New Watchdog Report Identifies Billions in Potential Government SavingsA new report from the Government Accountability Office identifies dozens of ways the federal government can save billions of dollars while improving the effectiveness of its spending – a task that will become all that much more pressing as the coronavirus crisis comes to an end and lawmakers begin to look for ways to reduce the budget deficit.“The federal government has made an unprecedented response to significant public health and economic challenges as the country continues to battle Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” the GAO says in its report. “Once the pandemic recedes and the economy substantially recovers, Congress and the administration should develop and swiftly implement an approach to place the government on a sustainable long-term fiscal path.”As in past reports, the GAO digs into the nitty-gritty of the federal budget, looking for areas of overlap and duplication that could be eliminated, as well as areas of fragmentation, where agencies could improve efficiency by pulling disparate efforts into one. The results can be remarkably detailed, and a good reminder of just how diverse federal spending can be. In the current report, areas under review include everything from the management of “cell-cultured meat” production by the Food and Drug Administration and US Department of Agriculture to potential savings in Medicaid claims processing and information retrieval systems. The GAO says its reports have been quite effective, with its recommendations producing $429 billion in benefits from 2011 to 2019. Speaking to a Senate committee earlier this month, Gene L Dodaro, the government is comptroller general, highlighted the savings that are available. “This year, we have over 112 new recommendations for consideration by the Congress and the executive branch,” Dodaro said. “The first has to do with leveraging the government is enormous potential purchasing power by pulling together to purchase common items, medical supplies, office supplies, etcetera. There is been some progress in this area, but there can be much, much more that result in significant savings.”Read the full GAO report here and an analysis by The Washington Post is Joe Davidson here. Point/Counterpoint: The Inflation RiskFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers expressed his growing concerns about inflation in aWashington Post op-edthis week, arguing that the Biden administration is Covid-19 rescue package is too large given current economic conditions, which could result in higher than expected and potentially dangerous price increases throughout the economy in the coming months. Summers’ comments are providing ammunition for those who oppose Biden is ambitious spending plans, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) quoting him more than once this week as he presses his case that Biden is proposing too much spending. Here is the nub of Summers’ argument, along with acritical reply from economist Dean Baker, who runs the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. Summers raises a red flag:“The covid-19 chapter in US economic history is coming to a close more rapidly than almost anyone expected, including me. Within weeks, gross domestic product will reach a new peak, and it is likely to exceed its pre-covid trend line before year is end, as the economy enjoys its fastest year of growth in decades. Job openings are at record levels, and unemployment may well fall below 4 percent in the next 12 months. Wages and productivity growth are increasing. ...“Now, the primary risk to the US economy is overheating — and inflation. Even six months ago, it was reasonable to regard slow growth, high unemployment and deflationary pressures as the predominant risk to the economy. Today, while continuing relief efforts are essential, the focus of our macroeconomic policy needs to change.”Baker says it is too soon to tell:“Starting with the inflation that we have seen to date, it is important to remember that this follows the very low rate of inflation we saw in the pandemic. Much of this is just catch up. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 0.8 percent in April. That sounds scary, but it is up just 3.1 percent since February of 2020, which translates into a 2.6 percent annual rate of growth. The core index, which excludes food and energy prices, is up just 2.5 percent since before the pandemic started, translating into a 2.2 percent annual rate of increase.“We can see a similar story in many of the sectors that were hard hit by the pandemic. Hotel prices jumped 8.8 percent in April, but are still almost 6.0 percent below the level of February, 2020. Air fares rose 10.2 percent in April, but are 17.7 percent below their pre-pandemic level.“Everyone knew these big price jumps were coming, so they really should not be cause for panic.”Top Dems Call for a 'Public Option' Health Care PlanTwo key Democratic lawmakers overseeing health policy on Wednesday announced they will look to craft legislation to create a government-run “public option” for health coverage, pushing ahead on one of President Joe Biden is campaign promises even as the president has focused on other parts of his agenda. Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, put out a call for ideas on how to design the legislation.“We believe bold steps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed “to all interested parties.” “As we work to craft legislation, our priority is to establish a federally administered public option that provides quality, affordable health coverage throughout the USs.”Their request asks for answers to eight broad questions, such as who should be eligible to enroll in a government-run plan, how benefits and payments should be structured and what kind of premium assistance should be offered. Biden campaigned on creating a Medicare-like public option, pitching the idea as part of a plan to build on Obamacare — an alternative to calls from Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others to eliminate private coverage entirely and transition to a single-payer “Medicare for All” system. But, despite some pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden has left a public option out of his major policy proposals thus far and reportedly will not include i tin his forthcoming budget request even as he reiterates his support for the idea. The president has instead pushed plans to make Obamacare plans more affordable and accessible. Insurers and hospitals oppose a public option and critics have argued that it would ultimately lead to “a one-size-fits-all” government health insurance system. The American Hospital Association said in a statementWednesday that it opposes a public option because “inadequate reimbursement rates” would raise the risk of hospital closures. Why it matters:The letter from Pallone and Murray “is the first indication that Democrats are still serious about the idea” of a public option,saysVox is Dylan Scott. And Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation calls it “a serious effort by Senator Murray and Representative Pallone to take the public option from bumper sticker to workable legislation.”A public option enjoys broad support in polls, with more than two-thirds of adults in an October 2020 Kaiser Family Foundationtracking poll— including 40% of Republicans — saying they strongly favor or somewhat favor the idea. But, as the questions in the Pallone-Murray letter suggest, a host of issues still need to be addressed, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies atop that list. “A public option has the potential to reduce prices and make health care more affordable, but the further it goes in that direction, the bigger the blowback will be from the health care industry,” Levitt told theAssociated Press. And while the industry pushes back, Republicans may also be likely to renew their attacks labeling the Democratic proposals as “socialist.”The bottom line:While it is notable that two leading Democrats are working on a public option, the re is no sign any legislation has a chance of passing in the near term. Defense Budget Battle LoomsLawmakers on the left and the right are already taking positions on the upcoming defense budget, Joe Gould and Leo Shane III ofDefense News report, pushing in opposite directions on the single largest component of discretionary spending in the federal budget. Progressive Democrats are looking for ways to trim spending, while conservative Republicans are raising alarms about potential threats as they push for increases in the Pentagon is budget. One point of contention involves the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which could be completed as soon as July. The move is expected to produce savings of as much as $50 billion, and House Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Mark Pocan (D-WI) wants to use that “peace dividend” for domestic purposes, including health insurance and housing. At the same time, Republicans in the Senate are calling for more spending on the military. “China is long-term military investments are paying dividends that should alarm us. But Democrats want to pump the brakes on our own?” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said last week. “Fewer resources for our own men and women in uniform? Less defense innovation? What sense does that make?”Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also invoked China as he called for more spending. “We know the best signal we can send China is a strong military, but a strong military is not free,” he said last week. “I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure we are giving our military the resources they need to deter Chinese military aggression and defend our country.”Ultimately, moderate Democrats including Representative Adam Smith (D-WA) and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) will have to find a way to satisfy both camps on a defense bill that could be upwards of 4,000 pages long. “The bill never passes if it is not bipartisan, we all understand our responsibility,” Smith told Defense News. “And that is [Republicans’] incentive: we want to pass a bill. And there are thousands of things in that bill ― or hundreds ― that are important, on a whole series of policy levels, on a bipartisan basis.”Biden Wants to Spend More on Cyber Warfare: ReportPresident Biden is budget request is expected to include an increase in funding for a military unit that focuses on cy ber warfare,Politico reports. Located within US Cyber Command, a joint military group that draws on multiple branches of the armed forces, the Cyber Mission Force is charged with coordinating “cyberspace operations in defense of US national interests.” Biden will reportedly call for an increase in the size of the force by about 10%, up from its current level of 6,200, at a cost of at least $100 million. If Congress agrees, it would be the first expansion of the force since 2012, when it was first created. The expansion has been under discussion for some time but has likely received new impetus in the wake of recent cy ber attacks on the US, including one ransom ware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that resulted in fuel shortages in some parts of the country, Politico is Martin Matishak and Lara Seligman say. In congressional testimony earlier this year, Gen. Paul Nakasone, chief of Cyber Command, said it was time for the force to expand. “Recent demand across DoD has demonstrated that the original 133 teams in the CMF are not enough,” he wrote, referring to the current structure of the force. “The strategic environment has changed since the original CMF was designated in 2012. Added forces will ensure USCYBERCOM can fulfill its responsibility as both a supported and a supporting command.”Send your feedback to yrosenberg@thefiscaltimes.com.

Data and experience, however, have shown that criminal izing sex work does little to alleviate those harms,"" Savit said in the statement. ""Indeed the criminalization of sex work actually increases the risk of sex work adjacent harm. Accordingly, the Washtenaw County Prosecutor is Office will henceforth decline to bring charges related to consensual sex work per se. The Prosecutor is Office, however, will continue to charge sex work-adjacent crime — including human trafficking, violence, and offenses involving children — that directly harm county residents.""Efforts to reach Savit for further comment Thursday were not successful. Elected in November, Savit said with the exception of Nevada, sex work is generally criminal i zed in the USs but that ""America is prohibitionist stance on sex work is increasingly out of step with international norms. Consensual sex work is legal — at least in some form — in nearly 100 countries across the globe.""Savit added the laws against ""consensual"" sex work conflict with the US constitution as adults have a right to ""engage in private conduct"" such as sex.​Savit added that ""Laws banning consensual sex between adults thus generally violate the USs ConstitutionIt is only when sex is exchanged for money that such activity may be banned. But even once money enters the equation, sex is not consistently criminalized.""In Oakland County, Chief Assistant Prosecutor David Williams told The News Thursday that while his office is main focus is human trafficking, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald will be ""rolling out"" policy changes in prosecutions.""I applaud what (Savit) is doing and he certainly is headed in the right direction,"" said Williams. ""There is no question. There absolutely will be changes (in Oakland County).""Last week, Savit made headlines when he announced his office would end cash bail for defendants, saying the practice punishes the poor.""America is system of cash bail is unfair, inequitable, and imposes severe harm on communities,"" Savit said last week. ""Cash bail is a system under which a defendant who has been accused of a crime is required to post money in order to secure release from jail pending trial.

8,Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema: the centrists blocking Biden is agenda,-7.67,44.33,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/03/joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema-democrats-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-03,25,"Donald Trump is favorite insult for political opponents inside his own party is “Rino” – Republican in name only. By such logic, SenatorsJoe Manchinof West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the epitome of Dinos, two elected Democrats whose dogged resistance to Joe Biden is social agenda threatens to upend his entire presidency. Their standoff with the party is progressive wing over the price tag of Biden is ambitious reform package has become almost more of a hazard to his legacy than anything the Republicans, currently in a narrow minority in both chambers of Congress, can throw at it. That resistance – and threat – to Biden is domestic ambitions is now set to continue for the month of October as House speaker,Nancy Pelosi, set a new deadline of 31 October for the House to pass a major infrastructure spending bill after a week of negotiations left massive social and environmental policy overhaul plan in a limbo. Progressive Democrats in the House have refused to vote on the infrastructure bills leverage in negotiations over a separate bill that contains huge spending on issues increased access to childcare, help with college tuition and major action on climate change. Analysts, meanwhile, question if the senators’ resistance to programs that Biden ran and won an election on is rooted more in a need for political self-preservation. Manchin is a moderate Democrat in a state where the governor is mansion and both legislative chambers are controlled by Republicans; Sinema is seen as vulnerable in Arizona where she captured the Senate seat that previously belonged to the Republican Jeff Flake before he decided not to run again. Both face sticky re-election challenges in 2024. Meanwhile, New York magazine is Intelligencer coined a phrase for the oversized power resting in the hands of the two otherwise unremarkable Democratic holdouts:Manchema. “They are, in effect, holding the president is priorities hostage to their personal whims,” the article is author, Sarah Jones, wrote.“That is not a new story in politics. But their stubbornness in the face of contemporary challenges reveals the bottomless emptiness of their brand of centrist politics.”Manchin, 74, has been in the US Senate since 2010, and became a controversial figure during the Trump administration by allying himself on several key votes and even toying with an unprecedented cross-party endorsement of the former president for reelection. If Senate Democrats were frustrated with him the n, it morph ed into impatience when the party seized control of the chamber in 2020 but became reliant on him for every vote so vice-president Kamala Harris could break a 50-50 tie. Manchin has always insisted he is not against Biden is desire to enact social reforms, but balks at the $3.5tn cost and has indicated he would be comfortable with $1.5tn. Last month he called for Democrats to “hit the pause button” for more negotiation.“I could say that I am against this and that and everything. I am for an awful lot of the things. I am for also putting guardrails on,” he told NBC is Meet the Press. Sinema made headlines in 2018 not only for becoming Arizona is first Democrat senator for more than two decades but also as the first openly bisexual member of the chamber. Yet despite being from the same party as Arizona is other senator Mark Kelly, who ousted the incumbent Republican Martha McSally in last year is special election to make it the first time in 70 years the state was represented in the Senate by two Democrats, she has taken a much more conservative stance on several issues. In March, she angered colleagues by giving athumbs-down gesture on the Senate floor as she voted against raising the federal minimum wage. Unlike Manchin, Sinema, who rarely gives interviews, has not indicated publicly what parts of the $3.5tn bill she objected to. As an indicator of her importance to the process, she has become a regular visitor to the White House, getting more face time with the president and senior Democratic leadership than any other senator with only three years’ standing. In Arizona, Democrats have become weary of Sinema. The state is Democratic party passed a motion pledging a no-confidence vote if she votes against the bill, while some members are plotting a primary challenge. In Washington, the Hawaii senator Mazie Hirono encapsulated congressional Democrats’ frustration. “I and others are waiting for Kyrsten and Joe to tell us what is it that they like or do not like, and the n we can get it done,” she said. Manchin, meanwhile, drew the personal ire of the Senate is most prominent progressive, the former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, in a recent interview on ABC is This Week.“Is it appropriate for one person to destroy two pieces of legislation?” he asked. “It would really be a terrible, terrible shame for the American people if both bills went down.”",2,1,The Guardian

That included $150,000 for the LGBT+ Center Orlando. The money was earmarked for the Orlando United Assistance Center, which provides mental health services for survivors of the2016 mass shooting at the city is Pulse nightclub.""Yesterday marked the first day of Pride Month, and Governor DeSantis has once again proved that he is one of the most homophobic and trans phobic governors in the USs,"" said George A Wallace, LGBT+ Center Orlando executive director. Equality Florida, the state is most prominent LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, issued a press release slamming the budget decisions. DeSantis signed a budget with more than $101 billion in spending but could find no room for any programs benefiting the LGBTQ+ community specifically. The vetoes also occurred when Florida reports a $6.6 billion surplus, though only thanks to President Joe Biden is American Rescue Plan, which DeSantis opposed. Representatives for the governor stressed that while funding designated specifically for Pulse survivors did not make the final budget, survivors can still take advantage of funding provided separately.""Governor DeSantis vetoed $1.5 billion in total, which included dozens of line items. Although the specific earmark for Pulse survivors was among those items vetoed, the funding is not going away,"" said DeSantis Press Secretary Christina Pushaw. ""The Florida Leads budget that the governor signed today provides a historic increase in funding for community-based mental health services, so help will continue to be provided and encouraged for all who need it, including survivors of the Pulse nightclub tragedy.""Governor DeSantis has been a champion on mental health since day one -- and he absolutely supports every Floridian who has experienced such horrific trauma, which has a lifelong impact on survivors. To this end, the new budget ensures that Floridians in need -- including LGBTQ Floridians -- will be able to access vital support and resources.""But survivors of the shooting and other LGBTQ+ advocates do not buy it.""Let is be clear about what this is: Governor DeSantis has declared war on Florida is LGBTQ community,"" said Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the shooting who now works as Equality Florida is media relations manager. The action proved all the more insulting for Wolf, who met with DeSantis in June 2019, shortly after the governor took office, at the Pulse memorial before the third anniversary of the shooting.""Before the 2019 Remembrance Ceremony, Governor DeSantis stood on hallowed ground, steps from where I escaped the building in 2016, and promised me that he would always support those of us impacted by the Pulse nightclub shooting,"" Wolf said. ""Today, almost two years later to date, he vetoed mental health services for us. I will never forget.""It is DeSantis is second slight on the LGBTQ+ community since Pride Month started just Tuesday. On the first day of the month, DeSantis signed into law a bill prohibiting of trans girls and women from competing in school and collegiate sports consistent with their gender identity. In the budget, the mental health funding was not the only vetoed item connected to helping LGBTQ+ Floridians. He also killed $750,000 in funding for the Zebra Coalition, which provides services specifically to LGBTQ+ children and young adults, ages 13 to 24. The Florida legislature, where Republicans control both the Senate and House, had budgeted $750,000 for youth housing programs, most of it to be made available through grants and aid efforts.""This money would have helped LGBTQ+ youth facing homelessness, bullying, isolation from their families, physical and sexual abuse, and drug abuse,"" said Heather Wilkie, Zebra Coalition executive director. ""We were planning to expand our housing capacity from 11 to 35 beds for homeless youth and were honored for the support of so many of our state legislators. Now we are unsure where the money will come from.""Similarly, leaders of the LGBT+ Center in Orlando expressed disappointment at the loss of funds.""I am disappointed once again that Governor Ron DeSantis has vetoed funding for the LGBTQ community, specifically those affected by the Pulse tragedy,"" Wallace said. ""Some of Central Florida is most vulnerable citizens rely on the Center Orlando to provide lifesaving services, such as case management, navigation, and critical mental health counseling. The OUAC directly serves those impacted by the 2016 Pulse tragedy. We now must pivot to find funding to continue serving Orlando is LGBTQ community at the same level as we had planned for the upcoming fiscal year.""Lawmakers who fought for the funding did not hold back criticisms.""Vetoing funding for Pulse survivors days before the 5 year remembrance is heartless. Vetoing funds for LGBTQ homeless youth is indefensible,"" tweeted Florida Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, an Orlando Democrat who is the only openly gay man serving in the Florida House. ""During Pride 2021 following your attack on trans youth? Governor Ron DeSantis what did LGBTQ people do to you to earn your contempt?""Early in DeSantis is term, LGBTQ+ activists had hoped the young governor, now 42, would not govern with the same anti-LGBTQ+ zeal as some of his predecessors. But DeSantis in recent months has been more openly setting himself up to run in the 2024 Republican primary for president. Democratic Florida Representative Anna Eskamani, who represents the district where the Pulse nightclub is located, issued fundraising appeals for the Zebra Coalition and LGBT+ Center on Wednesday after the veto.""June is a really hard month for Orlando,"" Eskamani tweeted. ""Five years from Pulse, I know it will always be a hard month for Orlando. Governor Ron DeSantis' contempt for LGBTQ+ people make it even harder. I hold so much. I hold so much pride for our legislative champs. I am heartbroken by the hate in the Governor is heart.""And US Representative Darren Soto, also a Democrat, used the veto to advocate for more federal spending to help survivors.

Those two House Republicans, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Indiana is Jim Banks, ""made statements and took actions that just made it ridiculous to put them on such a committee seeking the truth,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said at a news conference.""When statements are ridiculous and fall into the realm of, 'You must be kidding,' the re is no way that they are going to be on the committee,"" Pelosi said. Her decision to turn away Jordan and Banks stemmed from their words and actions stretching over months, some as far back as before the January 6 riot itself and others as recently as this week, a senior Democratic aide familiar with the deliberations told CNBC Most recently, the aide said, Democrats were outraged by a statement from Banks on Monday night, in which he vowed to reveal the facts about the Capitol invasion, including the ""responses from Capitol leadership and the Biden administration.""In fact, the Biden administration began two weeks after the riot on January 6, when hundreds of former President Donald Trump is supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from confirming now-PresidentJoe Biden is electoral victory. When Congress returned to their chambers hours after the rioters were dispersed, both Jordan and Banks voted to object to the results of the election. Pelosi on Thursday said that Banks' statement was akin to claiming that the Biden administration was responsible for the attempted insurrection. ""There was no Biden administration on January 6"" she noted. The Democratic aide also told CNBC there was ""deep concern"" about Jordan, a staunch Trump ally who is the to p-ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. The aide specifically cited his participation in a December meeting at the White House in which Trump and a group of Republican lawmakers reportedly strategi zed about ways to overturn Biden is election win. Pelosi is blunt rejections,announced Wednesday, stoked a fiery response from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who had selected Jordan and Banks for the committee along with three other Republicans. McCarthy, R-Calif., accused Pelosi of an ""egregious abuse of power"" and vowed to pull all five of his picks from the panel unless she reversed course. The speaker is ""more interested in playing politics than seeking the truth,"" McCarthy said. But Pelosi on Thursday appeared highly unlikely to change her mind. Banks' and Jordan is words and actions make it ""impossible for them to exercise judgment"" on the investigative committee, she said. Spokespeople for Jordan and Banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Pelosi is remarks Thursday. The Democratic aide told CNBC that caucus members also objected to Banks' appointment in light of a recent trip to the US-Mexico border organized by the Republican Study Committee, on which he serves as chairman. The group of GOP lawmakers on the trip were reportedly joined by Anthony Aguero, an alleged Capitol rioter, who was seen chatting with multiple committee members. Banks ""never spoke to the individual in question, the Republican Study Committee was unaware of his identity and whereabouts on January 6, and he did not travel with our group to the border,"" a spokesperson for the committee told CNN in a statement. After their nominations were rejected, Jordan and Banks released statements accusing the select committee of being a partisan endeavor. But one Republican member is on the panel: Trump-critic Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who was ousted from her role as GOP conference chai rafter she refused to stop criticizing the former president for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was rigged against him.""I think the committee is going to do a very thorough and fair and nonpartisan job at getting to the truth,"" Cheney told reporters Thursday as she and other members gathered in Pelosi is office for a closed-door meeting.",2,2,CNBC

Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program or activity that receives federal funding, and is well known for its requirement that women is sports programming receive equal support to men is programming. Gabbard, who declined to run for re-election in 2020 and is in the final days of her Congressional term, introduced the bill, titled the “Protect Women is Sports Act,” with Republican Oklahoma Representative Markwayne Mullin. Republican Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler introduced a similar bill, titled “the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,” into the Senate in September. (Loeffler is bill ha snot been taken up for a vote.)“Title IX is being weakened by some states who are misinterpreting [it], creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes,” Representative Gabbard said in a statement. “Our legislation protects Title IX is original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based on sex.”“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance to succeed, including in sports,” said Representative Mullin in a statement of his own. “Allowing biological males to compete in women is sports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.”If implemented into law, the bill would deny federal funding to schools that “permit a person whose biological sex at birth is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.” It was immediately decried by LGBTQ+ advocates.“It is shameful that one of Representative Gabbard is last acts in Congress is to attack trans youth,” said Chase Strangio, deputy director for Trans Justice with the ACLU LGBT & HIV Project in a statement provided to TIME. “While this bill will not advance, it has already sent a dangerous message to trans youth and is spreading the same lies that are fueling attacks on trans youth in state legislatures.”“Representative Gabbard is harmful and unnecessary bill is not about protecting girls and women is sports. There is no evidence in the 18 states with policies that allow transgender athletes to participate on teams consistent with their gender identity that inclusion negatively impacts athletic programs,” added GLAAD is Alex Schmider, Associate Director Transgender Representation. “This is more about opportunistic people like Representative Gabbard who, under false pretense, claim to be protecting girl is sports to justify discrimination.”Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, concurred, describing Gabbard is “play for attention” as “embarrassing” in a statement. “She should be ashamed of trying to burnish her right-wing credentials with attacks on transgender student athletes,” Keisling is statement continued. “It is just a hurtful attempt to get on TV without any regard to the damage such rhetoric does to transgender kids.”Gabbard did not immediately respond to TIME is request for comment on the backlash. Gabbard is record on LGBTQ+ rights received increased scrutiny during her 2020 presidential campaign. In the early 2000s, she worked for her father, Hawaii state Senator Mike Gabbard, and his anti-gay organization The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, that campaigned against the legalization of same-sex marriage in Hawaii. She has since publicly reversed her position and signed an amicus brief challenging the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013.“In my past I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones,” Gabbard said in av ideo apology posted shortly after she announced her presidential candidacy. “My views have changed significantly since the n and my record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart: a strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights.”Yet advocates argue the introduction of “Protect Women is Sports Act” goes directly against those commitments. A number of state legislatures have tried to pass legislation over the past year aimed at prohibiting trans women and girls from participating in female sports teams. Idaho Governor Brad Little signed the“Fairness in Women is Sports Act”into law in March, which said no female sports teams could be open to “students of the male sex” and a “dispute” could be resolved by presenting a signed physician is statement on the student is sex based on their “internal and external reproductive anatomy.” A federal judge struck down the law in March,writingthat the state had not provided a “legitimate interest” the Act served “other than an invalid interest of excluding transgender women and girls from women is sports entirely, regardless of their physiological characteristics.”“This is a victory for all women and girls in Idaho,” the ACLUtweetedat the time. “Trans people belong in sports.”Write toMadeleine Carlisleatmadeleine.carlisle@time.com",1,1,Time Magazine
13,Sleepwalking Into World War III,-9.5,39.17,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-19/sleepwalking-world-war-iii,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,17,"Civilian political authority over military leadership is a bedrock principle of the US Constitution, so fundamental to the American system of government that it has rarely been questioned. But since President Donald Trump entered office in 2017, his administration has systematically eroded the norms that have supported this constitutional principle for generations. The Trump administration has consistently elevated military voices over those of experienced civil servants in the development of foreign policy, and funding cuts to nondefense federal agencies, along with the resignations of many career civil servants, have left government offices woefully understaffed. As a result, policy planning and the guidance of strategic defense initiatives—which have historically been the purview of senior civil servants—have increasingly been ceded to those in uniform. Civilian authority over the armed forces is weaker now than at any point in living memory, and the Trump administration is increasingly engaging with the world in ways that mirror military preferences. The resulting foreign policy is eerily reminiscent of the “cult of the offensive”: an overconfidence in offensive military advantage that can lead to rapid escalation; such overconfidence is widely believed to have contributed to the outbreak of World War I Unless civilian control over the military can be reestablished, the USs risks sleepwalking its way into another world war. By giving civilian leaders authority over the military, the framers of the US Constitution were not merely assigning elected officials a few oversight duties. They were creating a system in which defense planning would be guided by civilian needs and the military would carry out its activities in the service of civilian goals. Since Trump is civilian “America first” plan was announced early in the 2016 presidential campaign, many members of the US foreign policy community have viewed the agenda as an inherent danger to national security. Even more worrisome for those concerned about the continuing stability of civil-military relations, many of the cabinet nominees whom the new administration found acceptable were military officers, such as General James Mattis, General John Kelly, and Lieutenant General HR McMaster. From the beginning of the Trump era, the national security establishment made a Faustian bargain: in an effort to constrain the new president, it looked the other way as extraordinary numbers of active duty and retired military officers were appointed to positions usually reserved for civilian experts. As the “adults in the room,” these career military officials hoped to protect American alliances and constrain Trump is worst impulses. Although few of these officers questioned the principle of civilian control, their narrow interpretation of civilian oversight meant that broader norms of civilian guidance became a kind of collateral damage in the struggle to contain the chaos. This political bargain gave the more experienced military officers at the highest levels of the administration, some of whom had served together for decades, a natural advantage over their civilian counterparts. Their shared service gave them a common language and, most important, an outlook that allowed them to easily sideline civilian outsiders like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and later, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. When leaders are appointed at the top levels of government, they staff their organizations with people whom they trust to execute their plans. Most civilian leaders have diverse professional networks to draw upon, but career military officers tend to know few qualified people outside of veterans’ organizations. As a result, many of the lower-level staff posts within the Trump administration have also been filled with retired military officers. In the office of the secretary of defense, uniformed officers continue to execute civilian responsibilities. And although sluggish hiring and retention difficulties have played a role, Mattis is admitted preference for military officers over career civil servants during his tenure exacerbated the imbalance. When the department did hire civilians, it often placed them in “acting” roles with little power and even less influence. The result is that uniformed officers of the military have developed and enacted policy for the secretary of defense—such that it does not necessarily reflect the priorities of civilians in the administration. Indeed, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commissionnotedin November 2018 that “there is an imbalance in civil-military relations on critical issues of strategy development and implementation. Civilian voices appear relatively muted on issues at the center of US defense and national security policy.”Military officers and civilians see foreign affairs differently. Military officers tend to assume worst-case intentions and capabilities in order to be best prepared for potential threats. When called upon to act, they often prefer solutions that enable them to take the offensive. When civilians lose their voice in the process, military preferences shape security strategy in ways that reflect these institutional biases toward action and confrontation. And as civilian control of the US armed forces has declined, these preferences have increasingly dominated American foreign policy. Thus, the current imbalance in civil-military relations has led to a foreign policy that has heightened international tensions, closed off avenues for productive diplomacy, and increased the risk of inadvertent escalation or even accidental war. Mattis and McMaster principally authored the 2017 USs National Security Strategy and the 2018National Defense Strategy. These documents defined security almost exclusively in terms of great-power competition and state actors, emphasizing the threat from China in particular. The strategies largely approach the world as a zero-sum competition in which maintaining an advantage matters far more than cooperating for mutual benefit. Current US strategy the refore filters the meaning of the changing geopolitical environment almost exclusively through military perceptions of threat. In the event of a war with China or Russia, the military would face a daunting task in the South China Sea or in the Baltic states. Its instinct, the n, is to develop the strategies and build the capabilities that are most likely to win such a confrontation at the lowest cost possible. But these strategies can have dangerous consequences. With their emphasis on “globally integrated operations,” senior military commanders are developing retaliatory military strategies that emphasize speed and could lead to quick escalation, effectively limiting the options of political bodies like theNorth Atlantic Councilin the event of a conflict. And by officially labeling China a “revisionist” state, Mattis and McMaster assume its hostility, forcing decision-makers to start from the premise that diplomatic approaches are unproductive and preventive action is the only way to contain China is ambitions. Military leaders need civilian input in order to mitigate these risks. Military operational preferences privilege offensive action—civilian officials are best positioned to articulate the pitfalls of such an approach, lest the concern about a great-power war become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The military naturally seeks to modernize and acquire new weapons systems. In response to this desire, the Trump administration withdrew from at least three major arms control agreements, and it looks unlikely to renew the New START agreement with Russia. But without arms control, the USs not only risks setting off arms races but also loses transparency into its adversaries’ systems, capabilities, and intent. Decision-makers must the n adopt the military is worst-case assumptions in the event of a crisis, and they are likely to miscalculate. The military is priority of seeking ever more lethal and modern weapons increases the risks of nuclear use and proliferation. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review advocated for the development and deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons in response to Russia is alleged intention to use limited nuclear strikes in regional conflicts. But by acquiring nuclear weapons specifically designed to be used in a much wider set of circumstances than the current inventory, the military has effectively lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons—a fact that did not escape congressional leaders during their hearings on the document. Furthermore, as the USs modernizes its arsenal, states with vulnerable stockpiles may feel the need to invest even more in their nuclear programs, increasing their inventories and investing in second-strike capabilities. The USs has proposed to develop new weapons systems capable of dismantling nascent nuclear programs. Some states may the refore conclude that nuclear latency—the ability to develop a nuclear weapons program from existing peaceful infrastructure—is no longer a sufficient deterrent and choose to proliferate instead. The USs is rushing even now to introduce hypersonic weapons into its arsenal. Such missiles serve essentially no defensive purpose—and their development is leading to a new nuclear arms race. The White House and Congress must reestablish strong civilian control over military priorities if the USs is to find diplomatic solutions that can help avoid another great-power war. The next administration, whether under Joe Biden or Donald Trump, should refrain from equating military experience with foreign policy expertise. Rather, at the top levels of government, the president should reset the balance of power toward civilians, appointing officials whose backgrounds yield a variety of perspectives on foreign policymaking. The next president is priority upon taking office should be to fill positions within the civilian office of the secretary of defense that have been largely taken over by uniformed military officers. These new civilians should be hired in a manner that maximizes the office is demographic, experiential, and intellectual diversity. Current hiring laws privilege hiring veterans, which limits the diversity of those in policymaking positions. Civilian hiring initiatives must the refore act as a counterweight to that tendency. Finally, the administration should comprehensively review engagements, programs, and posture to ensure that US actions are in fact aligned with strategic intent. Such a review should encompass all military programs. Many may seem like good ideas in isolation, but in combination they may prove to be provocative or threatening. Civilian leaders should make political determinations about the risks and rewards of military spending on offensive weapons programs; in particular, they should review the constraints on the new Space Force that may be necessary in order to both encourage service pride and avoid an arms race and conflict. In 1962, the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles just 90 miles from the USs’ shore. President John F Kennedy and the rest of the civilian leadership did not allow the military to continue with its standard operating procedures and preferred courses of action. Instead, they carefully orchestrated a series of signals that narrowly avoided the outbreak of open hostilities between the world is two nuclear superpowers. Current US policy resembles the firm civilian control and oversight of the Kennedy administration far less than it does the posture of the great powers before the outbreak of World War I Civilian leadership was either co-opted or pushed aside as French, German, and Russian militaries pursued strategies that prioritize offensive operations and doctrines—leading to the now famous cult of the offensive. Privileging the military is perceptions of threat over those of diplomats makes war all but inevitable. Without strong civilian oversight, the USs risks this catastrophic fate.",1,2,Foreign Affairs
14,Column: The Atlantic says ‘the California Dream is dying.’ So what else is new?,-2.67,37.67,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-23/the-atlantic-california-dream-is-dying,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Magazine writers’ chestnuts do not get any more dependable than the “death of the California dream” trope. It is got everything a writer looking for buzz could ask for: the irresistible opportunity to simultaneously evoke and denigrate the sun and fun of the Golden State. Bikini-clad prurience and quelling of readers’ enviousness in one glittering package. Hollywood glamor, Silicon Valley wealth and the dark side of both, all at the same time. If California fails to offer young people and newcomers the opportunity to improve their lot, the consequences will be catastrophic—and not only for California.— Conor Friedersdorf, The Atlantic“You were right to scoff,” the authors assure their readers. “California is just as bad as the place you live in.”No wonder that articles flogging this the me appear so regularly, every six months or so, that you can pre-fill your iPhone calendar app years in advance to notify you that the next one is on its way. The latest installment comes to us from the Atlantic, an 8,000-word piece titled“The California Dream Is Dying.”Its author, Conor Friedersdorf, is a Californian himself. That sets him apart, at least, from the customary authors of similar screeds, visitors from outside parachuting in for a week or two to sponge up local color for their takes. Friedersdorf, however, follows more or less the same course as many of the others. Like the m, his mood is both elegiac and apocalyptic.“California has always thrived by embracing both cultural and economic dynamism,” he writes. But “if California fails to offer young people and newcomers the opportunity to improve their lot, the consequences will be catastrophic — and not only for California.”As I have observed in the past, the literary genre of California truth-telling dates back to the mid-1800s. The earliest version I have found was published in 1855, in only the fifth year of California statehood, by one Hinton R Helper, a transplant from North Carolina who cursed the state is “rottenness and its corruption, its squalor and its misery, its crime and its shame.” (Helper was not wrong.)Five years later, Horace Greeley, famous for having counseled young men to “Go West,” warned that California was almost tapped out as a land of opportunity.“No more merchants or clerks are wanted,” he wrote; “and of those who come hereafter, nine-tenths will go back disappointed or impoverished, or stay here paupers.”Friedersdorf is not wrong about many of the maladies facing the California dream today. He cites an anti-growth mentality by residents that causes a lack of affordable housing, conflicts over water, deteriorating roads and other infrastructure and government regulation. All these features do exist in California, though some of the complainants Friedersdorf quotes are plainly engaged in special pleading. That includes an almond farmer in the Central Valley who grouses that the average Californian does not understand what he does for a living or how much his crop contributes to the state. Um, no: The problem with the California almond crop is not that people do not understand it but that almond trees’ demand for an uninterruptible water supply is less and less consistent with the availability of water as the state is drought deepens and global warming threatens to make it even worse. Friedersdorf mentions the grower is fallowing of land and bulldozing of almond trees because of drought but does not explore how the competition for ever-scarcer water shapes the state — and not necessarily for the worse — beyond that. Among other things, the state is a national leader in water conservation. Overregulation? Friedersdorf quotes business owners complaining they have been cited for violations. (My guess: A poll of such business owners would turn up unanimous agreement that regulation is bad.) But he denigrates the state is landmark California Environmental Quality Act by citing how it interferes with the addition of bike lanes on public roads. This is a woefully skewed picture of CEQA, which was enacted in 1970 in the aftermath of the Santa Barbara oil spill, a genuine catastrophe. Friedersdorf calls CEQA “vulnerable to abuse,” by which he means that it is exploited by locals to block environmentally suspect projects. But he does not mention that it is also vulnerable to political pressure by well-heeled developers, like the developers of big NFL stadiums who received exemptions from CEQA rules they claimed were onerous. He cites surveys by CEOs and business lobbies ranking California is business environment as the worst in the nation. I have reported many time son the folly of relying on similar surveys to gauge the strength of the state is economy, since they consistently fail to explain how such an anti-business state can show the nation is strongest economic growth. Maybe they are just baloney. Friedersdorf, to his credit, shows that he is well aware that California is history is nothing like a steady march to diversity and opportunity for all. “Across its first century, California kept attracting fortune seekers both foreign and domestic, its population always growing,” he writes, before acknowledging “California is many failures to do right by its wildly diverse inhabitants.”As he reports, the Gold Rush led to genocidal attacks on native tribes. The importation of Chinese labor for the Central Pacific Railroad led to the Chinese exclusion laws. Development of farmland by Japanese settlers led to statewide discrimination against the Japanese and ultimately to their wartime incarceration, one of the most unpardonable episodes in California, and American, history. The state is relationship with Latino and Black residents has been punctuated by outbreaks of violence, some of it directed at ethnic minorities and some of it the expression of minorities’ frustration with social inequity: the Zoot Suit riots of the 1940s, the 1965 Watts riot, the 1992 Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict. The fundamental problem with Friedersdorf is piece and many like it is a problem of framing. By implying that something new has arrived to derail the California dream, he implies that the state was strutting high, wide and handsome until very recently, when it ran into a brick wall and the dream was blown to smithereens by encroaching reality. He mentions the report in May that the state had experienced a net loss in population during the pandemic. Evoking Carey McWilliams, the California historian whose 1949 paean to the state identified it as “the great exception,” Friedersdorf writes that the shrinking of the state is population is something “McWilliams would have found unthinkable.”That is surely incorrect. McWilliams in his book made clear that California was a work in progress and could veer off into any direction: “The time has not yet arrived for a real summing-up; one cannot, as yet, properly place California in the American scheme of things.... There is still too much commotion — too much noise and movement and turmoil.”McWilliams also warned that “California is resources are basically inadequate to support its future population.” Rather than finding a population break “unthinkable,” McWilliams saw it as very, very plausible. What “the dream is dead” the me overlooks is that California has always been a place of boom-and-bust economics, of shifting political ideologies and of contradictions of all sorts. It is seen today as a beacon of progressive politics, as it was at the turn of the last century; but between those bookends it also gave us Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Favorite son Earl Warren ranks as one of California is most liberal governors and became an avatar of racial justice as chief justice of the US; what is almost universally forgotten is his virulently racist advocacy of Japanese incarceration during the war.“When we are dealing with the Caucasian race we have methods that will test the loyalty of the m,” Warren advised a congressional committee pondering the policy, “but when we deal with the Japanese we are in an entirely different field.”Some of what Friedersdorf identifies as California ills are obviously maladies of American society as a whole. He tells how his grandfather, a carpenter, was able to buy a house, settle in Orange County and raise a family of four as his household is sole breadwinner in the 1950s.“At 41,” he writes, “I’d be hard-pressed to buy a home in the neighborhood where my grandfather built his house and where my parents bought theirs three decades later.” That may be so, but the hollowing out of the American middle class and the difficulties of achieving home ownership, not to mention college tuition and retirement, is not merely a California phenomenon but a national one. It is fair to say that California, for all its strengths, is not immune from the inequality of the American economy, but is that a rap against the “California dream”?Every virtue of California from its statehood to its astonishing postwar growth was sure to inspire a reaction; it is hardly unusual for people who have climbed the ladder of economic success to try to pull it up behind them. California residents who settled in desirable neighborhoods have fought to keep them as they were at the start. But the not-in-my-backyard impulse is not unique to the Golden State. Californians confronted extremes of water and air pollution and responded with some of the most stringent pollution regulations in the land. To some of Friedersdorf is sources, this is a burden. But the state is methods of controlling pollution have become models for dozens of other states, so there must be some good to them. To say the California dream is dead or dying is still at least somewhat of an exaggeration. The population decline is properly blamed on the pandemic and i smore than likely to reverse soon. The state is median household income of $75,200 handily exceeds that of states whose reactionary governors love to point to California as a failure: Texas, $61,870; Florida, $55,660. Until the recent Delta variant-driven surge in COVID cases, California is new case rate was the best in the country. Critics assert that California is “hemorrhaging people,” but this is not a new phenomenon — California has lost population to other states every year for the last three decades; the issue is who is leaving and who is arriving? The answer is that it still sees net in-migration of those with advanced degrees, the highest incomes, and the young. So, yes, in a sense the California dream is dying, but it has been dying almost since it was born. Friedersdorf shows an acute awareness of where the threats to the state is future lie, as he should, being a Californian with the incisive awareness of the outside world of any good journalist. But somehow, the state is still showing the rest of the country, and the world, how to survive and even thrive in the face of the harsh realities around us. Maybe the next iteration of the “California is dying” trope will get it right.",1,2,LA Times

The Energy Department is returning to the standard that was approved in 2013, noting that most shower heads already provide an ample amount of water for a thorough wash. Most commercial shower heads are already aligned with the 2013 rule, so the policy change will have little impact among consumers. Showerheads that could generate the additional supply of water that former President Donald Trump sought are not widely available, Energy officials said. Since 1992, federal law has stipulated that shower heads should not put out more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. However, as newer shower heads were introduced into the market, the administration of former President Barack Obama modified the restrictions to reflect the total amount of water that came out of any nozzles. If a showerhead had three nozzles, for example, no more than 2.5 gallons of water total could be released from all three nozzles per minute. The Trump rule,which was instituted last December, allowed for each nozzle to release a maximum of 2.5 gallons of water per minute instead of the standard applying to the entire showerhead. The rule change, which would return to the Obama-era standard, is slated to published in the Federal Register next week. The general public will the n have 60 days to comment on the proposal before a final rule is devised, according to The Associated Press. Energy officials estimated that the previous rule saved US households roughly $38 a year and believe that returning to the old standard will yield similar savings. Kelly Speakes-Backman, the acting assistant secretary for the department is Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, touted the move on Friday.""As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchase shower heads that conserve water and save them money on their utility bills,"" she said. Trump, in pushing for the change under his administration, mentioned that his hair needed to be ""perfect.""""So shower heads — you take a shower, the water does not come out.

Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the energy conservation groupAppliance Standards Awareness Project, told The Associated Press that with four or more nozzles ""you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom.""""At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencing serious drought exacerbated by climate change, the re is no place for shower heads that use needless amounts of water,"" he said.

First, on July 24, the FDA filed a memorandum to stay (halt) Judge Chuang is preliminary injunction pending an appeal. As NRL News Today reported, Judge Chuang maintained that the safety precautions required by the FDA constituted a “substantial obstacle” to a woman is right to abortion. Second, today more than 20 pro-life leaders, including NRL President Carol Tobias, wrote to the head of the FDA urging Dr. Stephen Hahn “to protect American women and preborn children by removing the abortion pill (mifepristone) from the US market.”The letter approvingly cited (as NRL News Today reported previously) “the FDA is decision to shut down illegal web sites trafficking unapproved abortion pills into the US,” but asked the FDA to go further—“to classify the abortion pill as an ‘imminent hazard to the public health’ that poses a ‘significant threat of danger’” and pull it off the market. The abortion industry is brazen in its determination to use the COVID-19 pandemic to erase any and all limitations of how women undergo medication/chemical abortions. They are not subtle: their stated objective is DYI abortions in which women receive the abortifacients by mail or pick up them from a pharmacy. Proponents, of course, insist such self-administered abortions are safe, an assertion Judge Chuang, an Obama appointee, agreed with wholeheartedly. The letter sent to Dr. Hahn thoroughly and systematically disputed that characterization. For example,This lethal drug that the FDA permits for killing innocent preborn children during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is also highly dangerous for women. According to the FDA is adverse event reporting system, the abortion pill has resulted in over 4,000 reported adverse events since 2000, including 24 maternal deaths. Adverse events are notoriously underreport ed to the FDA, and as of 2016, the FDA only requires abortion pill manufacturers to report maternal deaths. Manufacturers gather this information from the prescribers, such as Planned Parenthood facilities. Yet, women who experience side effects like heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, or severe infections are likely to seek care at emergency rooms, not the abortion facilities where they received the pills. Since emergency rooms are not required to report abortion pill adverse events to the FDA, the true number of adverse events is impossible to assess. For these and other reasons cited in the letter, the pro-life leaders urged the FDA “to pull the abortion pill from the US market immediately and declare it an imminent hazard to the public health”; encouraged “your continued efforts to stop the illegal trafficking of black market abortion pills into US commerce”; and requested the FDA “to fight back against the abortion industry is radical push to overturn REMS in the courts.”[In this case REMS– Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy—mandates that mifepristone can be dispensed only in clinics, medical offices and hospitals; only by, or under the supervision of, a doctor certified to prescribe the drug; and only to patients who have signed an FD A.-approved patient agreement,” to quote the New York Times.]The FDA is July 24 memorandum to Judge Chuang dismantled his reasoning point by point by point. (What I neglected to mention in a prior story was the condescending manner in which Judge Chuang haughtily dismissed the FDA is defense of its REMS policy. He also heavily relied on the testimony of one abortionist– Dr. Heather Paladine.)The memorandum begins by observing that Judge Chuang incorrectly concluded the abortion industry has “standing” (the legal right) to file a lawsuit on behalf of women seeking medication abortion. As to the close relationship element, the Court ruled that Plaintiffs “provided specific evidence of close physician-patient relationships, including between Dr. Paladine and her patients.”But evidence of a single physician is Relationship with her patients does not establish that the thousands of physicians who are members of the Plaintiff organizations generally have close relationships with their own patients who seek a Mifeprex [the brand name for mifepristone] prescription, and may seek to assert not only the rights of long-time patients, but of all patients seeking Mifeprex prescriptions. The FDA added tellingly(I)n fact, the entire point of this suit is to reduce Plaintiffs’ relationship with their patients—and failed to show that their patients were hindered from vindicating their own rights. The memorandum also persuasively made the case that “Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That the In-Person Requirements Pose a Substantial Obstacle to a Large Fraction of Women Seeking an Abortion During the COVID-19 Pandemic.” That is, the in-person requirement did not constitute an “undue burden” on a woman is right to have an abortion. Further, the Memorandum observed that Judge Chuang had “noted that FDA has not fully evaluated the in-person requirement since 2013 and thus has not determined whether the requirements remain necessary in the context of tele medicine or the pandemic.”The response all but bristled…In reaching its conclusion. the Court relied on the Supreme Court is statement in Whole Woman is Health that courts should avoid “giv[ing] ‘[u]ncritical deference’ to the findings of the legislature.”But FDA is not a legislature—it is an expert scientific agency responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs. FDA is evaluation of a drug is risks to determine the appropriate restrictions necessary for safe use is a matter quintessentially within FDA is expert scientific judgment. The FDA concluded that if Judge Chuang decides not to stay his “preliminary injunction pending Appeal,” the n it “respectfully asks that the Court summarily deny the motion without awaiting a response from Plaintiffs, so that Defendants can seek relief from the Fourth Circuit expeditiously.”",1,0,Life News
19,Herod and Bacon: Colorado is Black Caucus has big concerns about redistricting maps,-12.0,31.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/23/colorado-black-caucus-redistricting-minority-house-senate-districts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Recently preliminary redistricting maps were released for Colorado is state House and Senate. Though we have been assured that these maps will change over time, the approach used to draw the new lines is deeply troubling. In many of the new districts, communities of color have been broken apart to diminish our voting power for no discernable reason other than arbitrary road-based divisions that mean nothing to voters. For example, the current House District 8 has been split down the middle in the new maps, separating the historic Five Points neighborhood from North Park Hill. Both of the new districts, house districts 4 and 6, will have a lower percent Black population, effectively diluting our voting strength and making it more difficult to get Black representation in the state House. House District 8 has historical significance to Colorado. The first Black representation came out of the district. That representation brought our state major advancements in civil rights from the formal recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day to police reform. Similarly, Aurora House and Senate lines have been reconfigured in ways that may reduce the chances of Black members getting elected to the Colorado General Assembly. In El Paso County, the African American population is fractured between four House districts and three Senate districts. According to the Colorado Sun, a redistricting commission advising attorney, Jeremiah Barry, acknowledged that the maps were drawn with the knowledge they would dilute minority voting power, reducing majority Hispanic House districts from seven to three. The process of splitting minority communities into separate districts, a tactic known as “cracking” during gerrymander attempts, has long been used to prevent adequate representation from minorities in legislative bodies around the country. Dramatically redrawing Colorado is current districts, rather than expanding or contracting current borders based on population changes, needs to have a strong justification. One that is lacking here. As reported during this last session prejudice still runs rampant. The Black caucus as an entity is a multi generational group spanning in age and experience from members who lived during Jim Crow to those born during The New Jim Crow. Our voice is a vital voice for freedom. To see it diluted is an affront to centuries of hard work and activism to not just be seen and heard, but to be at the table when determining our community is fate. These “starting place” maps should be to ssed out and the commission should start with the current Colorado House and Senate lines, which have previously been approved by the Colorado Supreme Court. There is no justification for dramatically reducing Black and other minority voting power across the board.",1,2,Denver Post

21,Massachusetts Question 2: Ranked choice voting opponents take victory lap,0.0,48.33,https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-question-2-ranked-choice-voting-opponents-take-victory-lap/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"Opponents of ranked-choice voting in Massachusetts took a victory lap on Wednesday after voters turned down a new voting system for the state. Question 2 — implementing ranked-choice voting in the Bay State — was defeated by a 55% to 45% margin. Question 1 — updating the “right to repair” law — overwhelmingly passed 75% to 25%. Opponents of the ranked-choice ballot measure said Wednesday that voters handily rejected the question and that “the will of the people is pretty clear” against ranked-choice voting. The “No on 2” side also addressed the potential for backers of ranked-choice voting to try again in Massachusetts.“Anyone that has the willpower can put something on the ballot, and anyone that has the willpower can defeat it, too,” said Paul Craney, of the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, which opposed the question along with the Massachusetts Republican Party and Governor Charlie Baker. The chair of the “Yes on 2” campaign on Wednesday said the result was “obviously disappointing,” but noted that more than 1 million people supported the proposed voting system.“This kind of change is definitely hard,” said chair Evan Falchuk. “It is a marathon, not a sprint.“There are a lot of people here in Massachusetts and around the country that see this kind of political reform as a big part of rebuilding our democracy,” he added. Asked if the campaign will try the ballot measure again in the Bay State, Falchuk replied, “Maybe one day.” He also cited the ranked-choice voting bills in the Legislature, and cities and towns looking into it.“We are going to keep the faith and keep moving forward,” Falchuk said. The voting system— which has been adopted by the state of Maine and a handful of cities nationwide — would enable voters to rank as many candidates as they want in order of preference. Workers tallying the vote first look at all of the first-place votes, and, if someone has a majority, the election stops there and that person wins, as is the case right now. If no candidate wins more than 50%, the bottom vote-getter is eliminated, and all of the ballots that went to them are allocated to voters’ second-place choices. If no one is above 50%, the process repeats, eliminating one candidate per round until there are only two candidates left, at which point the one with the most votes wins. Many Massachusetts voters “did not understand why anyone would want to add such a complicated system, such a complicated measure into voting,” said Anthony Amore, of the “No on 2” committee. Ranked-choice voting was repealed in Worcester, and Lowell voters rejected it last year, Craney said. When asked about the possibility of the Legislature taking up ranked-choice voting, Craney said, “Any time the Legislature does anything, it is supposed to be the will of the people. In this case, the will of the people is pretty clear as far as what they think of ranked choice.”“That is up to them … if they want to go ahead and pursue something that clearly has no mandate and the voters have spoken pretty clear on it,” he added. “We will have to address it if it does come up legislatively at that time.”",2,1,Boston Herald

On July 1937, however, Earhart achieved fame for an unfortunate reason. Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonandisappearedin the irLockheed Electra plane, while attempting a global flight. Despite extensive efforts to find the m, they were never found, nor was any wreckage from their plane. Earhart was officially declared dead in 1939. Despite disappearing more than eight decades ago, Earhart has remained a pop culturefixture. She has also remained the focal point of conspiracy the ories, some of them more bizarre than others. Officially, the position of the US has been that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean while trying to reach tiny Howland Island to land and refuel. Some believe that Earhart was captured by the Japanese government after landing in the Marshall Islands, with some pointing to a photograph taken in the 1930s that allegedly showed both Earhart and her plane there. In another theory, some speculated she took on the identity of ""Tokyo Rose,"" a propagandist who made English-language broadcasts intended to demoralize Allied forces during World War II There was no evidence for this narrative. But Ric Gillespie, author of the book ""Finding Amelia"" and executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery,toldthe BBC in 2017 that there is no evidence supporting the claim that a photograph shows Earhart in Japanese custody. Another theory is that Earhart and Noonan successfully landed on Nikumaroro, another tiny island southeast of Howland, but both died there as rescuers failed to find them in time. Per National Geographic, tantalizing clues, including human remains and airplane parts, were discovered on the island by a British exploration party in 1937. Another unfounded theory was that Earhart survived and returned to the US, but assumed a new identity, namely ""Irene Bolham."" This theory, put forward by book author Joe Klaas, was false, as ABC Newsreported:The theory should have died after Bolham sued Klaas, his associate Joe Gervais, and McGraw-Hill for defamation and McGraw-Hill pulled the book from shelves. But 33 years later, another book, ""Amelia Earhart Survives"" by Col. Rollin Reineck, came out in 2003 making the same claim. Stranger the ories about Earhart is disappearance attribute it to ana lien abduction and even more bizarre, the idea that she was saved by a race of people that live inside the Earth.",1,2,Snopes

Even with the tumult of 2020 -- from the COVID-19 pandemic to social unrest to a president who refused to concede an election and incited an insurrection -- corporate America trended toward inclusivity, with 60 corporations that previously appeared on the CEI receiving perfect scores for the first time. In total, 767 businesses met all the criteria to earn a 100 percent rating and the designation of being a ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality,"" including several that participated in the CEI for the first time ever. HRC considers numerous criteria when ranking company is LGBTQ+ inclusivity. Criteria 1 is workplace protections, specifically if companies prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (also, in 2020 the Supreme Court banned anti-LGBTQ+ workplace discrimination across the US). Criteria 2 is whether companies offer inclusive medical benefits and other additional benefits for same-sex spouses and domestic partners as well as transgender-inclusive medical care. Criteria 3 ranks companies on inclusive culture and corporate responsibility, specifically diversity training for management and new hires, gender transition guidelines, LGBTQ+ resource groups, and outreach and engagement to the LGBTQ+ community, either through marketing, advertising, or philanthropy. The latter criteria is imperative because as HRC notes, ""policy is not practice,"" and 46 percent of LGBTQ+ employees remain closeted at work. The recent improvement in corporate treatment of LGBTQ+ employees and issues is evident and dramatic. For example, ""a full 94 percent of the Fortune 500 -- including both companies that participate in the CEI survey and those that do not -- have gender identity protections enumerated in their nondiscrimination policies (up from 3 percent in 2002) and 99 percent of the entire CEI universe of businesses offer explicit gender identity nondiscrimination protections (up from 5 percent in 2002),"" HRC states.

The progressive leader called for repentance of “policy sin.”The day after the inauguration, as with past transitions of power in the USs, the Washington National Cathedral hosted the National Prayer Service, also called the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Service. This year, the service was primarily virtual due to the pandemic, with many who sang or read scripture at the Cathedral wearing face masks and socially distanced. Barber called for people “to choose to repent of the policy sin and to repair the breach."" The NAACP leader defined a breach as ""a gap in the nation between what is and how God wants things to be.”“Transposed to our time, the breach is when we say ‘one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all’ with our lips, while we see the rich and the poor living in two very different Americas,” the pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina continued.“The breach would be knowing the only way to ensure domestic tranquility is to establish justice. It is pretending that we can address the nation is wounds with simplistic calls for unity. That is not how we can close the breach.”The 57-year-old preacher said that he believed the violence at the US Capitol on January 6 was “the result of a long history"" and a ""politics of division that was cynically named ‘positive polarization’ by those who thought they could use it for their own political advantage.”“This strategy of feeding and seeding intentional racial class division into the body politic spilled over into the inevitable violence that ideas of supremacy always produce,” added Barber.“If we want to come out of this jam and move forward together, we cannot accept the racial disparities and racial violence and breaches that impact black, brown, native, and Asian Americans while offering collateral damage to our poor white brothers and sisters and ultimately, our entire democracy.”Delaware State University President Tony Allen, CEO of the Presidential Inaugural Committee, said in a statement on January 19 that the prayer service was an important event.“The National Prayer Service is an important tradition for our nation and for President Biden, who has always been a man guided deeply by his faith,”stated Allen.“The program announced today will honor the role of faith in our country and provide a moment to reflect on the unprecedented challenges we face as we enter this new American chapter of healing to beat the pandemic, build back our economy better and unify our country.”While hosted by the National Cathedral, as with past inaugural prayer services, representatives from multiple Christian denominations and other faiths participated in the ceremony. Many faith leaders gave prayers from different locations. Among them was Jim Wallis, the founder and former head of the evangelical social justice organization Sojourners; the Reverend Otis Moss III, senior pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago; Rabbi Sharon Brous, senior rabbi of IKAR Jewish community in Los Angeles; Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation; and Sikh American activist and author Valarie Kaur. There were scripture readings from multiple religions, with Muslim Community Network President Debbie Almontaser reading from the Quran and transgender Rev. Paula Stone Williams reading from the Old Testament book of Isaiah. Singer-songwriter Patti LaBelle performed the national anthem, with other musical performances by Josh Groban, the Clark Sisters and the Washington National Cathedral Choir. The Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington,gave introductory remarks for the service.“As we mark, once again, the transition of political leadership and look toward the future with resolve and hope, let these sacred texts, songs, and petitions inspire us all to seek divine guidance always, care for one another, and live according to the highest aspirations to which God calls us as individuals and a nation,” said Budde. Since being elected president, a major the me for Biden, as seen during his inauguration, has been that of unity among Americans despite political differences.""My whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, and uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause,"" Biden said in his inauguration speech.""Uniting to fight the common foes we face: anger, resentment, hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, hopelessness.

25,The Democratic Party Is Setting the Stage for a Letdown,-19.0,34.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democratic-convention-sanders-virtual/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"During the week of August 17, thousands of Democrats elected to serve as delegates to their party is national convention will log on to their computers to view the proceedings. They will cast electronic votes on the party platform and for their party is nominee to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency. About one-quarter of this year is delegates are Bernie Sanders supporters. Most of them are progressive political activists—and many are first-time participants in a national convention. This virtual event will not be the experience they expected. And while all of those with whom I have spoken are supportive of the precautions being taken in this era of pandemic, most remain in the dark about the convention plans and whether their participation is valued. Months ago, when the 2020 Summer Olympics and a host of professional sporting events were canceled, it should have been clear that we were going to have problems bringing tens of thousands of delegates, supporters, and press to Milwaukee. I fully recognize the political calculations that had to be made, the problems of disappointing the host city, the need to have an event that would serve as a launching pad for the presidential election season. And I have no doubt that the convention planning team and DNC staffers were working round the clock weighing all these problems and exploring options. Nevertheless, what was missing was a recognition that the convention was not just the concern of the planning staff or the Biden campaign. It was personal for the delegates—especially first-timers, many of whom worked hard to earn their posts, felt empowered when they won, and were looking forward to playing their part in this quadrennial drama. Given this, it was troubling how little communication there was with prospective delegates and how little engagement there was with DNC members while deliberations were ongoing. I should be clear that I am not faulting the convention or DNC staff that delegates were left in the dark. This was a political call that should have come from the leadership of the party. With this in mind, the Bernie Delegates Network (BDN) conducted a national survey of Sanders delegates. We wanted to get their assessment of the planning process, whether they felt respected as delegates, and ideas they might have shared had they been consulted. Their responses should be seen as troubling both for the party and the Biden campaign. More than 80 percent of those who responded said they felt disrespected or ignored. And their comments made clear why. Common refrains were that as delegates they “felt left out” and that the process was “lacking in transparency and input.” Some went further, cautioning that this year is “organizing, like the 2016 DNC convention, seems to minimize participation by Sanders delegates.”Two others summed up the views of many: “It should have been anticipated much earlier that the convention would be online and things planned with that in mind ahead of time. [There were] a lot of missed opportunities…” And there was “too little communication with stakeholders, that is, delegates and DNC members. It has been a closed affair— not seeking input…” Frequently, the Sanders delegates also complained that they had no idea how this convention will allow their voices to be heard. They expressed the desire to participate but said they “do not know how.” And a number of first-time delegates were unsure whether their participation was even valued by the party. Some may dismiss these complaints as coming from the disgruntled losing side, but there is a risk in doing so. Young and old progressives are an important constituency. They make up a respectable share of Democratic voters, and many are activists who represent communities Democrats will need to win. As Jesse Jackson famously noted at the 1988 Democratic convention, “It takes two wings to fly.” In party-building, there can be no victor/vanquished. The role of a successful convention is to heal internal divisions and create unity of purpose among the various component groups of the party. In 2016, too little attention was paid to this critical undertaking. Bernie Sanders, personally, tried to soothe the disappointment felt by his delegation. But the message they received from the establishment was “We won, and you lost.” They felt shut out of the proceedings and left the convention demoralized. This year could have been different. So far, it has not been. There is not the same degree of rancor as there was four years ago; the Biden/Sanders task forces formed to create a unified approach to writing the platform, while producing a document not wholly satisfying to progressives, was still a good-faith effort to bridge differences. But leaving grassroots delegates in the dark as to how the convention will work—and reducing their role to passive online viewers—runs the risk of producing a massive letdown that could leave hundreds of delegates alienated. What this may mean is that at the conclusion of the party confab, many first-time Sanders delegates (and some old-timers, as well), instead of being energized and engaged, may turn off their computers feeling deflated and dejected. The unity so necessary for victory will not have been achieved. This can still be addressed. If there is a will, creative solutions can still be found to give us the “two wings” we need to fly. But time is running out.",1,1,The Nation

Dr. Sam Parnia is studying consciousness after death and examining cardiac arrest cases in Europe and the US The assistant professor of Medicine at the Stony Brook University School of Medicine says people in the first phase of death may still experience some form of consciousness. The expert ventured that people who have survived cardiac arrest later accurately described what was happening around them after their hearts stopped beating. He said: “They will describe watching doctors and nurses working, they will describe having awareness of full conversations, of visual things that were going on, that would otherwise not be known to them.”Explaining when a patient is officially declared dead, he said: “It is all based on the moment when the heart stops.“Technically speaking, that is how you get the time of death.”His study is examining what happens to the brain after a person goes into cardiac arrest – and whether consciousness continues after death and for how long – to improve the quality of resuscitation and prevent brain injuries while restarting the heart.

Michael FQ San Nicolas, theUS Representativeof Guam,saidduring the hearing that the US government should be “graduating its territories into whole parts of it or setting them free.”Today, the USs controls five inhabited island territories: Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. The people of American Samoa are US nationals, and the inhabitants of the four other territories are US citizens. The five territories are integral parts of the USs, populated by Americans who have proven their dedication to their country. Territory residents inGuamandAmerican Samoaserve in the military at much higher rates than those in the states. The territories are also home to more than100,000 veterans. Still, the Americans who live in these territories are denied basic rights that most citizens take for granted. They are not represented in the Senate, and their Representatives in the House cannot vote on legislation. They are not even allowed to vote for the Presidents who might send them to war. The territories also experience significant economic disadvantages, receiving fewer benefits from federal programs such asMedicaidand theSupplemental Security Incomeprogram. All five territories have a lower per-capita income than the average per-capita income of the fifty states and the District of Columbia. The “lack of equal representation and equal voting power has a direct correlation to persistent poverty across all of the US territories,” Stacey E Plaskett, the representative of the US Virgin Islands,testifiedat the hearing. “Americans living in the territories are accustomed to being last in line: for hurricane relief, for COVID-19 equipment, for basic health care, education, and more.”The five island territories were relegated to their subordinate status by the US Supreme Court in the early 1900s by what became known as theInsular Cases. By creating a new status for the territories called “unincorporated territories,” the court made it possible for the USs to control the islands without granting their inhabitants equal rights under the Constitution. Several Supreme Court justices made racist arguments, claiming that the people of the territories are members of “alien races” who were not ready for democracy.“Those decisions were explicitly informed by racial assumptions,” Plaskett says. They “have created a near permanent colonial status for those living in the territory.”Notably, many of the justices who ruled on the Insular Cases also ruled in the infamouscase, which created the “separate but equal” doctrine that provided the legal basis for segregation in the South. Although the Supreme Court later overruled thePlessy vs Fergusondecision, it has let the basic logic of the Insular Cases stand, continuing the legal basis for the territories’ colonial status. Critics argue that the racist thinking that informed the Supreme Court is original arguments continues to shape the way officials in Washington view the territories today.“It is not a mere coincidence that more than 98 percent of territorial residents are racial or ethnic minorities,”saysNeil Weare, the president and founder ofEqually American, an organization that advocates for equal rights for the people of the territories. For the past several years, Weare has been working through Equally American with the goal of getting the Supreme Court to overturn the Insular Cases. In one of his major cases,, Weare argues that people born in the territories have a constitutional right to citizenship.“Until the Insular Cases are overruled, the federal government will continue relying on them to justify discrimination against residents of the territories,” he insists. In the meantime, representatives of the US territories have been urging Congress to exercise its power by passingHR1, a bill that would create a Congressional Task Force to recommend ways of providing the residents of the territories with equal voting and representation rights. The bill, which the House passed last year, acknowledges that “political participation and the right to vote are among the highest concerns of territorial residents in part because they were not always afforded these rights.”While the bill languishes in the Senate, the people in the territories continue to endure second-class status. Though they constitute a larger population than the combined populations of the five smallest states, they lack voting rights or representation.“The nearly four million people who live in US territory are not the subjects of a king or a master,” PlaskettremindedCongress. “Their interests will not be fully represented within the government of the USs until they have full and equal voting rights, just like other Americans.”",1,1,The Progressive

But let us not forget to name what happened yesterday. There was a terrorist attack by an insurgent white supremacist anti-American sect, ordered by Donald Trump, an insane autocrat trying to seize power, mostly so he can avoid prison. That is it. How we talk about it matters. And it also matters that we name those who supported this act, this attempted overthrow of American democracy, by baselessly objecting to the electoral vote counts in states that failed to support their Dear Leader, attempting to disenfranchise millions of Americans they do not considerAmericans — Black voters, brown voters, LGBTQ voters, white voters they consider race traitors because they do not vote for white supremacy. So let us name the m, may their actions follow them around for the rest of their seditious piece of shit lives. At the top of the heap of people whose names shall live in infamy are GOP SenatorsandTed Cruz, who led the coup in the Senate to overturn the will of the people. After the fires started burning, Ted Cruz very poorly paid lip service to trying to cool things down, after he had helped commit the arson. Hawley could hardly be bothered to do that. Those two garbage fascists were joined in objections to Arizona and/or Pennsylvania by,Roger Marshall,John Kennedy,Rick Scott, brand new Wyoming SenatorCynthia Lummis, andCindy Hyde-Smith. Let the record show that these people went ahead and kept up their objections the US Capitol building was attacked by domestic terrorists they and their shi thole Dear Leader had incited. In the Senate, it was only those assholes. In the House, though? Holy shit. They objected to Arizona and somehow voted to sustain the objection to Pennsylvania in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, as if yesterday is terrorism put a spring in their step, as if the blood in the hallways of the Capitol gave them sustenance. Again, all of this was. And in the House it was not just Arizona and Pennsylvania either. Reps like Louie Gohmert stood up to object to other states too, even though the GOP senators who had originally planned to support those challenge shad put down their guns and agreed to end the standoff peacefully. (It was particularly pleasing to watch Vice President Mike Pence glare at Gohmert, who just got finished unsuccessfully suing Penceto make him overturn the election, and tell him his objection to the electors in Wisconsin ""MAY NOT BE ENTERTAINED,"" since he could not get even the Senate is dumbest Republican Ron Johnson to sign his treason permission slip anymore.)Overall, 139 House GOP members voted to object to the electors from Arizona and/or Pennsylvania. These are their names. They should not be allowed around your children, you should kick them out of your chicken restaurant, and they should always and forevermore be referred to as seditious traitors to democracy in the USs of America.

30,Pentagon Admits Kabul Drone Strike Was “Horrible Mistake” That Killed 10 Civilians,-2.0,45.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/pentagon-kabul-drone-strike-mistake-killed-civilians.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-18,25,"After insisting it had been a “righteous strike,” the Pentagon finally faced up to the facts and acknowledged that the last US drone strike in Afghanistan before the withdrawal of American troops was a “horrible mistake” that killed 10 civilians,including as many as seven children. The admission came after news organizations,including the New York Times and Washington Post, had published reports casting doubt on the official version of events that claimed the August 29 drone strike had stopped an imminent attack on the Kabul airport. Military officials now admit that pretty much everything they believed when they carried out the strike was wrong. The driver that the drone targeted and officials believed was a terrorist was actually Zamarai Ahmadi, a longtime aid worker for a US-based group. Officials believed he had loaded explosives in the trunk of a white Toyota, but in fact he was likely carrying water bottles. At first, the military had said a secondary explosion at the time of the strike proved the car was loaded with explosives, but now it seems likelier that it was a propane or gas tank that went up in flames with the strike.“We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced, and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed,”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. “We apologize, and we will endeavor to learn from this horrible mistake.”The killing of civilians is raising questions about the ability of the USs to carry out drone strikes in the country after withdrawal considering the severe lack of intelligence on the ground. Plus it provides new fuel for critics of President Joe Biden is decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, which was marked by chaos and tragedy. The drone strike took place mere days after an ISIS suicide bomber killed 13 US troops and at least 170 Afghans at the Kabul airport. Gen. Frank McKenzie, who heads US Central Command, said Friday that an ongoing probe is considering whether anyone would be held responsible and the government is analyzing compensation for the victims’ families. But he dismissed speculation that this would impact future actions in Afghanistan. “I do not think you should draw any conclusions about our ability to strike in Afghanistan against ISIS-K targets in the future based on this particular strike,” McKenzie said.",2,1,Slate

32,The Pentagon Inches Toward Letting AI Control Weapons,0.0,44.33,https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-inches-toward-letting-ai-control-weapons/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-10,25,"ApplicationHuman-computer interactionEthicsEnd UserGovernmentSectorDefenseTechnologyMachine learningMachine visionRoboticsLast August, several dozen military drones and tanklike robots took to the skies and roads 40 miles south of Seattle. Their mission: Find terrorists suspected of hiding among several buildings. So many robots were involved in the operation that no human operator could keep a close eye on all of them. So they were given instructions to find—and eliminate—enemy combatants when necessary. The mission was just an exercise, organized by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a blue-sky research division of the Pentagon; the robots were armed with nothing more lethal than radio transmitters designed to simulate interactions with both friendly and enemy robots. The drill was one of several conducted last summer to test how artificial intelligence could help expand the use of automation in military systems, including in scenarios that are too complex and fast-moving for humans to make every critical decision. The demonstrations also reflect a subtle shift in the Pentagon is thinking about autonomous weapons, as it becomes clearer that machines can outperform humans at parsing complex situations or operating at high speed. GeneralJohn Murrayof the US Army Futures Command told an audience at the US Military Academy last month that swarms of robots will force military planners, policymakers, and society to think about whether a person should make every decision about using lethal force in new autonomous systems. Murray asked: “Is it within a human is ability to pick out which ones have to be engaged” and the n make 100 individual decisions? “Is it even necessary to have a human in the loop?” he added. Other comments from military commanders suggest interest in giving autonomous weapons systems more agency. At a conference on AI in the Air Force last week, Michael Kanaan, director of operations for the Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator at MIT and a leading voice on AI within the US military, said thinking is evolving. He says AI should perform more identifying and distinguishing potential targets while humans make high-level decisions. “I think that is where we are going,” Kanaan says.“Is it even necessary to have a human in the loop?”At the same event, Lieutenant GeneralClinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration, and requirements at the Pentagon, says that whether a person can be removed from the loop of a lethal autonomous system is “one of the most interesting debates that is coming, [and] has not been settled yet.”A report this month from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), an advisory group created by Congress, recommended, among other things, that the US resist calls for an international ban on the development of autonomous weapons. Timothy Chung, the Darpa program manager in charge of the swarming project, says last summer is exercises were designed to explore when a human drone operator should, and should not, make decisions for the autonomous systems. For example, when faced with attacks on several fronts, human control can sometimes get in the way of a mission, because people are unable to react quickly enough. “Actually, the systems can do better from not having someone intervene,” Chung says. The drones and the wheeled robots, each about the size of a large backpack, were given an overall objective, the n tapped AI algorithms to devise a plan to achieve it. Some of them surrounded buildings while others carried out surveillance sweeps. A few were destroyed by simulated explosives; some identified beacons representing enemy combatants and chose to attack. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe US and other nations have used autonomy in weapons systems for decades. Some missiles can, for instance, autonomously identify and attack enemies within a given area. But rapid advances in AI algorithms will change how the military uses such systems. Off-the-shelf AI code capable of controlling robots and identifying landmarks and targets, often with high reliability, will make it possible to deploy more systems in a wider range of situations. But as the drone demonstrations highlight, more widespread use of AI will sometimes make it more difficult to keep a human in the loop. This might prove problematic, because AI technology can harbor biases or behave unpredictably. A vision algorithm trained to recognize a particular uniform might mistakenly target someone wearing similar clothing. Chung says the swarm project presumes that AI algorithms will improve to a point where they can identify enemies with enough reliability to be trusted. Use of AI in weapons systems has become controversial in recent years. Google faced employee protest and public outcry in 2018 after supplying AI technology to the Air Forcethrough a project known asMaven. To some degree, the project is part of a long history of autonomy in weapons systems, with some missiles already capable of carrying out limited missions independent of human control. But it also shows how recent advances in AI will make autonomy more attractive and inevitable in certain situations. What is more, it highlights the trust that will be placed in technology that can still behave unpredictably. Paul Scharre, an expert at the Center for New American Security and author of, says it is time to have a more sophisticated discussion about autonomous weapons technology. “The discussion surrounding ‘humans in the loop’ ought to be more sophisticated than simply a binary ‘are they or are not the y?’” Scharre says. “If a human makes a decision to engage a swarm of enemy drones, does the human need to individually select each target?”The Defense Department issued a policy on autonomous weapons in November 2012, stating that autonomous weapons systems need to have human oversight—but this need not mean soldiers making every decision. Those who believe that militaries could use AI to cross a Rubicon when it comes to human responsibility for lethal force see things differently.“Lethal autonomous weapons cheap enough that every terrorist can afford them are not in America is national security interest,” saysMax Tegmark, a professor at MIT and cofounder of theFuture of Life Institute, a nonprofit that opposes autonomous weapons. Tegmark says AI weapons should be “stigmatized and banned like biological weapons.” The NSCAI report is opposition to a global ban is a strategic mistake, he says: “I think we will one day regret it even more than we regret having armed the Taliban.”",2,2,WIRED
33,What Rights Do We Have On Social Media?,-7.0,41.33,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/what-rights-do-we-have-on-social-media,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"Donald Trump has been permanently banned from Twitter,which cited posts by the president that the company said could encourage supporters to commit acts of violence at the upcoming inauguration. Facebookfollowed suit. Separately, bothAppleand Google haveremovedParler, a social media app favored by right-wingers, from their app stores, citing its lack of a moderation policy. (It had becometh e Number 1 free app in the Apple App Store.) Amazon the n suspend edits web hosting, bringing the whole app down. Supporters of the president insist that he has been unfairly censored by Big Tech. Right-wing pundit Dan Bonginosaidthat, “This Big Tech/Big Government symbiont is now in open war with civil liberties and free speech in America.” Conservative Christian blogger Matt Walsh, whose latest book was reviewedinsaid:Donald Trump Jr. , whose book has also been reviewedin,saidthat, “It is a sad day when Big Tech has more power than Big Government.”Is it “censorship” for Twitter to remove the president, and for Apple and Google to remove Parler? Is it an attack on free speech rights?The easiest response to offer is that no, rights are not implicated, because Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Google are private companies, and they are not bound by the Constitution. You are “free to choose” whether you use these platforms, and if you do, you are governed by their terms of service. If they do not like what you say and decide to shut your account,, that is the free market for you. Go create your own platform if you want to exercise your free speech rights. The government has to respect your First Amendment rights, but a corporation of which you are a customer does not. This was also the obvious response to Trump ally senator Josh Hawley, who complained after Simon & Schuster terminated his book contract—incidentally, for a book called—that it was an “Orwellian” act by a “woke mob” and a “direct assault on the First Amendment.” The First Amendment has never previously been known to govern the publishing choices of Simon & Schuster—in fact, under existing jurisprudence it would be an interference with free speech if the First Amendment did tell the company that they were required to publish a senator is book. But while this response is easy, it iseasy, because it ignores that “corporate censorship” can be a very real thing, especially when corporations are gigantic and powerful. If you are a strict libertarian, who believes that “freedom of contract” means a company does not owe you anything except what they promise you in the Terms & Conditions, the n it is true that complaining a corporation has violated your speech rights is self-contradictory: they ca not have violated the m, because you do nothavefree speech rights vis-a-vis a private entity. On the left, we recognize that the libertarian case is very weak, however, because it ignores the fact that in the real world, corporations often function as “private governments.” When a company is functionally a monopoly, and controls access to critical infrastructure, it has the kind of power that a government has. We can see this if we think about a literal public square. If the square is indeed public, the n protests and demonstrations in it are governed by the First Amendment. But if the city government is taken over by a neo liberal administration, who are ideologically committed to the belief that private entities do a better job running public services than the government, the public square might be privatized and sold to a corporation. Once the square is owned by a company called, let is say, City Systems & Solutions, Incorporated, decisions about who gets to say what pass to the CEO Leftists point out that it is absurd for our rights to change just because what is rightfully ours has been handed to an unaccountable institution, and it is strange when your rights depend not on what kind of place you are in but on who happens to own it. That is to say, my speech rights at a college or an airport or on a street depend entirely on whether it is a private or public college, airport, or street. But this means that if a corporation ends up owning vast amounts of infrastructure, we have very few rights. The more privatized the world becomes, the more our basic civil liberties disappear. The big tech companies can be thought of like private corporations that own the roads or the square. I have written before about how because Amazon is a company that owns a public marketplace, it can manipulate the market in insidious ways. Facebook and Twitter are essentially the public square, and it is extremely difficult to go and “make your own” platform. My colleague,in-house economist Rob Larson, has written an excellent book calledBit Tyrants: The Political Economy of Silicon Valleythat talks about “network effects:” the way increased user ship increases the value of a service, making it impossible for small players to compete and entrenching large ones. You may think that the conservative move to Parler shows that alternate platforms are possible, but we can see already that Parler itself depended on Apple, Google, and Amazon. We should, the n, accept that there are no free speech rights that apply to corporate decisions about who to allow on a platform. I say this partly out of self-interest:Current Affairsis hugely dependent on Facebook and Twitter traffic for its revenue, and if either of them decided to crack dow non “fringe” political views or “fake news,” and stuck us in the bucket, we would have no recourse and might collapse overnight. It is a very real threat, and so I do not want rich liberals (of the kind we regularly antagonize) to be the ones deciding whether our magazine gets to be heard. Amazon Web Services is absolutely ubiquitous to the point where it isa core parto f the net is architecture, but at the moment, Jeff Bezos could decide one day that he is going to pull the plug on anyone who spreads what he considers “falsehoods” about him (and which the rest of us would call “facts”). What we really need is democratic, publicly owned platforms. Facebook and Twitter should be publicly owned. They should be governed by the Wikipedia model with rules created by users the mselves rather than the whims of some billionaire from an island in French Polynesia. And yes, the First Amendment should apply to them. But that does not mean that all speech would be permitted. The First Amendment prohibits Congress from making laws abridging free speech, but this has never been held to be a blanket prohibition on any restriction of speech in any context. You ca not stand up in your class at a public university and start drowning the professor out by shouting nonsense syllables. What it does mean is that courts (which are, theoretically, democratically accountable) have a more active role in deciding the propriety of various restrictions, and that there is a presumption in favor of expansive speech rights. The argument that there should be broad free speech rights on social media is not an argument that Donald Trump should have his Twitter account intact. I do not actually think he should. Reading Twitter isjustificationfor the decision, I think it is actually reasonable, and defensible a highly libertarian speech rights framework. Since the November election, Donald Trump has been insisting that Joe Biden did not actually win, and that the election was a giant fraud. This is a lie, but it is worth realizing just how dangerous of a lie it is. Anyone who believes Trump believes that Biden is, essentially, a usurper, a criminal who is trying to destroy the Constitution and impose himself as an unelected ruler, while Trump—the democratically elected president—is being unlawfully deposed. If you believe this, you may well see the Republic as being under a fundamental threat. If you see yourself as a patriot, you may see it as your mor alto take up arms and prevent Joe Biden from being inaugurated… by any means necessary. Trump has declined to acknowledge that he is pushing a point of view that, if taken seriously, might encourage otherwise-normal people to take drastic and even violent measures. In fact, that is precisely what happened at the Capitol. Trump is supporters, inflamed by his charges that their country is elected government was about to be overthrown, swarmed past security to try to stop the Electoral College vote from being certified. In the process, someone smashed a police officer in the head with a fire extinguisher, killing him. (Four rioters also died, one shot by police and three others from somewhat murky medical emergencies.)Now, there are murmurings on social media that the Trump mob will come back for the inauguration, with online posts saying things like, “we will storm the government buildings, kill cops, kill security guards, kill federal employees and agents, and demand a recount.” Trump has declined to do much to try to calm his people down. He called the Capitol rioters patriot sand seemed to justify their actions, saying it was what happened when elections were stolen. He said they should go home in peace, but did not comment on the fact that a police officer had been killed. And he continued to stoke their delusions about an illegitimate election. The posts that finally led Twitter to pull the plug involved Trump saying that his supporters “will not be disrespect ed or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” and commenting that, “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Twitter says it reasoned that, in light of the Capitol violence, Trump is continued tweets could increase the chances of a violent attack on the inauguration, which he was making into a safe target through his absence. The prospect of violence at the inauguration is not theoretical. A Capitol police officer is dead because Trump is supporters, whom he encouraged to feel enraged and aggrieved, stormed one of the most secure institutions in the country. We are lucky there was not more organization and planning behind the Capitol raid. Of course, Trump himself has not explicitly called for violence. But it is playing dumb to say that he does not know what he is doing by saying the Republic is under threat with those who raided the Capitol. (And appearing reluctant to condemn the violence, his first response being positive before the scale and unpopularity of the rioting became clear.) Twitter reasoned that if this continues, there might well be an attack on Joe Biden at his inauguration, and that the need to prevent this takes precedence over Trump is right to be heard. We get into very difficult territory here, because “security” justifications, once invoked, can be used to rationalize almost any kind of censorship. Already, in the wake of the Capitol raid, there is talk among lawmakers and officials of passing new domestic terrorism laws. This is a horrible idea, though a familiar one; post-9/11 madness also led to the drastic expansion of government police power, and it was a mistake. Free speech may not extend to speech that incites imminent violence, but it is also the case that once you start drawing more and more tenuous connections between speech today and predicted violence tomorrow, lots of speech that ought to be protected may no longer be. “Slippery slopes” are actually quite a real phenomenon; once you think speech that causes violence should be banned, what about speech that causes harm that is violence in its effects? And so on and so forth. But the risk of slipping down an unfortunate slope does not mean that “security” justifications always fail. Instead, it means that we have to be extremely careful and apply censorship as little as possible while preventing outright violent acts from being caused. There will always be hard cases and wrong calls. If the incoming president was violently attacked, however, as a direct consequence of a social media discourse encouraging that violence, it would not have been worth preserving the right to stoke violence. (Although, yes, it is a hard job assessing what violence is “caused” by what speech, and whether someone has a “responsibility” for what some deranged person does in their name. It does not surprise me that the ACLU seems to find the Trump Twitter bana bit of a difficult case to weigh in on, because this is indeed one of those situations where security justifications are genuine and conflict with civil liberties—though generally I think the ACLU should be “unreasonable” in their radical commitment to civil liberties, because that is their role.)Personally I do not think Trump should be banned forever, but only until the heightened threat of imminent violence by his supporters subsides. Certainly any reinstatement would need to be after the inauguration, and he would need to promise to abide by the Terms of Service in future and not keep saying stuff that might get his successor killed. Parler needs to agree to keep people from making direct threats of violence. Ultimately, however, I do not want corporate bigwigs being the ones making these decisions. Social media should belong to all, and the rules should be transparent. We can accept the suspension of Trump from Twitter (and even find it hilarious, which it is) while still demanding public control of our platforms.",1,1,Current Affairs
34,‘I am About to Puke’: QAnon in Chaos as Biden Takes Office,-6.0,42.0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/im-about-to-puke-qanon-in-chaos-as-biden-takes-office,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-20,25,"As it became clear that Trump was not, in fact, going to suddenly appear and order the arrest of all the Democrats, QAnon believers began to wonder if they had been tricked. Politics ReporterAs the rest of the country waited for Joe Biden to be inaugurated, believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory thought they were about to see something else: the long-awaited mass arrests of Biden and a host of other “deep-state” Democrats, followed by the restoration of the Trump presidency.“Trump will walk out during the arrest and thank America for reelection,” one QAnon supporter posted on a forum shortly before the inauguration. “This will be remembered as the greatest day since D-Day.”As Biden was sworn in, though, the mass arrests that QAnon believers call “The Storm,” stubbornly refused to happen. Trump really did appear to have left office, rather than springing the sly trap as they had all hoped. The Democrats really did have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The tens of thousands of National Guard soldiers QAnon believers thought would help Trump retake Washington instead appeared to be there for a more obvious purpose: protecting the city from the same crazed QAnon believers who had violently attacked the Capitol two weeks earlier.“I am about to puke,” one QAnon fan watching Biden take the oath of office wrote. For more than three years, tens of thousands of QAnon believers have pinned their hopes for the future on a second Trump term. They have become convinced that the government is run by a cabal of satanic pedophile-cannibals and that Trump is the only way to restore justice. Many of the m, egged on by promises that Trump is “plan” included the eradication of diseases and personal debt, pinned their dreams on QAnon as well, alienating friends and family with their ideas. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, the QAnon future vanished, presenting the ever-expanding conspiracy theory with its greatest challenge yet. As Biden is inauguration became ever more certain on Wednesday, QAnon believers rapidly cycled through rationalizations. They claimed that Trump was stepping down as the head of the USs “corporation”—an idea borrowed from fringe sovereign citizen legal the ories—to become the head of a restored republic. Some QAnon leaders claimed that Biden himself was in on the scheme, and would soon help Trump carry out the arrests. As Biden finally took office, however, the mood changed quickly on QAnon forums. QAnon channels on messaging app Telegram filled with g ifs of far-right mascot Pepe the Frog crying, as believers claimed they had been duped. Believers said they felt sick, or wanted to throw up.“Trump fooled us,” complained one Telegram commenter.“All my family and co-workers think I am crazy,” wrote another.“I feel stupid,” wrote a third. Even major QAnon boosters saw their faith in the bizarre conspiracy theory shaken on Monday. QAnon booster Roy Davis co-authored a bestselling book promoting QAnon under the alias “Captain Roy,” even getting his sports car painted with a giant, blazing “Q” on the hood. As Biden was sworn in, Davis initially told The Daily Beast he did not want to comment until he was sure Biden was really president. But as Biden is new title became official, Davis said he was ready to move on from Q—something his doctor has long urged him to do anyway.“We misinterpreted it,” Davis said. “Maybe we should have done something different.”Other top QAnon figures appeared to be backing away. As the former administrator of QAnon clues web site 8kun, Ron Watkins had control over who posted as the mysterious “Q”—and has been accused of being Q himself. But on Wednesday, Watkins suggested that the QAnon fight was over.“Please remember all the friends and happy memories we made together over the past few years,” Watkins wrote in a Telegram post. Still, there are many signs that QAnon and the kind of unreal world it promoted will persist. As Trump is defeat became more certain, QAnon followers changed their claims, beginning to insist that the president is war against the “deep state” had only begun. As the shock of Biden is inauguration wore off on Wednesday, QAnon forum posters encouraged one another to “hold the line,” claiming that they had merely misunderstood the QAnon clues. QAnon believer Jenny Hatch has followed the conspiracy theory since 2018, when she thought Trump referenced QAnon in a speech he gave at a White House Easter Egg Roll. Hatch had felt sure that Biden would have already been arrested on January 6, and was “quite demoralized” when Biden was instead sworn in two weeks later.“I fully expected some sort of military arrest of Joe Biden and many of the people who were on the dais with him,” Hatch said. Hatch, a Colorado resident, said her husband does not believe in QAnon, and she suspects her adult children have read articles about how to handle a family member believing in QAnon. But while Hatch was saddened that the mass arrests failed to happen on Wednesday, QAnon is utter failure to come true somehow has not shaken her faith in the conspiracy theory.“I am still all in with Q,” Hatch said. “I have not distanced myself from what Q meant to me personally.”The problem created by QAnon seems set to remain as well. QAnon has been tied to three murders anda terrorist incident near the Hoover Dam, along with a series of other crimes. Biden is top intelligence chief has promise dan analysis of the threat posed by the conspiracy theory. Even as he distances himself from QAnon, for example, Davis still thinks “Q” really was a government whistle blower revealing the truth about the world.“It was not some kid in a basement,” Davis said.

37,Last Exit from Afghanistan,-3.33,46.33,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/08/last-exit-from-afghanistan,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-01,25,"On the night of August 14th, Fawzia Koofi was on her way home to Kabul from the funeral of family friends. Koofi, forty-five, is one of Afghanistan is leading advocates for women is rights—a former parliament member who, in the twenty years since the USs and its allies toppled the Taliban, has carried on a ferocious public fight to reverse a history of oppression. She and her twenty-one-year-old daughter, Shuhra, were riding in an armored car, as they often do. A second car, filled with security guards, trailed behind. The guards were necessary; in 2010, Taliban gunmen had attempted to kill her. As they neared Kabul, her driver pulled over to get gas, and Koofi decided to switch cars. “Sometimes the armored car feels like a prison,” she explained, when I visited Afghanistan in December. As they left the gas station, she saw a car behind hers, seeming to track its moves; she was being followed. While she watched, a second car veered into the road, blocking the lane. Koofi is driver accelerated and swerved onto the shoulder, but, before he could get clear of the blockade, men in the other car opened fire. Bullets smashed through the windows and to re through her upper arm. The assailants sped away. Koofi was rushed to the nearest safe hospital, forty-five minutes away, where surgeons removed a bullet and set her shattered bone. A month later, Koofi was due to represent the government in peace talks with the Taliban—the latest in adecade-long series of attempts to end the Afghan conflict. As she prepared, the mood in Kabul was unusually fraught. A wave of assassinations had begun, which has since claimed the lives of hundreds of Afghans, including prosecutors, journalists, and activists. Officials in Afghanistan and in the US suspect that the Taliban committed most of the killings—both to strengthen their position in talks and to weaken the civil society that has tenuously established itself since the Taliban were deposed. “They are trying to terrorize the post-2001 generation,” Sima Samar, a former chairperson of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, told me. The peace talks began last September, in Doha, Qatar, a Persian Gulf microstate that sits atop the world is largest natural-gas field. For seven years, Qatar is leaders have hosted several of the Taliban is most senior members in luxurious captivity, housing them and their families with all expenses paid. At the opening ceremony, delegates from the Taliban and the Afghan government gathered at the Doha Sheraton, in a cavernous convention space staffed by an army of guest workers. When Koofi walked into the lobby, she saw a group of Taliban negotiators. They were staring at her arm, which was still in a cast. Koofi smiled at them. “As you can see, I am fine,” she said. Despite Koofi is assurance, the Afghan government was in a precarious position. For decades, it had been buttressed by US military power. But, as Americans have lost patience with the war, the US has reduced its presence in Afghanistan, from about a hundred thousand troops to some twenty-five hundred. Seven months before Koofi went to Doha, officials in the Trump Administration concluded their own talks with the Taliban, in which they agreed to withdraw the remaining forces by May 1, 2021. The prevailing ethos, a senior American official told me, was “Just get out.”Afghanistan presentsJoe Bidenwith one of the most immediate and vexing problems of his Presidency. If he completes the military withdrawal, he will end a seemingly interminable intervention and bring home thousands of troops. But, if he wants the war to be considered anything short of an abject failure, the Afghan state will have to be able to stand on its own. For Koofi and her fellow-negotiators, a question hangs over the talks: How much of the American-backed project, which has cost thousands of lives and more than two trillion dollars, will survive? Before the US and its allies intervened, in 2001, the Taliban imposed a draconian brand of Islam, in which thieves’ hands were cut off and women were put to death for adultery. After the Taliban were defeated, a new constitution opened the way for democratic elections, a free press, and expanded rights for women. Koofi worries that the Taliban leaders, many of whom were imprisoned for years atGuantánamo, do not grasp how much the country has changed—or that they view those changes as errors to be corrected. “I want their eyes to see me, to get used to what Afghan women are to day,” Koofi told me. “A lot of the m, for the past twenty years, have been in a time capsule.” She hopes that a deal can be made to keep the Americans in the country until a comprehensive agreement brings peace. But she fears that the talks will not be enough to save the Afghan state: “Even now, there are some people among the Taliban who believe they can shoot their way into power.”The USs has spent more than a hundred and thirty billion dollars to rebuild Afghanistan. The effort has been beset by graft and misrepresented by Presidents and commanders, but in Kabul the effects were evident. High-rise apartment buildings remade the skyline, and the streets filled with cars; foreign aid helped create new jobs, and women began going to work and to school. After decades of civil war and repressive government, the capital became a rollicking international city. Diplomats, aid workers, and journalists gathered at a French restaurant called L’Atmosphère and a Lebanese place known as Taverna; after hours, they stumbled over to the bar of the Gandamack Lodge, named for a site where nineteenth-century Afghan tribesmen massacred British invaders. The Taliban were gaining strength in the countryside, but the cities flourished. These days, assassinations and bombings have driven most of the foreigners away. Taverna closed in 2014, after a Taliban attack there killed twenty-one civilians. As American and troops have departed, blast walls, barbed wire, and armed checkpoints have risen to provide a semblance of security. The few Western visitors mostly stay at the fortress-like Serena hotel, even though American officials warn that the insurgent Haqqani network, an adjunct of the Taliban, is scouting the place for people to kidnap. At night, the streets are quiet. Twenty years into the American-led war, Kabul feels again like the capital of a poor and troubled country. On a frigid evening in January, I paid a visit toAshraf Ghani, the Afghan President. I got out of my taxi at the edge of the security cordon, about half a mile from his office, and trekked past concrete barricades, armed guards, and machine-gun nests. At the center of the defenses is the Arg—a nineteenth-century castle, replete with towers and parapets, which houses Ghani is administration. Inside, guards searched and X-rayed me, the n confiscated my voice recorder and my phone. I was led to a waiting area, a chilly room with rock walls and marble floors, and finally to the office of the President. Ghani was at his desk, wearing a mask, alone. “Welcome,” he said. Ghani, who is seventy-one, was born to an educated family near Kabul and went abroad as a teen-ager to study. He taught anthropology at Johns Hopkins and the n spent a decade at the World Bank, in Washington, DC, helping developing nations strengthen their economies. After the US invasion, he returned to Afghanistan and threw himself into the reconstruction. Ghani has the cool demeanor of a technocrat, but he spoke passionately about giving up a stable career to work for his country. “I made my decision to come home, and I never looked back,” he said. Ghani is Presidency has been a long struggle. He came to power in 2014, in an election marred by fraud. He promised to unite the country but instead watched it deteriorate around him, as more American troops departed. When he won reëlection, in 2019, fewer than two million Afghans cast ballots. In the past year, he has seemed increasingly aware that his country is future is being decided far from Kabul—first in the Trump Administration is negotiations with the Taliban over an American withdrawal, and the n in the Afghan government is talks with the Taliban over the potential for peace. When Trump decided to reach out to the Taliban, in 2018, he chose as his envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, a seasoned diplomat and a native Afghan. Khalilzad had known Ghani since high school, when they played basketball together. But the two found the mselves at odds over the country is direction, and their relationship soured. In January, Khalilzad arrived for a visit, and Ghani declined to see him. Trump was clearly desperate to make a deal that would allow him to say that he had ended the war. When the Taliban refused to include the Afghan government in the talks, the US did not insist. The senior American official told me, “The Trump people were saying, ‘Fuck this—the Afghans are never going to make peace anyway. Besides, who cares whether they agree or not?’ ” As the talks progressed, Trump repeatedly announced troop withdrawals, depriving his negotiators of leverage. “He was steadily undermining us,” a second senior American official told me. “The trouble with the Taliban was, they were getting it for free.” In the end, the two sides agreed not to attack each other, and the Americans agreed to withdraw. The Taliban had to meet a list of conditions, including preventing terrorists from operating out of Afghanistan and refraining from major attacks on the country is government and military. But the prospect of insuring a total pullout was appealing enough that the Taliban began rooting for Trump to win reëlection. In one of the odder moments of the US campaign season, they issued an endorsement of his candidacy. “When we heard about Trump being-19-positive, we got worried,” a senior Taliban leader told CBS News. (The group subsequently claimed that it had been misquoted.)In my meeting with Ghani, he seemed abandoned, like a pilot pulling levers that were not connected to anything. He professed gratitude to the USs, but was clearly uneasy with the deal. Recently, he said, he had ordered the release of five thousand Taliban prisoners—“not because I wanted to, because the US pushed me.” He feared a security disaster, as Taliban fighters returned to the streets and American soldiers left the country. “The US can withdraw its troops anytime it wants, but they ought to negotiate with the elected President,” he went on. “They should call me. I am the elected President.”Many Afghans say that Ghani is to blame for his predicament, describing him as remote, vindictive, and surrounded by sycophants. A prominent businessman who meets often with senior government officials told me that, when Khalilzad reported that Trump had ordered a pullout, Ghani should have tried to win over his old friend. Instead, the businessman said, “Ghani went around town announcing his intention to destroy him.” I noticed that Ghani did not have a television in his office; he prefers to read transcripts of shows afterward. “He is delusional,” the businessman said. “He has no idea what the country thinks of him.”Ghani was still hoping that Afghanistan would retain its place in the minds of American policymakers. “All I need from the US is four or five video conferences a year,” he told me. But the Americans have given every sign that Afghanistan is no longer a major consideration. US officials now see Ghani as an obstacle to a peace deal—wedded to the status quo, which keeps troops in the country and him in power. “Each step of the way, he is resisting,” the senior American official said. In 2018, the US asked Ghani to appoint a negotiating team; it took two years—and the announcement of a billion-dollar cut in American aid—for him to complete the process. Before the current talks began, he assembled his negotiators for a historical seminar on persistent conflicts. He walked them through Colombia is civil war, which lasted fifty-two years; Nepal is, which lasted ten; and Sri Lanka is, which dragged on for twenty-five. Ghani is message was that long wars take a long time to end. When talks were convened to end the Vietnam War, he noted, it took nearly three months just to agree on the shape of the negotiating table. Whatever pressure his negotiators felt—from the Americans or from the Taliban—ought to be resisted, he said, instructing the m, “Do not bring home a bad deal.”According to US officials, the most favorable outcome of the talks is a cease fire and an agreement to form a transitional government, with power shared between the Taliban and the existing Afghan government. The transitional government would write a new constitution and lay the groundwork for nationwide elections. Ghani insists that compromise is dangerous. He was chosen by the Afghan people, in an election that was open, at least notionally, to every adult in the country. Why would an elected President hand over power to a group of unelected insurgents? “My power rests on my legitimacy,” he said. “The moment that legitimacy is gone, the whole thing implodes.”The negotiators gathered in Doha at the Sharq hotel—a sprawling beach resort, operated by the Ritz-Carlton, with high-arched buildings set alongside ornately tiled pools. It struck some delegates as a peculiar place to end a war. “You walk around the hotel and people are swimming,” Koofi said. “Women are walking around in bikinis. And the n you go inside a meeting room totalk about the fate of the country.”At first, the loathing between the two sides was so intense that they bridled at standing together in the same room. “They would not even look at each other,” a Qatari official told me. After a couple of days, they sat down in a conference room, but even the n some of the delegates found their anger difficult to contain. Three weeks earlier, Taliban gunmen had killed the nephew of Nader Nadery, one of the government negotiators. Nadery himself had been arrested and tortured by the Taliban in the nineties, when he was a student activist. “I ca not tell you how badly I wanted to leave the talks,” he told me. Another negotiator, Matin Bek, had lost his father to a Taliban attack ten years before; a third, Masoom Stanekzai, had survived three attacks in which bombs blew up his car. The Taliban had their own grievances. Among their negotiators was Khairullah Khairkhwa, who helped found the Taliban and served as an interior minister in its government. In the chaotic days after the US began attacking, in 2001, Khairkhwa negotiated to become a CI A. informant. (He denies this.) As the talks broke down, Khairkhwa fled to the Pakistani border town of Chaman. He was captured, put on a plane, bound and blindfolded, and flown to the newly opened prison at Guantánamo Bay. “The flight was endless for me, a journey to Hell,” he told me. At Guantánamo, Khairkhwa said, he was denied sleep, handcuffed to chairs for hours, denied prompt medical treatment, and subjected to months of interrogation. There were occasional moments of tenderness, as when a female military-police officer slipped him earplugs, hidden in a roll of toilet paper, to help him sleep. Mostly it was boring. In prison, Khairkhwa insisted that he was merely a bureaucrat in the Taliban is administration. American prosecutors said that he was a military commander, who had helped foment a massacre of ethnic Hazara civilians—but much of the evidence was classified. In 2009, President Barack Obama gave a speech suggesting that cases like Khairkhwa is belonged in an uneasy category: too innocent to charge, too guilty to free. Then, in 2014, an American soldier appeared at his cell and told him that he was being transferred to house arrest in Qatar. He and four other Taliban leaders were being swapped for Bowe Bergdahl, an American soldier who had been captured five years before. Khairkhwa did not know much about Qatar, but his guards assured him it was a Muslim country. As it turned out, life was easy the re; his wife and children joined him, and he had an apartment, all expenses paid by the Qatari government. Just as Khairkhwa settled in, he was summoned again: he had been chosen to be a negotiator on behalf of the Taliban for an Afghan peace settlement. Soon afterward, he met for the first time with his American counterparts—diplomats instead of soldiers. “All of a sudden, I was negotiating with the same people who had imprisoned me,” he said. “It is a very strange feeling.”In the current talks, American observers noted that the Talibs who had been held in Guantánamo seemed to struggle to stay focussed. “Their physical and mental resilience has clearly been affected by their time the re,” the second senior US official told me. Still, their team was audacious. Before the negotiators could work on matters of substance, they had to devise a code of conduct. The Taliban proposed that disputes be decided exclusively by Sunni jurisprudence. Government delegates insisted that Afghanistan is Shiite populace be represented, too. “We made it clear to them that we stood for the diversity of our society,” Sadat Naderi, one of the negotiators, told me. The Taliban—whose members had massacred Shiite civilians before 2001—stormed out of the room. Eventually, they returned to the bargaining table, but things did not go much better. “They told us we were puppets of the infidels,” Naderi recalled. “They told us the war was over.” Khairkhwa suggested to me that the 2020 peace deal with the US had established the Taliban as the victors in the conflict. “We defeated the Americans on the battlefield,” he said. Hafiz Mansoor, a former minister in the Afghan government, blamed the Americans for giving the Taliban the impression that they had won the war: “By making the deal, the US legitimized them.”In meetings, the two sides shouted at each other; Taliban leaders said the Afghan officials represented an illegitimate government, propped up by infidels and bankrolled by Western money. “They were so arrogant,” Nadery said. “They thought they were there just to discuss the terms of surrender. They said, ‘We do not need totalk to you. We can just take over.’ ”Since 2001, the main arena of conflict in Afghanistan has been the countryside: the government held the cities, while the Taliban fought to control the villages and towns, particularly in the south, their heartland. But by early this year the paradigm had begun to fall apart. The Taliban were entrenched across the north; their shadow government had begun to creep into the cities. In January, I visited the Qalai Abdul Ali neighborhood, in western Kabul; it straddles the national highway, which runs south to Kandahar. Taliban fighters, distinguished by black turbans that trail down their backs, were strolling through the streets. A decade ago, when there were nearly a hundred and fifty thousand American and troops in the country, such a scene was unimaginable. In Qalai Abdul Ali, the government was mostly in hiding. A squad of police hunkered down behind Hesco barricades. The real authority, the locals said, was a Talib called Sheikh Ali, who took me on a driving tour of the neighborhood. “I am the mayor,” he said, as he climbed into my car. While we drove, an Afghan Army truck passed through without stopping. The police and other security agencies were not technically banned from the neighborhood, but those who entered risked attack. As Ali and I drove by a large, abandoned house on a hill, he pointed out the window and said, “Last year, we killed a judge who was living there.” We passed a tangle of twisted metal. “Here, you can see, we blew up an ND S. vehicle”—a truck from the National Directorate of Security, the equivalent of the FB I Ali, soft-spoken but assured, told me that the Taliban in Qalai Abdul Ali were collecting taxes, providing security, patrolling the streets. Every truck that passed through—hundreds a day, on the highway—had paid a toll to the Taliban. He produced a receipt for a payment from a driver who had recently carried a truckful of laundry detergent from Faryab Province. The receipt, marked “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” was complete with a contact phone number and an e-mail address. “The government is full of thieves,” Ali said. “We are the real authority.”The neighborhood is residents were not necessarily happy to see the Taliban take control, but they did not trust the government, either. A former police officer named Sultan told me that, in the years after 2001, he had thrown himself into his job, inspired by the local police chief, whom he regarded as competent and honest. But his colleagues extorted bribes from the locals; to get hired, he said, he was forced to hand over several months’ salary. Meanwhile, tales spread of corruption and illicit activities among the country is leaders. They included—a tradition, practiced by warlords in the nineties, of keeping boys as sex slaves. Sultan showed me a video, which was making the rounds on social media, of a former Afghan official ogling a dancing boy. “It turns my heart black,” he said. Sultan gave up his job a year and a half ago, after the Taliban assassinated the local police chief. Now he was working as a minibus driver. The Taliban patrolled the highway at night, all the way to Kandahar, he said: “The road is safe now.”On the second floor of a house on Qalai Abdul Ali is main street, I sat with three Talibs—middle-aged men who said they’d been fighting since the Americans first arrived. The group is leader called himself Hedyat; he had a scraggly gray beard and slouched against a pillow, regarding me with narrowed eyes. Hedyat said tersely that Taliban fighters had moved into the neighborhood two years ago from Wardak, an adjacent province. “The Taliban control all of Wardak now,” he said. “We can bring people from all over the country.”These days, he said, Qalai Abdul Ali was so secure that the Taliban were using it to stage attacks in other parts of the capital. “Oh, yes,” one of the other Talibs crowed. Hedyat told me that his local group was observing the cease fire with the Americans. But, when I asked about making a deal with the Afghan government, he smiled scornfully. “We are not sharing power with anyone,” he said. Freshta Kohistani was fifteen when the Taliban government fell, and she thrived on the new freedoms. In the next two decades, she became an advocate for the poor in her ancestral province of Kapisa, north of Kabul, where she helped families find food and medicine. She carried herself in a defiantly modern way, driving her own car, walking around in jeans, flashing a bright smile, and asking direct questions of powerful men. She used Facebook to publicly demand better conditions; she separated from her husband when he discouraged her activism. “You ca not imagine someone as brave as Freshta,” her brother Roheen told me. “She was confronting our stupid traditional society.”For years, Kohistani received threatening text messages, but she ignored them. Then, about a year ago, a group of men with knives surrounded her, and one of them slashed her side as she escaped. In December, Kohistani pleaded for the government to protect her. “I am not a frightened little girl,” she wrote in a Facebook post. But she was worried about what her family and her co-workers would “do in this ruined country after I am gone.” Twelve days later, as she and her brother Shahram were driving in Kapisa, two motorcycles pulled alongside the m, and a man on the back shot them both dead. When I arrived at the Kohistanis’ home, the family was still greeting mourners. Freshta is father, Najibullah, said that he was not sure who killed her, but that her death resembled many others in recent months. “They are killing the élites,” he said. Link copiedWhen the US negotiated its withdrawal with the Taliban, American officials made it clear that they expected suicide bombings and other mass-casualty attacks to end. In their place, the Taliban appear to have launched a campaign aimed at terrorizing the educated élite, just as the Afghan government began its own talks. More than five hundred Afghans have been killed in targeted attacks in the past year, many of them shot or struck by “sticky bombs,” explosives placed underneath cars. Among them are Malala Maiwand, a female journalist in Jalalabad; Pamir Faizan, a military prosecutor; and Zakia Herawi, one of two female Supreme Court justices who were killed. A deep unease has permeated Afghanistan is cities. “I feel like I am in a dark room filled with people, and I do not know who is hitting me,” an official named Ali Farhad Howaida told me in Kabul. The Taliban deny responsibility for the attacks, but Afghan officials say that many of them are orchestrated by the Haqqani network. Amrullah Saleh, one of the country is two Vice-Presidents, told me that Taliban commanders, meeting in Pakistan, mapped out the campaign early last year. Saleh said that he passed a warning to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper before the USs made the deal with the Taliban. (The State Department says that it has no record of this.) “We told them exactly what was going to happen,” Saleh said. Pompeo and Esper were undeterred. But not all the victims of assassination are enemies of the Taliban. In June, 2019, as Ustadh Abdul Salaam Abed was being driven to his office, a bomb blew off the back of his car and wounded him in the neck. Every week, during Friday prayers at the Osman Ghani mosque, Abed had been telling his congregation that Afghans had to reconcile. While he sometimes criticized the Taliban, he advocated dialogue; it was the government and its American supporters who were driving the violence, he maintained. At his house in Kabul, he gestured to his wound and told me, “I am a hundred per cent certain the government did this.”A growing number of Afghans believe that people inside the government are directing some of the killings. In August, a group of prominent former officials, many of whom are close to former President Hamid Karzai, wrote to Ghani alleging that there were “high-ranking officials who are credibly suspected of being involved in targeted assassinations.” The letter also accused a Vice-President and a deputy in the ND S. of “attempting to spread an environment of fear and terror among government critics and opposition figures.” A senior Afghan leader told me, “I do not have proof, but there are people around Ghani who are determined to destroy the peace process.”Ghani denied that anyone in his administration was behind the killings. Saleh, the Vice-President, dismissed the claims, saying, “They equated our lack of capability to stop the targeted assassinations with being complicit.” The senior American official told me that it seemed plausible that people in the government were behind some of the killings: “Why would the Taliban kill someone who supports the peace talks?” But, he added, with so few troops left in the country, the US was struggling to gather reliable intelligence. “We do not exactly know what is going on.”In January, General Austin Miller, the commander of forces in the country, flew to Doha to deliver a message to the Taliban: The assassination campaign was putting the deal with the Americans at risk. If the Taliban did not back off, the US could resume attacks. The Taliban maintained that it had no obligation to reduce violence: “the Islamic Emirate has not committed itself to any such undertaking.”At fifty-nine, Miller is compact, no-nonsense, and direct. When I arrived at his base, he was leading his soldiers in an hour of running and calisthenics, which, at nearly six thousand feet above sea level, were enough to tire a soldier half his age. He is a kind of living symbol of America is post-9/11 wars. Since 2001, he has spent more than seven years fighting alongside Special Operations Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he hunted members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban; in Iraq, he took part in the operation that killed the insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He noted wryly that many of the Afghan leaders that he and his staff encountered, friend and foe, were already present when he first came to the region. “We are dealing with their sons now,” he said. Since 2002, American soldiers and officers have typically served tours of a year or less. With each rotation, new soldiers have to learn the country, and senior officers devise fresh plans. The result is that twenty years of effort in Afghanistan has meant twenty different campaigns. Miller returned to the country in 2010 and took the top job in 2018. “This is my fourth, fifth, or sixth tour,” he told me. “I have not counted.”Miller arrived at the peak of the American effort, and has presided over a rapidly shrinking force. Where the US once pursued ambitious goals, instilling democracy and economic development, he defined his mission narrowly: Do not let Afghanistan become a terrorist haven. But, he said, the re is a catch. “You need a government for that.”Senior officials in the Biden Administration say that they intend to take their time before they decide how to handle Afghanistan. “They are trying to figure out the best of the bad options they inherited,” the second senior American official told me. They are conscious that, if Biden ignores Trump is deal and decides to keep the roughly twenty-five hundred American troops in Afghanistan, the Taliban will almost certainly resume attacking them. In January, a senior US military-intelligence officer told a group of American soldiers to get ready for attacks. “We have been in this country for twenty years, and we may be entering the last four months. These could be the most uncertain of all,” the officer said. “Come May 1st, if we are still here, I think it is game on for the Taliban.”Miller told me, “If the Taliban were to attack US or coalition forces, we are prepared to respond proportionally, with precision, and with capacity to spare.” But he also said that he was prepared to pull out the last of his soldiers if ordered to do so. The unanswered question—which has hung over the country since 2001—is whether the Afghan state can survive without Western troops. When I asked if he thought that the Afghan Army could secure the country alone, his answer was not reassuring. “They have to,” he said. In early January, I flew with Miller to Afghan Army bases in Mazar-i-Sharif, in the north, and near the Helmand River, in the south. Looking down on the Hindu Kush from our C-130 transport plane, I was reminded of the country is natural beauty but also of the geographic realities that have hampered every attempt to help it stand on its own: it is landlocked and covered by mountains and desert, with only twelve per cent of its land suitable for farming. For much of its modern history, Afghanistan has been a ward of the international community: foreigners pay seventy-five per cent of its federal budget, and American taxpayers largely underwrite its Army and its security forces, at a cost of four billion dollars a year. But, if there is any hope that the Afghan state can become self-sufficient, it resides with the soldiers who train here. In Mazar-i-Sharif, we met General Sami Alizai, the commander of the 209th Corps. (He has since been promoted to lead the Afghan Army is special-operations corps.) An ethnic Pashtun from the south, Alizai signed up in 2004 and went on to graduate from the Joint Services Command and Staff College, one of the United Kingdom is élite military academies. A typical US officer of Alizai is rank is in his fifties; Alizai is thirty-five and exudes restless confidence. “It was a tough fighting season,” he told Miller. “There are a lot of Taliban dead.”At a lunch meeting with Miller, the limitations of is campaign became clear. When the season began, five of the fifty districts that Alizai is troops oversaw were under Taliban control, and twenty-nine were “on the edge,” he said. His men had secured a dozen of the m, he told Miller. But the Taliban had captured several villages along Highway 1, effectively cutting off the northern and western parts of the country. In Maimana, the capital of Faryab Province, the local government is control extends barely past the city center. “You can only go to the end of the bazaar,” he said. Several local leaders had been assassinated.“What do you think is happening?” Miller asked.“The Taliban are trying to set up a network here,” Alizai said. “We do not know who they are.” It was a conversation that might have taken place fifteen years ago. The 209th Corps is assisted by sixteen hundredtroops, who help with training, and by an American Special Forces team, which provides both training and protection in combat; if an Afghan unit comes under attack, the Americans can call in a plane or a drone. (In one of the more unusual aspects of the US-Taliban peace deal, the USs is allowed to protect Afghan forces from attacks. In practice, that means almost daily American air strikes and drone attacks; when I visited Helmand Province, the US had carried out two drone strikes that morning.) The US team was highly competent; all of its twenty members were seasoned, with some having served a dozen combat tours, and many spoke Dari and Pashto. But Alizai worried that the West is commitment might be coming to an end—or that it might become too small to matter. Over lunch, Miller told him bluntly that he did not know what the future would bring. “You know where we are at,” Miller said. “It is just not clear.”The 209th, budgeted for fifteen thousand troops, was fielding barely ten thousand. Even though the Army guarantees employment, in a country where jobs are scarce, Afghan officers struggle to find recruits; young people are often reluctant to leave their families for long tours. Alizai was undeterred. “I think we can get it up to ninety per cent soon,” he told Miller. Alizai said that he was trying to contain the militias of two local warlords: Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former Vice-President, and Atta Mohamed Noor. Both men befriended the Americans in 2001, and both fight the Taliban. But they operate more like local fiefs than like agents of the government. Dostum has been accused of murder, rape, torture, and mass executions. “I will try to bring them in,” Alizai told Miller. “Once we pay the m, we can influence them.” But there was little sign that this time would be different. Alizai told me that, despite all the problems besetting the Afghan Army so late in the American era, his sponsors should not give up hope. “It takes time to build an army, brother,” he said. “We are trying to train the right people. We started from nothing. Please be patient.”At the Sharq hotel in Doha, Fawzia Koofi was often the only woman in a room full of male negotiators. At first, she told me, some of her Taliban counterparts refused to speak to her. At a lunch meeting, two Taliban seated across from her asked her to move to another table. A third Talib at the table stared at the floor, unwilling to meet her gaze. Koofi picked up a plate and offered him a kebab; the Talib took it and smiled. “Miss Koofi, you are a very dangerous woman,” he told her. They have been talking ever since. By the time I arrived, in late December, the negotiators had begun to relax. “They let their hair down,” the senior American official told me. The government delegates found that the Taliban, though often hostile in groups, were friendlier one on one. The harsher rhetoric began to fade, and on some afternoons I saw Taliban and government delegates walking together through the Sharq is gardens. Negotiators from both sides told me that they felt a heavy responsibility to end the conflict. Most believe that the Taliban would accept a deal under the right circumstances—that they are as tired of war as everyone else is. But many observers in Kabul suspect that the Taliban are using the talks to buy time until the Americans depart. One of the skeptics wasSima Samar, who for seventeen years presided over the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, which seeks to bring modern concepts of justice and equality to the country. Samar believes that the Taliban will ultimately decide it is easier to take power by force. “The Taliban?” she said. “They have not changed a bit.” In December, during a break in the talks, a video surfaced of Fazel Akhund, one of the Taliban negotiators, greeting a group of masked men at what appears to be a military training camp. As Akhund embraced the trainees, one of them cried out, “Long live the holy warriors of Afghanistan!”In Kabul, Vice-President Amrullah Saleh suggested to me that pro-government Afghans would be no less reluctant than the Taliban to share control of the country. I met Saleh in 1999, as the Taliban were surging to victory in the country is long, brutal civil war; back the n, Saleh and a few holdouts were clinging to a tiny piece of territory in the northeast. In 2004, Saleh became the head of the National Directorate of Security, and earned a reputation among the Taliban as a fierce and efficient foe. In July, 2019, suicide bombers breached Saleh is security cordon and killed thirty-two people. Saleh argued that, if the Afghan government is forced to make a deal with the Taliban before the group forsakes violence, the peace will fail, and the group will try to reimpose its medieval vision. “Society has changed,” he said. Women have been educated, young people are connected to the wider world, English has become common in the cities. “People will not accept the Taliban,” he said. “They will not lie down. We have forty thousand Special Forces. Do you think they will let the Taliban slaughter them one by one?” He went on, “It will be another civil war.” The first, in the nineties, killed more than fifty thousand people. “But it will be worse than the last one. Absolutely worse.”Yet the government negotiators will have to make some concessions to the Taliban, or the talks will break down, and the Western countries will likely leave the population to fend for itself. “I will fight with my claws and my teeth for the rights we have gained,” Fatima Gailani, a government delegate and an advocate for women, told me. “But there is a risk that some of these rights are going to be lost.”One place to measure that risk is the Afghan Women is Skills Development Center, in Kabul. The center offers training in sewing and catering, and works with a restaurant to supply jobs for trainees. It also provides a shelter for women and children escaping the difficulties of a society that, in many places, is still bound by age-old rules. Almost every day, a woman or a girl appears at the doorstep: a child bride fleeing her husband; a wife forced into an abusive marriage; a recently divorced woman whose family regards her as a disgrace and sent her into the streets. One recent morning, a young woman arrived so badly pummelled that attendants massaged her every day for two weeks. “There was not a spot on her body—not one—that was not black-and-blue,” a worker at the center told me. “I wanted to scream.” The shelter, the first of its kind in Kabul, has a maximum capacity of seventy; it is often full. One of the women who run the shelter is Mahbouba Seraj, an ebullient seventy-year-old. Born to royal lineage, she fled Afghanistan with her family in 1978, as the country disintegrated, and settled for a time in Manhattan, at Lexington Avenue and Forty-third Street. After 2001, Seraj was drawn back by the prospect of change in her homeland. Ever since, she has been sustained by a sense that outdated traditions were falling away. “There is a lot of change here, and a lot of possibility—and a lot of pain and a lot of happiness,” she told me. “All these things used to get swept under the rug, and there was nowhere for a woman to go. Now there is.”Would the shelter survive a Taliban regime? Seraj is not sure. She believes that the younger generations, which constitute most of the country is urban population, will fight. “I have a belief in the energy and the idea and the newness and the commitment of the young people of this country,” she said. “We have doctors now, we have people with master is degrees and PhD.s now. So many women and so many young people, so full of energy. They are not going to give this up.”Seraj is less sure about everyone else. She told me that she’d been chatting with friends recently, and they all agreed that the situation was likely to get much worse: “For the first time after all these years, I said to my friends, ‘Let is not be heroes. At this point, we have to save our lives.’ ” ♦An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the ownership of the Sharq hotel.

McDonald is recently raised its hourly wage sin some outposts, but many say those concessions are inconsistent and do not go far enough, particularly given the challenges of working through a pandemic. Members of theFight for $15will walk out of locations in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Flint, Houston, and a host of other cities, demanding increased wages across the board as well as union protection and adequate PPE Below, find the personal stories behind why three McDonald is workers across the country—Precious Cole, Doneshia Babbit, and Imelda Rosales—are striking on May 19. I have been working at McDonald is for about a month, but I have been working in fast food my whole life. I have worked at Wendy is, Freddy is [a fast-food chain based in Kansas], Little Caesar is, my first job was at Taco Bell. I have pretty much worked at all of the m, except for KFC When I was working at Freddy is, we had an employee that contracted COVID-19, and the managers knew because we all worked with her. The managers were like, “You have to quarantine yourself for two weeks or go get tested,” and we were all really upset because they basically let her come back to work without getting her negative test results back. Then, when her test results came back, she found out she was positive, and the n the whole night crew had to be out for two weeks with no pay. We had to figure out a way to get COVID tested just to come back to work. I am going out on strike to stand in solidarity with all McDonald is workers, even though I have only been there a short while. McDonald is has been around forever, and they set the standard for these other fast-food companies to pay us poverty wages. These corporations need to listen to their workers! Whenever I give a speech, I always tell people that these companies are nothing without us. Without us, these jobs would crumble, so we need to stand together and fight for a union and $15 dollars an hour. It is not enough, but it is a start. I have been working at McDonald is for over seven years now, and it is gotten a lot worse since the pandemic. A lot of our employees have quit, so we are short-staffed most of the time. I started working with the Fight for $15 when I first started at McDonald is, back in my teens. It just felt like the right thing to do. We said what we need, and we have not gotten it, so I am still fighting. We are getting paid nickels and dimes, and the shareholders and million-dollar corporations are making money off of our backs. With this strike, I hope to get into the minds of people who have not yet seen what we are working toward. A lot of workers feel unwanted or unneeded based on what they are being paid or how they are being treated, so I want to change that. I have worked at McDonald is for over a decade, and I am on strike to day—again—because I know the work I do, the work we all do, is worth $15 per hour. McDonald is made billions off our labor during a global pandemic, while workers suffered through unsafe working conditions and unlivable wages. I am tired of McDonald is putting profits above our safety and keeping workers like me down, and I will continue striking and speaking up until workers get a voice on the job.",2,1,Vogue
40,"The impact of women is careers on childbearing age, in one chart",-0.75,48.5,https://qz.com/work/1596628/more-uk-women-start-families-in-their-30s-now-than-their-20s/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,25,"We know intuitively that, in developed economies, birthrates are falling as people have fewer children and are waiting until later in life to start families. For some, that is because of career commitments earlier in life. For others, travel and education play a role, while others are waiting until they have found someone with whom they want to co-parent. Stats just released by the UK is Office for National Statistics gives one of the clearest pictures yet of these shifts. For the first time since the ONS began collecting data, more women are getting pregnant at age 30 or older than in their 20s:In 2017, the most recent year for which the agency has data, there were 398,284 pregnancies to women aged 30 or over, and 395,856 pregnancies to women of between 20 and 29. (Not all pregnancies, of course, end in childbirth.)Pregnancy in women under 20, meanwhile, fell to its lowest ever level. Kathryn Littleboy, the statistician responsible for the ONS data, said that teenage pregnancy rates, which have been falling consistently for 10 years and have more than halved since records began in 1990, may have dropped because of improved sex education, better access to contraceptives, and more young women staying in education. Total conceptions in all three of these age brackets fell, part of a trend of declining overall birthrate that keeps the UK in line with other developed economies. Only one age group saw a net rise in the rate of conception: women over 40, for whom total conceptions increased by 2.6% from the previous year. Littleboy said the reasons behind the rise in women over 40 having more children could include the effects of rising living costs. The overall trend of women getting pregnant later, however, signals a bigger shift for women, away from early marriage and motherhood, and toward establishing their careers. Fertile years do not last forever, which is why it makes sense to compare one decade—the 20s, when most pregnancies used to occur—to the total of both the 30s and 40s. Using the UK as a proxy for global trends, it seems likely that women entering the workplace and staying in it even when they have kids will mean a continued shift to pregnancy in the third and fourth decades of life.

Published: December 22, 2020 8:54amUpdated: December 22, 2020 2:57pmLate last summer, Black Lives Matter activists in Detroit sued the city government in federal court, alleging that Detroit police ""repeatedly responded with violence"" to anti-police demonstrations and riots in the city between June and August. The plaintiffs supported their claim with photos of some of the resulting injuries. US District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan Laurie J Michelson responded by issuing a temporary order to limit the use of force by the police department. Less than one month later, the city of Detroit filed a countersuit denying in detail each accusation made by the protesters. The city issuitalleges that the demonstrators in Detroit are part of a ""civil conspiracy"" in place to ""disturb the peace, engage in disorderly conduct, incite riots, destroy public property"" and resist the actions of city police. The city is asking the court to issue judgements against protestors who are a part of this ""conspiracy"" and who worked to defame the mayor and police department. The suit also requests that damages be awarded to the city. The city is countersuit — the first of its kind to be filed following last summer is George Floyd protests — is being attacked on the activist left as an effort to suppress protest movements. Progressive Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, whose district includes much of Detroit, called the move ""an unthinkable assault on constitutional rights.""""These attacks against us are a way of attempting to minimize our ability to go on the offensive and call for transparency and accountability,"" said Tristan Taylor, a protest leader and plaintiff in the initial lawsuit against the city. ""This is just a way of saying to people, 'This is not a place where you can raise your voice.'""The countersuit accuses Detroit protesters — specifically the umbrella group ""Detroit Will Breathe"" — of disseminating a ""false narrative to rile the public"" about the deadly July shooting of Hakim Littleton, a 20-year-old black man. Video footage released by the police department the day of the shooting shows ""the man fire a gun at an officer before police shot him.""The suit additionally contests a number of characterizations of alleged police brutality, including the use of the term ""chokehold"" to describe the actions of a female officer while arresting Nakia Wallace, a leader of the Detroit Will Breathe group. The demonstrators, meanwhile, are exploring both a legal response, in which they will be represented by allied national legal support groups, and a political response lobbying the Detroit City Council to use its power to cut off funding for the city is litigation efforts when the issue comes before the body in early 2021.",2,1,Just the News

43,The World is Most Technologically Sophisticated Genocide Is Happening in Xinjiang,-0.33,43.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/15/uighur-genocide-xinjiang-china-surveillance-sterilization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,25,"Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to the scale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostly secular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China. One is an authoritative report documenting the systematic sterilization of Uighur women. The other was the seizure by US Customs and Border Protection of 13 to ns of products made from human hair suspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forced sterilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. Two recent disturbing events may finally awaken the world to the scale and horror of the atrocities being committed against the Uighurs, a mostly secular Muslim ethnic minority, in Xinjiang, China. One is an authoritative report documenting the systematic sterilization of Uighur women. The other was the seizure by US Customs and Border Protection of 13 to ns of products made from human hair suspected of being forcibly removed from Uighurs imprisoned in concentration camps. Both events evoke chilling parallels to past atrocities elsewhere, forced sterilization of minorities, disabled, and Indigenous people, and the image of the glass display of mountains of hair preserved at Auschwitz. TheGenocide Convention, to which China is a signatory, defines genocide as specific acts against members of a group with the intent to destroy that group in whole or in part. These acts include (a) killing; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm; (c) deliberately inflicting conditions of life to bring about the group is physical destruction; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Any one of these categories constitutes genocide. The overwhelming evidence of the Chinese government is deliberate and systematic campaign to destroy the Uighur people clearly meets each of these categories. Over a millionTurkic Uighursare detained in concentration camps, prisons, and forced labor factories in China. Detainees are subject to military-style discipline, thought transformation, and forced confessions. They are abused, tortured, raped, and even killed. Survivors report being subjected to electrocution,waterboarding,repeated beatings,stress positions, and injections of unknown substances. These mass detention camps are designed to cause serious physical, psychological harm and mentally break the Uighur people. Therepeatedgovernment orders to “break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins”; “round up everyone who should be rounded up”; and systematically prevent Uighur births demonstrate a clear intent to eradicate the Uighur people as a whole. Ekpar Asat(brother of one of the present authors) is an emblematic example of how Uighurs are targeted regardless of their recognition as model Chinese citizens by the Communist Party. Asat was praised by the government for his community leadership as a “bridge builder” and “positive force” between ethnic minorities and the Xinjiang local government. But Asat still suffered the same fate as over a million other Uighurs and disappeared into the shadows of the concentration camps in 2016. He is held incommunicado and is reported to be serving a 15-year sentence on the trumped-up charge of “inciting ethnic hatred.” Not a single court document is available about his case. In 2017, Xinjiangwageda brutal “Special Campaign to Control Birth Control Violations,” along with specific local directives. By 2019, the government planned to subject over 80 percent of women of childbearing age in southern Xinjiang to forced intrauterine devices (IUDs) and sterilization. The goal is to achieve“zero birth control violation incidents.” Government documents reve ala campaign of mass female sterilization supported by state funding to carry out hundreds of thousands of sterilizations in 2019 and 2020. This goes far beyond the scale, per capita, of forced sterilization inflicted on women throughout China under the past one-child policy. To implement these policies, the Xinjiang governmentemployed“dragnet-style” investigations to hunt down women of childbearing age. Once apprehended, these women have no choice but to undergo forced sterilization to avoid being sent to an internment camp. Once detained, women face forced injections, abortions, and unknown drugs. And statistics show that the government is meeting its birth prevention goals. Between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates in the Uighur heartland plummeted by 84 percent. Conversely, official documents show that sterilization rates skyrocketed in Xinjiang while plunging throughout the rest of China, and the funding for these programs is only increasing. Between 2017 and 2018, in one district, the percentage of women who were infertile or widowed increased by 124 percent and 117 percent, respectively. In 2018, 80 percent of all IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang despite accounting for a mere 1.8 percent of China is population. These IUDs can be removed only by state-approved surgery—or else prison terms will follow. In Kashgar, only about 3 percent of married women of childbearing age gave birth in 2019. The latest annual reports from some of these regions have begun omitting birth rate information altogether to conceal the scale of destruction. The government has shut down its entire online platform after these revelations. The scale and scope of these measures are clearly designed to halt Uighur births. With Uighur men detained and women sterilized, the government has laid the groundwork for the physical destruction of the Uighur people. At least half a million of the remaining Uighur children have been separated from their families and are being raised by the state at so-called “children shelters.”What makes this genocide so uniquely dangerous is its technological sophistication, allowing for efficiency in its destruction and concealment from global attention. The Uighurs have been suffering under the most advanced police state, with extensive controls and restrictions on every aspect of life—religious, familial, cultural, and social. To facilitate surveillance, Xinjiang operates under a grid management system. Cities and villages are split into squares of about 500 people. Each square has a police station that closely monitors inhabitants by regularly scanning their identification cards, faces, DNA samples, fingerprints, and cell phones. These methods are supplemented by a machine-operated system known as theIntegrated Joint Operations Platform. The system uses machine learning to collect personal data from video surveillance, smartphones, and other private records to generate lists for detention. Over a million Han Chinese watchers have been installed in Uighur households, rendering even intimate spaces subject to the government is eye. The Chinese government operates the most intrusive mass surveillance system in the world and repeatedly denies the international community meaningful access to it. It is the refore incumbent on us to appreciate the nature, depth, and speed of the genocide and act now before it is too late. Recognizing or refusing to name this a genocide will be a matter of life or death. In 1994, by the time US officials were done debating the applicability of the term to the situation in Rwanda, nearly a million Tutsis had already been slaughtered. A document dated May 1, 1994, at the height of the genocide, by an official in the Office of the Secretary of Defensestated: “Genocide finding could commit [the US government] to actually ‘do something.’” Four years later, President Bill Clinton stood before Rwandan survivors and reflected on his administration is historic failure andvowed: “Never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence.”With the passing of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, the US government has begun to take steps in the right direction to avoid another human catastrophe. Seventy-eight members of Congress have followed upwith a call for the administration to impose Magnitsky sanctions on the responsible Chinese officials and issue a formal declaration of the atrocity crimes, including genocide. So far, the administration has officiallyimposedMagnitsky sanctions on four Chinese officials and an entity in charge of the Orwellian surveillance system and responsible for the expansion of the internment camps in Xinjiang. The US government must now make an official determination of genocide. This will not be difficult, as US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus has already asserted that “what has happened to the Uighur people … is potentially the worst crime that we have seen since the Holocaust.”A formal declaration of genocide is not simply symbolic. It will catalyze other countries to join in a concerted effort to end the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang. It will also prompt consumers to reject the over 80 international brands that profit off genocide. Furthermore, the determination will strengthen legal remedies for sanctioning companies that profit from modern slavery in their supply chains sourced in China and compel business entities to refrain from profiting from genocide and commit to ethical sourcing. In our interconnected world, we are not only bystanders if we fail to recognize the genocide as we see it.

44,Why a Biden Presidency Could Be Good for the Church,11.67,30.33,https://stream.org/why-a-biden-presidency-could-be-good-for-the-church/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-17,24,"Like many of you reading this article, I voted for Donald Trump, which means I voted against Joe Biden. I have also written articles calling out the radical nature of the Democratic platform, drawing attention to Biden is extreme, “transgender rights”position, and pointing to his continued shift to the left on abortion. And I have warned of the potential dangers of a Kamala Harris presidency. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about the directionAmerica could be heading under a Biden-Harris administration, including potentially destructive dealings with China and Iran. At the same time, I believe that the election of Joe Biden might be in the best interest of the Church of America. How can I say such a thing?Simply stated, it is because many of us Christian conservatives put too much trust in a man. (If you did not, fine. I said “many of us,” not all of us.)We were looking to a man to preserve our religious freedoms. Looking to a man to overturn through the courts. Looking to a man to fight our battles, to be our champion. Looking to a man to push back against the evil agendas of the radical left. Looking to a man to bring peace to the Middle East. Such an attitude is never healthy, especially when that man is Donald Trump, a man who could be as abrasive and destructive as he could be winsome and uniting. And when it seemed that Trump might be losing the election, we turned to God in fervent prayer and fasting. But it was not so much for revival in the church and mercy on America as much as it was for Trump is victory, as if only a Trump victory stood between America is freedom and America’ collapse. As I recall, Jesus taught us to pray that the Lord is name would be hallowed and that His kingdom would come and His will be done, rather than to pray for the election of a particular individual or the success of a particular party. To be sure, many were praying for justice, praying to “Stop the Steal.” Yet our prayers for the reelection of Donald Trump were far more passionate than our prayers for other critical issues, such as stopping the pandemic. Or our prayers to see our neighbors come to Jesus. Or our prayers for the safety of our persecuted brothers and sisters around the world. How could this be right?As things stand, I truly believe that four more years of Donald Trump would have led to greater spiritual complacency and even triumphalism, not to mention the vulgarizing of our own souls. Four more years of Trump (for which I, too, voted) would have led to even greater trust in a man, only deepening our dangerous trend. Four more years of Trump would have destroyed our witness even more severely, as evangelical Christians (in particular, white evangelical Christians) would have been better known for association with Trump than association with Jesus. (As it is, much damage has been done and we have much ground to recover.)Four more years of Trump would have kept our focus on the government, as if the White House or Congress or the Supreme Court could slow the national hemorrhaging or stop our downward moral and spiritual slide.“But,” you say, “a Biden-Harris presidency means more babies slaughtered. That alone tells me you are wrong. Surely God does not want more innocent blood being shed.”Certainly, I share your pro-life passion, and I fully understand the implications of a Biden-Harris administration when it comes to the unborn. Absolutely, 100 percent. But let is face the facts. Babies were slaughtered ata horrific rate through the Republican presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, George W Bush, and Donald Trump. That is a total of 24 years and more than 22 million babies, which is far more babies than were aborted during the 16 years of the Democratic presidencies of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. At the same time, progress is being made every year in reducing the number of abortions through other legislative and grass roots efforts, all while we continue to press for the overturning of.“But,” you say, “a Democratic victory now could mean the packing of the courts and the end of free and fair elections as we know it. We will never recover from this.”You could be right, in which case, the situation is dire. On the other hand, now is the time to stand up boldly and exercise our faith. Why must we be sof atalistic?The possibilities are indeed grave, but they are certainly not written in stone. Personally, I do not believe most Americans will support the increasingly radical leftist agenda. In fact, it could be that the best thing that could happen to our country is for the radical left to show its real hand and for its fangs, so to say, to be exposed. The more that BLM and Antifa terrorize our streets, the less popular they will be. The more people see where a Green New Deal will lead (especially in their paychecks and freedoms), the less they will like it. The more the Democrats seek to remake America, the more Americans will not want Democrats in power. The more people realize that Big Tech is trying to rule their lives and the mainstream media is lying to the m, the more they will resent this hostile takeover. As for the Church, the more we realize that we cannot look to the White House or Congress to do our bidding, the more we will get back to gospel basics. And it is those basics alone that can save the nation. To quote the words of the Psalms, “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes” (Psalm 118:9). And, “Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save” (Psalm 146:3). Today, we could substitute the word “presidents” for “princes.”Of course, these verses do not mean that we become passive and complacent when it comes to the political system. They do not mean that we have a k um baya mentality when it comes to laws and policies. But they do mean that we must not put our full trust in earthly leaders or earthly powers. And they do mean that our trust in God will be rewarded. The truth is that, quite often in life, the worst things turn out to the best things. And as the saying goes, if it does not kill you, it makes you stronger. A Biden-Harris presidency will not come close to killing us. Did not Jesus say that the gates of Hades would not prevail over the Church, meaning the powers of death itself?Instead, an adversarial presence in the White House could be the best thing that happened to the Church of America in years. Maybe this is what it will take to wake us up. An awakened Church remains the hope of the nation. It is that force alone — the force of the gospel lived out — that can change hearts. Then, people with changed hearts can reshape the government and the courts. Then we will have change that can last. ",1,0,The Stream

Or at least, the truth as she remembers it. Grisham, who served in a variety of White House roles as chief spokesperson for both the president and the first lady, told New York magazine that because she had not been planning a tell-all book before she quit the White House on January 6, she did not keep a diary and wrote entirely from memory. Unfortunately, while much of what Grisham writes about the Trumps’ off-screen behavior rings true, her account of what she witnessed in the Trump White House is riddled with factual errors and what appear to be trace elements of cover stories she invented for the press that eventually lodged the mselves in her memory, displacing in her mind the contrary evidence of her own eyes and ears. We know this because several of the events Grisham describes in her memoir unfolded in public and were documented in still photographs, on video, and in White House transcripts. By examining that evidence, we can see that at least a half-dozen of the stories Grisham recounts include details that are either incorrect or invented. Perhaps the clearest example of this is Grisham is new account of what came to be known as “Sharpiegate,” when, on September 4, 2019, Trump called reporters into the Oval Office and held up a weather map which he had altered with a black marker, presenting it as proof that he had been right, and the National Weather Service wrong, when he warned residents of Alabama earlier that week that they were in the likely path of Hurricane Dorian. Grisham tries to convince readers of her memoir that the whole event was more about incompetence than dishonesty. She writes that before the reporters were summoned that day, Trump expressed anger that the map, a week-old projection of the storm is likely path “sitting on an easel by his desk,” showed the hurricane threatening Florida and Georgia but not, as he’d tweeted, Alabama. Trump the n took a Sharpie from his desk and drew a black line to include Alabama in the path, insisting to his staff that this was the original projection for the storm. Grisham claims that Trump was right about that, despite the fact that none of the forecast cones predicting the storm is path ever included Alabama. Then, she writes, Trump was reminded that he was behind schedule and the press was rushed in. “No one thought,” Grisham writes, “that the map was still displayed for the press to see.”“When the reporters came in, some of them zeroed in on the map,” she continues. “The story was too good to resist: The president was creating his own reality again! He was doctoring official documents! Even though, in that case, Trump actually had not planned to show the map to the press.”Grisham even laments, “No reporter believed our explanations by that point. They believed that everyone around the president was a liar.” But any reporter she offered this explanation to had good reason not to believe it because video evidence shows that it was clearly a lie. The entire 27-minute briefing for the press that day was broadcast by C-SPANand posted on the White House YouTubechannel. What the video shows is that, contrary to Grisham is claims, the map was not accidentally displayed on an easel when reporters came in. It was facing away from the mon the floor behind Trump is desk, until Trump began the briefing by asking Kevin McAleenan, the acting homeland security secretary, to hand it to him so he could hold it up for the cameras. Grisham even attributes her failure to hold a single press briefing during her tenure as White House press secretary to her fear of ending up,like her former boss Sean Spicer, satirized on “Saturday Night Live” as a hapless liar. If she appeared on the briefing room is stage, Grisham writes, “I knew that sooner or later the president would want me to tell the public something that was not true or that would make me sound like a lunatic.”(Grisham fails to mention that she had already been caught lying for Trumpin a way that made her seem ridiculous in 2018, when she defended his delusional claim that he had “predicted” the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum during a visit to his Scottish golf course the day before the vote. In fact, ascon temporary news reports, and date-stamped tweets from bothTrumpandGrishamthat day make clear, Trump actually arrived in Scotlandthe morning after the referendum. Grisham completely omits this episode from her memoir.)Grisham writes that her worst fears seemed to be coming true, in the autumn of 2019, as the White House debated how and when to release the transcript of Trump is July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, which had triggered an impeachment inquiry. Trump summoned her to the Oval Office and directed her to “go out on your stage” and give a dramatic reading of the transcript. “You need to act it out. With voices,” Grisham recalls Trump telling her. “You need to really reenact the phone call so people will understand how perfect it was. Elegant, really. So you will need to use two voices and act it out.”“This was it, “Grisham writes, “this was going to be my ticket to being satirized on ‘Saturday Night Live.’”Grisham recounts that she only avoided having to perform this one-woman show — “presumably with a Ukrainian accent for Zelensky is portions? And what voice would I be using for Trump?” — after a colleague convinced Trump that it would be better to have a member of Congress read the whole transcript into the record for posterity.“The next day,” Grisham writes, instead of her “one of our most reliable ‘yes’ guys, California congressman Devin Nunes, read the full transcript before the House Intelligence Committee so the perfect phone call could be remembered forever.”But video of the House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearing on November 15, 2019, shows that while Nunes di dread the transcript of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky, it was not, as Grisham wrote, the record of what Trump referred to as his “perfect call” from July 25. Instead of that deeply incriminating call, Nunes read the semi-comic transcript of an earlier, anodyne conversation between the two presidents, which had taken place on April 21 — three months before the call in which Trumppressed Zelenskyto do him “a favor” by announcing sham investigations of Democrats, including Joe Biden.'When I owned Miss Universe, they had great people. Ukraine was always well represented.' Devin Nunes reads the transcript of a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy during to day is#impeachmenthearing. Live updates:— Reuters (@Reuters)November 15, 2019Other parts of Grisham is memoir that distort the historical record suggest that while she did get what she calls a “front-row seat” to watch history unfold inside the Trump White House, some of what she observed failed to make a clear enough impression on her for her to even accurately remember basic details. One example of this is Grisham is recollection of watching Trump try to impress President Xi Jinping of China by bragging about “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake you have ever seen,” over dessert at Mar-a-Lago during an April 2017 visit, “while talking about a missile strike on Syria he’d launched the week before.” But, as TrumptoldMaria Bartiromo a few days later,the missile strike, in retaliation for a Syrian government chemical attack, was carried out during the dinner that night. Grisham also has a vivid recollection of being in the White House briefing room for Sean Spicer is infamous first appearance the re, on Saturday, January 21, 2017, when he tried and failed to browbeat reporters into accepting that the relatively small crowd at Trump is inaugural the day before “was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period!”Grisham writes that she had no idea what Spicer was going to say but recalls that she was seated just to the left of the stage, next to Omarosa Manigault Newman. “Hope Hicks was next to her, the n Kellyanne Conway, and finally Sarah Sanders at the other end. I remember being proud that the press team supporting Sean that day consisted of all women.”In fact, archivalvideoandphotographsof that briefing show that Grisham was not seated alongside the stage, and neither were Newman or Conway. Grisham appears to have conflated her memory of Spicer is self-immolation that day with her presence at his second briefing two days later — when she was the re, seatedalongsideNewman, Conway, and Sanders. Grisham also flubs the time line in a story about her attempt to mediate an Oval Office dispute between the first lady and the president over a proposed ban to ban flavored e-cigarettes on September 11, 2019. Grisham writes that Melania Trump kept pushing her husband to immediately call in the press and announce the ban, despite the misgivings of political advisers who were concerned it would anger his base. In an effort to keep the first lady at bay, and give Trump more time to hear from other advisers, Grisham recalls that she “reminded her that it was 9/11 and she and the president still needed to take part in the moments of silence to honor the attacks. This solemn occasion was not the time to make such an announcement.”The stalling tactic failed, however, and Grisham writes that Trump finally agreed to his wife is demand to summon the press corps to the Oval Office without delay and announce a ban (which he would later backtrack on) before continuing with the scheduled commemorations of the September 11 attacks. But White House transcripts and video of that day show that this incident took place after the 9/11 ceremonies, not before them as Grisham recalls. The Trumps observed the moment of silence outside the White House, as scheduled, at 8:46 a.m. that morning, nearly four hours before the press corps was called into the Oval Office,at 12:26 p.m., to hear the president awkwardly cite pressure from the first lady as a factor in his decision to ban the e-cigarettes. White House announces FDA is going to take flavored e-cigarettes off the marketpic.twitter.com/y689So3cWA— Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1)September 11, 2019A more troubling distortion by Grisham is her account of a bizarre fight Trump picked with two Ohio Democrats, Senator Sherrod Brown and Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, hours after he visited victims of a mass shooting in the city on August 7, 2019. According to Grisham, the president and the first lady were both furious with her for not having had press in the intensive care unit at the hospital in Dayton, “to capture all of the medical staff clapping and cheering for them and taking selfies.” Grisham reports that both were unmoved by her explanation that press were not supposed to be crowded around patients, to protect their privacy and their health. “What a waste,” Trump said. Then, after they boarded Air Force One to fly from Ohio to the site of another mass shooting that week, in El Paso, Texas, Grisham writes, “my stomach dropped when I saw that the two local Democratic politicians who, at our invitation, had spent the day with us on the steps of the hospital we had just visited were holding a press conference. They had clearly preplanned it, and I watched the president is mood torpedo as he watched it unfold. They said that Trump is visit was a publicity stunt and had done nothing to heal the community.”While Grisham accurately sums up how Trump seemed to feel about watching Brown and Whaley speak to reporters — the president tweeted that day to accuse them of “totally misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital” — her characterization of what they said bears no resemblance to reality. To start with, they did not take questions at Miami Valley Hospital, where the gunshot victims were being treated, but in Dayton City Hall after they left the hospital. But more importantly, the full video of their remarks shows that they never called Trump is visit a publicity stunt or accused him of failing to heal the community. While both Democrats said that they had pressed Trump for real action to ban assault weapons — like the an AR-15-style rifle the Dayton gunman had used to shoot 26 people in 32 seconds, killing nine — neither of them said anything critical about his visit. To the contrary, Brown, who had previously been critical of Trump is divisive rhetoric, said that the president “was received well by the patients, as you’d expect. They are hurting. He was comforting. He did the right things. Melania did the right things. And it is his job, in part, to comfort people. I am glad he did it in those hospital rooms.”A reporter asked Whaleyif she thought “this helped the healing, having the president come here?” The mayor replied, “I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the USs came today.”With Trump somehow taking offense at what was said at the news conference, or just the fact that he was not part of it, Grisham relates that the president “totally unleashed on me,” launching into a foul-mouthed rant and demanding that she immediately leave the forward cabin on the plane and make sure the reporters traveling with them on Air Force One knew how well received he had been at the hospital. “Go back the re, go right now and tell them how much everyone in that hospital loved me,” Trump instructed Grisham. “Go, do it. Do it now.”Grisham writes that she could not bring herself to do that, fearing that reporters would laugh at her if she had gone back to them “on a day when we all should have been focussed on shooting victims and their families to say, ‘Hey guys, just want you to know the hospital staff really loved President Trump.’”Instead Grisham and Dan Scavino, Trump is social media id, channeled his bizarre tantrum into attacking the Democrats on Twitter from the plane. “Very SAD to see Ohio Senator Brown, & Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley – LYING & completely mischaracterizing what took place w/ the President is visit to Miami Valley Hospital to day,” Scavinowrotefrom his official White House account. “They are disgraceful politicians, doing nothing but politicizing a mass shooting, at every turn they can. The President was treated like a Rock Star inside the hospital, which was all caught on video. They all loved seeing their great President!”Grisham shared that message from the press secretary is official account and added that the president had “graciously asked Sen Brown & Mayor Whaley to join as he and the First Lady visited victims, medical staff & first responders. It is genuinely sad to see them immediately hold such a dishonest press conference in the name of partisan politics.”During his visit to El Paso that day, Trump was asked why he had lashed out at Brown and Whaley on Twitter. Trump replied by explaining that he was upset by remarks he attributed to Brown and Whaley, which they did not, in fact, make. “I get on Air Force One, where they do have a lot of televisions. I turn on the television, and there they are saying, ‘Well, I do not know if it was appropriate for the president to be here,’” Trump said. NEW: Pres. Trump makes first public remarks after visiting El Paso and Dayton in wake of mass shootings. “We had an amazing day.”— ABC News (@ABC)August 7, 2019What is truly bizarre about Grisham is faulty account of this incident is that, even with the benefit of hindsight, she still seems unable to admit that Trump is deranged tantrum was not an understandable reaction to unfair criticism by his political opponents but evidence of a dangerously unstable narcissist who was never fit for the job she spent more than four years helping him pretend he was capable of doing.

While a handful of these women — just like in the US, they call the mselves “the silence breakers” — have sought legal recourse, many others cannot; their cases are either blocked by government censors or counter defamation lawsuits in the notoriously male-dominated country that still maintains tight control over its judicial system and grassroots activists. Inspired by the dozens of women who accused Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, screenwriter Zhou Xiaoxuan is one of just a few women who has been able to get her case heard in court after coming forward with accusations of misconduct at the hands of one of the most recognizable faces in Chinese television: Famed celebrity interviewer Zhu Jin.

According to, some have even described her story as the “first step in the Long March” against sexual assault in China. Zhou Xiaoxuan, now 27, was one of several women to came forward with allegations of sexual assault in 2018 after the #MeToo movement first gained traction. According to, Zhou published an essay accusing China Central Television host Zhu Jin of groping and forcibly kissing her in a dressing room when she was a 23-year-old intern on his show. When Zhou reported the case to Chinese police, she was told that coming forward might damage Zhu is image and ""hurt the feelings of those who admired him,"" according toIt is highly unusual for sexual-harassment claims to make it to court in China, and hardly any of the country is state-run media outlets have reported on Zhou is case. She is reportedly seeking a publicly apology and $7,600 in damages from Zhu, who has denied claims against him, according to.“I am very nervous,” Zhoureportedly told AFPbefore a hearing on December 2. “But whether we win or lose the case, it has meaning. If we lose, it allows the questions we raised at least to remain in history. Someone will have to give us an answer.”After a long day in court, judges adjourned the trial and decided to hear the case another day. It is unclear what happens next, but experts believe it is significant that the court agreed to hear Zhou is case at all. ""Has Chinese society changed since the #MeToo movement? I ca not say,"" Lu Pin, a feminist campaigner in China until 2015, told. ""But 20 years ago, society was willfully ignorant or aggressively denying sexual harassment and rape culture. Today, we have at least forced the debate.""China has a ""zero tolerance for collective actions,"" Human Rights Watch researcherYaqiu Wangwrote in aop-ed, meaning that the country is #MeToo movement has not resulted in massive street protests like it has in the US Outside Harvey Weinstein is trial, for example,150 women wearing masks and dressed in all black chanted: ""It is not my fault! Not where I was, not how I dressed! The rapist WAS you! The rapist IS you!""The scene outside the courthouse where Zhou appeared earlier this month was much more subdued: A group of demonstrators held signs offering support and took pictures of her. “I saw people holding slogans to support Xianzi, I felt excited and moved to see people here to support each other,” Yang Ruiqi, a third-year university student, told the. “The whole #MeToo movement is an inspiration to me, making me realise that things which made me feel uncomfortable before were wrong, it was not because I was being too sensitive.”""The verdict is not important,"" Li Tingting, a women is rights activist there in support of Zhou, told. ""What was important for our movement was the moment, the process, the involvement of people who gathered physically from across the country and the foundation we have laid.""A new civil code enacted in China this summers tries to hold schools and businesses accountable for sexual harassment, though it is been called ""largely symbolic.""“The state is taking steps toward giving victims a path for vindicating their rights,” Aaron Halegua, a specialist in Chinese labor law at New York University, told. “However, the law is still very vague and leaves many questions unanswered.”",2,1,Elle
51,Teen Abandoned at Birth Now Raises Money to Give Senior Dogs the Love She Found With a Forever Home,-1.33,45.0,https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teen-starts-petsitting-service-to-donate-to-senior-dog-home/,https://adfontesmedia.com/good-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,17,"Abandoned in a basket on a college campus in India as an infant, Meena Kumar knows what it is like to need a little love. That is why she is drawn to the pups that are most often overlooked—senior dogs living out their golden years in animal shelters. Snuggling with four-legged seniors became her passion, and that dedication is helping to support second-chances for dozens of dogs, even after being told she was too young to volunteer.“More people should adopt senior dogs,” she told CNN. “They give you the same unconditional love as any other dog.”The 14-year-old is love for canines began when she was no taller than a Schnauzer. She spent a year in an Indian orphanage, before being adopted by a couple in Mumbai. As a two-year-old, she lovingly spent hours caring for newborn pups in her family is apartment.“My parents were worried about how to keep me amused in a small place,” she told TODAY.“Thankfully, a dog had laid a litter of puppies, and I used to spend hours every day watching and playing with them.”:13-Year-old Has Been Sewing Hundreds of Bowties to Help Shelter Pets Get AdoptedKumar is doggie dedication continued when she was brought to San Jose, California, where she insisted the family make regular visits to the Humane Society. When she was eight, they adopted Bambie, a mixed-breed pooch that she spent hours training to do tricks. Two years ago, as she was walking Bambie, she met a neighbor who had adopted through Muttville Senior Dog Rescue. She told Kumar about the nonprofit is cage-free rescue operation that gives senior dogs a “second chance at life.” The organization rescues about 1,000 dogs per year and runs mostly through the help of volunteers.“I know what it feels like to be left behind,” Kumar thought. “The dogs may be senior and old, but they are so friendly and cute. They are the most gentle and loyal creatures.”She enjoyed visiting the aging dogs at the rescue, but because she was 12 at the time, Kumar was five years too young to volunteer. The zealous girl would not let ageist rules stop her. Instead, she decided to raise money for the m, because, “You are never to young to start a business,” she said with a smile.:This Pizzeria Has Been Attaching Photos of Adoptable Shelter Animals to Their Delivery BoxesShe launched a pet sitting business calledPet Fairy Services—and it took off. With rates of $35 per day, Kumar raised an impressive $7,000 in two years—and she donated it all to Muttville. A matching grant through Intel, where her dad works, meant her donation ended up to pping $14,000. Even though the coronavirus pandemic has slowed things down for many nonprofits, the popularity of fostering and adopting dogs has skyrocketed.“It feels great to know that I have saved many dogs’ lives and given them another chance to enjoy life for their last years of living,” she told TODAY. “I feel like all dogs should get a forever home just like I did.”:6-Legged Puppy Given the Perfect Forever Home After She Was Adopted By Bullied Boy",2,2,Good News Network

Last night, USs Senator and giant pile of mammoth dung in the shape of a human being Josh Hawley learned that there would be some relatively minor push back for being an actual despot; Simon & Schuster canceled its contract to publish his book,, wherein Hawley planned to rant about social media companies being very mean to his fellow fascists. Simon & Schuster released thisstatement:https: //t.co/NdIkmGbCFI— Simon & Schuster (@Simon & Schuster)1610061880.0Josh Hawley, sage voice of reason that he is, maturely took the small setback in stride, accepted responsibility for his actions, andlolololololjk, he followed Dear Leader is command and took to Twitter, where he shot right back with ... something excruciatingly dumb, even for him. And we are talking about Josh Hawley, here, so that is saying something. My statement on the woke mob at @simonschuster https: //t.co/pDxtZvz5J0— Josh Hawley (@Josh Hawley)1610062940.0Here, let us transcribe that at you:This could not be more Orwellian. Simon & Schuster is canceling my contract because I was representing constituents, leading a debate on the Senate floor on voter integrity, which they have now decided to redefine as sedition. Let me be clear, this is not just a contract dispute. It is a direct assault on the First Amendment. Only approved speech can now be published. This is the Left looking to cancel everyone they do not approve of. I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have. We will see you in court.*GASP!* You mean a PUBLISHER has chosen to only publish certain works?! Who could ever have imagined such a thing?! It is almost like Simon & Schuster is a private company that is allowed to pick and choose what to publish in the manner it sees fit!Josh Hawley just loves him some free-market capitalism ... until he is negatively affected in any way. Then it is woke fascism. Clearly. And something something First Amendment. If he really believes a single word of this, he should ask Yale Law for his money back. The First Amendment does not entitle you to a book deal, Josh. In fact — and let is make this abundantly clear — the First Amendment does not entitle to a book deal. Shocking but true. The First Amendment, in fact, has absofuckinglutely NOTHING to do with Simon & Schuster, a private company, canceling someone is book deal. Weird, I know. But let is take a look, just to make sure! Here is the First Amendment, in full:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise the reof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Wow, unbelievably, the Foundersforget to include a clause saying Josh Hawley shall be entitled to book deals so he can whine about Nazis getting banned from Twitter. I do not know how they managed to leave that one out. The claim that ""this is not just a contract dispute"" and the addition of ""We will see you in court"" at the end is also just *chef is kiss*. This is the very definition of a contract dispute, asshole. Oh yeah, and like most post-Me Too contracts with major publishers, Hawley probably has amorality clause in his contract. I am just going to go ahead and say that inciting a violent mob to stage a putsch and even after that voting in the US Senate to declare Donald Trump dictator counts as ""moral turpitude.""You poop y twat. I am really fucking sick of how everyone assumes that people — especially white men, who are very skilled at failing up — with fancy degrees and credentials are smart. Kayleigh McEnany has a degree from Harvard Law. Ted Cruz has a degree from Harvard Law and clerked for Chief Justice WIlliam Rehnquist. Josh Hawley has a degree from Yale Law, which fancies itself even more prestigious than Harvard, and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. I am sorry, I do not care how many honorifics they have, these motherfuckers are no geniuses. But even Josh fucking Hawley, somewhere deep inside that thick skull of his,knows that losing his book deal has jack shit to do with the First Amendment. Trump is cult members, however, do not know that. And tyrants like Hawley are not about to let things like ""facts"" and ""law"" get in the way of a good grift. These psychopaths are his people! Who cares about things like ""integrity"" and ""ethics"" when there are tens of millions of brainwashed fools in our country to worship you and send you money?The US Capitol was overtaken by an armed mob, the speaker of the House is office was trashed and robbed, people literally pissed and shat all over the Capitol building itself, the lives of members of Congress were in serious danger, and five people actually did lose their lives. And still, Josh Hawley supported the insurrection. Now, he ca not accept that there may be even minor consequences for leading a failed coup. Fuck you, Josh. I ca not wait to read your complaint about how Simon & Schuster was VERY MEAN and FIRST AMENDMENT! I am sure it will be just as coherent as the Trump election lawsuits you supported. Maybe you can even get Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to represent you!Oh, and as for Hawley is claim that getting his book deal canceled is ""Orwellian""?RT @ScrewyDecimal: It is not Orwellian.

The impeachment vote onH Res. 27in the US House was 231-197 and largely along party lines, although 10 Republicans, including Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), joined Democrats in voting to approve the article of impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) presided as the vote was called. Impeachment proceedings will now head to the US Senate, which under the Constitution is a required to hold a trial, a process that will continue into the Biden administration. It will a take a vote of two-thirds of the members present to convict Trump, which may be in tall order in 50-50 Senate. Although Trump will be out of office, his impeachment and possible conviction represents a symbolic stand against his attack on the US Capitol and would bar him from holding federal office in the future. No other US president has been impeached twice. The only other presidents who have been impeached are Andrew Johnson and Bill Cinton.",2,1,Washington Blade

A society in which cops kill people because their license tags are expired? A society where, when a news anchor says, “We have breaking news about another mass shooting,” we are not even shocked anymore?Must we always respond the same old way, wringing our hands and promising that our thoughts and prayers will be with the victims and their families? Will we always follow up with a brief national discussion about gun legislation and police reform, and the n abandon the discussion after a week or two?Number This ca not be normal. It must not be normal. As a nation, we simply cannot keep going on like this, as though we were acting out the premise of the movie “Groundhog Day,” in which a man finds himself living the same day over and over again. We are not in a movie. We are not trapped by these atrocities. We are not incapable of doing some things to address them. We are not helpless. On the matter of guns -- as big a national hot-button issue as abortion -- we can start the conversation by refusing to engage in political hyperbole. It is possible, or should be, totalk about guns without claiming that strengthening gun laws is akin to dismantling the Second Amendment. It is also possible totalk about guns without labeling gun users as ignorant rednecks with a predilection for violence. And it is, or should be, possible for Congress to take some sensible steps to regulate gun ownership, including toughening background checks on would-be buyers and reinstating a federal ban on the manufacture or sale of certain assault weapons. Those measures would neither gut the Second Amendment nor keep Americans from owning guns for hunting, target shooting and personal protection. They might, however, keep psychologically unstable people from buying an assault-style weapon and the n, within a day or two, using it to shoot up a supermarket, massage parlor or FedEx center. Congress could also make more money available to mental health treatment centers in every state, in hopes of reaching people with counseling and medicine before they sink into a deep, dark hole where murder and suicide seem acceptable. As for police shootings, not every person pulled over by a law enforcement officer is innocent. Far from it. But all of us who are not dangerous felons -- black, white or brown, with or without outstanding warrants -- should expect to emerge alive from such encounters. Arrested, perhaps, or merely ticketed, but alive. As is the case when talking about gun control, when we talk about police shootings, we have to refuse to engage in political hyperbole. Talking about “defunding the police” and “no more policing” is foolish, pointless and distracting. America needs police departments made of up highly committed, well-trained, well-paid and well-educated men and women. It is disgraceful that many cities and counties pay their law enforcement officers so poorly that officers work second and third jobs to support their families. If Congress needs to step in with grant money to increase cops’ salaries, so be it. If we need a national commission to study and make recommendations about officers’ use of “reasonable force,” that is fine, to o; and if we need to find ways to change and improve the culture of local policing, the n let is do it. But for God is sake, let is stop turning on the TV to see regular reports of seemingly senseless or careless police-involved shootings. They make it hard for us to have confidence in our law enforcement communities, and they make it hard for good cops -- the officers who are first on the scene of disasters and catastrophes, who keep us safe and who deal with criminals so we do not have to -- to do their jobs with confidence, competence and dignity. Instead of only wringing our hands and offering our thoughts and prayers, let is also take some modest but concrete steps to reduce officer-involved shootings. And let is enact some reasonable gun regulations. In doing these things, maybe we can finally stop living out the fabled definition of insanity: “Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”Frances Coleman is a former editorial page editor of the Mobile Press-Register.

55,‘Boogaloo’ Believers Think a Civil War Is Coming. These Gun Firms Are Openly Marketing to Them.,-6.33,46.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/06/boogaloo-gun-ammunition-marketing-facebook-instagram/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-26,16,"In mid March, Fenix Ammunition, an ammunition manufacturer in Michigan, saw its daily online sales rise from$4,000 to $40,000. The coronavirus pandemic had boosted demand for guns and ammunition around the country, and Fenix was reaping the fruits of the national following it has cultivated since its 2016 launch. In addition to record high civilian demand, Fenix also counted at least three local police departments, a law enforcement training center, and KelTec, one of the leading rifle manufacturer sin America, among its clients. But Fenix is March profits were also driven by an aggressive social media campaign led by its owner, Justin Nazaroff. For months, Nazaroff had been posting mem es to his company is Facebook and Instagram pages referencing the “boogaloo,” slang for the armed uprising that a loose assortment of preppers, Second Amendment activists, and anti-government extremists is getting ready for — and in some cases trying to accelerate.“I will be honest, it drives sales,” Nazaroff said in April of his company is marketing practices. “People think it is funny. People click on boogaloo memes. It is something that gun people enjoy joking about.”“You can look up any firearms social media influencer and probably find them using the term boogaloo at some point in time,” he added. Nazaroff cut off communication after a police department notified him of our records request seeking information about sales to Fenix and em ails referencing boogaloo. The word itself is a reference to the 1984 movie, “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo,” but the imagined sequel would be a second civil war. Sometimes re-tooled as “big luau” or “big igloo” (adherents often don floral Hawaiian shirts or insignia bearing cartoon igloos), the concept reportedly originated on 4chan, the anonymous image board that is long been a meeting place for the alt-right. While some spreaders of boogaloo mem es claim to see them as provocative fun, their mushrooming popularity has concerned experts on extremism. They fear that the concept has re-energized the American militia movement and given anti-government extremists a rallying cry. Boogaloo is not a true movement in the sense that there is little — if any— structure or leadership. Adherents even seem to have different visions of what a civil war would accomplish. But to the extent that there is a central idea animating the boogaloo is largely white, right-wing supporters, it is that armed combatants will kick off a full-fledged rebellion to topple the federal government. “They do not have a lot of beliefs other than they really like guns, they really hate cops, and they want some sort of revolution,” said Megan Squire, a computer scientist who researches online extremism at Elon University. “You pretty much have to be weapons-trained and interested in weapons to be a boogaloo adherent.”In the past month, at least seven people with boogaloo ties have been arrested for attempting or carrying out violence at recent protests. On June 6, Air Force Sergeant Steve Carillo allegedly shot two Santa Cruz County Sheriff is deputies, killing one. He was arrested after scrawling the word “boog” in blood on the hood of a stolen car alongside phrases from mem es that are popular in boogaloo groups. Carillo was also charged with shooting two guards outside an Oakland, California, courthouse during protests a week earlier. One died. That morning, Carillo had posted to Facebook: “Go to the riots and support our own cause. Show them the real targets. Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.” A boogaloo patch was recovered from the van that he used that day. A suspected accomplice was also arrested after confessing to the FBI On the day of the Oakland shooting,three men were arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of possessing homemade explosives and on charges of conspiracy to commit an act of domestic terrorism near protests. Though they have since pleaded not guilty, the criminal complaint against them noted boogaloo ties. And, inSouth Carolina, two men with boogaloo connections were separately arrested on charges of looting and attempting to incite a riot. At least two more boogaloo supporters were arrested for the possession of illegal firearms inOklahomaandTennessee. InColorado, police seized multiple weapons from one boogaloo supporter at a protest, but did not make an arrest. On June 26, Attorney General William Barr created a task force aimed at fighting extremism, and in a memo he singled out boogaloo supporters, as well as members of the left-leaning antifa. Even before the protests, several boogaloo supporters had attempted to incite violence. In March, a Missouri man who planned to bomb a hospital in what he called “operation boogaloo” shot and killed himself before he could be arrested by the FBI In April, a member of several boogaloo Facebook groups was arrested in Texas, live streaming as he searched for police to kill.“Boogaloo boys,” as they call the mselves, have been spotted at protests following the killing of George Floyd, both marching with demonstrators and as counter-protesters. Some have also been discussing how to use the protests to encourage violence. The varied response is indicative of supporters’ lack of a unifying ideology. Their fixation on guns and tactical gear makes boogaloo supporters attractive clients for gun sellers. And hash tagged social media posts are an effective way for weapons dealers to boost their brands. Firearms sellers are not allowed to purchase ads on Facebook, though some have found ways around this, but they can use their official pages to reach niche audiences. When COVID-19 lock downs seemed to validate adherents’ expectations of government overreach, use of the term boogaloo exploded on mainstream social media sites like Facebook and Reddit. In April, the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that monitors activity on major online platforms, documented 125 boogaloo Facebook groups with over 72,000 members. More than 60 percent had been created since February — the same time that Fenix is use of boogaloo-related hash tags peaked, according to data from the company is Instagram page. Around the same time, a review posted on Fenix is Facebook page revealed that the company was sending stickers to online customers that featured the “boogaloo flag,” a black and white American flag with a floral Hawaiian stripe and a cartoon igloo instead of stars. When contacted, the reviewer said he had found the company by searching for competition-grade ammunition, and that the sticker helped cement his loyalty to Fenix. A December 19, 2019, post on Fenix is Instagram page, which has nearly 34,000 followers, shows the Sesame Street character Cookie Monster photos hopped so that he is holding an AR-15 and wearing night-vision goggles. “B is for Boogaloo” is written over the bright yellow background. “And V is for Virginia,” read Fenix is caption, which went on to offer “free shipping on ammunition, body armor and medical products” sent to the state. The offer lasted through a January 20 rally to oppose new gun laws, one that sparked a state of emergency order from Governor Ralph Northam as armed militia sand white nationalist groups implored their members to attend the demonstration. In the days before the rally, members of a neo-Nazi group calledThe Basewere arrested after federal agents said two of them discussed opening fire on the rally. An FBI affidavit claimed the group wanted to use the event to start the boogaloo, which some neo-Nazis see as a race war or civilizational collapse. There is no evidence that The Base acquired ammo from Fenix, and on June 25, Fenix posted on Instagram about our reporting, writing: “Our company wants nothing to do with anyone claiming to be a Nazi, or a white supremacist. We have banned people from our page for saying such things in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. The Boogaloo is for everyone. “Since October 2019, Fenix has made over 100 posts using hash tags and imagery related to the boogaloo. Many were linked to events like the Virginia rally, national anti-lockdown demonstrations, and recent anti-racism protests. “This is what the politicians and media fear the most” read a June 5 post showing a diverse group of protesters holding a boogaloo flag on a city street. In another post, Fenix responded to a suggestion that looters target white neighborhoods, like Novi, Michigan, the Detroit suburb where Fenix is located. The response included a picture of four high-powered guns with the comment “send bachelors.”The Trace has identified 35 more dealers and manufacturers of firearms or tactical supplies across the country that have posted references to the boogaloo on social media. They range from small town stores to multi-million dollar manufacturers of AR-style weapons, like the South Carolina-based Palmetto State Armory. We also reviewed the online presence of 548 federally licensed firearms dealers in Michigan,where armed protesters converged on the state Capitol, and identified 48 with active social media profiles. Six of those posted mem es or hash tags referencing the boogaloo. Eight promoted insignia from militia groups like the Three Percenters, an armed anti-government group with chapters around the country. Another six promoted coronavirus conspiracy the ories or encouraged disobedience against state lock down measures. Three made suggestive posts about shooting looters during the protestsInstagram no longer allows searches for #boogaloo and some related hash tags on its site. However, as of June 24, if you typed #boogaloo into the search bar, it still auto filled suggestions of related hashtags. After being asked about this by The Trace, a spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram and has been criticized for its failure to rein in boogaloo content, said, “The hasht ag #boogaloomemes was already blocked and we have since further blocked #boogalooboys, #boogaloocrew, and #boogalootime given the amount of content using these hash tags that violated our policy.”The spokesperson added, “we continue to remove content using boogaloo and related terms when accompanied by statements and images depicting armed violence. We are also preventing these pages and groups from being recommended on Facebook.”Boogaloo marketing is not limited to social media. Some companies, like Fenix, sell boogaloo-themed merchandise. For instance, in February, Palmetto State Armory sold a limited run of custom boogaloo-themed AK-47-style guns, finished with Hawaiian patterns, mimicking the shirts boogaloo supporters have adopted as an unofficial uniform. They also advertise boogaloo T-shirts on Facebook. Palmetto State Armory CEO Jamin McCallum did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Hoplite Armor, a body armor manufacturer in Kalispell, Montana, sells a Hawaiian-patterned plate carrier — a kind of bullet-proof vest — as a part of its “Aloha Line” of products. The traditional flowers have been replaced with a blood-stained bauhiniaflower, which adorns the Hong Kong flag frequently carried by protesters there. During an interview, Hoplite is owner, Lyman Bishop, said he was inspired to make the shirt on a trip to Hawaii, and not because of the boogaloo. Yet a September 27, 2019 Facebook post introducing the plate carrier was tagged with #boogaloo. The company is page, with more than 142,000 followers, has continued to use the hasht ag as well as associated language and imagery. Bishop is currently a long-shot candidate for governor of Montana on the Libertarian Party ticket, running on an apocalyptic platform that suggests violent secession. In spite of significant anti-police sentiment among boogaloo boys, Fenix is web site lists four Michigan police departments as major clients, as well as the law enforcement training center at Schoolcraft College. Records from police departments in the small cities ofDowagiacandBerkleyshowed receipts from Fenix totaling $4,899 and $18,076, respectively, since 2017. The Grosse Ile Police Department confirmed that it had records of purchases, but has yet to release them. The Northville Police Department denied buying ammunition from Fenix, and a records request returned no receipts from the company. The Schoolcraft training center confirmed it had purchased ammo from Fenix, but refused to say how much. All of the organizations said they had no knowledge of Fenix is support for boogaloo, and do not have policies on checking suppliers’ social media accounts. Fenix is social media posts have been largely pro-police, sprinkled with some criticism of police brutality, including the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. Interviews with firearms dealers revealed a host of reasons for posting about the boogaloo or selling related merchandise. Chris David, the owner of Route 6 Guns, a small shop in Torrington, Connecticut, said that he posts about boogaloo for his company is 650-odd followers because he believes in the movement is libertarian messaging. “It is a lot more mainstream than I think people give the movement credit for because of the portrayal that it is just this group of people that have these violent intentions, which is just not the case,” said David. David successfully lobbied for a spot on a list of pro-boogaloo companies in one of Facebook is largest boogaloo groups, which, as of June 8, no longer appears in Facebook searches. It is unclear whether this is because the group was made secret or if it was taken down by Facebook. All five firearms and armor dealers that agreed to be interviewed for this story denied that their posts should be interpreted as calls to violence. Nazaroff likened spreading the mem es to being an ammunition seller: He said he is aware of the possibility that his product may be used in violent crimes against innocent people. “That is the nature of the product,” Nazaroff said. “There is nothing to be done about that. It does not mean that my company should not exist.”“It is literally an internet joke. It is like ‘Harambe,’” said Dimitri Karras of Firearms Unknown, which sells “ghost guns,” unserialized but legal firearm parts that can be assembled by customers at home. “I am a Marine who is fought in two wars. I have a dark sense of humor. That is just who I am.”The use of humor to cover up intentions or shift the boundaries of acceptable discourse has a history in the alt right. In 2017, The Huffington Post published excerpts from the style guide for the Daily Stormer, one of the largest white supremacist websites, instructing supporters to employ jokes instead of screeds, noting that the latter may be a “turnoff” to potential converts. “The reader is at first drawn in by curiosity or the naughty humor,” it stated, “and is slowly awakened to reality by repeatedly reading the same points.” According to historian Elaine Frantz Parsons, the use of hu moras a way to destigmatize extremist ideologies dates back at least to the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. Whether the inflammatory mem es that boogaloo supporters share reflect their true beliefs can be hard to pin down — and some experts say that is by design. Nazaroff, for instance, said he considers himself a liberal libertarian and boogaloo “prepper.” He believes in the possibility of civil war, but like other arms dealers interviewed for this story, stressed that the mem es should not be taken seriously. But Cassie Miller, a researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said: “They pretend that it is a joke.

56,GOP Proposes Letting Fossil Fuel Firms Sue Sick Workers Seeking Compensation,-15.83,35.0,https://truthout.org/articles/gop-proposes-letting-fossil-fuel-firms-sue-sick-workers-seeking-compensation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Fossil fuel firms have long argued that addressing climate change will kill jobs — but the main entities killing oil and gas jobs lately have been fossil fuel firms. Rather than save jobs, oil firms have lined executive pockets just before declaring bankruptcy, and announced layoffs rather than cut into shareholder profits. Some oil workers are even dying on the job — and instead of increasing safety and transparency, oil companies have pushed Congress to make it impossible for workers and families to sue if they get sick due to unsafe conditions. We have seen this pattern before with the coal industry, which has long fought efforts to fund benefits to workers who contracted “black lung” in mines. Now, it is oil and gas firms that are putting profits ahead of the lives of their own workers. For years, one of the main selling points that oil firms used to lure investors was the amount of dividends they pay to shareholders. Exxon is a case in point: It has raised its dividend 37 years in a row, paying out more than $14 billion in cash dividend payments to its shareholders in 2019. But facing a $2.63 billion loss in the second quarter, Exxon decided to lay off workers rather than cut its shareholder dividend. For workers who manage to survive the layoffs, Exxon will be ending its employer match to workers’ retirement savings plans — a common benefit at major corporations where the firm matches any contributions a worker makes to their 401(k). This comes despite the implicit support Exxon has received from the Federal Reserve. The Fed has been leveraging $75 billion in public money provided by the CARES Act 10-to-1, allowing them to purchase up to $750 million in corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds through two new programs. The Fed has purchased nearly $300 million in debt from energy and utility companies — drawing scrutiny from 70 environmental and economic justice groups, who have asked the Fed to end these purchases. The Fed is purchases include $9 million worth of Exxon is corporate bonds. But the central bank will not be telling Exxon to save workers’ jobs: Congress and the Fed both failed to create any binding requirements that companies benefiting from these programs retain their workers. The response of fossil fuel firms and the Trump administration alike to the potentially lethal working conditions for oil and gas workers has been to bury the data and prevent workers from suing. Many oil producers have struggled with a decade of bad bets that were compounded by the spring plunge in oil prices. But that has not stopped them from pushing money out the door to their executives right before they collapse. Last week, the oil and gas drilling firm Noble Corp, which employs 1,600 workers, filed for bankruptcy. Only weeks prior, Noble Corp decided to pay all of its executives their full bonus for 2020, including a $4.2 million pay package for its CEO Noble Corp is hardly the first oil and gas firm to make sure its executives got their bonuses just before the company crumbled. Chesapeake Energy, struggling with $9 billion in debt amid crashing oil prices, decided in May to pre-pay 21 executives $25 million in bonuses to ensure they stayed motivated. By the end of June, they were bankrupt. Further, both Whiting Petroleum and Extraction Oil & Gas gave their executives millions in bonuses a mere week before going bankrupt — Whiting Petroleum executives nabbed $14.6 million in cash bonuses and Extraction executives pocketed $6.7 million. The response of fossil fuel firms and the Trump administration alike to the potentially lethal working conditions for oil and gas workers has been to bury the data and prevent workers from suing. Fossil fuel giants like ConocoPhillips and Exxon lobbied Congress to grant them legal immunity should their workers get sick, as documented by Friends of the Earth. The liability shield proposed by Senate Republicans even allows firms to sue their own workers should they try and seek recompense if they get sick. The liability shield proposed by Senate Republicans even allows firms to sue their own workers should they try and seek recompense if they get sick. This comes as reporting indicates offshore oil rigs may be hotbeds for the virus. On April 8, the Coast Guard reported that at least 26 workers on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico had tested positive for COVID-19. Since the n, the count has gone dark as the Trump administration refused to disclose new case numbers. But the problem appears bleak based on numbers coming out of Mexico where 202 employees and five contractors have died of coronavirus at the state-owned oil producer Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) — the highest coronavirus death rate of any company in the world, according to Bloomberg. Pemex has been disclosing coronavirus deaths on a daily basis. By contrast, ExxonMobil has declined to report any information at all about the death of its workers due to coronavirus. Fossil fuel firms are sacrificing their workers’ jobs and safety for profits. The sector ca not blame the pandemic for its troubles, as its troubles predate coronavirus. By rewarding executives just before bankruptcy, slashing jobs to please investors and pushing for immunity even if they endanger their workers, these firms are proving the mselves to be the real job killers. With the Fed is ongoing purchase of fossil fuel firms’ debt, the public itself is an unwilling enabler of the sector is approach of pursuing profits, no matter the cost.",1,1,Truthout

Citing violations of voting and election laws, representatives of the Brennan Center for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Protect Democracy urged the Department of Justice to protect ballots and prevent voter intimidation.""Ballots that are protected under federal law are in imminent danger of being stolen, defaced, or irretrievably damaged, and Arizona citizens are in imminent danger of being subject to unlawful voter intimidation,"" the four security specialists wrote in the April 29 letter. The Senate and private contractors hired to conduct the recount failed to ensure the physical security of ballots by keeping doors unlocked and allowing unauthorized persons to access the ballot storage facility at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the specialists wrote.""We believe that the Senate and its agents ... are violating their duty under federal law to retain and preserve ballots cast in a federal election,"" the specialists wrote. ""They also risk compromising the integrity of the ballots the mselves, using materials and technologies that will cause the ballot paper and marks to deteriorate.""Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward lashed out at the request Friday on YouTube, saying it was a Democratic Party-led effort to derail the audit and wrest control of the election from state officials.""Arizona is off limits to the federal government trampling on our constitutional rights and our sovereignty,"" Ward said. ""When it comes to managing our own election, we believe in the US Constitution.""Ward, who has promoted baseless conspiracy the ories that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former president Donald Trump, has championed the audit as a way to ensure election integrity in Arizona.""We also do not want or need partisan attack dogs like the Brennan Center or Protect Democracy coming in to observe or interfere or undermine our elections and the Arizona State Senate Audit,"" Ward said. ""But they are coming with their lawyers, with their money and with their agenda to attempt to derail this full forensic audit that is being done by qualified experts.""She called the groups ""aggressive and dirty players"" who are ""working with BLM (Black Lives Matter) and Marxist groups to literally destroy our nation.""The letter to the DOJ was signed byWendy WeiserandHannah Klainat the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law;Wade Henderson, CEO at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; andGenevieve Nadeau, counsel at Protect Democracy. The letter is addressed to Chris Herren, chief of the voting section of the Department of Justice is Civil Rights Division. The election specialists warned that Cyber Ninjas, the Florida firm hired to lead the $150,000 audit,planned to knock on the doors of Maricopa County voter sand collect information related to voter history.""We are concerned ... the Senate and its agents are preparing to engage in conduct that will constitute unlawful voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws,"" the election specialists wrote. Cyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan is a Trump supporter who has pushed unfounded election fraud claims as part of the ""Stop the Steal"" movement. Logan told reporters last week he would not touch any ballots. But former Arizona State lawmaker Anthony Kern, who stumped at ""Stop the Steal"" rallies and was at the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, has been been helping to count ballots for the audit. The Arizona Republic has twice documented Kern is activities at the coliseum since the audit began eight days ago. About 100,000 ballots had been counted as of Wednesday, when officials gave the last audit update. The audit is scheduled to end May 14, but Senate liaison Ken Bennett indicated it could be extended. Whatever the outcome, the audit will not change election results. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris carried Arizona by 10,457 votes, the narrowest margin of any state in the country. The results were certified by Governor Doug Ducey, the secretary of state and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. County officials hand-counted a statistically significant sampling of ballots and conducted two logic and accuracy tests of voting machines. The audit showed votes were counted with 100% accuracy. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs reiterated concerns Friday about the reliability of the audit and noted that it took a court order to force Cyber Ninjas to release its audit procedures, which the company maintained were proprietary.""It should not be a surprise that a company that has neither election experience nor auditing experience is not following some of the basic industry standards and best practices,"" Hobbs said in a statement. Ward, in her YouTube video, called Hobbs a ""Democrat hack"" and blamed her for the DOJ request. Ward said a court agreement already allowed Hobbs to have observers at the coliseum.""She is bringing the feds in where they have absolutely no business,"" Ward said. ""All of this is an insult to Arizona voters.""Ward said two of the three observers representing Hobbs were an election consultant with Protect Democracy and an attorney with the Brennan Center.""So, rather than officials of the Secretary of State is Office on the floor, we have two of the most notorious DC Democrat players on the floor representing Arizona voters by way of an elected official,"" Ward said.

But Hunter Biden will not have discussions about art sales at those events, White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed.“He is not—those discussions will be happening with the gallerist,” Psaki told reporters in Washington. Asked how the administration could guarantee that, Psaki could not provide an answer. Will there be anything stopping a prospective buyer from telling Hunter Biden that they plan to buy a piece? “He will not know, we will not know who purchases his art,” Psaki said. He accused Psaki of deflecting when asked about possible buyers telling Hunter Biden they'd buy his art.“The response? She deflects, saying Hunter will not know who the buyers are, the n jumps to another reporter. They have no answer,” Shaub wrote on Twitter.“The secrecy agreement was designed to keep one group of people from knowing who buys Hunter Biden is art: The public. There is no mechanism for monitoring, no mechanism for notifying the public if confidentiality is broken, no mechanism for tracking if buyers get access to [government],” he added. The arrangement, according to the White House and the Georges Berges Gallery, will see the gallery handle the sales while shielding the identities of the buyers from both Biden administration officials and Hunter Biden. Experts have expressed concern about buyers trying to curry favor with the Biden administration and have said the identities should be made public. Jerry Saltz, an art critic at New York Magazine also weighed in, envisioning a scenario former President Donald Trump is son Donald Trump Jr. was selling pieces of art while his father was president.“Imagine all the foreign agents, fishy businessmen, lobbyists, politicos buying the work & back room deals. The potential for conflict of interest is enormous & dangerous,” Saltz wrote on social media. The specific mechanisms of the arrangement have not been made public and the gallery has not responded to emailed questions. Persons who have answered the phone there have declined to comment. During the briefing Friday, a reporter later wondered about specific procedures that are in place to make sure conversations at the gallery events do not touch on sales.“I think it is certainly a commitment that has been made by all parties involved. He is not involved in the sale or discussions about the sale of his art. And he will not be informed of the sale and who is purchasing that art,” Psaki answered. “That is a commitment that is been made, and we expect that all parties would abide by it.”",1,0,Epoch Times

This process can be reduced to basic triage, but some newsrooms are prio rit izing narrative reporting as a service. In 2018, Lyndsey Gilpin launchedSoutherly Magazine, an independent regional publication aimed at ecology, justice, and reframing the coverage of the American South. “Communities—whether they are rural, or communities of color, or low-wealth—deserve both accurate information and beautiful storytelling that they can see the mselves in,” Gilpin says. “The industry underestimates how much people understand and appreciate good storytelling. Loving stories is an inherent human trait.”“Magazines are able to capture the gray areas, the fact that everything is perfectly imperfect,” says Robert Sanchez, a senior staff writer at5280Magazinein Denver. When the pandemic hit the US last March, he started a Twitter account called City Reads to highlight excellence in local magazine reporting across the country. “Good journalism is good journalism. You do not have to work atEsquire; the re is great journalism being done in Charlotte.”Still, the traditional magazine model is largely built upon exclusivity. It is limited by the same conundrum that wracks the industry as a whole: reporting requires resources. And it is not always enough to produce a good story.“No matter how much beautiful journalism I put onSoutherly iswebsite, if it does not reach people, what is the point?” Gilpin asks. “I have found myself backing up to consider what models we can use to actually get to the people we are trying to reach. When we talk to people living in their news deserts, they just need basic information. How do I contact FEMA? What do I need to do for the next hurricane season? How do I test my water?Those are questions that—eventually—could lend the mselves to a powerful story. The most immediate need is answering the m, and that is not as sexy. But once that trust is built and you are answering the basic questions, you can really dig into storytelling. Communities deserve really beautiful, informative, thorough stories.”In some ways, nonprofit newsrooms are uniquely positioned to direct resources toward deeply-reported stories. ForTHE CITY, a New York City-based nonprofit local newsroom,Claudia Irizarry Aponte and Josefa Velasquez wrote 3,500 words in December on Los Deliveristas Unidos, a group of indigenous Guatemalan and Mexican food delivery workers organizing for better treatment. While reporting the story, Irizarry Aponte says, the reporters were mindful of both their framing and their audience, which she sees as a group beyond “the pundit class” that includes “all working New Yorkers.”“We strive to do stories that really highlight people is ingenuity,” Irizarry Aponte says. “The workers in this story are not helpless. They are not voiceless. They are very active politically. They are incredibly aware of the forces that are shaping their lives. And they are acting against them.”The story took off. THE CITY is metrics indicated that readers not only clicked on the story; people really read it, in significant numbers. “I think often in local reporting, people think that the audience has a really short attention span,” Irizarry Aponte says. “This shows that people are hungry for stories that are embedded in the community, that really flesh out all the angles of an issue. People do want to read three-thousand-word stories about delivery workers in New York City. Absolutely.”As local journalism considers what to preserve and what to leave behind, it is worth considering how to build a sustainable model for stories that are deeply-reported, worthwhile––and, yes, beautiful. People are hungry for these stories. They should be available everywhere, and they should reflect everyone. Factual reporting matters; so does compelling narrative.

63,Here is Everything to Know about Current Gun Control Legislation Efforts,-17.33,41.67,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36155972/gun-control-leglislation-austin-shooting/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-18,23,"In an appearance on CNN ison Sunday, public health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci spoke about the current epidemic attacking the USs. No, not that one; the other one. “When you see people getting killed, in this last month it is just been horrifying what is happened. How can you say that is not a public health issue?"" said Fauci when asked by host Dana Bash if gun violence was a public health emergency. Fauci is comments came days after a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility left nine people dead, including the shooter, and only hours after a gunman opened fire outside of a bar in Kenosha, Wisconsin, killing three and injuring two. Later on Sunday afternoon, a shooter in Austin, Texas opened fire and killed three civilians. For those who are counting, that is six innocent Americans dead within 24 hours in two separate shootings. It is no wonder President Biden recently called America is woefully predictable pattern of mass shootings “a national embarrassment” and urged Congress to take action. At the same time, the President does not appear to be holding his breath. After the shooting in Boulder, Colorado, he announced a series of executive orders meant to begin the process of tackling gun violence in America. One of the most significant orders calls for a two-month review of homemade “ghost guns” which experts say will likely lead to a ban. Ghost guns are handmade fire guns that can either be assembled from a kit or 3-D printed. Because they do not come with a serial number, the federal government has no way to trace them. Another important order deals directly with a weapon accessory used by the Boulder shooter known as a pistol-stabilizing brace. Stabilizers effectively turn a standard pistol into a deadlier and more accurate short-barreled rifle. Biden is order will require pistols with stabilizers to be registered with the federal government and force buyers to go through a more rigorous application process. “There is no reason someone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets, that can be fired from that weapon,”Biden said while discussing the executive orders last Thursday. “Nobody needs that.”The president also announced his intentions to strengthen the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency in charge of enforcing federal gun laws, by nominating gun control advocate, David Chapman, to lead it. The notoriously beleaguered agency has not had a director since 2015. If confirmed by the Senate, Chapman would be a reliable partner who Biden could count on to enforce new gun control legislation. These steps, though narrow in scope, indicate that Biden is willing to bypass Congress if and when it fails to take action. For the most part, executive orders can only be used to direct current legislation. They cannot create it. For better or worse, the power of lawmaking belongs to Congress. That is why the NRA and the gun lobby have poured billions of dollars into congressional races for decades. But with the NRA now bankrupt and the Democrats in control of Congress, some lawmakers sense a renewed opportunity to pass meaningful gun control legislation. In fact, the House of Representatives has already voted in favor of two significant bills. The first measure expands background checks to include those purchasing weapons over the internet and at gun shows. Currently, neither type of purchase requires vetting. In-store purchases, which account for the majority of gun sales, require a routine background check. Eight Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the legislation. The second bill grants authorities 10 business days to complete federal background checks before a gun sale must be licensed. Currently, sales can proceed if the government fails to complete a background check of a prospective buyer within three days. Only two Republicans voted for the legislation. Gettings bills passed in the House is the easy part. The real hurdle is the Senate. That is where gun control legislation has historically fallen apart. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said this time will be different and vowed to bring the bills to a vote. For the bills to pass in their current form, Senator Schumer would have to secure 10 votes from Republican senators and also convince Senator Manchin (D-WV) to vote for them. There is virtually no chance of that happening. Senator Manchin already told reporters he opposes the legislation. That means for any legislation to make its way to President Biden is desk for signing, congress will have to engage in a process they are criminally bad at: negotiation. For what it is worth, minority leader Mitch McConnell said he was open to the discussion of gun control but opposed the House legislation. Meanwhile, nearlytwo-thirds of Americanssupport stricter gun laws and over80 percent support universal background checks. All of this begs the question: What kind of reforms are Republicans open to and how many more Americans must die before they finally propose a solution?Abigail Covington is a journalist and cultural critic based in Brooklyn, New York but originally from North Carolina, whose work has appeared in Slate,,Oxford American, and Pitchfork",1,0,Esquire

The Biden administration described such policies as cruel, and has instead blamed ""root causes"" like poverty, climate change and violence in Central America for the surge. It has focused on more efficiently processing migrants and releasing them into the interior, while still returning single adults via the Trump-era Title 42. The New York Postreported that the four bus companies that operate out of McAllen is central bus station are struggling to keep up with business due to the number of illegal immigrants being released into the US City Manager Roy Rodriguez told The Post that demand for tickets was at a ""record"" high"" with most of the increase coming from migrants who had come into the country illegally -- leading to delays.

66,So you have two passports—do you know how to use them?,-2.0,41.0,https://qz.com/1592529/how-to-travel-with-two-passports/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,25,"Traveling with more than one passport in your pocket always comes with a spy thriller novel-like allure. But it is also confusing. After all, a passport is not just a movie ticket that grants you entry; it establishes your ongoing right to visit, live in, or work in a country. A dual or triple citizen needs to make sure their movements do not peeve the authorities of the countries they visit. Dominic Volek is a man who knows a lot about passports. He is a managing partner at Henley & Partners, an investment migration firm that advises high-net-worth individuals on the numerous residence and citizenship-by-investment programs around the world. He estimates that up to 80% of the firm is clientele are seeking a second passport in order to get visa-free access to a broader range of countries. (For example, passports from Cyprus and Malta are particularly appealing, as they provide investors with an alternative citizenship or residency in an EU member state, while Grenada and Moldova allow investors visa-free access to the Schengen area.)However, he says for all the money and red tape clients wade through, the actual logistics of moving through airports once a client gets their second little blue, red, or green book rarely comes up. “What always surprises me is how few of our clients actually ask the question: How do I use this now that I have it? I would say probably only 10% of our clients actually [ask that].”So, the first question you need to ask yourself when traveling with two passports is simple: Are both of those countries cool with you being a national of somewhere else? If they are not, the n traveling with multiple passports is a more high-risk endeavor—one that could get your passport revoked. The good news is that two thirds of the world is nations already grant this right (high-income nations are more likely to do so) and Volek notes the global trend over the past few years is that more and more countries are seeing the benefit of allowing multiple citizenships. The second thing to keep in mind is “the golden rule,” as Volek put it: “As long as you are entering and exiting the same country with the same passport, the n you are fine.” That means the immigration officials of the country you are visiting (or living in) should only know you by one of your passports per trip. He is right, of course, but there are some caveats. The first caveat is what you do at the airline desk. An airline cares about one thing and one thing only: Do you have authorization to enter the destination country they are flying you to? If you do not, the n they are liable to pay to transport you back to where you came from (which they want to avoid). Volek illustrated with an example: Let is say you are a South African citizen living in Singapore on a visa that is linked to your South African passport. Let is also say you have a UK passport. If you are flying from Singapore to the UK, you will need to check in with the airline using with your UK passport. (If you tried to check in with your South African one, you’d be asked for a UK visa). However, once you move past the check-in desk and you come face to face with Singaporean immigration officials, you need to show them your South African passport, which contains the visa which grants you the right to be in that country. When you arrive in the UK, you enter on your UK passport. The second caveat has to do with that immigration check. Confusingly, despite having relatively hard line stances towards immigration, the UK and the US are two of just a handful of countries in the world that do not have physical immigration checks when you depart. So even if you wanted to flash the same passport you used to enter the country to leave it, no one will directly ask you to. (Remember, the airline will only ask for the passport that affords you access to the country they are flying you to, not the one that grants you the right to be in the country you are leaving.) This can be confusing for travelers, who may feel they have no proof (in the form of a passport stamp) which shows they did not overstay a visa. However, just because some countries do not have “boots on the ground” checks, that does not mean officials are not aware you are leaving the country. Airlines share their flight manifests with authorities before they take off—as do operators of sea, ferry, or rail journeys—so even if no one ever asked you to flash your passport, they know you left. A Customs Border Patrol official also confirmed for Quartz that officials know about your second passport; that is why passport applications generally ask you if you possess a passport of another nation. So rest assured: They know you are gone, with both your passports in to w. In summary, says Volek, there are two main scenarios where people need to be cautious about which passport to use. The first is the type that is likely to affect one of his clients: people who have one passport that is much weaker than the other. This traveler needs to make sure she is traveling on the stronger passport that grants her visa-free access to the country she is visiting. The other scenario is a question of citizenship and residency. You want to make sure you are entering the country you live and work in on the passport that grants you the right to do that, even if you could theoretically enter visa-free or visa-on-arrival with your alternative passport. (It is worth noting thatUS law requires that citizens who are entering or leaving the US “bear a valid USs passport”—even if they do not live or work there anymore. However, a change in the law that went into effect in 1979eliminated the penalties for this.)While the second scenario may seem like common sense, it would be easy to assume, say, that if you lost your UK passport or it was going to expire two days before a flight, it’d be fine to enter the UK on your US passport (which would allow you visa-free access anyway). However, Volek says it is best to avoid that. That said, it is also best practice to always travel with both your passports in your possession. Despite the lingering perception that traveling with two passports is dodgy, it is not. As long as you are a citizen of two nations that allow it, you have got nothing to hide.

You doubtless have heard that question more than once during the 2020 presidential campaign, post-election drama, and the early days of the Biden administration. Thepresumptionbehind this inquiry has always been,s otto voce, that of course he could not be making his own decisions, they are being made for him, by some person or persons hidden behind the curtain. And Joe Biden has heard the chatter too – the talk that he is an empty suit, controlled by others, transparently in decline, not the man he once was. A marionette manipulated by undisclosed power brokers, likely intent on little more than refilling his oh-so-familiar establishment Swamp which was drained by Trump. What, you thought his aides and family, who for months kept him more hidden than a down-on-his-luck shut-in, were able to block it all out for him? Okay, that is a rhetorical question, but the new president is style of leadership so far may actually reveal his own pointed reaction to the notion that he is in way over his head. Biden is term, if continued on its present course, would be viewed by objective historians as an imperial presidency – for one simple reason. He has handed down edicts from on high, requiring only his command, at a record pace. Most of his more than 40 executive orders have been aimed at sanitizing the presidency of Trump and demonstrating to the left that he can keep them at least satisfied if not overjoyed. We have postulated here onthat, while both of these objectives were highly predictable, the record-shatteringof executive orders immediately upon taking office would suggest a man who knows his time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue may be limited. But there may well be yet another motivation. Ask yourself how you would react to the widespread notion that you are addled, unable to make decisions, essentially incapacitated to a point perhaps short of panic but beyond mere concern. Would you send out the signal that, yes, I really am pretty weak so I will go ahead and let Vice President Harris and congressional leaders play an enlarged role while I recede into the background, the stick figure I have been depicted as by my detractors? Or would you say hell yeah I am my own man, and I am as capable as ever of setting my own agenda and making my own decisions – whether you are or not? And would not the best way to achieve that objective be to grab the (carefully set) stage with all manner of early moves requiring only the stroke of your pen – and certain to get major play in the friendly media – while keeping the VP and others who seek to control you at a comfortable distance?This does not answer the question of who might or might not be exercising outsized influence on this president. As a political lifer and admitted transitional figure – in every way the reverse image of Donald Trump – President Biden understands that the battle to succeed him started the day he was proclaimed president for the one term he is likely to serve, in whole or in part. However, that this president appears laser-focused on removing doubts about his competence at least adds to our limited understanding of the current state of mind of a chief executive who was kept more distant from the voters than any presidential nominee in modern American history. Could it be that Joe Biden is extraordinarily swift, unilateral, and voluminous decrees are not only his way of leaving his footprints in the sand, but also a desperate attempt to transmit the message that the person who is pulling his puppet strings is … the president himself?This article originally appeared on Liberty Nation.

But what is news, is the Biden administration is efforts to play nice with the terror-backing country and its leaders despite knowing what easing sanctions on Iran means for the safety of Israel, America, and others.

72,An Abolitionist Approach To Addressing Sexual Violence Without Police,-12.8,41.4,https://shadowproof.com/2020/07/15/community-organizers-address-sexual-violence-without-the-criminal-justice-system/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-15,22,"When college student L. saw photos of her feet in a boy is Snapchat, she felt scared. She had never consented to those photos being taken, let alone shared on a Snapchat account, where the boy was constructing a romantic narrative for both of them without her knowledge or permission. L. is friends were furious on her behalf, threatening to beat up the boy who hurt her. When L. realized the situation might devolve into physical violence, she approached Jasmyn Elise Story is organization and requested a restorative justice process (locations for this story have been kept purposefully vague for the anonymity of the involved parties). Story, an international restorative justice practitioner and the founder ofThe People is Coalition, started the process of alternative justice—one that does not require the involvement of police or the criminal justice system but does require a commitment to accountability—through pre-conferencing with the victim and the boy who harmed her separately.“Pre-conferencing are the meetings that occur prior to any restorative process before we get to the actual dialogue about how we are going to move forward,” according to Story, who has worked as a restorative justice practitioner since 2014. “We practice and we meet and we work through that conversation ahead of time.”L. was concerned about the boy is safety, but she also wanted to make sure the boy knew how much she hurt and scared her. Pre-conferencing asks participants to answer five restorative questions that confront the harm caused: What happened? What were you thinking at the time? What have you thought about since? Who is been impacted and how?“The first step [to this kind of process] is to hear the survivor, hear their needs—and that does not necessarily mean that we are doing a deep dive in their narrative and their story—but to understand what they are seeking and what does justice look like for the m, and why they are looking for this particular process,” Story added. After both students had gone through pre-conferencing, L. was told that she had options for moving forward. She could meet face-to-face with him, there could be a letter-writing process, or she could request time and treatment before the conferencing section of the process, where victim and harm-doer dialogue with each other.“As a practitioner, I am focused on what the survivor is going to need to be able to show up fully in the process that they choose, if it is a face-to-face process, if it is a circle process, if it is a letter-writing process. My job is to figure out what they need to move forward and be able to participate,” Story shared. The process can be customizable to make the survivor comfortable, Story said. The survivor might need time or mental health support, or they might request the harm-doer go through therapy or substance abuse treatment before the conference, depending on what the harm was and the needs of the survivor. In L. is case, she decided she did not want to speak to the harm-doer face-to-face and requested that Story brought her answers to the restorative questions to him.“What came out was that he wanted people at home to think he had a girlfriend, and he was not even thinking about the fact that taking pictures without consent, sharing them on the internet without consent, building a narrative that is untrue without consent, is something that is terrifying. But this absolutely did not cross this student is mind, and I would say that there were social cues that the student missed,” Story said.“Once this was clarified, the student was willing to be fully accountable to this, and he deeply understood that the extension of this process [to him] was really something he needed to be deeply grateful for as well because part of why this was being brought to us was fear of violence against this young man that the survivor could not handle being done in her name.”The process ended up being really positive; the harm-doer took responsibility and made the adjustments that were requested by L. and everyone was able to move on. L. also requested that Story inform her friends that justice had been achieved by her standards and that her needs were being supported. L. is story is one example of a prison abolitionist approach to gendered harm, where harm against a woman is dealt with outside of the traditional criminal justice system. Recent public debates about police and prisons have brought up questions of the usefulness of police and the criminal justice system in cases of gendered violence. Critics of the criminal justice system and how it deals with rape and sexual assault point out that the current system retraumatizes sexual violence survivors, that police can often be perpetrators of sexual and gendered violence the mselves, and that some survivors are incarcerated for fighting back against their abusers. Story is a survivor of sexual violence and extremely open about their experiences with the criminal justice system and the ways it failed them.“The first thing that happens in a traditional carceral justice process is intake, and the only thing that is happening to a survivor is invasive harm,” declared Story.“The gathering of a rape kit is a violent process, it is invasive, and depending on how fresh that physical harm is, it can be extremely, extremely painful. Then you have the fact-finding part of the piece which is even more invasive, where you have someone who is allowed to ask you whatever questions they feel relevant. It is a completely arbitrary process that is to the discretion of whoever is sitting across the table from you.”Story and other abolitionists are also critical of the lack of support survivors receive from the system.“When it comes to support in America, in particular where we do not have robust social welfare, what is provided to survivors is unbelievably poor. I will never forget the neon sheet of paper I was given with services I could tap into for a limited amount of time that the government was willing to pay,” they shared. This lack of trauma-informed care and support for survivors inspired twenty-five-year-old writer Nylah Burton to start a healing fund for Black survivors who were harmed at Howard University. Burton suffered sexual violence on the Howard University campus, and though filing a Title IX complaint against her attacker resulted in his suspension, the lack of care and support compounded by already existing mental health issues resulted in a derailment of her life. She is still recovering.“The reason that I started the healing fund was because I knew first-hand how those assaults can completely destabilize your life in ways that people do not even think about,” she said. “I remember after the first time that I experienced sexual violence, my mother was incredibly abusive to me because she felt it was my fault. And that started a chain reaction that led to me losing my scholarship [at Howard], being estranged from my parents, having incredibly bad relationship problems, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the same time.”Burton is experience with inadequate support and the subsequent unraveling of her mental state is common. It is part of what advocates call the “sexual abuse to prison pipeline.”A study from 2004 by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network revealed that if the trauma of sexual abuse in girls and women is not resolved, it may result in the further development of mental health problems and behaviors that are criminalized.“At the very least you need money to get through that,” Burton said, referring to her fund that provides survivors with a stipend of $5000 for mental health care. Burton mentioned survivors might not be able to work for a while or that the assault might result in huge medical bills and impact a survivor is career aspirations..“Dealing with the trauma of sexual assault delays your education, it delays so much [of your life]. The first person who abused me, he graduated med school, and I am just now being able to start this journey of thinking maybe I can go to med school too, and he is literally a doctor now. I feel a lot of resentment about that, and I know a lot of survivors who did not graduate college and do not know what they are going to do next and are financially insecure.”Financial instability and poverty have been proven to increasepeople is vulnerabilities to sexual violence. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the prevalence of sexual assault increases dramatically as annual household income decreases.“The work of healing is so intense,” said twenty-six-year-old survivor Nisa Dang, when asked about structural issues she had to battle due to being a survivor. “Especially as someone who was unemployed and financially unstable [after the assault], it just added to the process of being retraumatized throughout so to be able to get a stipend to spend it however I need it would have been helpful.”Story suggested that the difference between a carceral and a restorative process is who is centered.“In a carceral process, the only reason the state cares about what happened is because the person who harmed you owes the state for breaking a law,” they added. “That means it is never about you. It is never about the harm that you have experienced. It is never about the harm that your family has experienced. It is never about the punitive damages that you as a survivor might take on, albeit paying for doctors, therapists, things like that. It is solely about how the state gets repaid for having to go through this.”According to the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), the vast majority of sexual assault perpetrators will not go to jail or prison, and a recent survey with survivors revealed that 20% were afraid of police retaliation for reporting a sexual crime. There are issues within the actual police force as well: one study revealed that the NYPDundercounted rape sin New York City for years and a 2018 study revealed the lack of training of police officers investigating sexual assaults in Austin, Texas.“The only thing that I ever wanted [after the assault] was the ability to feel safe again and to live in a society where it is normalized to discuss harm without it being litigated in court, without it being wrapped up in incarceration,” Dang shared. Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS), a grassroots organization in Washington, DC, recognizes the need for safety for survivors without police. Originally a chapter of Hollaback, an organization that seeks to stop sexual harassment in public spaces, CASS works to prevent sexual violence without the involvement of police through workshops on masculinity and bystander intervention. It is an example of abolitionist work that seeks to prevent sexual violence before it happens, recognizing that the social problem of sexual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape.“We train local bars and restaurants in the hospitality industry on bystander intervention so if someone is being harassed or assaulted in real time in these public spaces, the restaurant and bar staff are equipped with the tools needed to intervene directly and in a way that does not involve the police,” stated Je’Kendria Trahan, executive director for CASS. “We also have our Rethink Masculinity program which is an eight-week cohort model where men and masculine of center folks come together to unpack toxic masculinity and rape culture and talk about building accountable communities.”While CASS did not start as a prison abolitionist space, Je’Kedria said they have organized around abolition and focused on the prevention of sexual violence because of the harm the system causes survivors looking for support.“By virtue of being in the decriminalization [of sex work] space, we were almost an oddball in the domestic violence and sexual assault world because some folks are very invested in carceral feminism,” she said. “Because we are now in this political moment of an uprising, it is really important to make a decision about what side we are going to be on as folks are calling to de fund the police. Let is also think about how the money and the resources can be pulled away from the police and away from prisons and allocated into community-driven solutions that do not cycle these instances of criminalization and harm.”CASS is an example of abolitionist work that seeks to prevent sexual violence before it happens, recognizing that the social problem of sexual violence is more complex and wide-ranging than penetrative rape. As someone expanding their experience as a restorative justice practitioner to other identity-based harms, Story has a similar perspective on justice and gender.“There is so much gender-based harm, and for the whole world and communities to solely focus on penetrative rape, penetrative sexual assault. I feel like that does survivors a disservice,” they said. In many ways, what survivors need to feel safe is a completely different world.“Everything that [survivors] are asking for is so simple,” Dang concluded. “The idea that I could have a night out with my friends and not have to form a barrier between them and a man. Or that we could be in spaces and be free and that if we were drunk, that was okay, and we would not be shamed or humiliated or harassed.”",1,1,Shadowproof

After lift-off, the capsule separates from its booster, the n spends four minutes at an altitude exceeding 100km (60 miles), during which time those on board experience weightlessness and can observe the curvature of Earth from space. The booster lands autonomously on a pad 3.2km (two miles) from the launch site, and the capsule floats back to the surface with three large parachutes that slow it down when it lands. Bezos, who announced earlier this year he is stepping down as chief executive of Amazon to spend more time on other projects including Blue Origin, has said he would be fulfilling a lifelong dream by flying into space. Blue Origin is New Shepard has successfully carried out more than a dozen unmanned test runs from its facility in the Guadalupe Mountains of west Texas. The reusable suborbital rocket system was named after Alan Shepard, the first American in space 60 years ago. The automated capsules with no pilot have six seats with horizontal backrests placed next to large portholes, in a futuristic cabin with swish lighting.

Democrats are looking to address organizational issues at the Postal Service in the coming weeks, not to provide additional funding at this time, according to sources familiar with the discussion. Nothing says “crisis” in Washington quite like pulling politicians away from their campaigns for a political stunt like holding an “emergency” session of Congress. One option would be to vote on a modified version of a bill introduced by House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) earlier this week that would prohibit USPS from implementing a planned organizational overhaul that critics maintain would handicap mail-in voting. Other top Democrats also floated addressing other issues, including expired federal unemployment benefits and voting rights. But Democratic sources said the immediate focus — at least for now — is preserving the Postal Service ahead of the election. So now Democrats want to become experts at mail delivery and dictate to management how the mail is to be delivered? Sheesh. The media is doing their part in fanning the flames of crisis. Some of the headlines are choice. That Reuters headline is hysterical. UPS and FedEx are not supposed to carry ballots. They are not the US Postal Service. There would have to be an act of Congress before they could carry ballots. But if it gins up fear and outrage, all the better.",0,0,PJ Media

76,$15 an Hour Is the Compromise,-14.33,42.33,https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/federal-minimum-wage-stimulus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,25,"Economist Dean Baker reminds us that for the first 40 years after President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, the national minimum wage “not only kept pace with inflation, it rose in step with productivity growth.” This progress did not deliver the cooperative commonwealth that progressives hoped to achieve. But it was on an economically, morally, and politically sound trajectory. Unfortunately, it did not continue. After 1968, Baker explained last year, the minimum wage has not even kept pace with inflation. In fact, while there has been progress at the municipal and state levels of government, the federal minimum wage has not increased by a single penny in the past 12 years—since 2009, when it reached $7.25 an hour. What if the minimum wage had kept rising at a rate that respected the contribution of workers? “It would be over $24 an hour today.” So a new Democratic administration could have started where the AFL-CIO does, by noting that, “had the federal minimum wage kept pace with workers’ productivity since 1968 the inflation-adjusted minimum wage would be $24 an hour.” Joe Biden has not gone there. He has started with a modest proposal to raise the wage to $15 an hour in stages between now and 2025. This is the definition of incremental progress. “$15 an hour—and by the way, it is over a four-year period—is not a radical idea,” says Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “If you make $15 bucks an hour, you are not getting rich. But at least, at least, you have a shot to live with a minimum of dignity. You do not have to have all the stress and pressure that is on you right now trying to survive on starvation wages.” What the Senate Can Do The slow march to $15 an hour, as outlined in the American Recovery Act, was always a compromise. And now, the compromise has been imperiled by the Senate parliamentarian is decision that it is unacceptable to use the budget reconciliation process to set a $15-an-hour standard as part of Biden is $1.9 trillion The parliamentarian is ruling ca not be the end of this fight. The party of FDR must recognize the calculus that Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal spells out when she says, “We made a promise to raise the minimum wage and we now have to deliver on that promise to 27 million Americans who are not going to be much convinced when we go back in two years and say, ‘Sorry, the unelected parliamentarian told us we could not raise the minimum wage.’” Japayal and her caucus colleagues got Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the House Democratic Caucus to back a version of the ARA that keeps the $15 proposal in the package. She is now urging Senate Democrats to be just as bold, as is Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, whose no-excuses response to the parliamentarian is ruling was: “Abolish the filibuster. Replace the parliamentarian. What is a Democratic majority if we ca not pass our priority bills? This is unacceptable.” On Monday, Omar and Jayapal joined 20 other House Democrats in signing on to a letter to the administration written by California Democrat Ro Khanna, which urged the Senate is presiding officer—Vice President Kamala Harris—to “refute the parliamentarian is advice” and keep the 2020 Democratic platform is “fight for $15” promise. That is good advice. It is unacceptable to compromise of something that is so necessary, and so popular, as the fight for $15. Unfortunately, Omar is clarity has not been echoed in the White House response, or that of most Senate Democrats. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president was “absolutely committed” to the $15-an-hour wage hike. Yet when she was asked whether Harris would overrule the parliamentarian, Psaki said, “That is not an action we intend to take.” So what is the strategy? “We do not have a clear answer on what that looks like at this point,” she said. “It just remains a commitment and something he will use his political capital to get done.” That is a profoundly unsatisfying answer because it suggests a stalemate that is all but certain to lead totalk of compromising for a smaller minimum-wage increase. What is frustrating about the administration is response is that the Senate has plenty of options: The White House could rethink its position and recognize that Harris has the authority to reject the parliamentarian is recommendation—as Vice President Hubert Humphrey did during a spending debate in 1969, and as Vice President Nelson Rockefeller did in 1975. Senator Sanders says he plans to force a vote on an amendment to the ARA that would have the Senate ignore the parliamentarian and include the wage hike. “My personal view is that the idea that we have a Senate staffer, a high-ranking staffer, deciding whether 30 million Americans get a pay raise or not is non-sensical,” says Sanders. “We have got to make that decision, not a staffer who is unelected, so my own view is that we should ignore the rulings, the decision of the parliamentarian.” Senate Democrats could finally recognize that it is time for filibuster reform, which would allow passage of the stimulus package and other major proposals with the votes of 50 Democratic senators and a tie-breaking assist from Vice President Harris. (With the filibuster gone, it would even be possible to pass a freestanding minimum-wage bill, if Democrats could unite on the issue.) An amendment could be added to a future spending package to be used to raise wages, as has been done in the past. But to keep this option on the table, Harris and Senate Democrats must not limit the scope and character of what are considered acceptable amendments. Even if Options 1 and 2 really are off the table, Biden should be talking about what he plans to do next. There has to clarity on moving forward. That clarity must be rooted in an understanding that the fight against poverty wages will not be won if the White House and Senate Democratic leaders show any sign of flexibility when it comes to the $15 figure. Unacceptable ‘Compromises’ When “compromises” are suggested, Biden must explain that $15 an hour is the compromise. This has to be the administration is bottom line as Republican senators and Democrats such as West Virginia is Joe Manchin and Arizona is Krysten Sinema object that the $15-an-hour standard is too generous, even if it is implemented on an agonizingly slow timeline. Recognizing that Americans are enthusiastic about raising wages, the Ebenezer Scrooges of the Senate are already proposing their “alternatives.” Republican Senators Mitt Romney, of Utah, and Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, want a $10-an-hour federal minimum, which is actually less than Arkansas is existing state minimum of $11 an hour. Adding insult to injury, the Romney-Cotton scheme would rework existing employment laws to add anti-immigrant requirements. Manchin is only slightly more generous; he is proposing a federal minimum of $11 an hour. That does not even provide a living wage for his own constituents. How should Biden respond? Not with negotiations but by seizing the bully pulpit and making the moral, economic, and political case for the rapid adoption of a $15-an-hour wage. That should not be hard. The voters have already signaled that they want to go big. In Florida, on the same day that Biden lost to Donald Trump, a $15-an-hour proposal won 61 percent of the vote. In states across the country, red and blue, the fight for $15 won popular support. New national polling commissioned by the National Employment Law Project, which surveyed 2020 general election voters in the nation is 67 most competitive congressional districts, has found: Fully 62% of those polled, including 59 percent in the districts won by Republicans, favored raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025. These results reinforce the success of the Black-and-brown-worker-led Fight for $15 movement and the desperate need for at least a $15 minimum wage across the country, while demonstrating that this is a bi-partisan issue and one on which Congress should take immediate action. Democrats Have to Put Money in People is Pockets Biden should certainly do his best to convince Manchin and Sinema that this is the right time to do the right thing. If that does not work, however, he can go over their heads—to the American people in general, and to the people of West Virginia and Arizona in particular. His argument should be a partisan one. You read that right: partisan. The president needs to recognize that, despite everything that Trump is Republican Party has done to discredit itself, the Democrats are now in a perilous position. “What history has told us is that two years after President Obama won the presidency in 2008 and two years after President Clinton won in 1992, Republicans did phenomenally well. And the reason they did so well was because Democrats had the power, and they did not exercise that power to help working families,” says Sanders. “We cannot make that mistake again.” Biden needs to define the Democratic Party as a political organization that recognizes the immorality of paying full-time workers so little that they are stuck in poverty. And he needs to do so quickly. “We do not have a lot of time here,” says Jayapal. “The midterms are in two years. We need to show people that their lives are appreciably better, that we can get control of the virus and we can put money in people is pockets.” Excuses will not cut it, morally or politically. As Jayapal says, “We simply cannot go back to the Black, Brown, AAPI, Indigenous, poor and working class voters who delivered us the White House and the Senate majority and tell them that an unelected parliamentarian advised us—based on arcane rules—that we could not raise the minimum wage as we promised.”",1,1,The Nation

78,Maddesyn George Killed Her Alleged Rapist. Prosecutors Blocked Her Self-Defense Claims.,-12.0,44.6,https://theintercept.com/2021/10/08/maddesyn-george-self-defense-rape/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-08,25,"No one disputesthat, on July 12, 2020, Maddesyn George shot and killed Kristopher “Buddy” Graber as he reached through the window of the parked car where George was seated. After George saidGraber raped her, she did not go to the police. That is not unusual. The majority of sexual assaults are not reported to the police. Only33.9 percent of sexual assaults were reported to police in 2019, according to the Department of Justice. In a 2021 memorial to missing and murdered Indigenous women, thousands of cardboard red dresses were set out on the state Capitol lawn in St. Paul, Minn., to represent the history of abuse, neglect, and killings of Native women across the nation. At the time of her arrest, George was a 26-year-old single mother with a 4-month-old daughter. She was using methamphetamine, which Graber had been supplying for the past three years. Her previous felony convictions were for drugs and burglary, though the statute for those convictions was later found unconstitutional. Though she knew of Graber is reputation for violence, George had never expected him to rape her. “We never had a sexual relationship,” she told The Intercept. “He was my drug dealer and that was it.”What she did know was that she could not expect help from the police. When she was a child, her uncle was fatally shot by police while trying to seek help, she recalled. In more recent years, George said she was sexually harassed by a deputy at the Okanogan sheriff is office, who sent her unwanted messages and pictures of his genitals. She included these allegations in court exhibits to drive home why she decided not to report Graber is assault: She thought that the police would be unresponsive — the same as before — had she turned to them. There was also her own criminal record and continuing substance use. “I did not feel they would listen because of the life I was living,” George said. Her fear is not unfounded, said Earth-Feather Sovereign, founder of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Washington, a nonprofit connected to the awareness-raising grassroots movement. Sovereign said police often do not take Indigenous women is reports of sexual assault or victimization seriously.“It has to do with systematic racism,” she said. “A lot of our cases are being ignored — whether domestic violence, sexual assault or someone is reported missing or murdered.”For victims who appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, she added, police often assume that the person was a willing participant rather than a victim of sexual assault. Goodmark, the law professor, agrees. “We have spent literally billions of dollars training police and prosecutors on various forms of gender-based violence since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and they still ca not see or will not see victimization claims unless they come from people they deem to be credible and true victims,” she said. George is race, as well as her substance use and past record, make her a less credible victim in the eyes of law enforcement — a dynamic reinforced by the imbalances of justice on tribal lands and off for members and nonmembers. Sovereign pointed to the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Oliphant vs Suquamish ruling that tribes cannot prosecute nontribal members who commit crimes on reservations. While the alleged rape occurred outside tribal lands, George was on the Colville reservation when Graber confronted and struck her. Had he assaulted her further, Sovereign pointed out, tribal authorities would have had no ability to arrest or prosecute him and, based on their history of declining to prosecute cases on Native lands, federal authorities would likely have done nothing.

Yvonne Wanrow Swan stands with Colville Confederated Tribe members and others in Kettle Falls, Wash., during a 2020 gathering in support of a fellow tribal member is case before the Canadian Supreme Court. Wanrow was the defendant in a case stemming from a 1972 killing that had wide-reaching effects on Washington state jurisprudence involving victims of sexual abuse. In 1972, Wanrow, a Colville tribal member, was living with her two children in Spokane. One August afternoon, her children were at the home of Shirley Hooper, a family friend. While riding his bicycle, Wanrow is 11-year-old son encountered a man who tried to drag him into his house. The boy escaped, but the man, William Wesler, followed the boy to Hooper is. Earlier that year, Hooper is 7-year-old daughter had been raped, resulting in a sexually transmitted infection. When Hooper is daughter saw Wesler, she told her mother, “He is the man who did it to me.”Hooper called the police. Though they had previously arrested Wesler for molestation, this time, they refused to arrest him. Hooper the n asked Wanrow and other relatives to spend the night. Wanrow brought her children and her gun for protection. At 5 in the morning, Wesler, visibly intoxicated, showed up at Hooper is house to sort out the allegations. The women demanded that he leave. In the commotion that ensued, Wanrow turned around at one point to find Wesler is imposing figure standing over her. She shot him, he died, and Wanrow was arrested for murder. At trial, the judge instructed jurors to consider only what had happened “at or immediately before the killing.” This excluded both Wesler is previous record of sexually abusing children and the testimony of Hooper is daughter. Wanrow was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison. An appeal court, however, decided to vacate her conviction and grant Wanrow a new trial. They found that the judge is instructions about self-defense had not allowed the jury to consider the fact that Wesler was a known child molester, that Wanrow had heard he had previously raped her friend is daughter, and that, less than 24 hours earlier, he had attempted to grab her son. In 1977, the Washington Supreme Court upheld the vacature.“The justification for self-defense is to be evaluated in light of all the facts and circumstances known to the defendant, including those known substantially before the killing,” the court declared. It further stated, “Care must be taken to assure that our self-defense instructions afford women the right to have their conduct judged in light of the individual physical handicaps which are the product of sex discrimination.”By the n, Wanrow had attracted the attention of women is and Native American movements, who rallied around her case as one of a woman is right to defend herself and her family. They formed defense committees across the country, raising public interest and legal funds. In 1978, Wanrow pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assault; the court sentenced her to five years’ probation.“There was so much support for her,” said Sovereign, whose mother had been part of Wanrow is defense campaign. The court decision on self-defense had been a huge step forward, Sovereign said: “She was not only able to create awareness about her situation, but put in place directions to help all women.”Now, Sovereign and other grassroots groups have assembled the Campaign to Free Maddesyn George,urging federal prosecutors to drop the charges against George. Maddesyn visits with her family in their first video visit from prison, one year after her incarceration, in July 2021. Screenshot: Courtesy Jody GeorgeFederal prosecutors are notshowing any signs of an inclination toward leniency, let alone dropping the charges — or even consider leniency. Maddesyn visits with her family in their first video visit from prison, one year after her incarceration, in July 2021. On July 6, 2021, prosecutors filed a motion to prevent George and her attorney, Stephen Graham, from including the sexual assault or a theory of self-defense in his opening statement. Instead, prosecutors espoused a different motive: that George had stolen Graber is gun, drugs, and money, and he was simply trying to retrieve his property when she shot him. They argued that the passage of time negates a defense that she shot him in the heat of the moment. They dismissed the link between Graber is act and the killing, writing that “an assault with a vibrator does not justify the use of deadly force one to three days after the alleged assault.”“Forcing someone to submit to that at gunpoint is rape,” said Graham, the attorney. “It is not ‘an alleged assault with a vibrator.’”Minimizing the extent of the sexual assault is not unusual, said Goodmark, the law professor. “Police and prosecutors minimize the harms that victims describe. They give other readings of the situation,” she said. “What the prosecutor is telling is a story of robbery by a drug-addicted Native woman, playing into stereotypes about substance use and Native people to undermine her claim of self-defense.”Graber had a known history of violence, including several convictions, restraining orders, and violations of those restraining orders for domestic violence. A man who witnessed Graber is shooting told police that Graber had been known for beating up women. On the afternoon that Graber attacked George, he was awaiting trial for drug and gun charges. He had already been ordered by the courts to not possess firearms or controlled substances, orders that he had clearly violated the night before. Prosecutors, however, submitted a motion to limit George and her lawyer is ability to bring up Graber is own history of violence.“Because they can ascribe other motives to her, like robbery, the fact that he had been abusive in the past is not important because they do not care about her story that she was sexually assaulted at gunpoint,” said Goodmark. By July 26, 2021, George had spent over a year in the Spokane County Jail. Covid-19 has stopped in-person visits; she could only see her family, including her now 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter, through the jail is video visiting system, which frequently malfunctioned. Fearing the possibility of a total 43 years in prison convicted in federal court, George pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of methamphetamine and voluntary manslaughter in Indian country. Prosecutors filed a motion asking the court to sentence George to 17 years, more than federal sentencing guidelines calling for nine to 11 years. Adding to their initial theory of robbery, they argued that, by taking Graber is drugs, George was engaged in drug trafficking. The allegation became central to their push for harsh sentencing: “She discharged a firearm pursuant to that offense and caused a death so that she could keep and even hide the drugs she stole from Graber.”Graham, on the other hand, insists that this is about sexual assault and self-defense. He noted that law enforcement — from the initial investigators to the prosecutors — focused on the allegations of drug theft rather than George is report of rape.“It reinforces the idea that investigators in this country look for perfect victims,” he said. “If you are on the margins of society — if you struggle with drug abuse — you are not able to avail yourself of self-defense in the eyes of the law. Self-defense is only for the NRA members who are in the rotary club with the police chief, not for a sex worker or homeless person or drug addict. Everybody has the right to self-defense.”On October 20, a federal judge will decide George is fate. George plans to address the court directly about what happened last July. She said, “My hope is that they will listen to me and understand that he did this to me.",2,1,The Intercept
79,Biden administration moving to double tariffs on Canadian lumber despite already skyrocketing timber prices,13.67,39.33,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-double-tariff-canadian-lumber-skyrocketing-prices,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-27,25,"The Biden administration is recommending doubling tariffs on Canadian lumber despite the current skyrocketing prices for the materials for US consumers.“At a time when soaring lumber prices have added nearly $36,000 to the price of a new home and priced millions of middle-class households out of the housing market, the Biden administration is preliminary finding on Friday to double the tariffs on Canadian lumber shipments into the US shows the White House does not care about the plight of American home buyers and renters who have been forced to pay much higher costs for housing,”National Association of Home Builders chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. The move, which would raise tariffs on Canadian lumber from 8.99% to 18.32%, comes as lumber pieces in the US jumped 275% since last April.“The administration should be ashamed for casting its lot with special interest groups and abandoning the interests of the American people,” Fowke said. BUYING OR BUILDING A HOME CONTINUES TO GET COSTLIERThe finding was also heavily criticized by Canadian authorities, who called the increase a “tax on the American people.”“US duties on Canadian softwood lumber products are a tax on the American people. They make housing less affordable for Americans and hinder economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mary Ng, a Canadian MP and the minister of small business, export promotion, and international trade.“We will keep challenging these unwarranted and damaging duties through all available avenues. We remain confident that a negotiated solution to this long-standing trade issue is not only possible, but in the best interest of both our countries,” she added. Canada has successfully challenged US lumber tariffs before, most recently after former President Donald Trump is administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian lumber. That number was brought back down to 9% after the World Trade Organization ruled in Canada is favor. The Trump tariffs resulted in skyrocketing prices at the time, though from a much lower base than the current prices. But US lumber manufacturers praised the findings, saying such tariffs are necessary to create a “level playing field” for US businesses.“A level playing field is a critical element for continued investment and growth for US lumber manufacturing to meet strong building demand to build more American homes,” US Lumber Coalition co-chair Jason Brochu said in a statement.“More lumber being manufactured in America to meet domestic demand is a direct result of the trade enforcement, and we strongly urge the Administration to continue this enforcement,” he added. Deacon Lumber Company founder Stinson Dean urged a “ceasefire” between the countries on the hot button trade issue in hopes that the two sides could come to a solution that will help increase the supply of lumber to US consumers.

The US needs all the supply it can get-and buyers will clearly pay for it-but if it does not exist, it brings construction to a halt.

80,Facebook asks the court to dismiss the FTC is antitrust complaint,0.0,48.67,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/facebook-asks-the-court-to-dismiss-the-ftcs-antitrust-complaint.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-12,18,"Last fall,after more than a year-and-a-halfof Congressional committee hearings and investigations into the power of technology companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the government released a comprehensive report alleging anti-competitive conduct. The report, which called for a number of “structural remedies”—including that the companies be broken up—also gave momentum to an almost unprecedented number of state and federal antitrust actions. One of those w asa lawsuit against Facebook brought by the Federal Trade Commission, backed by an investigation conducted alongside forty-nine states; the suit alleged a wide range of monopolistic behavior. When the case was filed, last December,Facebookresponded with a blog post calling the lawsuit “revisionist history” and arguing that it “ignores reality.” On Wednesday, Facebook released a much more comprehensive response: a legal defense and request to dismiss.“No government lawsuit similar to this one has been brought in the 130-year history of the Sherman Act, and for good reason,” Facebook is statement begins. The FTC “has not alleged facts amounting to a plausible antitrust case” and “ignores its own prior decisions, controlling precedent, and the limits of its statutory authority.” In order to make a plausible case for antitrust action,Facebook argues, the FTC would have to prove a) that Facebook dominates a defined market, b) that it has the power in that market to raise prices or restrict output, and c) that it has maintained that monopoly power in ways that harm competition and-or injure consumers. The government is complaint fails, per Facebook, “because the FTC has not pleaded facts sufficient to satisfy any of the three required elements of a claim.”The FTC, for its part, has no trouble defining the market that Facebook dominates: it is “personal social networking,” or the sharing of photos and other personal information with family and friends. As some technology journalists have pointed out—including Casey Newton, the author of a Substack called Platformer—FTC is definition seemsshaky, though: for one thing, the FTC is claim ignores the existence of popular ap ps like TikTok, which has managed to build a massive amount of market share—eight hundred million users or so by the end of last year. Such success would be impossible according to the FTC is definition, if Facebook really has managed to squeeze out competitors. Facebook is defense also goes after another problematic aspect of the FTC is claim: the fact that antitrust activity (as it has been defined by the courts for the past several decades) consists of causing harm by restricting choice and-or raising prices. The second of these is difficult to prove on a consumer level because, as Facebook has taken pains to point out, its services are free. That leaves the FTC to argue that price-raising takes place on the advertising side, or that Facebook causes consumers harm in equivalently bad ways—by, say, invading their privacy and sharing their data with advertisers. That argument was advanced in 2019 byDina Srinivasan, a legal scholar at Yale, in apa per called “The Antitrust Case Against Facebook.” So far, however, it has not been tested in federal court. The FTC is case is further complicated by the fact that a substantial amount of its claim rests on the idea that the acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp were anti-competitive in nature, designed to maintain and expand Facebook is monopoly on social networking. But as Facebook points out in its motion to dismiss, the FTC approved both acquisitions—and expressed no problem with them from a competitive point of view. Although antitrust experts such as Tim Wu—a Columbia Law professor and former advisor to the FTC who was recently named to Joe Biden is economic advisory council—have said that approving deals does not in any way restrict the FTCfrom questioning them later, doing so means arguing that the FTC either screwed up the first time around or, perhaps, in Facebook is terms, is trying to revise history. That does not mean Facebook should not be scrutinized and kept in check—it certainly has plenty of bad behavior to answer for—but the FTC will likely need to keep searching for another way.

81,A Letter to Black America on the Anniversary of George Floyd is Death From Poet Tracy K Smith,-7.67,35.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/george-floyd-death-anniversary,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,23,"Dear Black America—I hear the birds outside in the spring air, and there is a part of me that ca not believe we have made it this far. It is been a year sinceGeorge Floydwas stolen from his family and from us. A year since the whole world squeezed into the the ater of our grief. What have we lived through? Where have we been?None of our losses were new. The ever-lengthening list of Black lives cut short by brutality, by fear, by racialized hate. Like a terrible procession, making its slow march through the ages. My grandparents knew it. Perhaps yours did too and theirs. My parents told me stories about how this form of loss had touched them growing up in Alabama in the 1930s and ’40s. Such stories were a way of warning me that justice was not guaranteed. Perhaps they also sought to underscore the enduring trauma such injustices instigate—how, even in loss, our Black lives continue to matter. All manner of stories were lumped together—like the one about my mother is uncle or great-uncle who, in the early 1940s, had made a good deal on the sale of timber felled from his own land. At the end of a night spent celebrating his gains in a bar, he was shot and robbed by a white man who’d caught wind of the fortune in that uncle is pockets. “Did the white man go to jail?” I asked, before I had learned enough to know that is not how these stories ever end. But there was another kind of story too. When I was in my first or second year at Harvard, in 1990 or ’91, one of my mother is sisters pulled me aside to tell me the story of B., a cousin who had attended Harvard in the early 1960s. If I am remembering correctly, B. had lasted there barely a year. The proof of the psychic toll that place in that particular time had had upon her was that she had been found walking across campus one afternoon barefoot in the snow. Somehow her story, in its telling, was equal in strife to that of my mother is uncle. Of course B. had gotten out with her life, but there was no way, my aunt seemed to be saying, to measure the psychic toll of what our cousin had endured or to know whether the damage of that time had come to an end. These family stories were meant to be extrapolated upon. I was meant to extract from them not just a private warning about how to protect myself, and whom it was unsafe to trust, but also a larger form of knowledge. I was meant to understand that our family stories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built of struggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I was meant to understand unreservedly that our stories were indispensable to the full story—the true story—of America, a story America itself was unwilling to tell. But for a long time, all this knowledge did was coalesce into a painful spot in my mind, a site I tended to shy away from. If I am being honest—with myself, with you—for a long time I coped with that particular pain by attempting to numb the area of my mind where it sat. On the night thatMichael Brown is murderer was acquitted, I muted my rage, telling myself I had long ago been told (“Did the white man go to jail?”) what the verdict would be. I believe this numbness, this muting of feeling, was an attempt at self-protection. What would I have known to do with the force and the weight of such actual pain if I had been willing to truly claim it or claim a right to it? Would I have let it chase me out into the street or out barefoot in deep snow?Our family stories were but a minuscule part of a centuries-old collective body of knowledge built of struggle, punctuated by loss, and kept alive by love. I have always felt ashamed of my tendency toward silence, my habit of seeking to settle the emotions wishing to storm up and out in reaction. So I was eager to let this past year, with its convergence of crises, change me. The past year, so frequently and so inaccurately labeled unprecedented, was like a storm hammering down on all of us at once, held as we were at home in lockdown. In its conflagration of deaths—to police brutality and to subtler but no less virulent forms of racialized disregard—history seemed to be insisting that we acknowledge how little had changed:It seemed that the age-old patterns my parents had insisted I see were registering in the collective imagination. Not as proof of how things had always been but as an argument for how things must begin to change. The world is watching, and its reacting, refused to let me retreat into numbness. Thanks to activists in Minneapolis, New York, DC, and communities across the country, I felt myself to be in a strange new Now that was bound up—this time willingly and actively—with the past. History, no longer behind us, was right the re, nudging us to act. And act we have. Even in moments of peace, I feel now the guiding presence of history. Savoring a delicious meal, I am for a flicker of a moment a child again at my mother is table. Snuggling next to one of my children at bedtime, I feel myself be wrapped up again in the cherishing crucial to my own experience of childhood—the tenderness and instruction intended to buoy me through day after day, to keep me intact in a world where so much would be intent upon my diminishment., history seems to say. And, finally, I obey. Black America, I am trying to make or preserve the space where the We of Blackness can count on the wider, whiter world to have our backs. But I am also wary of such trust. How many times in this very same year, in moments where my advocating for smaller justices—in the literary community or on the campus where I have long taught—was met by attack, have I been made to feel the silence of my white peers as a form of annihilating violence?Chasteningly, it is in those very circumstances—in the pain of feeling betrayed—that I have been made to see how dangerous for us all the tendency to muteness and the ability to go numb can be. My own included. Black America and all of us willing to honor and protect Black life: We know how exhausted this year has left us. We also know our strength. We know our laughter is a way of digging into the work to be done. And we know a song or a poem or a prayer can summon others near so all the many of us can work together as one. Black America and all of us willing work not just in the here and now of our own time but in the wake of the labor of generations past: Mammoth is our task. I believe it will keep us busy into generations yet to come—our waves rippling out to merge into theirs, even if you and I are, by the n, elsewhere. When I am overwhelmed, as I am so often this year, I close my eyes. Once, in what must have been a plea or prayer for help, I watched as the silhouette of a woman bathing in a river or lake took shape in my mind is eye. I watched her in her wading, her diving and rising. Never facing me. Her back and shoulders rippling with agency. Then I felt a message rise in my mind:Black America and everyone who understands that a cherishing of Black life is essential to the enterprise of democracy: I am talking to us, all of us. As we did so often in the past year, we find ourselves standing shoulder to shoulder—now in flesh, now in spirit—called upon to manifest the possible. Is it possible for us to reseed the imagination not just of ourselves but of our entire nation? Is it possible to fill it with tall climbing vines that lift our sights up from where they have been?",1,1,Vogue
82,‘We Ca not Wait’ Defund The Police Has Its Moment,-19.33,39.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/we-cant-wait-defund-the-police-has-its-moment,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-11,23,"The movement to de fund the police has grown exponentially in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police on May 25. The idea of de funding police is rooted in the decades old prison abolitionist movement. In the midst of increasing protests, and increasing police violence against protesters, It is become a topic of national conversation.“The movement is aimed at creating a world where public safety is not defined by police and crime but how communities use their resources to care for each other,” said Ralikh Hayes, Deputy Director of Organizing Black, a grassroots member-led collective demanding Baltimore cut police spending in half to fund education and social services in disinvest ed Black communities.:Democratic and Republican leadership has so far rejected the idea of de funding the police, “The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms,”presumptive Democratic nomineeJoe Biden said in a USA Todayop-edpublished Thursday. However,it continues to catch fire in cities across the country. President Donald Trump has falsely accused Biden of supporting de funding the police. Instead Biden has proposed spending an additional$300 million on community policing, along with reforms that activists have rejected as ineffectual.“We know that policing in this country has not worked for a long time and Biden is response shows how out of touch the Democratic Party is with its base of Black people,” Hayes said. Grassroots pressure has resulted in victories on a local level. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council supports disbanding its police department. Mayors in Los Angeles and New York have vowed to cut their multi-billion dollar police budgets to invest in local communities. In Baltimore, activists and progressive council people targeted recent week-long budget hearings to highlight excessive police spending in the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget, which is greater than education, healthcare and civil rights combined. Budget hearings begin Monday morning. Here is a quick sampling of how your money is proposed to be spent.pic.twitter.com/zrxz4zs9it— Ryan Dorsey (@ElectRyanDorsey)June 5, 2020For the 2020 fiscal year, the citybudgeted$536 million for the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) versus $278 million for public education (Baltimore City Schools’ FY20budget was $1.1 billion, the majority of which is funded through the state). Baltimorespendsthe most per capita on police among large cities. City Council President Brandon Scott, recently declared the winner of the June 2 Democratic primary– which effectively decides the election — told The Real News he is committed to reducing police spending and increasing spending on social programs such as education. Scott says he is identified tens of millions of dollars of potential cuts in the police budget, urging Mayor Jack Young in a June 8letterto “re-allocate its budget away from the current dependence on the police department.”“We must reinvest these dollars in our historically under funded neighborhoods by building a new, more equitable system and bringing our budget into greater alignment with our values as a city,” Scott wroteYoungrespondedby cautioning “against making any dramatic cuts that may result in unintended consequences for the City of Baltimore.”Due to Baltimore is ‘Strong Mayor’ system of governance, only the mayor has power to add money to the budget, the council can only cut funding. Hayes, who is helping organize a protest on June 12, the day the Council will vote on the police budget, said Scott is proposal was not enough but organizers were open to having a dialogue with him. Organizing Black is also demanding state lawmakers turn over control of the Baltimore Police Department to local authorities. The conversation around de funding police has alarmed some prominent journalists and commentators, who note that relative to LA or New York, Baltimore is crime and homicides rate remains high, even as crime rates have dropped across the country. The Baltimore homicide unit is utterly overwhelmed, with detectives carrying far too many cases each. Closure rates are down around 30 percent. Just something to consider during the “abolish/defund” debate.— Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis)June 6, 2020But activists argue grassroots-led efforts that operate on a shoe-string budget have far better results in reducing violence than Baltimore is scandal-ridden police department.“We know for a fact that programs like Safe Streets, community mediations…work, and need to be brought to scale,” said Hayes. Studies have found the Baltimore Ceasefire movement, which fights violence through outreach, connecting vulnerable populations with resources and by building community,reducedshootings by 52 percent. Meanwhile Safe Streets has been credited with reducing shootings by over 50%. Hayes says opposition to de funding the police is rooted in racist views that Black communities need policing instead of the investment in education and other social services given to affluent, white communities.“It shows that they are not ready to redefine what public safety looks like,” says Hayes. “I challenge them to follow Black leadership, and trust we have thought about this for a while and that we are ready to create a pathway to make that happen.”Leading calls to de fund the police are The Youth, an organization of young people in Baltimore who have led a series of marches that have brought thousands into the streets. Thousands took to the streets of Baltimore as part of a youth-led protest to demand justice for#Georgefloydand all victims of police brutality.@jaisalnoorreportspic.twitter.com/Fu4ou8dqJu— The Real News (@TheRealNews)June 2, 2020“We decided this is now or never. As Black youth, our lives are on the line,” said A’niya Taylor an 11th grader at City College High School, who helped organize a June 10 march from The School for the Arts to the City Schools Headquarters. Taylor is demands include cutting the police budget to fund clean drinking water in schools, increased mental healthcare for students, and a culturally relevant curriculum that empowers Black students. The crowd is now observing 8 minutes, 46 seconds of silence.@wjzpic.twitter.com/9kHD9Zy62c— Avajoye Burnett (@AvajoyeWJZ)June 10, 2020The Youth are also demanding an end to the presence of police in schools. In recent years students in Baltimore have marched to demand more funding for education, the lack of adequate heat and air conditioning in classrooms, gun violence, to demand action on climate change and to oppose arming police officers in schools.“There is a chance if we do not do this, we could be the next victims of police brutality,” Taylor said. Many, including parent-activist Melissa Schober have noted Baltimore City is investment in policing pales in comparison to its investment in youth, while spending more than $7 million dollars a year on its own school police force. Baltimore is the only jurisdiction in Maryland with its own school police force.“Given the economic downturn, it is really, concerning that we are going to spend $7 million of scarce resources…on a police force,” Schober said. She explained that Baltimore City school students meanwhile, do not have drinkable water, efficient HVAC, textbooks, lap tops or internet access. Officials in Prince George is County, Maryland announced they were joining a growing number of districts such as Minneapolis and Portland to remove school resource officers (SRO) from schools. On June 10, the Maryland Office of the Public Defender joined that demand.“We cannot wait for a catastrophe at the hands of an armed police officer in our schools to make a change,” OPD is statement read. “By removing SROs from our schools, this Board can take the first important step in dismantling the school security apparatus, and reimagine schools without police. Together, we can create the safe schools our students deserve.”Eleventh grader Taylor said that police simply are not necessary in schools.“I feel like students do not need police, we go to schools to learn, for a lot of students schools are a safe place for us, ” Taylor said. “When we see police officers it is a fear factor, we should invest in guidance counselors and prevention teams,” she said.

BuzzFeed News ReporterEPA Administrator Michael Regan testifies in front of Congress on June 9, 2021. The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled $50 million in new funding on Friday to help low-income and communities of color most impacted by pollution, the climate crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the Biden administration is first big spending blitz on environmental justice, which has formed a cornerstone of his climate policy. And it represents a dramatic increase in funding on an issue largely ignored by the Trump administration.“This is the most aggressive approach to tackling environmental injustice and equity issues,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan told BuzzFeed News ahead of Friday is announcement. “And from the White House to the EPA, we are turning the words into action and we are really excited to get these resources into the hands of communities.”Congress allocated $100 million to the EPA to go towards environmental justice initiatives as part of the latest COVID aid package, the American Rescue Plan signed into law in March. Friday is funding announcement identified how the first half of that money will be spent, and the agency plans to share details on the next $50 million later this summer. The largest chunk of the money — $16.6 million — will go to environmental justice grants to help cities, states, tribes, and territories to fund education on pollution is impacts on the environment and public health, as well as training community members to get jobs in the environmental sector.“What we have all seen firsthand is that COVID-19 has magnified the daily injustices facing communities of color, low income communities, the same communities that will suffer disproportionately from climate change, who face higher rates of heart and lung disease,” Regan said. Some studies have suggested that people living in places across the country with dirty air are more likely to die from COVID-19 than those living with less pollution. Coming in as the first Black man to serve as EPA administrator, Regan vowed to make environmental justice a priority, just as he had in his previous role as the head of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. For Mustafa Santigao Ali, the former EPA environmental justice head under the Obama administration, this funding announcement is long overdue. The Trump administration curbed pollution enforcement, watered down car and power plant pollution rules, and even suspended diversity training programs, all of which “actually deepened and widened the sacrifice zones across the country,” Ali said.“It is great to see for the first time the re is going to be significant resources for these various sets of programs,” he said, adding that to day is funding levels are “magnitudes larger” than what he had to work with at the agency. Regan is announcing this new funding from a water filtration plant in Baltimore, noting that $200,000 is going to a program there called YH20 that trains people from diverse backgrounds to get jobs in water management. Since launching in 2015, YH20 has trained nearly 100 people between the ages of 18 and 24 in local water management. Upwards of 85 of them are still working within Baltimore is Department of Public Works, according to Yolanda Winkler, who helps run the mentor ing and training program. The money from the EPA will help the program “expand in a real and serious way,” Winkler said, including increasing how many people can participate.“YH20 and organizations like them are the perfect organizations to receive the money, to not only relieve the pressure that has been exacerbated by COVID-19, but to relieve pressures that have been present for generations,” Regan said. Some of the additional grant money will go to groups including the Tohono O’odham Tribal Nation in Arizona to help develop plans to address air quality problems, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to boost awareness about air pollution and disinfectants, and theLos Angeles, California housing authority to fund a pilot program boosting worker awareness about asthma. Additionally, $7 million is going to the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act rebate program to fund electric school buses in under served communities, $5.1 million is going to expand civil and criminal enforcement of air and water polluters, and $5 million is going to help cleanup brown field sites. And to help the EPA, which lost hundreds of employees during the prior four years, about $1 million of the money is going towards “administrative costs.”“A lot of it will go to shoring up our basic infrastructure to make sure we have equity and environmental justice included” in the agency is work, Regan said. But he acknowledged that even more resources are needed for the EPA to truly address these issues, and hopes the president is proposed 2022 budget goes further to help fill the gaps.",2,1,BuzzFeed News

By the next day, over a thousand people had registered, and that was only the beginning. Now known simply as Facebook, the site quickly ballooned into one of the most significant social media companies in history. Today,with 244 million combined monthly active users in the USs and Canada, Facebook is the most popular social network in the USs. But like any 17-year old, Facebook has changed since it is infancy. Consider how its mission statement has evolved over time:– Thefacebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at colleges. [Limited to your own college or university]– The Facebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at schools. [Now there are two Facebooks: one for people in college and one for people in high school]– Facebook is an online directory that connects people through social networks at schools.– Facebook is a social utility that connects you with the people around you [Facebook is made up of lots of separate networks – things like schools, companies, and regions]– Facebook is a social utility that connects you with the people around you. [upload photos or publish notes – get the latest news from your friends – post videos on your profile – tag your friends – use privacy settings to control who sees your info – join a network to see people who live, study, or work around you]– Facebook is a social utility that connects you with the people around you. [Use Facebook to… keep up with friends and family, share photos and videos, control privacy online, reconnect with old classmates]– Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.– Facebook gives people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.– Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. When Facebook was a cute toddler everyone loved him, but he has grown into an obnoxious teen, who through lack of discipline, has become a bully. Facebook is bad behavior started slowly, almost imperceptibly. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when it began, but at some point conservative individuals and groups started seeing a decline in engagements with their posts. Laura Evans, a marketing consultant in the firearms industry, has been using Facebook socially and professionally for more than a decade. She was among the first users to discover Facebook is content bias.“In my work with companies and manufacturers in the firearms industry, selling anything on Facebook is impossible,” explained Evans. “The only way we have been able to get around that is through working with social media influencers, but even they are being stifled. They are getting kicked off left and right.”With the advent of content neutral sites such as Parler,conservatives were able to see for the first time how Facebook was suppressing their content. Evans elaborated, “Years ago I talked to a major firearms manufacturer who said Facebook was just a failure for them. At one point they were getting 100,000 views per post and their engagement was through the roof. Then overnight, it vanished and they were lucky if they got a thousand views per week. That is half-a-million fans no longer able to enjoy content from a company they chose to follow.”More recently, Facebook, emboldened by the lack of push back on their covert efforts to censor conservative content, began to overtly censor and ban content and users. The most shocking takedown, of course, was of President Trump is account. But prior to that, Facebook began placing warning labels on political content. In recent months, so many conservatives have been restricted on Facebook, it has become somewhat of a badge of honor among conservatives to be placed in “Facebook jail.”Facebook is actions are at odds with at least one of its core principles,“to give people a voice.” According to itswebsite, “People deserve to be heard and to have a voice — even when that means defending the right of people we disagree with.”At age 17, Facebook has high ideals, which perhaps someday it will live up to.",1,0,Daily Torch

Allegedly, “personal checks drawn on the account of and signed by Donald J Trump, and later drawn on the account of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust dated April 7, 2014” went for tuition payments of Weisselberg is family. Other alleged undeclared benefits received by Weisselberg included lease payments on his Mercedes, housing and cash. For the moment anyway, Cyrus Vance, the district attorney for Manhattan, appears to lack the goods to nail the former president. Relatively speaking, an elephant gave birth to a mouse. Beyond that, Vance is office did not bring racketeering charges against Trump is eponymous company. Arguably if the district attorney had the goods he would have brought the most serious charges on the first go around. Significantly, the indictment did not trigger a default under Deutsche Bank is loan documents. Trump and his lenders can exhale, a little. Right now, the prospects of forfeiture and foreclosure and the necessity of refinancing Trump is loan packages are not staring back at them. By the metrics of scandal, the alleged crime is decidedly underwhelming. Wrongfully taken over tax deductions are quintessentially human, let alone Trumpian. In case anyone forgot, Trump is still undergoing a years-long IRS audit over claimed deductions. The Republican base will shrug. Likewise, giving sweetheart deals to key employees and favored others is textbook New York, a textbook that Trump himself helped write. Back in the day, the day being 2003, a younger Trumpreportedly assistedMarjorie Harris – a close personal friend of the Rev Al Sharpton – to obtain a luxury sublease in a Trump building without undergoing a standard credit check. Harris is financials were not necessarily robust, but at the time Trump was focused on keeping Sharpton happy. In a hyper-transactional world, tuition and cheap housing for the Weisselberg clan were rewards for years of service and loyalty. There is a reason Weisselberg is known as Trump is soldier. He is no Michael Cohen. Rather, Weisselberg is a limelight-avoiding accountant who has so far refused to cooperate with prosecutors. Yet with Weisselberg taking one for the team, the spirit of Roger Stone and Paul Manafort lives on. And we know how that worked out – both men received presidential pardons. But this time Trump is out of office and the charges stem from purported violations of New York is penal law, not the US code. Weisselberg was released on his own recognizance. The guy is no menace to society. As for the midterms, the indictment will not hurt the Republican party is chances. Team Trump and his party will be able to claim “witch-hunt” with a modicum of credibility. All those subpoenas and document productions have yielded little. Florida is governor, Ron DeSantis, may even want to put his presidential ambitions on hold until 2028. A year ago, the US supreme court rejected Trump is contention that he was immune from investigation simply because he lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Writing for a seven-person majority, Chief Justice John Roberts opined: “No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.”Justice Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, put things more succinctly in a concurrence joined by Justice Gorsuch, another Trump appointee: “In our system of government, as this court has often stated, no one is above the law. That principle applies, of course, to a president.”In hindsight, it all sounds a tad overblown. The only member of the Trump Organization facing criminal charges is Weisselberg. Looking back, Weisselberg must be asking: was it worth it? After he was led into the courtroom in handcuffs, we can only guess his answer. Still, do not bet on him flipping. And as trials go, this one is looking mesmerizing ly dull.

A container ship, loaded with sunset-hued cargo, was anchored across the harbor, far from the Puget Sound shipping lanes where it belonged — a hulking, unsightly, and noisy migrant among the bay is resident kayaks, sailboats, and small crabbing boats. Only later would I learn that I'd been lucky to stumble upon just the one unwelcome behemoth:According to local reports, ""As many as four container ships at a time have been anchoring in normally quiet Holmes Harbor since last April because of shipping congestion at the Port of Seattle and beyond.""You may likewise already be acquainted with America is port crisis, dubbed the ""Great Supply Chain Disruption"" of 2021 or, perhaps more fittingly, ""the Everything Shortage."" If you have not encountered it yet, you will soon: Stores are urging customers to begin their holiday shopping, in October, to avoid the inevitable bottleneck that will result from high demand, limited supply, labor shortages, and congested ports. The crisis is already expediting the dreaded Christmas creep. But it is also threatening to reveal to American customers the fragility of our ""I want it now"" mindsets. Instant gratification — normalized over the past decade by Amazon Prime and its promise of two-day shipping — has completely warped the way we shop.

The night before a mountaineering trip a few months ago, for example, I belatedly realized I did not have my preferred blister-preventing sports tape for my stiff climbing boots. I placed an Amazon order after dinner and woke up when the delivery person dropped the tape at my door a few hours later, around 4 a.m. Amazon is incredible speed is becoming the norm. Other companies, to compete, have ramped up their fulfillment pace, too. But this modern-day miracle comes at a cost: the exploitation of workers. In the case of Amazon, it is the horror stories we have heard but usually ignore for personal convenience — the ones about the company sacrificing the safety (and in some cases, lives) of its delivery worker sin favor of speed and low costs. But it is also other stories we may not know. Many supply chain issues can be traced to the Delta variant ravaging under-vaccinated parts of Asia. For example, in order to meet the US consumer demand, the government of Vietnam has ""[adopted] strict measures, including a 'three-in-one-place' policy that requires employees in some highly affected regions to eat, sleep, and work in the workplace to avoid catching and spreading the virus,""writes. Consider also that ""about half of the world is sailors, who are crucial to the flow of global trade, are from developing nations where vaccine rollouts have been slow,""asVoxreports. Often we can ignore that exploitation, but the supply chain crisis highlights it. ""In short,""explains, ""supply chains depend on containers, ports, railroads, warehouses, and trucks."" And currently, ""[e]very stage of this international assembly line is breaking down in its own unique way.""This is all coming to a head right now, and the effect for consumers is an early commercial Christmas. ""I went to Lowe is, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, HomeGoods, and I am already seeing Christmas stuff replace the Halloween stuff, which is ridiculous,""one shopper complained to. ""I am like, hello? Are we just skipping Halloween this year?""Actually, yes: While people be spending the week of October 11th shopping for Elsa costumes and12-foot-tall skeletons, it is looking more like December 18 out there. Stores are pushing customers to place their holiday orders now — or, preferably, yesterday —due to limited stock. Booksellers, who rely on winter sales to put them in the black for the year, are alarmed by publishing delays, compounded by paper shortages, on top of the global supply chain choke. ""October is the new December,"" the American Booksellers Association has declared, reusing the slogan it rolled out amid early signs of stock issues last year. EvenChristmas trees may be in short supply. It is a testament to the power of the American economy that, up to this point, we have been able to enjoy the luxury of showing up to a mall on December 23expecting to find a Bratz doll for our niece still on the shelf. (In 2017, a survey by the National Retail Foundationfound, just over half of Americans did their holiday shopping on the Saturday before Christmas.)This system is incredibly convenient, but is it? Tasked with holiday shopping weeks away from the all-encompassing frenzy of Black Friday and forced to consider what I want to buy for December in October, I have had a clear-eyed reckoning with the amount of unnecessary consumption I do this time of year. And while I am a secular celebrant, I share my former colleagueMatthew Walther is unease over the way we have historically ""allow[ed] corporate marketing departments to set the tempo of our existence.""I'd like to think this supply chain crisis will be a turning point for Americans, an opportunity for us to collectively remember that the holidays are not actually about what is under the wrapping paper. Alas, I am not that naïve. More likely, a lot of confused children will be getting IO U.s from Santa for presents that will arrive on January 15. But maybe, in the flash of irritation that comes from checking the tracking number of a shipment that is making no progress or scanning the bare shelves of a local store, we will briefly recognize our own entitlement. Maybe we will notice, if only for an instant, how a system in which we expect goods to magically materialize in our hands is as fragile and unsustainable as one in which they are delivered to our door by a cadre of flying reindeer.",1,1,The Week

92,Some States Curb Public Access To COVID-19 Statistics Amid Uptick In Cases,-3.67,41.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/states-covid-statistics-cases-hospitalizations-deaths_n_60fc26b4e4b00c1de0a20b10,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Several states scaled back their reporting of COVID-19 statistics this month just as cases across the country started to skyrocket, depriving the public of real-time information on outbreaks, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in their communities. The shift to weekly instead of daily reporting in Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota marked a notable shift during a pandemic in which coronavirus dashboards have become a staple for Americans closely tracking case counts and trends to navigate a crisis that has killed more than 600,000 people in the US In Nebraska, the state actually stopped reporting on the virus altogether for two weeks after Governor Pete Ricketts declared an end to the official virus emergency, forcing news reporters to file public records requests or turn to national web sites that track state data to learn about COVID statistics. The state backtracked two weeks later and came up with a weekly site that provides some basic numbers. Other governments have gone the other direction and released more information, with Washington, DC, this week adding a dashboard on breakthrough cases to show the number of residents who contracted the virus after getting vaccines. Many states have recently gone to reporting virus numbers only on weekdays. When Florida changed the frequency of its virus reporting earlier this month, officials said it made sense given the decreasing number of cases and the increasing number of people being vaccinated. Cases started soaring soon after, and Florida earlier this week made up up one-fifth of the country is new coronavirus infections. As a result, Florida is weekly releases — typically done on Friday afternoons — have consequences for the country is understanding of the current summer surge, with no statewide COVID stats coming out of the virus hot spot for six days a week. In Florida is last two weekly reports, the number of new cases shot up from 23,000 to 45,000 and the n 73,000 on Friday, an average of more than 10,000 day. Hospitals are starting to run out of space in parts of the state. With cases rising,Democratsand other critics have urged state officials and Governor Ron DeSantis to resume daily outbreak updates.“There was absolutely no reason to eliminate the daily updates beyond an effort to pretend like there are no updates,” said state Representative Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from the Orlando area. The trend of reducing data reporting has alarmed infectious disease specialists who believe that more information is better during a pandemic. People have come to rely on state virus dashboards to help make decisions about whether to attend large gatherings or wear masks in public, and understanding the level of risk in the community affects how people respond to virus restrictions and calls to get vaccinated.“We know that showing the data to others actually is important because the actions that businesses take, the actions that schools take, the actions that civic leaders take, the actions that community leaders take, the actions that each of us individually take are all influenced by our perception of what the risk is out the re,” said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who leads the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. But reporting the numbers on a weekly basis still allows people to see the overall trends while smoothing out some of he day-to-day variations that come from the way cases are reported and not the actual number of new cases. And experts have long advised that it makes sense to pay more attention to the seven-day rolling average of new cases because the numbers can vary widely from one day to the next. And Florida health officials say that they have not curtailed the sharing of data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maintaining daily updates on the virus does require significant resources for states. For instance, Kansas went to reporting virus numbers three times a week in May because the state health department said providing daily statistics consumed too much time for its already overwhelmed staff. In Nebraska, officials decided that continuing to update the virus dashboard daily was not the best use of state resources now partly because there had been a steady decline in the number of views of the web site indicating less interest in the numbers, spokeswoman Olga Dack said. The state could return to providing daily updates if the governor is office decided that was needed, she said.“Now that Nebraska is back to normal, some of the staff that has been dedicated to the dashboard has been able to focus on some of the other important issues,” Dack said. State health departments have a long history of providing the public regular updates on other diseases like flu and West Nile, but those viruses have none of the political baggage associated with COVID-19. In Florida, a former health department employee was fired last year after publicly suggesting that managers wanted her to manipulate information on coronavirus statistics to paint a rosier picture. The employee, Rebekah Jones, did not allege any tampering with data, but her comments sowed doubts about the reliability of the metrics. Infectious disease specialist Dr. David Brett-Major said that for many people, national web sites such as the one run by the CDC can be a good source of data on the latest state trends and weekly updates could be OK The World Health Organization often uses weekly updates, but he said they do that for practical data management reasons, not political ones. He said the message Nebraska sent when it ended its dashboard that the state emergency was over and conditions were returning to normal was troubling.“The main problem is that it reflects a disinterest in pandemic risk management,” said Brett-Major, with the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said part of the problem is that public health officials generally do not have sophisticated data systems so it is more labor intensive to produce the daily dashboards. Even though public health agencies have money for operations at a time when pandemic government spending is flush, they have not necessarily had the chance to upgrade.“It would be great if daily reporting could be made widely available, but public health would have to be funded better to do that and right now that is just not the case,” said Hamilton. And even in states where virus numbers are not being reported publicly every day health officials are still looking at the latest data, Hamilton said. But at a time when the delta variant is, in the words of the CDC director, “spreading with incredible efficiency,” Bibbins-Domingo said it is important that everyone can see the latest trends and understand the risks.“Even if we know that they are available to decisionmake rs on a daily basis, there is considerable value to providing the data to the public,” she said.

93,DOJ: Arizona recount may violate federal law,-3.67,45.0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/may/6/doj-arizona-recount-may-violate-federal-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,23,"TheUS Department of Justiceexpressed concerns Wednesday involving the unprecedented private recount currently underway of votes cast in the 2020 presidential election in Maricopa County, Arizona. Pamela S Karlan, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department is Civil Rights Division, warned the recount process may be running afoul of federal statutes it enforces. In a letter to Arizona state Senate PresidentKaren Fann, a Republican, she asked her to explain what steps are being taken to ensure the process complies with federal civil rights and voting laws. Reports suggest ballots and other materials being scrutinized as part of the recount are no longer under the control of state and local election officials and at risk of being compromised, she wrote. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1960, she wrote, election officials are required to maintain for 22 months afterward “all records and papers” relating to any “act requisite to voting” in a federal race.“We have a concern that Maricopa County election records, which are required by federal law to be retained and preserved, are no longer under the ultimate control of elections officials, are not being adequately safeguarded by contractors and are at risk of damage or loss,” Ms. Karlan wrote. Additionally, she added, the Justice Department has concerns involving Cyber Ninjas, a private security company with no prior election auditing experience that has been contracted to lead the recount. Cyber Ninjas recently said in a statement of work that it plans to visit the homes of certain voters to “collect information of whether the individual voted in the election,” she noted.“This description of the proposed work of the audit raises concerns regarding potential intimidation of voters,” Ms. Karlan wrote.“Past experience with similar investigative efforts around the country has raised concerns that they can be directed at minority voters, which potentially can implicate the anti-intimidation prohibitions of the Voting Rights Act,” she added. “Such investigative efforts can have a significant intimidating effect on qualified voters that can deter them from seeking to vote in the future.”A message requesting comment from Ms. Fannwas not immediately returned. Local media reported that lawyers for the Republican-controlled Arizona state Senate she leads are drafting their response. Former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters have maintained for months that supposed voter fraud in Arizona and elsewhere led to him losing his race for reelection to President Biden. No evidence has emerged to corroborate their claims of election voter fraud, however, and the votes cast in Arizona and nationwide have already been certified at both the state and federal levels.

94,Derek Chauvin Convicted on all Charges in Death of George Floyd,1.0,46.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/derek-chauvin-convicted-all-charges-death-george-floyd,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,24,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of all charges Tuesday in the death of George Floyd nearly a year ago. Chauvin had been charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. After hearing closing arguments Monday, the 12-member jury – comprising six white people and six people who are Black or multiracial -- spent about 10 hours over two days discussing information from the three-week trial before coming to a decision. In their final arguments, a prosecutor accused Chauvin, who is white, of killing Floyd, an African American, by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. A defense attorney, Eric Nelson, contended that Floyd died partly from drug use and that Chauvin was following his police training in the way he arrested Floyd last May on the curb of a street in Minneapolis. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher summed up the case against Chauvin, who held down the handcuffed Floyd as Floyd lay prone on a city street and gasped — 27 times, according to videos of his arrest — that he could not breathe.“He was trapped…a knee to his neck,” Schleicher said, with Chauvin is weight on him for nine minutes and 29 seconds.“George Floyd was not a threat to anyone,” Schleicher said. “All that was required was some compassion, and he got none.”“No crime was committed if it was an authorized use of force,” Nelson argued.“The state has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” the legal standard for a conviction, the defense attorney concluded as he asked the jurors to acquit Chauvin of murder and manslaughter charges. Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby convenience store. The routine police investigation of a minor case last May 25 and Floyd is subsequent death have resulted in one of the most consequential US criminal trials in years. Chauvin pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. Last week, Chauvin invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and did not take the witness stand. Under US law, the prosecution must prove the allegations against defendants, and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Trial judge Peter Cahill told the jury not to draw any inference on Chauvin is innocence or guilt from his declining to testify. After dismissing the jury Monday, Cahill criticized Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who is Black and a member of Congress since 1991, for recent remarks regarding the trial. Waters told protesters in Minnesota to “stay on the street” and to become “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin is found not guilty.“I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,” Cahill said. Despite Cahill is plea, US President Joe Biden Tuesday described the evidence against Chauvin as overwhelming.“I am praying the verdict is the right verdict,” Biden said during an Oval Office meeting with Latino lawmakers. “I think it is overwhelming in my view. I would not say that unless the jury was sequestered now.”As the case nears its end, authorities in Minneapolis are bracing for possible street protests after the verdict. Many stores are boarded up to prevent a recurrence of the damage and looting that took place after Floyd is death almost a year ago.“We cannot allow civil unrest to descend into chaos. We must protect life and property,” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said Monday. “But we also must understand very clearly, if we do not listen to those communities in pain and those people on the streets, many of whom were arrested for speaking a fundamental truth that we must change, or we will be right back here again.”Protests, some of them violent, broke out in many cities in the USs and throughout the world after Floyd is death. The Black Lives Matter movement was at the forefront of the demonstrations, but thousands of people who had no previous connection to the Black-led protests joined in to condemn Chauvin is actions, and more broadly, police treatment of minorities. The same issues raised by Floyd is death came to the forefront in the community again when a now-resigned police officer in a Minneapolis suburb fatally shot a 20-year-old African American man during a traffic stop on April 11. Meanwhile, Republicans in the US Congress said they planned to hold a censure vote Wednesday over comments made by Representative Maxine Waters of California. On Saturday, Waters was in the Minneapolis suburb where another Black man had been killed by a police officer earlier this month. Waters told protesters who had gathered in Brooklyn Center over the death of Daunte Wright that she wanted to see a murder conviction against Chauvin. She added, “We gotta stay on the street, we have got to get more active, we have got to get more confrontational, we have got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”On Monday, Judge Cahill called Waters’ comments “abhorrent” and that and they could lead to a verdict being appealed and overturned.

95,"Nevada Legislature special session will not start until Friday, at earliest",-0.33,49.0,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/nevada-legislature-special-session-wont-start-until-friday-at-earliest-2084047/,https://adfontesmedia.com/las-vegas-review-journal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,24,"CARSON CITY — Nevada issecond special legislative sessionwill not start until Friday or possibly into the weekend, according to the spokeswoman for Governor Steve Sisolak. Sisolak said this week that the session could start as early as Thursday. But Sisolak is spokeswoman, Meghin Delaney, said that will have to wait at least one more day.“The second special legislative session will not begin tomorrow. Once the governor feels confident the session is ready to begin, he will issue a proclamation,” Delaney said in a statement Wednesday. Part of the reason for that delay? According to one former lawmaker and another source familiar with the discussions, Sisolak, a Democrat, is pushing for legislation that would grant liability protections for businesses in Nevada, an idea that legislative Democrats have bridled at over concerns that those protections could put workers at risk.“It is going to be delayed a day or two. And the major reason for delay is the governor wants on the agenda legal immunity for businesses to reopen,” Justin Watkins said during a segment on the local sports talk radio program “Cofield and Company” that was also streamed on Periscope. Watkins is a former Democratic state assemblyman who was elected in 2016 but chose not to run again after one term. But Watkins still has close ties to some lawmakers, including Democratic Assemblyman Steve Yeager, the Assembly is speaker pro tempore and a partner at Watkins’ Battle Born Injury Lawyers law firm. Watkins could not be reached for a follow-up comment Wednesday. Sisolak said this week that the second special legislative session of the summer would include policies aimed at “helping stabilize businesses so they do not suffer continued economic hits,” while also addressing safety standards for workers. Sisolak is spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about liability protections. Proponents of those protections for businesses, which include the Nevada Resorts Association and Vegas Chamber, have said they are needed because businesses being held liable for employees or customers contracting COVID-19 would further cripple the economy. Watkins also voiced some the same concerns raised by many labor unions and progressive groups about potential legal immunity for businesses.“You take away all the rights of the employees. You take away all the rights of the customers. And it is incredibly bad policy at any time. But it is especially bad policy in times of emergency,” Watkins said on the show.

96,"Trump, Twitter and the Digital Town Hall",-6.67,33.33,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/trump-twitter-and-the-digital-town-hall/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"The merits are hard to stomach for partisans long jaundiced by presumption and dislike, but the cheer at the de platform ing of Donald Trump by a range of social media platforms said as much about the nature of any sentiment about democracy as it did about those claiming to defend it. For one, it shut off a valve of fantastic, instant recognition to a figure whose thoughts are best aired rather than cellared in underground vats. But cellaring, hiding, suppressing unsavoury viewpoints are the very things social media platforms are getting more enthusiastic about, much of it pushed on the censorious lobby that claims to have a monopoly on veracity and good behaviour. In the name of misinformation, offence and incitement, users will be either suspended, barred or subjected to digital excommunication in the name of safety. Which brings us to the fascinating nature of Trump is latest legal action against Twitter. In January, the former US president was banned from the platform following the January 6thriot at the Capitol building inspired by supporters riled by claims that the election had been stolen. It began as a temporary ban of 12 hours for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy”. Two days later, the ban was made permanent. “In the context of the horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would permanently result in this very course of action,” Twitterclaimed in its January 8 statement. “The company is “public interest framework” existed to permit “the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly.” But this role did not exist “above our rules entirely” and could not be used “to incite violence, among other things.”The reasoning behind the ban was illuminating of a social media giant sitting in shallow judgment. Two of Trump is tweets were singled out: one claiming that 75 million “great American patriots who voted for me” would “not be disrespect ed or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”; the second stating that he would “not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” Assuming the imperious role of civics guardian, the company strained to identify these mutterings as violating “our Glorification of Violence policy”. At the time German Chancellor Angela Merkelcalledthe decision “problematic” while Jens Zimmermann, Social Democrat member of the Bundestag, wondered what it meant “for the future actions of social media platforms”. In July, Trump began his legal battle to seek reinstatement across a range of platforms, filing a class action lawsuit against Google, Twitter and Facebook. “We are demanding an end to the show-banning, a stop to the silencing, and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing, and cancelling that you know so well,”he state dat the time. On October 1, Trump filed am ore specific complaint in the Southern District of Florida claiming that Twitter “coerced by members of the USs Congress” was censoring him. The social media platform, the complaint argues, “exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate”. With 88 million followers, Trump argued that his account had become “an important source of news and information about government affairs and was a digital town hall.”The filing also made a pointed remark to Twitter is somewhat varied approaches to users. Why permit the Taliban, “a known terrorist organization”, room to tweet about their military victories across Afghanistan yet claim that his own efforts had been accused of “glorifying violence”. Resort was also made to Florida is social media legislation, the Stop Social Media Censorship Act, which was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis in May to spite “the Silicon Valley elites” only to be blocked two months later by a bemused judge. One of the plaintiffs, Steve DelBianco of the industry group NetChoice,expressed delight at the absurd proposition that the court ruling “ensured that social media can remain family-friendly”. But equally absurd was the law is idiosyncratic drafting, which included an exemption for companies operating the me parks in Florida. It is likely to perish at the hands of the Federal Appeals Court. Leaving aside the twaddle put forth by DelBianco, the difficulties of targeting social media platforms are almost insurmountable. Content moderation remains a pillar of using such fora, one guaranteed by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which gives the digital giants platform rather than publisher status. And the sacred First Amendment is assumed to apply to government actions rather than corporate mischief. The efforts by Trump to place his legal arguments against Big Tech on the hook of the First Amendment has received little support. One mighty voice in the field of jurisprudence thinking Trump has a case is Alan Dershowitz,who has argued that the case “pits freedom of speech on the one hand against the First Amendment on the other.” Such reasoning can well justify why lawyers deserve a bad name, but Dershowitz sees it as the high-tech behemoths quashing free speech. “They are censoring but they are claiming the right to do so under the First Amendment”. Withering scorn has been levelled at that view. “Unlike delusional Dershowitz,” Democratic Representative Ted Lieuinsistedwith smug confidence, “I read the First Amendment and it does not apply to private sector companies.” Laurence Tribe, formerly Carl M Loeb Professor at Harvard Law School,took a dim view of his former colleague. “How low can a former law professor sink? To call a bogus lawsuit on a fake version of the First Amendment an important case, much less ‘the most important’ of the century? Has he no shame?”Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff, conforming to the fashion of the times,suggesteda retributive remedy: the cancellation of Dershowitz is status as emeritus professor. Harvard Law School had “a professional and ethical responsibility to its community – past, present and future – to associate with faculty who are ethical and have a high regard for the law.”For all such righteous splutters, Dershowitz and Trump have a point in pointing out a symptom of the US body politic that has become cripplingly apparent: business and the interests of capitalism have come to control speech, its circulation, its distribution. For decades, they had already come to guide politicians and political parties, exercising influence through campaign donations. Why run for elected office when you can buy it?In 2010, the US Supreme Court decision of found that limits upon “independent political spending” from corporations and private interest groups violated the First Amendment. Those with deep purses could only deem this the natural order of things: if you have cash, spend it to influence opinion in the name of free speech. Put rather simply, such speech was a shield big capitalism could well employ if it needed to. (Representative Lieu, take note.)Gore Vidal used to remark that anyone seeking the keys to the White House could only do so with the approval of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Had he lived to see the Trump cancellation saga, he may well have added those Big Tech titans to the sterile committee of electoral approval.

99,We Asked Kyrsten Sinema is Office for One (1) Example Where the Filibuster Created Bipartisan Comity,-10.0,36.33,https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a36618396/kyrsten-sinema-filibuster-bipartisanship/,https://adfontesmedia.com/esquire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,23,"It cannot be said that Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are responsible for placing American democracy on the edge of a cliff. This is a development decades in the making, the result of a ceaselessly radicalizing Republican Party and a Democratic opposition that has often lacked the courage and conviction to stop the slide. But now that we have truly arrived, with Republican state legislatures going all out to suppress the vote—and, crucially, to make it easier to overturn future election results they do not like—based on an insane lie for which they have not provided a shred of evidence, and with Republicans at the federal level blocking an investigation into an attempted insurrection following the last election result they did not like, Manchin and Sinema are playing a crucial role. They could work with the rest of the Democratic congressional caucus to arrest this slide at long last. Instead, they are sidestepping. Last week,we asked Senator Manchin is office whether he still supported the kind of filibuster reforms he did back in 2011, when he declared that ""West Virginians deserve a government that works for the m, and they are understandably frustrated with the way things get done—or do not—in Washington."" We did not get a response, but that was somehow better than what Senator Sinema served up on Wednesday. In a press availability alongside Republican Senator John Cornyn,with whom Sinema has embarked on a road trip in order to demonstrate the glories of bipartisan comity, the Arizona Democrat offered a defense of the filibuster that amounted to little more than make-believe. The history and real-world effects of the Senate mechanism that Sinema offered here simply have no connection to reality. Jonathan Chait at magazine has dealt with the various scraps of historical nonsense here. The filibuster was not created by design, it was not created by the Founders, they rejected a super majority procedure for passing the vast majority of bills in the Senate, it was not used until 1837, and its most prominent use throughout the 20th century was to block civil-rights legislation. But on that last point, there are also the just entirely made-up effects of this procedural device Sinema presented here. The senator claimed the filibuster was ""created""—again, a tenuous view of history—to ""create comity and encourage senators to find bipartisanship and work together."" The obvious counterpoint to this is that we have had the filibuster over the last, say, decade, and there has been very little comity and bipartisanship in that time. In fact, the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell,has declared it his top priority under the last two Democratic presidents to block their agenda. Passing laws to grapple with the major issues of our time? Number Obstruction. Still, Esquire reached out to a representative for Senator Sinema to ask for an example of a bill where the filibuster created comity and encouraged senators to find bipartisanship and work together. We will update this if we get a response. But even if they do dig one up, we all know what is going on in the here and now. Sinema was standing next to Texas Senator John Cornyn for this presser, a man who conveniently doubles as a walking counterpoint to the assemblage of words she offered up. When the president is super fans stormed the Capitol to try to prevent the Legislative Branch from confirming he would soon leave power—an assault on the very foundations of American democracy—Cornyn soon hipped to the line that rather than impeach the outgoing president for his crimes against the republic,Congress should form a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate the events of January 6. When it came time to create such a commission at the end of last month, however—and its final design was highly favorable to Republicans considering how many of them were implicated in the nonsense leading up to the Capitol riots—Cornyn and his colleagues blocked it. These are the people with whom Sinema is going to find compromise on voting-rights legislation? They very likely will not even cooperate on an infrastructure bill, unless you think McConnell is obstruction pledge has an exemption for...a massive public-investment initiative that could define Biden is presidency. Get fucking real. Republicans already used gamesmanship to cover up just how much of a lowball their opening counteroffer on infrastructure was. Now they have got Senator Shelley Moore Capito at the White House conducting negotiations with the Biden folks as if when the time comes, no matter how big or small the bill is, essentially the entire Senate Republican caucus will not vote against it. You probably will not even get Mitt Romney on this one. You certainly will not get 10 Republican votes, for this or anything else. The only question that truly remains is whether Sinema really believes this shit. Jack Holmes is a senior staff writer at Esquire, where he covers politics and sports.

President Trump had removed such “training” from the federal government as part of a larger crackdown on the far-left concept of “critical race theory,” which essentially argues that all White people are racist, and claims without evidence that America is an inherently racist and sexist nation. The order prohibited federal agencies from using taxpayer dollars to fund such courses, which would “teach” federal employees about such fictional concepts as “systemic racism” and “White privilege.”Multiple far-left groups voiced their support for Biden is reversal of this policy.

In the first episode of HBO is new miniseries, Shane (played by Jake Lacy) and his new wife, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), arrive on their honeymoon, on an unspecified Hawaiian island, with bagfuls of silk resort-wear and books by Malcolm Gladwell. Alone in their suite, Jake moves in to kiss Rachel, but he is suddenly gripped by a suspicion that all might not be entirely copacetic. “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait wait wait,” he says, detaching himself from his bride and lifting his face up to better sniff out the scent of deficiency. “This is the wrong room.” Thus begins a kind of one-man Waterloo, a furious and eventually bloody war between a luxury hotel and a wealthy guy who suspects he has not gotten absolutely everything he is paid for.was created by Mike White, a veteran screenwriter and an occasional reality-show contestant (he appeared on bothThe Amazing Raceand the David-versus-Goliath-themed season ofSurvivorin 2018) whose work tends to be preoccupied with the foibles of human nature, the tragicomedy of modern life, and the costs that inevitably come with self-actualization. So the setup—a cluster of wealthy guests tries to escape their troubles on vacation at a five-star resort—seems made for satire. White is previous show,Enlightened, was a critically beloved and little-watched series co-created with Laura Dern, who starred as a divorcée seeking out meaning after a personal breakdown. More recently, his in die filmsBeatriz at DinnerandBrad is Statusmine the fault lines of class and ambition in satirical, squirmy fashion. The White Lotusseems to fit within a spate of recent HBO shows about rich people rotting in their own toxic privilege—Succession,The Undoing,Big Little Lies—but it is baggier than those shows while also being, in fleeting moments, more insightful. Across all six episodes, a convincing the sis emerges: The curse of the privileged is that they would rather be miserable than lose even a tiny fraction of the things they have been given. Read: Filthy rich: The power plays of ‘Succession’I did not entirely love, maybe because I spent seven years working in the service industry and the psychic wounds from absorbing people is power plays night after night still have not healed. The series begins with a flash-forward to an airport, where a gloomy Shane watches a mysterious box labeledHUMAN REMAINSget loaded onto a plane. The question of which entitled holidaymaker at the White Lotus resort has died—and how—hangs vaguely over the series as it unfolds, but not intrusively. The show does not expect us to get absorbed in a central mystery or even gawk at the spectacular vistas of American wealth. Rather, it wants us to stew inside the cauldron of moneyed disaffection—to understand why these characters are so doomed by their competitive impulses that they ca not even enjoy a trip to a tropical paradise. White filmed the series on location during the pandemic, using a spectacular cast of players. Murray Bartlett () plays Armond, the ferociously tense manager of the hotel, with a mustache and a rictus grin that is beginning to crack. During the first episode, he coaches a new hire, Lani (Jolene Purdy), on the dynamics of catering to super-rich vacationers; every one of the m, he explains, is a sensitive, overgrown hothouse flower who desperately wants to feel like “the special chosen baby child of the hotel.” Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) is a caftan-clad alcoholic whose voice is a whiny whisper, and whose residual pain engulfs the hotel is staff virtually the second she steps off the boat. Nicole (Connie Britton) and Mark (Steve Zahn) are a Sheryl Sandberg–esque tech-company CFO and her emasculated husband. Their college-student daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend Paula (Brittany O’Grady) sneer at the luxury around them without being willing to disavow it altogether. With a different kind of director,could have been a more sensuous and sumptuous productentirely, all sunsets and succulent walls and dewy boat drinks. The thrill of a show likeSuccession, with its wealth consultants and shinily sterile interiors, is partly in its voyeuristic immersion in the fabulous lives of the 0.001 percent—it is easy to understand why luxury might be addictive. But White seems intent on making his island resort feel more like an ordeal. Exterior scenes have a jaundiced tone. Green leafy prints crawl invasive ly over curtains and bedspreads. Scenes play out against a nightmarish score by the dystopia specialist Cristobal Tapia de Veer (Black Mirror, Humans, The Third Day), which incorporates shrieking instruments over a relentless drumbeat. At the end of the first episode, Shane and Rachel go to bed together, and the camera films them for far too long through a frame of fluttering drapes on the balcony, implicating viewers for peeping in a discomfiting way. Read: On TV, having wealth means you get to suffer beautifullyThe show has notes of absurd humor, but they tend to be loaded with ugliness. “Would you like a second toilet?” Armond asks Shane, who is demanding to know what other upgrades are available. “I dreamed I was on top of this beautiful mountain range in Asia and I had a cyanide pill,” Tanya tells Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the spa manager, whose equilibrium and care she feeds off of like a succubus. At one point, Mark is floored by a health crisis and a revelation about his father; the scene is played for laughs and yet feels disturbingly unfunny. White is not unsympathetic toward his characters—Coolidge, in particular, delivers an extraordinary performance and tenderizes a woman who, in lesser hands, could have been a ghoulish caricature. Still, he seems stuck between acknowledging their unhappiness and skewering them for their toxic behavior, never quite extending all the way in one direction or another, never allowing the show to be purely funny or purely tragic for a minute. Everything is a push-pull between feeling for his rich, monstrous characters and loathing them for not seeing the truth about the mselves. But if is clear on the sins of the elite, it does not let its below-stairs characters off the hook either, or patronize their virtuous labor in aDownton Abbeykind of way. Armond can be as tyrannical, abusive, and petty as the guests he caters to. The series is most sympathetic toward Belinda, who is consumed by the vampiric emotional demands of wealthy women, but it also makes clear that she has her own agenda in getting close to them. Every interaction in the series is an exchange of power, and even when people try their hardest to use that power in benevolent ways, or to redistribute it, things go awry. “Nobody cedes their privilege,” Mark tells his wife and kids during a tense dinner debate. “That is absurd. It goes against human nature. We are all just trying to win the game of life.”And that,suggests, is exactly the problem. We are so hardwired to want to accumulate things—possessions, money, experiences, even people—that sacrificing any of them feels harder and more painful than unhappiness itself. As Mark and Nicole is son says toward the end of the series,“We are all just parasites eating the last fish and throwing our plastic crap in the ocean.”",1,1,The Atlantic

The administration and others filing friend-of-the-court briefs inMahanoy Area School District vs BL(Case Number 20-255) stress the need for schools to be able to respond to threats of violence as well as speech that bullies other students. And they argue that the prevalence of remote learning due the the COVID-19 pandemic makes it all the more important that the authority of school officials be clarified.“When it comes to online activity—especially salient during the current pandemic—many of students’ contacts and social-media ‘friends’ are likely to be fellow students, so anything they post online reasonably could be expected to ‘reach’ the school,” says the brief filed March 1by Acting US Solicitor General Elizabeth B Prelogar. The merits briefs by the school district and its supporters come in a case over the discipline of a high school student who posted a vulgar message on Snapchat in 2017 a dispute involving her cheerleading team. The the n-sophomore student, identified in court papers as BL, posted a message on Snapchat one Saturday night that said “F*** school ... f*** cheer f*** everything” after she was placed on the junior varsity cheerleading team instead of the varsity squad. The “snap” came to the attention of cheerleading coaches at Mahanoy Area High School, who said it violated team and school rules. BL was removed from the JV team for the season, a decision upheld by administrators and the school board. The student sued under the First Amendment, winning in a federal district court and in the US Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, in Philadelphia. The appellate court issued a broad ruling last year interpreting the US Supreme Court is landmark 1969 decision inTinker vs Des Moines Independent Community School District, which upheld student speech as long as school was not substantially disrupted. The 3rd Circuit court said in theMahanoycase thatTinkercategorically did not apply to off-campus speech, and thus schools could not discipline “speech that is outside school-owned, -operated, or -supervised channels and that is not reasonably interpreted as bearing the school is imprimatur.”The Supreme Court granted review of the Mahanoy district is appeal of that decision in January. The court could hear arguments in the case in April and issue a decision by this summer, though the justices have not yet set the schedule for the court is April argument session and there is a chance the case could be bumped over to next term. The Mahanoy district argues in its main brief that the First Amendment does not prohibit schools from disciplining student off-campus speech that is directed at the school campus and is substantially disruptive.“The ubiquity of smartphones, plus the added complexity of the COVID remote-learning environment, makes the decision below” unjustifiable, the district is brief says. “Wherever student speech originates, schools should be able to treat students alike when their speech is directed at the school and imposes the same disruptive harms on the school environment.”The Biden administration, in its brief, says that “the broad range of speech engaged in by students when off campus is beyond the proper purview of school officials” and “there is good reason to be wary of any rule that would permit an over broad opportunity for the discipline of such speech.”But the administration agrees that the 3rd Circuit is categorical rule is incorrect. It argues that among the categories of off-campus speech that could justify regulation by school officials is speech by an extracurricular participant that targets teammates or threatens team cohesion. The National School Boards Association, joined by the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and AASA, the School Superintendents Association,argues in a briefthatTinkergives school officials the authority to discipline “disruptive” behavior regardless of whether it is on-campus or off-campus.“The 3rd Circuit is categorical rule is especially ill-suited for to day is social media age,” the NSBA brief says. “Students can disrupt the school community from anywhere simply by hitting send, and the same tweet, Instagram post, or you name it will have the same impact no matter where it was sent.”Abrief by the Cyberbullying Research Centerand other groups emphasized the prevalence of online bullying among students and the need of schools to be able to respond regardless of where the bullying originated. The National Education Associationfiled a brief that does not support one party or the other in the Pennsylvania dispute, but argues that schools must be able to respond to threats and harassment that disrupt the school environment.“Warning signs of the next school shooting can appear in off-campus student speech,” the NEA brief says. “If school officials cannot respond to signs that portend a threat to safety, the learning environment at school will suffer.”And a group of First Amendment and education law scholars,in a brief that also supports neither party, argues the 3rd Circuit is categorical rule went too far and school officials should be allowed to regulate online student speech that has a close nexus to school grounds and is reasonably likely to cause substantial disruption at school. But under these scholars’ test, school officials would not be able to discipline speech that is “bona fide commentary” on matters of public concern or critiques of the school or officials.“Giving school officials power to censor bona fide online commentary raises serious questions about the suppression of student dissent from the school is chosen educational mission,” the scholars’ brief says. “It invokes the specter of signaling to students that they cannot express bona fide disagreement with what is happening at school, even when they use their own device at home, not on school time.”BL is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which has argued that the student is Snapchat message was a “spontaneous, non-threatening, non-harassing” expression of her frustrations over cheerleading that should not subject her to school discipline. BL is merits brief, as well as briefs from her allies, responding more fully to the arguments of the school district and the other newly filed briefs are due at the high court in about a month.",2,1,Education Week

Graham now says he supports “any effort to move forward” to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seat. Earlier Saturday, President Trump tweetedthat he intended to move forward with nominating Ginsburg is successor “without delay.”Back in 2016, Graham was singing a very different tune. When Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on Obama-nominee Judge Merrick Garland, Graham said it was too close to the election even though at the time of late Justice Antonin Scalia is death in February it was roughly nine months away.“I want you to use my words against me,” Graham said at the time. “If the re is a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let is let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.” He has since reissued that promise several times over. In 2018, he said that following a potential seat vacancy in the final year of Trump is term the Senate would “wait to the next election.”“If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump is term, and the primary process has started, we will wait to the next election,” he said. But Graham began to set the stage for his epic reversal more recently when he said in Maythat “appointing judges is a high priority for me in 2020,” and that Merrick Garland was “a different situation.”“You had the President of one party nominating, and you had the Senate in the hands of the other party. A situation where you have got them both would be different. I do not want to speculate, but I think appointing judges is a high priority for me in 2020,” Graham said during a “Full Court Press” interview with Greta Van Susteren. Graham completed his reversal Saturday — the day after the Ginsburg is death — that he would support a Supreme Court nomination by President Trump.“I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,” Graham wrote. In light of these two events, I will support President@realDonaldTrumpin any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg.#3— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC)September 19, 2020",1,1,Talking Points Memo

105,"Suicide Crisis In Prisons Compounded By COVID-19, Lack Of Health Care",-1.33,41.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/16/suicide-crisis-in-prisons-compounded-by-covid-19-lack-of-health-care/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-16,22,"In the normal course of its work connecting prisoners across Wisconsin via email correspondence and newsletters, theIncarcerated Workers Organizing Committee of Milwaukeereceives reports of the deaths of incarcerated people from their fellow prisoners. One recent report involved Kristopher Carlisle, who was incarcerated at the Columbia Correctional Institution. According to the report, Carlisle was in poor health, suffering from diabetes and requiring a wheelchair, yet he was given only a walker and made to climb stairs multiple times a day for meals, medication, blood sugar checks, and other routine necessities. On January 14, Carlisle crawled to the upper tier of his cell block and dove over the railing, falling two stories to his death. Deaths like Carlisle is are not uncommon within prisons across the USs, where administrators’ neglect of inmates’ general health care needs are compounded by their particular neglect of adequate suicide prevention. Worse yet, even the relatively robust network of suicide prevention resources available to the general public do little to assist prisoners. The heightened rates of illness-related deaths among prisoners in the USs are matched by suicide rates. When figures available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics(BJS) and the Centers for Disease Controlare compared, it becomes clear prisoners suffer from significantly higher mortality rates from preventable diseases than the wider population, including cancer (30 percent to 22 percent), heart disease (30 percent to 23 percent), and liver disease (7 percent to 2 percent). Similarly, suicide rates are nearly four times higher among prisoners (7 percent) than the general public (2 percent), reaching a 16-year peak in 2016. In fact, some prisoners and their advocates believe that suicide rates may actually be even higher, however, they are obscured by administrators as accident-related deaths (1 percent). Prisoners’ advocacy groups like the Southern Center for Human Rightsalso report that suicide rates have reached “unprecedented levels” due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, especially since administrators responded to the virus by keeping inmates in their cells for weeks at a time. A sense of the new reality can be gleaned from the more recent reports received by IWOC Milwaukee, as the Wisconsin Department of Corrections confirms COVID infections in the thousands. On the evening of October 24, a prisoner at Fox Lake Correctional Institution reported two ambulances were called to the “quarantine wings.” Whether the ambulances were responding to COVID cases, other emergency medical conditions, or instances of self-harm remained unclear.“Suicides within prisons and correctional facilities are rapidly becoming the rule and not the exception,” argued Nicasio Cuevas Quiles III, an inmate at Prairie du Chien Correctional Institution. “Statistics remain the highest unreported occurrence within prisons as the primary cause of death—second only to deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”“The [Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC)] seems very good at burying such statistics as accidents and other causes, trying very hard not to admit that the re is a problem,” reiterated Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) Milwaukee organizer Robert Thibault. Prisoners the mselves connect inadequate health care with the preponderance of suicide. Jeremiah Grube, an inmate at New Lisbon Correctional Institution, describes being diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed methylphenidate, better known as Ritalin, in 2004. But because Grube is now unable to obtain his medication from the prison psychiatrist, he self-medicates with contraband opiates and methamphetamine. He has also seen where that may lead, pointing to the suicides of two fellow prisoners: Shawn McNutt on January 7, 2019, and Scot Weiss on October 5.“The prison does not help or treat addiction at all,” said Grube. “People rather die than live in pain.”The pain prisoners experience is compounded by the negligence with which it is received by administrators. Not only are inmates’ health care needs routinely ignored, as in the cases of both Carlisle and Grube, but even their suicide attempts are scorned. Prisoners complain of staff making suicide jokes, threatening suicidal inmates with isolation, or simply ignoring suicide attempts.“It is a common ‘mistake’ for guards to just walk away, saying they believed the inmate was being manipulative or misleading, or making threats out of anger and did not really mean it,” explained Aaron Pavin, a prisoner at Waupun Correctional Facility. “Then the inmate harms the mself, and no one gets in trouble.”Representatives from both the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections tout their respective staffs’ mandatory suicide prevention training, which they say is delivered on a regular basis and includes instruction on mental illness. According to John Beard, director of communications for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, state prisons averaged less than four suicides per year from 2010 to 2019. Beard claimed suicide prevention resources available to prisoners include clinical monitoring, crisis services, emergency call buttons in restrictive housing cells, and more. Yet all of the prisoners interviewed by Shadowproof described the services available as inadequate — or, in the words of one interviewee, “a joke.”The belief that prisoners are malingering, or exaggerating the risk of suicide for their own benefit, is so persistent that the National Institute of Corrections sharesresourceslike, “Is He Faking? Why You Should Treat All Suicide Threats as Real.”Outside the prison walls, suicide prevention resources are relatively prevalent. The best-known of these isth e National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a network of more than 180 crisis centers across the USs, which make up the leading suicide prevention effort in the country. Callers to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is hotline number are routed to local crisis centers for free mental health services and emotional support. But the lifeline provides no inmate-specific support.“The lifeline provides support to anyone that contacts the lifeline,” explains Hannah Collins, a communications manager with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Collins notes that, while she is not aware of a nationwide suicide prevention initiative specifically supporting prisoners, the individual crisis centers associated with National Suicide Prevention Lifeline may have their own, independent programs to that end. However, after contacting all four crisis centers based in Wisconsin, Shadowproof was unable to confirm that even one provided support specifically to local prisoners. On the contrary, a representative from one crisis center, Journey Mental Health Center in Madison, explained that the center provides support to those released from prison, but not those currently incarcerated. Denied adequate health care or suicide prevention resources inside, and unable to access the more prevalent prevention resources available outside, prisoners are left to fend for the mselves as circumstances become increasingly dire. As previously mentioned, the latest figures from the BJS indicate that suicide among prisoners reached a 16-year high in 2016—well before the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic threatened to turn every sentence into a death sentence. The intersection of already rising suicide rates and the failure of administrators to adequately respond to the pandemic raises the spectre of even more deaths from self-harm, lending greater urgency to the calls for release from prisoners and their advocates. Since mid-March, IWOC Milwaukee has argued for the release of all prisoners age 60 and over, as well as those expecting trial, and a halt to all arrests. “It only takes one misstep to turn an isolated, overpopulated institution into a death camp,” reads the appeal. But as with the suicide crisis, the question remains: is anyone listening?",1,1,Shadowproof

At that hearing, Republican senators pressed him on several issues, perhaps most notably the rights of transgender students to participate in athletic events that match their gender identity. But his exchanges with lawmakers generated few surprises, especially when compared with the hearing for former education secretary Betsy DeVos four years ago (although the education committee also reported her nomination favorably to the full Senate). As the February 3 hearing drew to a close, Burr called Cardona, who is Connecticut is education commissioner and was unveiled by Biden as his nominee in December, “eminently qualified” for the job. If confirmed by the full Senate, Cardona will be faced with numerous challenges at the Education Department.

Wall of Moms, whose members said they aimed to support and protect other Black Lives Matter protesters near the fence in front of the federal courthouse, announced Friday that its white leadership had rescinded their positions to allow women of color to be in charge. New leaders announced Friday include Teressa Raiford, executive director of Do not Shoot Portland, Demetria Hester and Danialle James. But less than a week later, Do not Shoot Portland took to Instagram tourge people against supporting the Wall of Moms, saying that it was no longer working with the moms group. EDIT FOR EVERYONE UPSET ABOUT THIS POST: WE ARE NOT AGAINST MOMS! EVERYONE HAS A PLACE IN ORGANIZING. WE ARE NO LONGER IN SUPPORT OF WOM LEADERSHIP. ANTI-BLACKNESS. DO NOT SUPPORT @wallofmoms #WALLOFMOMS. . After leaving vulnerable Black women downtown after marching, failing to support those on the ground that put trust in the m, @wallofmoms leadership also found time to make THREE registrations through Oregon is Secretary of State. This was all done in privacy and without the knowledge of the Black leadership WOM was claiming to implement. The lies are finally clear and we are sad but ultimately not surprised that anti-Blackness showed it is ugly face with Wall of Moms. This all came to light over the last 24 hours - We began having safety concerns within the group because Black women started saying they were not protected by WOM leadership. Too frequently would be in communication for safety, transport etc and when the time came, there would be zero response and no leadership to rely on. It is put many on the ground in direct danger. Once these registration filings with Secretary of State came out, it became more clear - WOM was not started for BLM, but to get the feds out of PDX None of the Black leadership WOM claimed to implement knew about this. Combined with a lack of care for and disregard of Black women, we were used to further an agenda unrelated to BLM Please do not support this organization anymore. We need everyone to show up against racism, but it is even more crucial to prioritize transparency and accountability. . The Wall of Moms . The Wall of Moms PAC AND Wall of Moms as an entity name: post shared byDo not Shoot PDX(@dontshootpdx) onJul 29, 2020 at 9:06am PDT“The lies are finally clear and we are sad but ultimately not surprised that anti-Blackness showed its ugly head,” read the post published on Wednesday by Do not Shoot Portland, a local Black Lives Matter and mutual aid group founded in 2014. The Wednesday post alleges that Wall of Moms founder Bev Barnum filed for business registrations without consulting the newly instated Black leaders and that the safety of Black members at the nightly protests in downtown Portland was overlooked. The post said that issues of Black mothers’ safety have only come to light in the past 24 hours. Barnum appeared to file three business registrations on Tuesday including one that makes The Wall of Moms a 501c3 nonprofit. Do not Shoot Portland interpreted the filings to mean that Wall of Moms goal was to get federal officers out of Portland -- not to support Black Lives Matter, according to the Instagram post. The newly instated Black leaders were not told about the registrations, according to the post.“None of the Black leadership WOM claimed to implement knew about this,” the Wednesday post reads. “Combined with the lack of care for Black women, we were used to further the agenda unrelated to BLM.”Do not Shoot Portland is statement was retweeted on Twitter by the Wall of Moms’ official Twitter account. The Wall of Moms answered a commenter is question saying, “The founder went rogue. Many of us do not agree with her decisions. And she does not currently have access to this account.”The Wall of Moms tweeted just before 1 p.m. that it is trying to regroup and “do things the right way,” but that there were no official announcements. Hey team, by now y'all have heard about the drama unfolding. Lots of us are trying to regroup and do things the right way. No official announcements yet - standby.#BlackLivesMatterIn a comment Barnum appeared to post Wednesday morning on the private Wall of Moms Facebook group, she addressed the situation.“The announcement of the 501c3 really hurt some of you,” she wrote. “That was never my intention. In fact, it was just the opposite. WOM will be led by a BIPOC board and BIPOC advisor committee. WOM is a group that supports BLM, not a BLM group. If that is not good enough for you, please feel free to leave this group. And if you currently volunteer your time, please feel free to leave your positions.”A newFacebook group has formed called Moms United for Black Lives. A post from Faith Lightsy, a member of the group said she and others are in contact with Raiford, Hester and James to figure out what to do next.“This group is only a few hours old with 3k members already...please be patient with us. I am in direct contact with Teressa and she has asked repeatedly this group be centered around Demetria and Danialle,” the post read. Wall of Moms and Do not Shoot Portlandfiled a joint federal lawsuitMonday against the US Department of Homeland Security. The filing accused federal officers of violating their free speech and using excessive force.

109,A Transgender Potato Head? Hasbro is Classic Plastic Toy Experiences a Change,10.0,32.67,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2021/february/a-transgender-potato-head-hasbros-classic-plastic-toy-falls-to-the-trans-agenda,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-broadcasting-network-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-25,25,"Chalk up another unusual headline to the LGBTQ agenda. This time it is not a television or movie character who appears to have sudden gender confusion, it is a children is toy that has been around for almost 70 years. Hasbro, the company that makes Mr. Potato Head, announced the potato-shaped plastic toy has been given a gender-neutral new name: Potato Head. Mr. Potato Head first hit the toy scene in 1952, when it did not even come with a plastic potato — kids had to supply their own vegetable to poke eyes, a nose, or mustache into. Hasbro, which also makes Monopoly and My Little Pony, bought the brand and eventually added a plastic potato. It is just the latest move by corporate America in what they say is an effort to modernize their classic brands. Barbie-maker Mattel released agender-neutral doll line in 2019. Barbie also shed her blonde image and now comes in multiple skin to nes and body shapes. Thomas the Tank Engine added more girl characters. And American Girl is now selling a boy doll. As part of the rebranding, Hasbro will release a new Potato Head play set that will let kids create their own type of families, including multiple moms or dads. The Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters will live on in some form, Hasbro said but did not provide details. Dropping the ""Mr."" from its brand name could encourage other companies to not assign genders to their toys – a trend that has already been happening, said Ali Mierzejewski, editor in chief at toy review site The Toy Insider. Shortly after the hot potato announcement went public, Hasbro appeared to be working on damage control, saying Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are not really gone after all:Hold that Tot – your main spud, MR. POTATO HEAD is not going anywhere! While it was announced today that the POTATO HEAD brand name & logo are dropping the ‘MR.’ I yam proud to confirm that MR. & MRS. POTATO HEAD are not going anywhere and will remain MR. & MRS. POTATO HEADpic.twitter.com/6I84KrxOLQ",1,1,CBN
110,Our uncomplicated love of Alex Trebek,0.0,38.33,https://www.mic.com/p/our-uncomplicated-love-of-alex-trebek-42393720,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,25,"There was so much time to brace for the inevitable, in the months sinceAlex Trebekwas diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer back in spring of 2019, but it still did not seem like he would ever leave. Unflappable as ever, he just kept on hosting— often in excruciating pain, during a pandemic, and with the same trademark composure. Early Sunday morning, Trebek died at 80, after a nearly two-year battle with cancer. Trebek was born in Sudbury, Ontario, where he’d go on to work as a bellhop in the same hotel where his father worked as a chef. Before he became the consummate game show host, Trebek took up a career in broadcasting, working for Canada is CBC and taking any range of assignments that came his way. Chalk up his steely demeanor and grab bag of knowledge to his time as a newsroom underling, but Trebek had to work his way through a number of marginal hosting gigs upon moving to the US in the ‘70s. These shows —,Double Dare,Classic Concentration,High Rollers, and more — rarely lasted more than a few years, but he honed his skill as a wry, dependable host nevertheless. Not until seizing the syndicated version ofJeopardy!in 1984 did he really find his foothold as a cross-generational institution. He departs as one of the last true universally beloved figures in American culture through his run on, 36 years, more than 8,000 episodes, and seven Daytime Emmy Awards later. It is not the kind of blueprint you can follow easily — occupying the consistency and down-the-middle frankness of an old guard network news host, with the playful warmth to leave a formative impression on the right viewer. In one of the final episodes to air before his death on Sunday — it should be noted, the series still has enough Trebek-hosted episodes to run until December 25 — champion Burt Thakur tearfully told Trebek that watchingJeopardy!every night with his grandfather helped him learn English. Despite his role as this sort of paternal, instructive presence, Trebek was a delightful bundle of contradictions. He was like the kind, knowing professor, who could still be kind of a bully and stare you down over his glasses. As host of an unbelievably nerdy enterprise — a dinner-hour trivia program that has not considerably updated its aesthetic since it began — Trebek still managed to playfully chide contestants for not knowing the answers to fairly basic sports questions or being into nerd core hip-hop. He’d bring the same reverent cadence to reciting lyrics from an old opera as he would top 40 rap lyrics. Trebek was almost entirely averse to bullshit on air, except for the rare occasion when he absolutely reveled in it. It feels like a safe assumption that no one will ever maintain this kind of presence again on network or syndicated television, with viewers hip splintered across platforms and ideologies. With murky enough politics so as not to alienate either side of the spectrum, liking Trebek never communicated a discernible world view beyond enjoying a calming trivia show over dinner. His closest analogues — late-night hosts, national news anchors, and Pat Sajak — have all but alienated half of the country in one way or another, despite their best efforts. Trebek was just a host who seemed like the smartest guy in the room, or at least smart enough to corral some of the smartest people in America.will find a new host to replace Trebek — it is too sturdy an institution to not, and he repeatedly maintained that he did not want to see the show is legacy die with him. But losing Trebek marks the end of a certain type of TV guy — the kind who maintained public trust through sheer volume, dependability, and neutrality. Although Trebek and Chadwick Boseman departed on decidedly different terms — one suffering publicly and transparently, while the other isolated close colleagues from the grim prognosis — they both treated their work as a sort of public service so much as the ideal coping mechanism. Not everyone has the resources, stamina, or emotional capacity to spend their final years in this way, but it is the kind of selfless embrace — of believing that your work serves a greater purpose to people like Burt Thakur — that led them to keep going in the face of impossible circumstances.",1,1,Mic
111,Day Three of the Republican Convention: One Week of Honesty on TV Every Four Years,27.0,28.67,https://spectator.org/rnc-day-three-honesty-media/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,23,"Preface: A Stream of Consciousness on Media Bias, Mass Brainwashing of College Kids and American Voters, and Cancel CultureOnlyone more day of truth left for prime-time television, and the n we will have to wait four more years. In starklingo,Winter Is Coming, and we soon will resume being lectured onWhite Walkerprivilege. It has been such a wonderful three days. I variously channel-surfed to stations I have not watched for years: CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC It was so nice. It was like we had a fair and honest media again. Fair is fair, and they gave the Democrats four such nights last week. That is fine. And if we did not know better, we would be thinking that now the media honorably maintain the balance by giving the GOP four nights. But we know it all is an illusion, a mirage. Of the 209 weeks in a Quadrennium, we get one — actually only four of the seven days of that one week. The Democrats get the other 208. We have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. It is a shame, because that kind of one-sided bias indeed does brainwash people. There is no question but that the lopsided domination of Left Media — the “mainstream” media — not only causes a falsified narrative to be disseminated, but it ultimately intimidates and brainwashes people. Of course it does. A person thinks to himself or herself a certain thought or idea and the n finds that “everyone else” disagrees. In time, of course it impacts thinking. That is how the Left has taken over universities and truly brainwashed two generations of their own zombie White Walkers. Of course they have. That is why we heard so much at this GOP convention about Cancel Culture and repression of conservative ideas. Left-wing professors mix their assigned course materials with their own propaganda. They load their syllabi to force students to read only one message, that of the Left. Even 40 years ago, when I majored in political science at Columbia University, I never once heard the name “Ayn Rand” except when I went into the student health clinic one time with an otolaryngological irritation, and the doctor, a closet libertarian, made small talk with me. All I had been reading for four years was Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Karl Marx, Stokely Carmichael, and the Friedrich Engels–Karl Marx Reader. That was the n; it is so much worse now. Yes, Ocasio-Hyphen is not super smart, but sheal so is not super stupid. If we are honest, not just calling people names, we recognize that she speaks coherently, sat through four years of college, passed her tests, got a graduate degree. We fool ourselves by saying that she simply is “stupid.”Rather, she represents something more egregious: O-Hyphen is what happens when you take an average — that is, a mediocre — intellect, and the n force-feed it left-wing pulp for four or six years. That is why she says, in her alternate universe, that the 25thAmendment was passed to stop Franklin Roosevelt from winning a fifth term. That is not “stupid” in the purest sense; rather, that isignorant— abysmal ignorance. That is why she cannot individuate between gas chambers and crematoria in Auschwitz, on the one hand, and ICE compassionately caring for, feeding, and medically treating illegal aliens on the other. And how can she be so ignorant that she does not know the 25th Amendment was passed well after FDR died in office?Because she was force-fed years of leftist pulp. Why is she a “socialist” (the homogenized name for “communist”)? Because that is what she was taught for six years, that is what she was assigned to read and to regurgitate on her exams: pure pulp fiction. Of course the enormous media bias — 208 out of 209 weeks devoted to the Democrat-Left — tilts minds. People get deeply impacted by what they think the people around them think. It is rare to find people strong enough to defy the majority, the “common wisdom,” especially when the majority also can fire you and take away the livelihood you need to feed your family, if you do not conform. That is why so many professors who are conservatives hide their views on campuses, while the leftist professors bellow. That even is why some conservative professors publicly espouse a liberal perspective in the classroom but the n privately struggle with their consciences off campus, as they share with others who share their views how deeply frustrated they are. It is a Cancel Culture in which we live. And that is why even “science” cannot be trusted on first blush, because even “science” is politicized. If you publish the right “science,” you get the grants and funding to continue your “research.” If you publish the wrong science, even though the data are unmistakable, your funding dries up, and you are canceled. Thatis the climate that needs to be changed. When CNN fired myAmerican Spectatorcolleague, Jeffrey Lord, for tweeting “Sieg Heil!” to the president of Media Matters, whom Jeffrey was criticizing for being anti-free-speech bigots, employing fascist-style tactics to shut down opposing speech in the tradition of repressive Hitler and Mussolini propaganda machines, Jeffrey was perfectly justified in using that hyperbole. No one thought he was advocating Nazism; that would be as insane an inference as when the Left media went crazy on Laura Ingraham four years ago, manipulating a photo where she waved to the GOP convention crowd with an understandably outstretched arm, and they said she had given a Nazi salute. It all is crazy. But CNN used that tweet as their excuse to drop Jeffrey as a commentator. That is Cancel Culture. It happens all over, in every institution where the Left holds sway. I live with it every single day in academia. I always am one joke away, one adjective, one noun away from being canceled. Take this joke, which is not even all that funny (by my finely honed New York Jewish Catskills humor):“A priest, a pastor, and a rabbit walk into a bar. The rabbit says to the bartender: ‘Do not look at me. I am just a typo.’ ”I would not dare tell that joke on a university campus. First of all, as noted, it is below my humor standards. But more than that, which snowflake will be offended? Someone who is a recovering alcoholic? An atheist? Or maybe someone who complains that the professor used an animal that is …White? Why did not the professor use a bear? Or a seal? Or a Doberman Pinscher in the joke? Well,duh, because that does not work in that joke. A Doberman is not a typo of “rabbi.” But that is why JerrySeinfeld no longer will do comedy on campuses:The younger generation “just want to use these words,” Seinfeld said. “‘That is racist, that is sexist, that is prejudice.’ They do not even know what they are talking about.”So Day Three is an exciting respite, but the oxygen is waning and soon will be gone for 47 months and three weeks. It was a great night, so inspiring that I stopped taking notes and just enjoyed it like a great symphony. OK, a symphony joke — since I am not on campus right now:A guy goes to the cemetery where Beethoven is buried. As he approaches the grave, he sees it is open, and Beethoven actually is sitting up, with pages of music in front of him, vigorously rubbing it all out with an eraser. He is just erasing everything, and the page is titled “Ninth Symphony.” So the guy says: “Beethoven, what in the world are you doing in your grave?” And Beethoven says, “I am decomposing.”Day Three at the GOP ConventionOK, back to the convention Day Three. It was a wonderful night. An Ode to Joy. And yet it also was somber and about real life. Kayleigh McEnany told her deeply moving story of the double mastectomy she voluntarily underwent because she was diagnosed with the gene that can cause the same fatal breast cancer that killed her close relatives. She assured us that she knows this president, and he will cover pre-existing conditions. She also told us that he showed enormous personal caring, the side the media obscure. Trump deeply cares about people. There are so many stories of this genre that the media cover up. Kellyanne Conway spoke, and we know she is stepping out now to be a Mom after having done masterfully as counselor to the president. She has to focus on the child at home; besides that focus on Husband George, she also wants to devote more time to the kids in this era of remote learning via Zoom. Sister Deirdre Byrne, MD, of the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts, and a former army surgeon, talked forthrightly about the sanctity of life, a very different message and focus than the nun that Joe Biden had at his convention. Lou Holtz, the legendary Notre Dame football coach, gave a fabulous speech for Trump. Michael McHale, president of the National Association of Police Organizations, spoke about the chaos in the streets of Democrat cities and praised President Trump is unbridled support for our First Responders. After Representative Elise Stefanik of upstate New York called out the shame and fiction of last December is Democrat Debacle, the bogus impeachment that got crushed a few weeks later in the Senate like the spider it was, Jack Brewer spoke. He is a former NFL safety who set special-team records for tackles on teams where he played. He was emphatically pro-Trump, as NFL great Herschel Walker was the day before, and — like Walker and so many others speaking at the convention — he is Black. He returned to Joe Biden is racist the me that, if you do not vote for Biden, “You ai not black.” Brewer is Black, as are Vernon Jones, the Georgia state representative; Kim Klacik, the Baltimore congressional candidate; Herschel Walker; US Senator Tim Scott; and the many other Black figures supporting Trump. Do you know who actuallyai not Black?Joe Biden. There was Chen Guangcheng, blind since his youth and a self-taught attorney, who was locked up in China for four years and the n placed under further house arrest because he opposed the Communists’ one-child policy. He made it to America by escaping house arrest and fleeing to the US embassy in Beijing. Unlike Ocasio and Bernie, Elizabeth Warren and the whole left-tilted Democrat Party, Mr. Guangcheng is fiercely pro-Trump and anti-socialism. Or, as Joe Biden might say, “Man, if you are for Trump and against socialism,you ai not Chinese.” New York Representative Lee Zeldin spoke. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa talked about how Trump raced to support Iowa when it was hit with natural disasters that the media never covered, how Trump is entire agenda has helped farmers significantly, while the socialist Democrat agenda that has enveloped Joe Biden is the most dangerous anti-farm program ever. Next came another Black former NFL football player, Burgess Owens, who is campaigning in Utah for a congressional seat. Like Jack Brewer, who spoke earlier, Owens also was a safety. Interesting that no one picked up on their field positions at a convention that has a salient the me that President Trump is the law-and-order candidate who will support safety while Biden and his entourage work to de fund the police. Owens yet again put the lie to Biden is “You Ai not Black” racism. Sam Vigil, whose wife innocently was shot dead while in her garage, praised President Trump is “Operation Legend,” his crime-enforcement initiative that allows federal agents to work with local police in crime-devastated cities. He told us, “The police were overwhelmed. They needed help. Help arrived when President Trump launched Operation Legend in July of this year. Almost immediately, the FBI took over Jackie is case. In a matter of days, they arrested four men. The fifth — the suspected killer — is in a Texas jail on unrelated charges.” A particularly powerful moment came next when Clarence Henderson, who was among those in the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins, took center stage to endorse Trump mightily. Instead of “If you vote for Trump, you ai not Black,” Henderson said “If you vote for Biden, you do not know history.” Henderson reminded us why he rightly is regarded as a civil rights hero and what real history teaches:Walking into the Woolworth Department Store on February 2, 1960, I knew it was unlike any day I’d experienced before. My friends had been denied service the day before because of the color of their skin. We knew it was not right. But when we went back the next day, I did not know whether I was going to come out in a vertical or prone position, in handcuffs or on a stretcher or even in a body bag…. It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. It was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship. And it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote. They do not teach it that way in college or grad school, and teachers who try to do so get fired or canceled. But that is the truth that sneaks onto the TV screen one week every four years. Henderson tied his message together by saying that “These achievements demonstrate that Donald Trump truly cares about Black lives. His policies show his heart. He has done more for Black Americans in four years than Joe Biden has done in 50.”The evening wound down with two wonderful speeches. Richard Grenell, our former ambassador to Germany and the n our former Acting Director of National Intelligence, powerfully praised Trump is foreign policy achievements. Trump had charmed Angela Merkel but also got her to pay more towards NATO While Obama and Biden flew in hundreds of millions in cash to Iran, Trump flew in the attack craft that evaporated Iran is master of worldwide terror, Qassem Soleimani. We were reminded that, in a career spanning nearly half a century in Washington, the historical record shows that Biden has been wrong on almost every single issue that ever has come before him. Even on killing Osama bin Laden, Biden advised Obama to wait. Mike Pence finished with a very fine vice presidential speech that touched on all the mes of the convention and the Trump–Pence first term. It was wonderful to hear but a bit saddening, too, because it means we have only one more night of Truth left on mainstream TV media before the long cold night of 47 months and three weeks of left-wing media bias resumes. Savor it. If we want any other truth to get onto the NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, CNN, or MSNBC screens between now and November 3, Trump and the GOP will have to buy the minutes. At least Cancel Culture still allows that. Do not be sure that right will survive four years hence if the Left wins in November and extends their digital-media censorship beyond Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook to permeate into broadcast media.",0,0,The American Spectator

113,Andrew Cuomo ran New York badly – because he ran a toxic workplace | Joel Wertheimer,-10.67,31.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/11/andrew-cuomo-new-york-toxic-workplace-governor,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the state of New York,has resigned after the publication of a report by the attorney general which documented that he sexually harassed 11 women and his staff retaliated against one of those women who had the temerity to speak out. (Cuomo denies any wrongdoing.)Some commentators have taken the opportunity to note that not only did he run a toxic workplace, sexually harass staff and violate state and federal laws in his actions, he also has run the state poorly, despite the reputation he developed during the coronavirus pandemic. But, based in part on my experience of having worked in his administration, it would be more accurate to say that Cuomo has run New York poorly he ran a toxic workplace, sexually harassed staff and violated state and federal laws. Start with the number of women whose careers were cut short and harmed by the governor is actions. That leftNew Yorkwithout the contributions of many women who could have made the state a better place but who left because of the abuse. And who are the women who did not get jobs in the government at all because Cuomo may not have found them attractive? What was their contribution to our collective wellbeing that was missed? It is impossible to have worked for the governor and not have noticed that the senior women who worked directly for him predominantly looked alike and notably none of them where non-white. Similarly, the attorney general is report meticulously detailed the ways in which the state is hiring and staffing decisions were based upon Cuomo is proclivities. On the one hand, the governor had the New York State police change their seniority rules to allow a woman that he had met to be assigned to staff him, even though she was underqualified for the role. On the other, numerous women were given non-substantive jobs in the governor is vicinity rather than substantive work for which they were qualified. Cuomo was more than willing to use his power to degrade government because of his personal desires, and it did not stop at discrimination against women. The brain drain as a result of his toxic administration hurt New York. I made it seven months in the Cuomo administration in 2017. I was looking for a new job after two months. But working in an abusive and chaotic environment where nobody cared about policy outcomes was not worth proximity to power. The staff often justified what they went through as necessary for good governance, but I knew otherwise, having just come from the Obama White House, where working long hours was the norm, but so was kindness coming from the to p. While I would not count myself as a large loss for the administration, the number of smart people who walked in the door and realised they could do more good work elsewhere is innumerable. For example,Andy Byford, who was fixing the subways that had withered under Cuomo is time leading New York, left because working for the governor was so unpleasant. The report also documented the ways in which a staff obsessed with serving the governor, his wants and his image rather than delivering for New Yorkers leads to bad outcomes. Led by the now departed Melissa DeRosa, the staff were all hands on deck to silence the harassment claims against Cuomo in the middle of a pandemic. They are alleged to have retaliated againstLindsey Boylan and lied to the press hoping to ward off future accusations. That campaign was described by the governor is office as “fighting for our lives”, which should give us a sense of how much energy was being devoted to issues other than running the state is government. Indeed, it is this media obsession and policy failure that led to Cuomo is massive popularity amid the pandemic while New Yorkers died at higher rates than almost any other state in the country. If it had to do with television, he and they cared and they could get good headlines. While I think very little of Cuomo, I do believe hisEmmy was well deserved. He did an incredible job every day playing the competent foil to Donald Trump, assuring a shell-shocked nation desperate for the mere performance of competence. TV Andrew Cuomois good at the job of being TV Governor. When the cameras were off, the image-obsessed staff failed to deliver for New York. New York is second among the US is states in deaths per capita, and while a fair assessment would note the early timing and geography – nearby New Jersey and Connecticut also struggled to prevent Covid deaths – nothing suggests Cuomo did anything more notable to limit the spread of the virus than other governors. Instead, when his policies potentially led to larger numbers of deaths in elder care facilities, his administration reportedly scrubbed the number sat his behest. As New Yorkers struggled to get Covid tests, his administration pressured hospitals to provide them for his friends and family. And when news broke of his sexual harassment last year, his administration is Covid “czar”gauged the loyalty of county officials struggling to get vaccines to their constituents, according to media reports. That is my memory of working the re: seeing people screamed at by his close staff if the temperature was not sufficiently cold for the governor is events. Cuomo is administration has constantly failed because it prized loyalty, subservience and shiny objects over making things work. New York received billions of dollars in rent relief money from the federal government this year, but the programme has been marked by dysfunction, with lawmakers demanding details of the awarding of a no-bid $115m contract to a company that was charged with distributing the funds. The state wasted $106mon unused lights for New York bridges, because the governor prized the veneer of infrastructure, all while subways broke down. Andrew Cuomo is gone. But there will be more politicians who are said to sexually harass their staff and run toxic work environments. We should remember that the harms do not stop at the women they harass or the staffers they abuse, although that should be enough. The abuse is corrosive, the harms leak out throughout the government, and we are all worse for it.

A judge sentenced Clare Bronfman, the daughter of late Seagram is billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr., to 81 months in prison and fined her $500,000 on Wednesday. ""I have made mistakes, I am sorry for the time and resources I have taken from the court,"" she said. Bronfman is accused of illegally bringing young women into the US for the Nxivm cult and using part of her $210 million fortune to silence the group is enemies with legal action. ""She used her incredible wealth as a means of intimidation, threat and exacting revenge on individuals who challenged its dogmas,"" Brooklyn Federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis said in sentencing her. Nine Nxivm victims spoke directly to Bronfman—who still publicly supports cult leader Keith Raniere—during the emotional hearing, the reports. ""I pray that you will take the claws of Keith Raniere out of you, and you will learn who Clare Bronfman really is,"" said victim Susan Dones as she wept. ""He is killing you."" Other ex-members said they endured ""scorched-earth litigation"" and ""hundreds of headline news stories"" after leaving the group. Bronfman is sentence was based on her two guilty pleas: racketeering and conspiracy. Raniere, meanwhile, was found guilty last year of charges including sex-trafficking and racketeering. He could get life behind bars when he is sentenced in October. (Women in Nxivm were apparently branded with his initials.)",2,1,Newser

He put those who refuse to call Trump what he is — a racist and antiSemite — on blast. Stop using soft language around it. Who benefits from it? Only the racists. Only the antiSemites. This righteous tirade came after Chris Hayes asked the NYT journalist about, in particular, what he made of the silence of Trump in the face of the awful New Zealand terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 50 innocent Muslims at prayer. ALI: It is the feature, not the bug. Let is not forget when it came to Charlottesville, and there were white supremacists, KKK and the alt-right, who repeated the white supremacist conspiracy theory that ""Jews will not replace us,"" Donald Trump responded by saying there are very fine people, and both sides are to blame. And when it is come to this terrorist attack in New Zealand, which has claimed fifty lives, including a three-year-old baby, it is been five days, Chris, and Donald Trump has yet to use the ""t"" word, terrorism, to describe it. In fact, he has yet to reach out the the victims. In fact, I wish he had half as much concern for the rest of Americans, including Muslims, that he does defending Judge Pirro, who promoted anti-Muslim conspiracies that are found in the same ideological swamp shared by these white supremacists around the world. I wish he would attack the number one domestic terror threat in America, according to the FBI, which are white supremacists, the number one source of domestic terror plots in the past ten years, with as much gusto and passion that he attacked John McCain, the press, SNL and Robert Mueller. But he has not done that and he has not done it throughout his presidency. And, I will say something bold here, it is because I think, Chris,He is not racially charged or racially motivated or has racial flare-ups. He has promoted and mainstream ed a white supremacist conspiracy theory to win the midterm elections, which is that George Soros was funding the caravan — the invasion. The same language used, by the way, by the Australian terrorists who killed 50 people last week. Um... YES, PLEASE... Hayes brought up the Mick Mulvaney apology tour, you know the one where the Acting Chief of Staff went to all the cable news shows and had to answer the question, ""Hey, is your boss a white supremacist? He sure seems awful white supremacist-y."" (Sidenote - I do not think Mulvaney has what it takes. By the third or so, he was suu up er tired of answering that question...""How many times do I have to deny this???"") Ali had an epic takedown of that insulting display, as well. ALI: It is 2019. You ca not gaslight me. Because I remember the president saying, ""I think Islam hates us."" I remember the president asking for a (*slipping into the Trump voice*) ""total and complete ban on Muslims until we can figure out what the hell is going on."" I remember the president saying he saw a tape on television of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 terror attacks. I double-dare you, President Trump. I am calling you out. You say that you saw the tape of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey the 9/11 terror attacks. Show me the tape. So this is a president who is anti-Muslim. Again I want to say this, Chris. He mainstream ed a white supremacist talking point in October. The Jews, led by George Soros, a Jewish-Hungarian American, funding the caravan of rapists, criminals, Muslims and Mexicans. That is exactly the number one conspiracy theory of white supremacists, that the rest of us are being used by the Jews to weaken the white race, which was used by the shooter who killed 50 people last week. You got to call him out and you have also got to call out the Republican leaders who also mainstream ed it. That includes Kevin McCarthy. Call them all out, and ask the m, ""Do you stand by President Trump is views of that white supremacist conspiracy theory?"" Reporters need to ask until they answer. You hear that, reporters? Call racism and antiSemitism what it is, when it happens, even if it comes out of the mouths of powerful people. ESPECIALLY when it comes out of the mouths of our leaders.

Maxey can flat out score, has played with Tyler Herro at Kentucky, and would have fit so well into the team on both ends of the floor. I like Precious Achiuwa, but do not think his ceiling is as high and see him as a long-term backup if we get Danilo Gallinari or Giannis. — Ethan, New York. A: But you ca not draft on the assumption of landing other players in free agency, especially with the current whirlwind offseason. (Or perhaps you can, if the Heat know they will be adding a wing.) Face it, if the Heat felt it was a close call, they assuredly would have gone for the Kentucky prospect. So that, alone, tells you that the Heat saw something more than Number 20 talent in Achiuwa. Quality bi gs remain harder to find than quality wings. Q: Is it weird that as the league moves more and more into a shooting league, the Heat drafted a player whose only glaring weakness is shooting? — Chadwick, Lake Worth. A: Actually, when you look at the very top of the draft, at the first five or six players, none are knockdown shooters and only Patrick Williams is considered much in the way of a shooter. What it shows in this era of position-less basketball is that the completeness of a game still matters. In Precious Achiuwa, the Heat get a player who fills plenty of boxes, albeit perhaps not necessarily the one you cite. This is when Erik Spoelstra again calls upon shooting coach Rob Fodor. Q: Why the obsession with Bradley Beal? The Heat already have a younger, cheaper version of him in Tyler Herro. Beal did not break any records in his rookie year or show what Herro showed us as a rookie. Why are the Heat assuming Herro cannot be the second scoring option they are desperately looking for? I get the “win now” window, but I do not see why Pat Riley is itching for Beal, which will require trading Herro. They already have All-Stars in Bam Adebayo and Herro. I feel like circumstances have to force Riley to see this. — Billy. A: And who says the Heat are “itching” for Bradley Beal or any potentially available star? Or could it be that due diligence requires studying any and every option in case that option becomes available? The Wizards ultimately will decide when to engage about Beal and at what level.

AndEuropean countries joined in on examining their own racist and colonial past. There is been some change toward police reform. At least 17 state shave banned or restricted police use of chokeholds. More than 20 major US cities(think: LA, Seattle, Austin) cut their police budgets in some way. Some have reinvested the money into services like mental health and housing programs. And in arar e moment of police accountability, Chauvin was found guilty of all charges (including second-degree murder). He will be sentenced next month. But many families – like those ofBreonna Taylor,Daniel Prude, andRonald Greene– are still waiting for justice. Right.

Andsome lawmakers still maintain the US ""is not a racist country"" – despite an alarming rise in hate crimes and the pervasiveness of white supremacy.

Before Clay is tenure, his father William Clay held the seat for three decades. That makes Bush, whose campaign grew out of protests against the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014, the first to topple the Clay political dynasty in 52 years. Bush, 44, of Florissant, first challenged Clay in 2018. She returned this year with the same message — that Clay had not been bold enough in tackling the district is challenges — but with more campaign funds and support from progressive groups challenging establishment Democrats in a bid to pull the party left.""Tonight, Missouri is 1st District has decided that an incremental approach is not going to work any longer,"" Bush said in a victory speech late Tuesday. ""We decided that we the people have the answers, and we will lead from the front lines.""Not me, US Bush, who has spoken openly about being evicted and failing to pay taxes, has said her background as a single mother of two children connects her to working families in the district.

Clay, long a solid vote for Democratic policies, had touted his support for Senator Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, Ocasio-Cortez is Green New Deal, and for impeaching President Donald Trump — all positions that put him left of other centrist Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

124,Branson flight signals confidence in commercial spaceflight,0.0,41.0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/branson-flight-signals-confidence-in-commercial-spaceflight/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,25,"Virgin Galactic-founder Richard Branson and five company crew mates have made final preparations for a barnstorming ride to space Sunday, a bold show of confidence in his company is readiness to start carrying adventurous passengers on brief trips out of the atmosphere. Beating rival Jeff Bezos to space by nine days, Branson and company expect to zoom higher than 50 miles in Virgin is sleek spaceplane, experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness and out-of-this-world views before gliding back to landing at Spaceport America near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. It will be the fourth piloted spaceflight for Virgin is VSS Unity space plane and its 22nd overall. But it will be the first with a crew of six on board and the first with Branson, a high-stakes demonstration of his long-standing commitment to launching wealthy space tourists, researchers and even astronauts into space on a for-profit basis. It also demonstrates the high-stakes nature of the competition to be first in the emerging space tourism marketplace with Virgin Galactic competing head to head with Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for space tourism dollars. After 15 unpiloted test flights, Bezos announced last month that he planned to fly aboard his company is New Shepard spacecraft July 20 when it takes off on its first piloted flight to sub-orbital space. A few days later, Branson upstaged the Amazon founder, announcing he planned to take off nine days earlier.""Yeah, the re is a little bit of competition in the who is going first or when things are happening,"" Virgin President Mike Moses, a former space shuttle manager at NASA, told CBS News. ""But it is really not a race. It is not a competition. I know that sounds maybe a little shallow or disingenuous, but it is not.""It is a small community. I know dozens of people who work at Blue Origin, I know dozens and dozens of people at SpaceX, and we all used to work together at NASA And I wish every single one of them the best. ... Because all of us together is what is going to get humans into space and our culture to recognize that space travel is the foundation for the future for everyone.""With typical Branson fanfare, Sunday is flight will be broadcast live across Virgin Galactic is social media platforms, featuring appearances by Stephen Colbert and retired Canadian space station astronaut Chris Hadfield, along with the performance of a new song by singer-songwriter Khalid. Even SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to be watching.""Will see you there to wish you the best,"" he tweeted Saturday. Will see you there to wish you the bestVSS Unity, mounted beneath the wing of Virgin is twin-fuselage carrier jet VMS Eve, is scheduled for takeoff from Spaceport America shortly after 10:30 a.m. ET, slightly later than originally planned due to overnight weather. Joining Branson will be company pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, both veterans of earlier test flights to space, along with company astronaut trainer Beth Moses, also a flight veteran and Mike Moses' wife; operations engineer Colin Bennett; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research.""This has been a long journey for him,"" Mike Moses said of Branson. ""He is like a kid in a candy store here in training this week. He is bouncing around, he is happy, excited. ... But that excitement is really infectious. And so the whole crew is feeling it.""Asked if the team felt any pressure because of Branson is presence on board, not to mention his wife is, Moses said he would not hesitate to call off the flight if the weather or a technical issue raises a safety concern.""I have scrubbed while Richard was watching before, and if I have to scrub while he is on board, we will,"" Moses said. ""It is a human flown, piloted aircraft. And so we take that safety very, very seriously. And we do not treat any one crew member as any more or less important than any other.""Assuming all goes well, VMS Eve will climb to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. At that point, after a final round of safety checks, carrier pilots Rick Sturckow and Kelly Latimer will release Unity to fly on its own. Seconds after dropping away, Mackay and Masucci will ignite Unity is hybrid rocket motor, kicking off a high-speed near-vertical climb out of the lower atmosphere, pushing the crew back in their seats with up to three times the normal force of gravity. During crew training, Mackay told Branson and his crew mates the space plane will propel them ""nice and smoothly to zero G.""""It feels wonderful, and you will want to get out of your seat automatically, I think, to unstrap yourself and experience this thing,"" he said in a company video shot during training. ""To me, it is all about the view, and it is absolutely amazing. It is spectacular.""After the rocket motor shuts down, the space plane will continue climbing on a ballistic trajectory, reaching a high point of more than 50 miles, the ""boundary"" of space recognized by NASA and the FAA, before arcing over and beginning the plunge back to Earth. Along the way, the four passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness, allowing them to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin behind the two pilots, taking in spectacular views of Earth and space through 12 windows. For re-entry, the space plane utilizes an innovation pioneered by legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan -- wing-like tail booms that rotate upward with respect to the fuselage after the vehicle leaves the lower atmosphere. In the so-called ""feathered"" orientation, aerodynamic drag is sharply increased, causing the spacecraft to naturally orient itself like a badminton shuttlecock for a relatively low-speed, low-temperature re-entry with minimal piloting. Once back in the lower atmosphere, the tail booms will rotate back parallel with the fuselage and the pilots will guide Unity to a landing on Spaceport America is 12,000-foot-long runway. If all goes well, Virgin is expected to carry out two more test flights before beginning commercial operations with paying customers on board. Ticket prices have not been announced, but a seat is expected to cost in the neighborhood of $250,000. More than 600 enthusiasts have reserved seats.""I think we are seeing the tip of the iceberg with the folks that have stepped forward already,"" Moses said. ""There is going to be a huge interest.""",1,2,CBS News

Mike Penceis only interested in looking out for himself right now. It is not in his interest to blow up the Constitution to try to keepDonald Trumpin power with a scheme that will not work. Mike Pence wants to run for president in 2024 and another four years as Donald Trump is marginalized stooge would not be the best thing for his political ambitions. Pence does not have the power to reject electors. TheVice Presidentcould stand there looking concerned while House and Senate Republicans object to the Electoral College results in five swing states. The Vice President is not going to do down for Trump and some harebrained coup that is destined to fail.

State Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh had 4 percent, and businessman Tim Jones had 2 percent. A quarter of respondents were undecided. Moore is well-known for his anti-LGBTQ stances.

His opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, responded that he would challenge such a move. Biden is campaign said it will fight any efforts by the president is campaign to go to court to prevent ballots from being recorded after Election Day. Trump claimed that continued vote counting constituted “a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. We will be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop.”Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon sent out a statement calling Trump is comments “outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect.”O’Malley Dillon said the Biden campaign has “legal teams standing by ready to deploy to resist that effort” and that they “will prevail.”There are still hundreds of thousands of votes left to be counted in a handful of “battleground” states that remain too close to call. The Associated Press has not declared a winner in the presidential race. Trump has indicated that he believes the elevation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, the president is third selection for the court, would give his campaign an advantage in a legal challenge. The Biden campaign has expressed confidence that the final results in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will vault the former vice president to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency. Vote-counting in those states could extend to the end of the week or beyond. All three of those states, once considered a Democratic “Blue Wall,” unexpectedly went to Trump in 2016. Biden appears to have carried Arizona and has a shot in still-uncalled Georgia, two traditionally Republican states. With a win in Arizona or Georgia, the Democratic nominee would have a route to victory even without one of the three “Blue Wall” states. The president, meanwhile, has held onto the South, including Florida and Texas. North Carolina remains too close to call. The Republican continues to have a narrow path to re-election.“We are going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished,” Biden said Tuesday night. “But we are feeling good about where we are.”He added on Twitter:“It is not my place or Donald Trump is place to declare the winner of this election,” he said. “It is the voters' place.”Even with so many ballots still to be counted, the US Senate appears set to remain in Republican hands, despite a determined push by Democrats to take over the chamber. Democrats will retain the majority in the US House of Representatives. The Associated Press contributed to this report.-- Douglas Perrydperry@oregonian.com@douglasmperry",2,2,The Oregonian

Unrest broke out shortly after a flight carrying single adult men arrived and released the men to Haitian authorities on the tarmac. Then, the source said, several of the men stormed another recently arrived flight carrying families. The men assaulted the pilots of that plane, who work for a government contractor licensed to fly deportation flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while the families were still on board. Three ICE officers were also attacked on that plane, each suffering non-life-threatening injuries, the source said. In a statement, a DHS spokesperson said, “On Tuesday, Sept. 21, some adult migrants caused two separate disruptions on the tarmac after deplaning in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Haitian crowd control officers responded to both incidents and resolved the situations. ICE fully respects the rights of all people to peacefully express their opinions, while continuing to perform its immigration enforcement mission consistent with our priorities, federal law and agency policy.”The US has been ramping up its deportations of Haitians after more than 15,000 overwhelmed the US border by congregating under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, in just a matter of days. As of Tuesday, just over 1,000 of theHaitian migrant shad been deported to Haiti, according to two sources familiar with the operations. A total of 4,000 have been either deported or moved to other processing centers along the border, the Department of Homeland Security said. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday at a Senate hearing that the crowd in Del Rio will dissipate in the coming days.""Expect to see dramatic results within the next 48 to 96 hours,"" he said. But after the assaults Tuesday, some inside DHS worry that they do not have enough security at the airports to safely land deportation flights, said the source familiar with the incident.

But after months of hearings and negotiations, state lawmakers will end their legislative session without passing a single measure addressing HB6 in any way, displaying a stunning inability to do anything about a law that has become an embarrassment to the state. The reason is that legislative Republicans, who dominate both the Ohio House and Senate, are split about what to do with HB6: some want to fully repeal it, some want a partial repeal, and others argue it should be kept in place. Most legislative Democrats, for their part, have insisted on fully repealing HB6 and have generally opposed any reform efforts short of that.“The substance of House Bill 6, not the criminal proceedings, are complex issues on which the re is a wide range of opinion in the legislature,” said House Speaker Bob Cupp, a Lima Republican,according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. “The diversity of views on what is good and appropriate public policy, I think, has forestalled a consensus on what should be done.”Cupp continued: “Whether it is revise, repeal, replace, partial revision, partial replacement, partial repeal, total repeal, no replacement -- these are policy issues that we will be continuing to work on in the next general assembly.”Senate Republicans, meanwhile, placed the blame on their colleagues in the House, which wanted to take the lead on addressing HB6 because the legislation originated there.“I think we should have done a repeal, and I think we should have done it a long time ago,” said Senate President Larry Obhof, a Medina Republican. “I am disappointed that that did not happen.”Obhof told reporters after the Senate wrapped up business Tuesday that deciding what to do about HB 6 has been “a difficult issue” in both chambers.“You run into situations where there are people who want to repeal it but will not vote for anything except for a straight repeal, for example -- even if the re is a change that moves in the direction that they want, because it is not everything that they want,” Obhof said. “And the n you have some people who look at it and say, ‘Hey, whatever its underlying problems may have been, or whatever its origins may have been, we voted on it when we did because we thought it was the right public policy, and that has not necessarily changed.’”Despite lawmakers’ failure to act, the $1 billion-plus nuclear bailout at the heart of HB6 is on hold for now, as a Franklin County judge on Mondayissued a preliminary injunction blocking the state from starting to collect money from rate payers next month. But it remains to be seen whether the 2019 law itself will be eviscerated by the courts, or whether lawmakers will finally agree on a repeal or (more likely) a reform of the law after they begin a new session next month. GOP lawmakers have met behind closed doors during the final days of the lame-duck session, proposing (among other things) to de lay the bailout fee collection by a year while an audit is conducted to see whether the nuclear plants actually need the money. Bizarrely,Energy Harbor, owner of the plants, has lobbied lawmakers to give it the option of refusing the bailout money, as a federal regulatory ruling might turn audit-reduced subsidies into a financial liability. Even Republicans who favor repealing and replacing House Bill 6 have noted, accurately, that HB6 is an enormously complex law that goes far beyond the nuclear bailout. Given that they are now being criticized for acting too quickly to pass HB6 in the first place, they want to make sure that any changes they make to it now will not have unintended consequences for Ohioans. Between 2021 until 2027, HB6 directs that every Ohio electricity customer has to pay a new monthly surcharge that ranges from 85 cents for residential customers to $2,400 for large industrial plants. The money would go to Energy Harbor, a former FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary that owns the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants along Lake Erie. However, the judge is injunction does not affect other parts of the bill, including subsidies for six solar plants and two coal plants, one of which is in Indiana. Anotherso-called “decoupling” provisional lows FirstEnergy to charge rate payers what could end up being hundreds of millions of dollars more, making the company “somewhat recession-proof,”in the words of ex-FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones. Federal authorities arrested the n-House Speaker Larry Householder and four allie sin July,claiming they received more than $60 million from FirstEnergy Corp. to secure the passage of HB6 and fend off a potential referendum to overturn it. So far, two Householder allies -- political aide Jeff Longstreth and FirstEnergy lobbyist Juan Cespedes --have pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges for their roles in the scandal. FirstEnergy has also fired Jonesand other top executives, though to date no FirstEnergy or Energy Harbor officials have been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. Householder has maintained his innocenceand, besides losing the speakership, has faced no political penalty so far -- the Perry County Republican has remained in the House and was evenre-elected to another termin a landslide. Meanwhile, the only House Republican to lose re-election this year was state Representative Dave Greenspan of Westlake, who helped the FBI collect evidence against Householder.

132,"Kamala Harris is not getting any honeymoon, and some Democrats are fretting",-4.33,38.67,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-07-02/kamala-harris-isnt-getting-the-same-honeymoon-as-joe-biden-and-some-democrats-are-worried,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"Hours after Vice President Kamala Harris snapped at NBC News anchor Lester Holt last month in an interview from Guatemala, she was still showing signs of exasperation with questions about why she was not also going to the US-Mexico border in her role dealing with waves of migrants to the US“Listen,”she said animatedly to reporters who’d accompanied her. “I have been to the border before. I will go again. But when I am in Guatemala ... I think we should have a conversation about what is going on in Guatemala.”It was the kind of moment that has even supporters questioning her political acumen — underscoring why Harris, nearly six months into her term as a history-making vice president, consistently lags in polls behind President Biden, has failed to get the same honeymoon with voters, draws more critical media coverage and stands as a bigger target for Republicans.“Just in terms of the public-facing stuff, it has not been a stellar six months,” said David Axelrod, formerly the senior campaign and White House advisor to President Obama.“You have limited opportunities to play the featured actor,” he added. “Mostly, you are playing a supporting role. So if something goes wrong during those limited opportunities, they are magnified.”Harris ended upgoing to the border last week, but the controversy over whether she would go provided grist for Democrats who see her flailing in the face of the Republicans’ attacks. That Harris’ public support trails that of Biden, who is favored by a slight majority in most polls, is fairly typical for vice presidents, who by definition play backup roles, are less well known and sometimes serve as heat shields for their bosses. Harris, as a Black and Asian woman, also is subject to racial and gender prejudice that neither Biden nor her predecessors faced. Women in public or private jobs, especially women of color, are often judged more harshly and held to higher standards than white male colleagues in high-level positions. Still, some Democrats are beginning to worry that her sluggish approval numbers are indicative of a bigger problem for Harris, who as vice president ranks as the party is potential heir to Biden, the oldest president in US history at 78. They have many of the same doubts that have long dogged her, and contributed to her failed campaign for Democrats’ 2020 presidential nomination — about her style, political instincts and treatment of staff. Politicoreported last week about increased tensions within her office — including aides’ frustrations with Chief of Staff Tina Flournoy — while Axios followed wit han article about friction between Harris’ staff and Biden is. At least three Harris staffers have left in recent weeks and others are said to be considering the same. For now, those who have departed have been fairly low-level aides, and some churn is expected given the stress that comes with White House jobs. Still, Harris has long had a reputation for high staff turnover, and as vice president she is working with an almost entirely new group of advisors, no longer in close touch with much of the political team in California that helped propel her career. Allies say the hand-wringing is overwrought. Some complain that Harris has been hemmed in by the White House, even as Biden has given her thorny, perhaps impossible, tasks — notably, to seek ways to deter migration from Central America and to lead Democrats’ fight to expand access to voting. Mark Buell, who has been Harris’ chief fund raiser since her first race for district attorney of San Francisco, said the White House seems to be giving her the toughest jobs without the full license to make her own mark.“The administration needs to give her real authority, where she can hold a press conference and say, ‘Here is what I think and here is where I am going,’” Buell said. Administration officials say Harris is a valued voice behind the scenes and that her polling numbers should not be a surprise, given that she is playing a supporting role and lacks Biden is decades on the national stage.“She is actually doing the hard work that a vice president does and not getting the credit for it because people have this sense that she should be out there doing something different,” said Anita Dunn, a senior advisor to Biden. A senior administration official who would not agree to be quoted by name acknowledged that it is “always part of the vice president is role” to “take some of the heat” for the president, and called it “insulting” to suggest Harris’ assignments are too hard, as if “she needs to be protected.” The most important thing, the official added, is that the vice president is a trusted advisor and public messenger. Harris is viewed favorably by an average of 44% of voters and unfavorably by about 47%, according to theReal Clear Politics average of recent polls. Biden, by contrast,is viewed favorably by 51% of voters, with about 43.5% disapproving. The difference in approval between the m, in the high single digits, has been fairly consistent over past months. A recent YouGov poll showed some of the factors behind the numbers. Biden did better than Harris among white voters across the board, but especially among white women with college degrees. While both get high approval from Democrats and low approval from Republicans, the intensity of support or opposition is different: More Democrats said they “strongly approve” of Biden than said the same about Harris, and fewer Republicans said they “strongly disapprove” of him. Those differences reflect on the one hand Harris’ lukewarm support from the Democratic Party is base, a problem since the 2020 presidential nomination race, and on the other the relentless attacks against her from conservative politicians and media.“She is not going to have a thermometer rating that matches the president is. She just is not,” said former Obama pollster Cornell Belcher, referring to his own polling data. “She is subservient to the Number 1, just like he was subservient to the Number 1 when he was behind Obama.”Donna Brazile, a friend and former Democratic Party chief, said it is too early for Harris to worry about the polls. If they look the same a year from now, Brazile went on, the n Harris should look at increasing her prominence. But for now, she should continue to literally stand behind or beside Biden at public events while advising him privately, Brazile said. Perhaps the biggest challenge for all vice presidents is showing the public that they are capable of leading as commander in chief. For Harris, that challenge is all the greater, given that she is the first woman and the only woman of Black and Asian descent to hold the job.“Middle white America” — people between the coasts — “they are comfortable with an older white guy, and I do not think I am saying anything insane when I say that,” said Belcher, who is a Black man. But he pointed out that Harris’ barrier-breaking identity is also a political asset, which will only be more valuable by 2028, when Biden, if he runs and wins reelection, would be ending his presidency. By the n, given demographic trends, “we have an electorate that is probably about eight [percentage] points browner,” Belcher said. Bakari Sellers, a co-chair of Harris’ presidential campaign and a CNN political commentator who remains a confidant, said Harris gets more scrutiny than her predecessors and less leeway than Biden. For example, he said that Biden is recent comments that put the administration is infrastructure package in jeopardy were greeted as a “faux pas.” But, he added: “If Kamala Harris had done that, it is stories about ‘Is she prepared?’”Sellers does have advice: Harris should “stop advisor-sourcing information and just fall back on her gut.”He said that Harris did not look comfortable when she said in Guatemala that would-be migrants should “stay home.”“I am pretty sure that came from the White House,” Seller said, “and that is why it did not sound natural.”",1,2,LA Times

If you do not think so, please count the houses you own and think about how you or your family earned them. Then compare yourself toBLM co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors and her four homes worth a total worth of $3.2 million. Local BLM organizers are crowd funding to stay active while their fearless leader is currently searching for property at the resort area in the Bahamas where Justin Timberlake also has a home. Maybe they will discuss marches and riots at the next neighborhood barbecue. After all, their personal chefs will be busy manning the grill.“An Australian Strategic Policy Institute report published this March, “Uyghurs for sale,” found Uyghur slave labor working in factories supplying 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing, shoe, and automotive sectors, including Apple, GM, Gap — and Nike.” But that is funny because Apple and Nike are amongst some of the biggest names in social justice. Maybe buying shoes made from slave labor is the same as supporting minorities in business or something?Picture the rainbow flag that appears all over advertisements during Pride month and tell me if those businesses really care about LGBT issues (and yeah, I refuse to add other letters to that, it is what it is) or if the marketing team simply understands that hanging a flag might bring them more customers. At the very least it may help keep the sharks at bay when it comes time to criticize companies for not being woke enough. And while we are talking about money, if you are wondering where all the money raised by climate change activists goes…it goes to scientists who publicly endorse climate change, federal funding, international assistance, and the planning of more climate activism. It is a billion-dollar industry that has done squat for climate change. Despite the fact that global surface temperatures stalled in 2000 and have not increased significantly since, we have been promised that the world would end several times by now. Even with all the urgency and alarm, the best plan on the table to save us involves giving everyone a free home and banning cows or developing cows that do not pass gas courtesy of theGreen New Deal. I look back at these predictions made on Earth Day in 1970, and I wonder if scientists the world over would not benefit from a Xanax. Of course, the billion-dollar drug industry is doing well enough on its own. Did you know that climate anxiety is an illness you can get a prescription for? It does not rid you of the problem, but it can mask it for life if you take it that long. Problem solved. Restless leg syndrome? There is a pill for that, no need to stand up. Active child? That can be cured in no time. I think it is no secret that Big Pharma is a self-licking ice cream cone. Their “compassion” for the traumas of the world is filling their pockets. They remind me a bit of politicians who want to keep us locked down for our own safety, but also want to go to hair salons and have birthday parties with their friends. The compassion, it is so thick you could choke on it. I found an illustrative video on the cycle of money surrounding pharmaceutical companies if you do not mind a few F-bombs. At the end of the day, I am not saying that none of these issues are real issues. I mean, I DO think BLM is simply a Nigerian Prince scam because they raised $90 million and none of it went to black communities. But are there times when medications are life-saving? Absolutely. Is the climate changing? Sure. Are the LGBT issues worth discussing? I’d say so. But are social justice activism and virtue signaling addressing any of these issues in earnest? Not at all. Not even a little bit. But is it making money? Oh my goodness, yes! It is raking in the big dough. Dollar-dollar-bills y’all. There are definitely times when companies like Gillette and the NFL can virtue signal with such gusto that they lose money and fans faster than Kaepernick can drop from the bench to his knees. But for the most part, if done subtly, most people do not even acknowledge the businesses pandering to the woke crowd or the organizations putting pressure on them to do so. It is time for the people who donate to and support these organizations to look past the outrage encouraged, the complicity demanded, and the catchy slogans and readily available tee-shirts to ask where the money is going and how it is making a difference. They may find they are stuck on a merry-go-round while the attendant is taking a nap. Hop off of that sucker and join the skeptics. At the very least, try to support the causes you believe in with time instead of money. If they are truly benevolent, they will be grateful for your time. If you already know the deal and do not drink the SJW Kool-Aid, here is an amusing video on how to spot a social justice warrior. SJW is just CHILL, it is a joke!!

134,Biden says US will appeal DACA ruling and Congress must act,-2.67,48.33,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-07-17/biden-pledges-appeal-of-deeply-disappointing-daca-ruling,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"President Biden said the US will appeal a federal judge is ruling that the DACA program protecting hundreds of thousands of “Dreamers” who came to the country as children was implemented unconstitutionally, and he renewed his call for Congress to agree on a permanent solution.“Yesterday is Federal court ruling is deeply disappointing,” Biden said in a statement Saturday. “The Department of Justice intends to appeal this decision in order to preserve and fortify DACA.”US District Judge Andrew S Hanen of Houston issued his ruling Friday in a suit brought by Republican-led states over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was implemented by the Obama administration on behalf of almost 650,000 Dreamers fighting to stay in the country.“Although Congress may someday enact such a Dream Act, until it does, its continued failure to pass bills coextensive with the DACA population evinces a rejection of this policy,” Hanen said in a 77-page decision, which noted widespread sympathy for Dreamers. “As much as this court might agree with these sentiments, and as popular as this program might be, the proper origination point for DACA was, and is, Congress.”The ruling comes amid a continuing humanitarian crisis: Since the start of the year, US authorities have apprehended or denied entry to more than 200,000 Central Americans at the southern US border, expelling many of them to Mexico. Hanen said it would be too disruptive to the lives of Dreamers in the existing program to end it immediately. He ordered the US Department of Homeland Security to continue renewing permits for current enrollees and to not reject any renewals because of his order, while he gives Congress and the administration time to figure out how to cure the legal defects that undermined the program. Biden said the ruling underscores the urgency that Congress, through the process known as reconciliation or other means, pass a law to “finally provide security to all Dreamers, who have lived too long in fear.”One of Biden is first actions as president was an executive order for DHS to “preserve and fortify” DACA, and the agency says it will undergo the formal rule-making process Texas claims Obama illegally skipped. The US House has passed a bill to give all DACA recipients lawful permanent residency. A bipartisan companion bill that protects Dreamers is under consideration in the Senate. While none of the young people is at immediate risk of either deportation or losing work authorization, the judge effectively said rescuing Dreamers is a job for Congress and the Biden administration, which have failed to reach agreement on what to do with them. The legal challenge moves next to the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, which now includes six judges appointed by former President Trump. Hanen is decision ultimately sets the case back on track to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in June 2020 that Trump could not arbitrarily end DACA without following federal rule-making procedures and providing a good explanation. The Texas challenge asked the same legal question in reverse, whether former President Obama violated federal procedures when he implemented DACA without congressional approval in 2012. Friday is ruling was no surprise, given Hanen is previous conclusion in a related case that DACA appeared unconstitutional but that ending it would be like trying to unscramble an egg. Hanen ruled that Obama skipped the same required rule-making steps as Trump. But the judge indicated DACA might yet be saved if the Biden administration gave the public time to comment on a new version of DACA before a reconstituted program is put into place. Representatives of Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton, who spearheaded the states’ fight against DACA, did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment. The Dreamers had support in court from a broad coalition of civil rights groups, business associations, healthcare organizations and academic institutions. They argued DACA recipients will contribute as much as $460 billion to U. S gross domestic product by 2028, according to a study by the Center for American Progress. Companies will have to spend $6.3 billion to hire replacements if Dreamers lose their jobs, the study found. Texas claimed it had spent at least $250 million annually providing education, healthcare and law enforcement services to immigrants in the country illegally, costs that justify court protection from the program is financial harm. Hanen said Friday that the 5th Circuit has already rejected the balancing argument that the Dreamers’ economic contribution outweighs their social cost to the states where they live and receive services. But he clearly wanted to avoid throwing the lives of so many young people into chaos, saying they were on the wrong side of the law through no fault of their own. Texas, in addition to the DACA challenge, also persuaded a federal judge to block the plan Biden announced after taking office in January to halt deportations of immigrants in the US illegally for 100 days. The proposed deportation freeze was part of a broader effort to roll back Trump policies and work toward nationwide immigration reform.",2,2,LA Times

Romulus Mayor LeRoy Burcroff acknowledged using $4,500 from the funds to cover the open bar at the wedding at a yacht club, according to a Friday report from localABC News affiliate WXYZ Burcroff is attorney, Daniel Wholihan, told the news outlet that the wedding was related to the campaign because many of those attending the wedding had also worked for Burcroff. Wholihan added that while using the money for the wedding created ""poor optics,"" he did not believe it constituted an improper use of funds. He said that Burcroff has since repaid the expenses to his campaign, WXYZ reported.

Not Even CLOSE",24.0,9.33,https://thenewamerican.com/300000-u-s-covid-deaths-not-even-close/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,16,"With the way COVID-19 deaths are recorded, many may wonder if they were calculated with a Dominion voting machine and if the disease is name is “Biden.” After all, other causes of death appear to have a funny way of ending up in the coronavirus column. The disease that really seems to be losing “votes” to the China virus is the flu, and now even more evidence to this effect has emerged. As commentator Andrea Widburgwrites:We keep being told that Americans are dying like flies, far in excess of their normal numbers. I accept that there are excess deaths. I am sure that the virus increased our annual death rate in spring, when many elderly people died in the first wave after Democrat governors trapped them in retirement homes and the n sent in infected people. I am also sure that more Americans are dying from cancer, heart disease, depression, suicide, murder, and spousal abuse thanks to the cruelty of the lockdowns. What offsets all this is that fewer Americans are dying from the flu. That is either because masks help prevent the flu (although we are told our mask use is all wrong for stopping the virus) or because a lot of the deaths marked as Wuhan virus deaths are in fact flu deaths. The mask theory does not seem tenable, and this is not just because data indicate that masks, at best, offer marginal protection. It is also that if the China virus is “spiking” despite mask use, why should we think the flu would not also be experiencing its regular fall increase?Of course, one could make the case that because SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious, its spread would be even greater were it not for mask use and that the latter has suppressed it and the flu. But among the reasons to question this theory are the following data, found by way of Widburg:Deaths in the USA over the years…2010: 2.5M2011: 2.5M2012: 2.5M2013 :2.6M2014: 2.6M2015: 2.7M2016: 2.7M2017: 2.8M2018: 2.8M2019: 2.9M2020: 2.5M (as of November)Where is the massive spike?(h/t@MillerStream)As Widburg points out, while the 2020 mortality data are not complete, it is unlikely the number will eclipse recent years’ just based on adding in December figures. (Moreover, if people really are concerned about deaths, is not the real story here the steady mortality increase since 2012?)Also, despite media claims to the contrary, hospitals are not on average overburdened. In fact, as “fears persist of overwhelmed medical systems and at-capacity hospitals nationwide, data indicate that ample hospital space remains available for both COVID-19 patients and other medical needs, with one official at a major hospital network stating that the country is ‘managing pretty well’ the latest surge of COVID-19,”reportsJust the News. The above is true even if there are a few strained hot-spot urban hospitals. Note, too, that temporary hospitals established early in the pandemic largely went unused and had to be dismantled. Widburg also states that fear of overwhelmed hospitals perhaps originated with video from Italy. Yet that nation has socialized medicine, which — in accordance with the economic principle that price caps lead to shortages — is notorious for suffering a lack of resources. But perhaps most striking, and actual news, is the following Twitter thread Widburg presents from a long-time pharmacist talking about a suspicious flu-related phenomenon:pic.twitter.com/Gt8mkqAVap3)…how much ta mi flu and generic has he sold to Pharmacies this season. He has not sold any. He has 75 accounts of independent pharmacies across the USs. 👇4) Conclusion: By now, it is well known that Covid tests give false positives. How many of these false positives are actually “the flu”? How many are just “the common cold”? Why does the CDC report daily case numbers & deaths for Covid and not for the flu? …6) I believe we are being played. Yes, Covid is real, it can be deadly. We now have drug regimens to treat Covid effectively, one being Dr. Zev Zelenko is@zev_drregimen, among others. I believe the Covid numbers are being skewed upward, on purpose…8) If we are so obedient to wear masks,obedient to stand here,do not stand the re, obedient to get the Covid vaccine,obedient to carry proof you have gotten the vaccine; otherwise,you will not be able to fly; the n it will be buses, trains, taxis, Uber is,Target,Walmart, grocery stores…Mr. Staub the n concludes with (a bit of salty language in the last tweet):10)They really do not know what they will find out in 6 months, a year, 5 years & longer, that can be attributed to the vaccine. It is way past time for people to take their heads out of their ass & start thinking for the mselves. / DoneThough eye-brow raising, Staub is input could be dismissed as anomalous anecdote — were it not for that it simply affirms long-made claims from other sources. Most strikingly, the CDC reported in November that 88,280 China-virus-labeled deaths were actually caused by the flu or pneumonia, according to One America News (OAN; video below). OAN also reported that the CDC tells us that 51,000 China-virus-labeled deaths were actually caused by heart attacks. In fairness, some observers claim that COVID can induce heart attacks in certain individuals, which underlines the reality that people with comorbidities (e.g., heart disease) are most vulnerable; note that the CDC reported this summer that 94 percent of China virus “victims” had an average of 2.6 comorbidities. The vast majority of the population, however, has a SARS-CoV-2 survival rate in excess of 99.5 percent. Someone else who questioned the China virus numbers, early on, was radio giant Michael Savage, a trained epidemiologist and author of close to 20 health and nutrition books. In the spring, he analyzed comprehensive April 6 disease data and noted that while COVID deaths were rising, flu-related deaths had supposedly dropped almost to zero. For all intents and purposes, this is a. Then there was the conversation I had with a security guard at a local hospital while waiting for a loved one receiving medical care. We were discussing how the China virus was affecting his institution and, after expressing some realities, he casually said, “And, of course, they are lumping in all the flu cases with COVID.”After I related this on Twitter, a naysayer mocked the man is security guard status. But note that not only was not he a very political person, he also no doubt talks to doctors and nurses just as he spoke to me — and them talk, too. So he is perhaps as good a source as any. Yet, again, none of this is revelatory. As the liberal reported in early September, “According to Daniel Spitz, chief medical examiner in Macomb County, Michigan, ‘I think a lot of clinicians are putting that condition [COVID-19] on death certificates when it might not be accurate because they died with coronavirus and not of coronavirus.’” Other medical experts have informed likewise. We may also note that none of this is surprising if, as reported, hospitals are receiving more money for treating China virus patients. For if “you subsidize something, you get more of it,” the economic principle goes. In fact, Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis,claimingin late winter that the COVID lock downs were based on “bad data,” even stated that if we did not know a new virus existed, we might just “have casually noted that flu this season seems to be a bit worse than average.”So since approximately177,000 Americans died during the 2017-2018 flu season, we should be happy we know the new virus exists — because now the flu season is a lot better than average!",0,0,The New American
138,Do not Blame Trump for Afghanistan is Collapse. Blame Barack Obama.,10.67,32.33,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/08/13/dont-blame-trump-for-afghanistans-collapse-blame-barack-obama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden is decision to withdraw abruptly from Afghanistan, without any discernible exit strategy, has plunged that nation into a bloody, ruinous chaos. After pleading with the Taliban to spare our embassy in Kabul, he has now redeployed 3,000 troops to conduct a hasty air evacuation of embassy staff. At this stage, the only good that can come from this debacle is that our leaders might wake up and recognize that theObama Doctrineof foreign policy is an abysmal failure and must be abandoned once and for all. Tragically, this lesson comes, yet again, at tremendous cost: wide scale human misery and heightened threats to US interests. As we study what is happened, let is first dispense with the canards: that this fiasco was inevitable and that it is all former President Donald Trump is fault. The reality is that, during Trump is tenure and despite the Afghan government is many imperfections, Afghanistan had made great strides. The government controlled most of the country is territory. There was real economic growth. Women could work. Children could go to school. Further, the cost of fostering regional stability by maintaining a stable Afghanistan was well within reason. The US was spending less in Afghanistan in a year than we used to spend in a week. American forces were training and advising Afghan forces. Our troops were not fighting wars and taking causalities. This was clearly sustainable. And how, in heaven is name, is Trump to blame for Biden is disastrous decision to cut and run? Trump was negotiating with the Taliban, but there was nothing wrong with that. The negotiations were conditions-based, and Trump made clear the Taliban would be held accountable for its actions. Moreover, Trump is team made sure that if, in the end, the Taliban proved untrustworthy, the remaining US force had been sized and scoped to present a serious deterrent to the Taliban and be sufficient to protect US interests. Trump, in fact, handed Biden a problem mostly solved. All Biden had to do was negotiate a lasting settlement from a position of strength or maintain an economy of force presence in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to deliver. Instead, Biden just decided to call it a day and call the troops home regardless of what the Taliban did on the ground. The Taliban is offensive should surprise no one, given the conditions handed to it. Why would it not take advantage ofBiden is abandonment of Afghanistan? It knew full well the odds that this president would try to stop its orgy of murder, rape, forced marriages, and mayhem was near zero. Of course, Biden will blame Trump. He will blame the Taliban. He can make all the excuses and spin all the narratives he wants, but a narrative ca not stop a bullet. This is a disaster. The situation did not collapse until he withdrew troops—and it is impossible not to conclude this happened because of what he decided. Here is the bigger problem. This was not a one-off decision. This is part of a pattern of Obama-Biden foreign policy. And that should surprise no one since the current policies are being managed by much the same people. In Iraq, after spending much time and effort stabilizing the country, former President Barack Obama precipitously withdrew US troops. It was like ordering firefighters who had extinguished a wildfire to not stick around after the wildfire in case the blaze rekindles. ISIS mushroomed overnight, creating the largest and most powerful terrorist state in modern history. In Libya, Obama insisted on leading from behind. And once Muammar Gaddafi was gone from the picture, he ignored the spiraling decline in the security situation until our diplomatic facilities in Benghazi were smoking ruins. This is the Obama-Biden playbook. Disengage in dangerous situations, and hope everything does not go to hell in a handbasket. And when those fond hopes do not pan out? Time to make excuses; shift blame; do anything but deal with the problem—unless there is absolutely no alternative. In the face of America is enemies, the default position of Obama-Biden foreign policy default is accommodation and appeasement. Unfortunately, the bad guys are not stupid. They had eight years to study the Obama playbook, and they know what to do with it: exploit the deliberate self-weakening. Biden is carrying on exactly the same foreign policy. Caving to Russia onNord Stream 2. Refusing to confront China on the origins of COVID-19. Pleading with Tehran to let the US back in theIran nuclear deal.

One feature of the new rules, restrictions and conditions is that future oil and gas well pads in unincorporated parts of Boulder County will generally have to be set back at least 2,500 feet from any residential dwelling, school or licensed child care facility. That setback requirement also now generally applies to the distances well pads must be distanced from work places in light industrial, general industrial, commercial, business and transitional zoning districts, under the new regulations. Well pad setbacks also will be required from public recreational trails and trail heads owned by the county or any city or town in the county. Boulder County is updated rules include expanded requirements that oil and gas operators provide financial assurances to cover the cost and risk of their operations and require stronger notice to, and intervention opportunities for, county residents who would be affected by proposed f racking sites. Boulder County is setback standards now exceed a 2,000-foot setback standard between new wells and schools and homes under a rule the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, the state is oil and gas regulatory agency, had adopted in November. Local governments, including municipalities and counties, can impose even stricter setback requirements, state and local officials have said. However, representatives of two oil and gas industry organizations — the American Petroleum Institute Colorado and the Colorado Oil and Gas Association — have criticized the new Boulder County regulations and warned against using them to prohibit future oil and gas development in the county. County officials did not adopt a ban, but they said they were closely monitoring a lawsuit that could affect local governments’ future ability to impose prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing. On December 18, Longmont received notice that a pair of environmental groups — Our Health, Our Future, Our Longmont as well as Food & Water Watch — is appealing a Boulder District Court judge is November ruling against reinstating Longmont is ban on hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas deposits within in the city limits, a measure that Longmont voters approved in 2012 and the Colorado Supreme Court struck down in 2016.

Three of them are from the Department of Homeland Security. The US Marshals is the fourth, they guard the inside of the courthouse,"" explained Cuccinelli. He went on to explain that a little known division of the DHS, called the Federal Protective Service, protects thousands of federal properties across the country, and has been protecting the Mark O Hatfield US Courthouse in downtown Portland since it was built in 1997.""This is not a new mission. It is a 24/7, 365 mission.

""And with respect to the cars, we do use unmarked cars. I almost laughed when I heard [House Speaker]Nancy Pelosimaking this 'accusation.' Maybe she should check the San Francisco Police Department.

However, Mr. President, please allow me to congratulate you on behalf of millions of Evangelicals on having been elected to serve in the highest political office in the land. And, make no mistake, we accept you aspresident. You will not hear from us the dangerous nonsense, “He will never beourpresident.”As you doubtlessly know, the Bible exhorts us to pray for “kings and all who are in authority” (1 Tim. 2:1-2). I was raised in a devout Christian home where I was taught, as most Evangelicals are at an early age, to pray for the president every day, regardless of his or her political affiliation. In fact, in my family, my mother was a Republican, and my father was a Democrat. They were both Baptist Evangelicals. I can remember praying for every president every day since I was a young boy praying for President Eisenhower. Since the n, I have prayed for every president every day, regardless of whether I voted for them or not. I can assure you that the vast majority of American Evangelicals will pray for you every day. We covenant with you to pray that our Father God will grant you godly wisdom and the mind of our Lord Jesus Christ in all your decision-making. We pray with the faith and confidence that “the king is heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turn eth it wither soever he will” (Proverbs 21:1). We will also importune our Heavenly Father to bless you with safety, health, and all spiritual blessings. On issues that involve moral and ethical values, we will both pray for you and exhort you to apply timeless biblical principles and values as you make policy decisions that will impact the families in America and the world. I can assure you that as you put the prestige and the “bully-pulpit” of the presidency behind the defense of First Amendment free speech, freedom of conscience and religion, human rights, and voice support for persecuted groups like the Uyghurs around the world, you will have the whole-hearted and full-throated support of the Evangelical community. Evangelicals are also overwhelmingly committed to the sacredness of all human life, from conception to natural death, and everywhere in between. We urge you to extend the legal protections of the law to all of our citizens, pre-born and born. Therefore, we earnestly plead with you to prayerfully reconsider your stated positions on abortion on demand. No one, not even a mother, should have the absolute right of life and death over another human being, even their child. Mr. President, we will pray for you, support you when we can do so without violating our consciences, and we are united in the rejection of violence and in our commitment to peaceful redress of grievance and nonviolent protest.

Yesterday, after not having any corrections in Tangle for more than two weeks, I made two mistakes.

Then it gets blamed on me for not catching it (Dan Sullivan is a very interesting politician who I know is from Alaska because I read about him a lot). AK is the state abbreviation for Alaska, and AR is the state abbreviation for Arkansas, and this can happen when abbreviations look alike and you are in a hurry. Anti-Asian crimes. The Tuesday night shooting spree at three Atlanta-area spas in which eight people were killed, including six Asian women, has called into focus a larger story of anti-Asian hate crimes across the country. In the case of the Atlanta, Georgia, shootings, police have not identified a key motive. The man arrested for the crimes, Robert Long, said he was acting out of an attempt to eliminate his “temptation” tied to “sexual addiction,” according to police. Investigators have not ruled out racial animus as a motivating factor, but Long denied that was his motivation while in custody. He was a frequent customer at the massage parlors and carried out the attacks “as a form of vengeance,” according to The New York Times. All but one of the victims were women. However, the shootings come at a time when news reports across the country are calling out increases in anti-Asian harassment and violence. In are port released before the shootings last week, Stop AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) Hate said they had received 3,795 reports of incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes between March of 2020 and February of 2021. From the report:The Associated Press reported a similar up tick in crime:There have been several other high-profile stories about anti-Asian crimes: An 84-year-old man died of his injuries after an attack in San Francisco, a 67-year-old man was attacked there around the same time, a family and their children we restabbed in Texasshortly after the pandemic began, and videos of elderly Asian-Americansbeing attacked in cities like New York have made the rounds on social media. Many of these crimes have been tied to animosity toward Asians because of coronavirus (which researchers believe originated in China) or general anti-Asian sentiment. Today, we are going to take a look at some of the writing in response to these news stories. The right has argued that we are witnessing a general rise in crime, that there are reasonable questions about the role white supremacy has played in these crimes, and that a lack of policing is part of the issue. In The National Review, Jim Geraghty noted the difficulty of parsing the data, especially considering that groups like Stop AAPI Hate rely on self-reported data and have no historical “control” point to compare to, since they popped up at the beginning of the pandemic.“It is also worth noting that a report that generated the frightening headline, ‘Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spiked by 150% in Major US Cities’ showed wildly different circumstances in different cities,” he wrote. “The report identified 122 incidents of anti-Asian-American hate crimes in 16 of the country is most populous cities in 2020… In Cincinnati, the number of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans increased from zero in 2019 to one in 2020, and San Diego had the same figures. Chicago stayed level with two each year. Denver and Houston increased from zero to three. Washington, DC, declined from six to three.“Every crime is worthy of investigation and prosecution, and even one case of someone being targeted for a crime because of their race, religion, or heritage is one too many,” he added. “But in this situation, it appears that the existing spotty statistics are being shoehorned into place to support a narrative of a worsening crisis. The headline ‘Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Spike in a Few US Cities, Rare in Others’ would not attract quite so much attention,” he said. In the Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe de constructed the narrative that the crimes were tied to white supremacy or Donald Trump is anti-China rhetoric.“Even if the assailant was motivated by his desire to eradicate ‘temptation,’ such a sexualization of Asian-owned businesses constitutes its own sort of racism,” she wrote. “But even more concerning than the public and the media is rush to judgment over this attack is their willingness not just to ignore rampant discrimination against Asian Americans in education and attacks in the street but to whitewash this oppression… Why? Because the source of the surge in hate crimes is not white supremacy. Not only are many prominent suspects black, but the culprit is actually the very sort of under policing the Left has been advocating for the past year.“Of the 122 anti-Asian American hate crimes documented in our 16 most populous cities last year, more than 72% were in just six cities, and 23% were just in New York. What was going on in New York City and Los Angeles that was not going on in San Diego or Cincinnati (just one anti-Asian American hate crime apiece)?” she asked. “Furthermore, prominent serial assailants, such as Yahya Muslim, who allegedly attacked three Asian Americans in one day, and Antoine Watson, accused of killing an Asian man in broad daylight, are black. That has not stopped cable news hacks like Kurt Bardella from claiming on MSNBC without evidence that the recent surge in violence is motivated by white supremacy.”The left says anti-Asian sentiment stoked by American nationalism and white supremacy needs to be addressed. In The Washington Post, Alafair Burke asked“who will march for us?”“The numbers do not capture the ugliness of these attacks,” she said. “‘Go home,’ a man yelled while throwing a glass bottle at a woman placing her baby in a car seat, appending a racial slur to the insult. Another man kicked a dog and spat on its owner, saying, ‘Take your disease that is ruining our country and go home.’ Scores of Asian American elders have been senselessly assaulted by random strangers on the street… Racism against Asian Americans often goes unrecognized and unchallenged because of stereotypes that depict Asian Americans as people who do not need protection from abuse — or who do not deserve it.“And xenophobia and misogyny often intersect,” she added. “Less than a day after the appalling shootings in Atlanta, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the suspect cited ‘sexual addiction’ as his motivation and saw the spas he targeted as ‘a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.’ With every casual ‘me love you long time’ or ‘happy ending’ joke, our culture hyper sexualizes and dehumanizes Asian American women, portraying us as victims while treating us as targets.”In Mother Jones, Inae Ohexpressed frustration over the hesitancy to call the shooting an act of racism.“One can be cautious about what caused a man to kill people while still acknowledging that watching people who look like you die for no reason looks exactly like what it is,” she wrote. “But law enforcement officials made a specific choice in ignoring that and echoing the words of a killer. And their stress for caution before labeling Tuesday is murders as racially motivated—while fore grounding the potential sexual nature of the investigation—runs the risk of falsely treating misogyny and racism as if they are mutually exclusive, when in fact, overwhelming evidence has shown that the two toxic forces are often interwoven.“The fact that Asian women make up70 percent of the recent rise in anti-Asian attacks is further proof of the parallel traumas,” she added. “In the case of Asian sex workers, the re is really no separating the inherent racism rooted in a white man is assertion that ‘sexual addiction’ prompted him to commit violence.”Before we get into the specifics of this case, I want to briefly do what you are not supposed to do in these situations and center myself. I remember vividly when I heard about the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue shootings. It was gutting for a lot of reasons: I am a Jew. Pittsburgh — the city where I went to college — is a place I love. I had been inside that synagogue before. And, worst of all, as I sent frantic text messages and em ails to check in on friends and members of the Jewish community, I learned that a family member of one of those friends had been killed in the shooting. You do not have to identify with a minority group to understand the way that kind of moment works psychologically. If you are a cookie-cutter white guy in American suburbia, it’d be a similar feeling to hearing that a mass shooting happened inside your favorite restaurant, at which you had dined just the night before. You feel sick, scared, lucky, ashamed you feel lucky and ca not help but re-run every moment around the attack in your head. It is the kind of thing that stops you in your tracks. I say all this as a preface to address my Asian readers living through this week: I just want to say I am thinking of you. I am sending my love. And I am sorry this is the world we have today. There is much we still do not know about these attacks and more we will learn. Sometimes, as in the case of the Pulse nightclub shooting, our initial understanding of these events is woefully inaccurate and ends up being totally wrong(the shooter, in that case, was believed by the public to be targeting the LGBT community, though further investigations did little to support that narrative). Other times, as in the case of the Charleston church shooting, our initial understanding falls short of the horrifying reality of the motivations behind what happened (the shooter, in that case, was believed by the public to be randomly targeting Black parishioners, but investigations revealed he was literally trying to start a race war). On one side people are screaming that this attack is rooted in white supremacy, the sexualization of Asian women, the belittling of the Asian experience, and the demonization of countries like China (i.e. Trump calling coronavirus the “China virus” or “Kung flu” or writers like me being extremely critical of the Chinese Communist Party). My response to that side is: yes, you are probably right. On the other side, people are screaming that this attack is the product of police not having the presence they need to have in these neighborhoods, that we know some of the perpetrators in high-profile cases have been Black, that we do not yet understand the Atlanta shooter is motives, and that given the data available we do not have a great grasp of this purported “wave” of anti-Asian hate crimes. My response to that side is: yes, you are probably also right. This is not bothsideism, it is reality. It is not as simple as white supremacy and it is not as simple as crime in under-policed neighborhoods. The anti-Asian sentiment in our country (much like anti-Semitism, actually) can come from across the political and racial spectrum for a variety of reasons. If you want to get really nuanced, you can throw in studies showing Christian nationalism (which exists amongst white and Black Americans) is the greatest predictor of xenophobic, anti-Asian feelings tied to coronavirus. All this is without even touching on the fact that the shooter reportedly purchased the gun he used legally, the same day, with no waiting period, the n committed exactly the kind of crime waiting periods are supposed to prevent. For now, it is okay to look at all these things and see them all as factors — with various weights and importance — that need to be considered. Because they all are. Regardless of which narrative is most “true,” the reality is Asians in our country are going to have to spend the next few weeks digesting horrifying news reports, unsettling studies and traumatic videos telling them that their fellow citizens hate them. The least the rest of us can do is try to balance that by showing them love, camaraderie and understanding. In the meantime, if you are looking for a piece that embraces the nuance of this moment, I’d highly recommendJay Caspian Kang is writing in The New York Times Magazine. So far, we are crushing it. According to Bloomberg, we have administered (which means injected) 113 million doses. Globally, the total is just over 400 million, meaning we make up more than a quarter of the global total. America makes up about 4.25% of the world is population, but we have administered about 30% of the vaccines. In total, 73.7 million people in America have already gotten one dose of the vaccine. On a per-capita basis, we are doing similarly well. Israel has given out 105 doses per 100 people, leading the way across the planet (the number of doses exceeds the number of people because most vaccines administered so far require two shots). The New York Times just did a greatpodcastabout the vaccine rollout in Israel. Seychelles, the United Arab Emirates, Maldives, Monaco, the United Kingdom (Wales, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), Bahrain and Chile all have administered more per capita doses than we have — the US comes in at eighth with 34 doses per 100 people. We are also seventh in the per capita rate of people who have gotten at least one dose. Of those seven countries, we are by far the largest and most populous.

145,France is Sarkozy faces jail term in campaign financing trial,0.0,47.0,https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20210622/news/306229971/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-herald-chicago-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-22,17,"PARIS (AP) - The trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy concludes Tuesday in Paris, after a month during which the court sought to determine whether he broke laws on campaign financing in his unsuccessful 2012 re-election bid. The verdict is expected to be rendered at a later date. Prosecutors have requested a six-month prison term, as well as a six-month suspended sentence and a fine of 3,750 euros ($4,468). Sarkozy, France is president from 2007 to 2012, denies wrongdoing. He is accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount of 22.5 million euros ($27.5 million) on the re-election bid that he lost to Socialist Francois Hollande. The trial comes after Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty on March 1 of corruption and influence peddling in another case. He has appealed that verdict. In their conclusions last week, prosecutors said Sarkozy knew weeks before the 2012 election that his campaign financing - strictly limited under French law - was getting close to the legal maximum. They accused him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning against racking up additional expenses. Instead, he gave instructions that led to more money being spent and did not put in place a supervision system, prosecutors said.'œSarkozy is the signatory and the only person responsible for his campaign financing. He is responsible for monitoring expenses, which he did not do,'ť prosecutor Vanessa Perree said. He showed 'œhis intention to exceed (the limit) by continuing to hold his rallies,'ť she added. Prosecutors said on March 10, 2012, eight weeks before the presidential election runoff, the campaign is budget was already above the legal limit. The next day, Sarkozy held a giant rally at Villepinte, north of Paris, which alone cost 6 million euros. Closer to election day, Sarkozy held almost one rally per day, including two major ones in Paris at a cost of several millions of euros. During his one-day appearance at the Paris court last week, Sarkozy vehemently denied wrongdoing. He said the extra money did not go to his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer. He said, voice often raised in anger, that he followed the financial recommendations of his staff, including cancelling two planned rallies. 'œI do not see where I was careless, where I was negligent,'ť he said. He said he 'œnever'ť gave any direct instructions to service providers in charge of the organization, because he had a team to do that.'œWe made mistakes, probably... But was there malicious intent, fraudulent intent? No, no,'ť he said. In addition to the former president, 13 other people are on trial, including members of his conservative Republicans party, accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organizing the rallies, named Bygmalion. They face charges including forgery, breach of trust, fraud and complicity in illegal campaign financing. Some have already admitted wrongdoing and detailed the system of false invoices that was meant to cover up the overspending. Prosecutors requested mostly suspended prison sentences, and up to one year in prison for the Bygmalion co-funder. The defendants 'œdisagree on everything. The declarations are not credible, possibly they are lies,'ť Perree said. Sarkozy retired from active politics in 2017, but is still playing a role behind the scenes within his party, The Republicans. French media have reported that he may end up supporting centrist President Emmanuel Macron, through an alliance with figures on the traditional right, in next year is presidential election.",2,2,Daily Herald-Chicago

(Photo by Hannah McKay-Pool/Getty Images)Trump is second impeachment was the most bipartisan one in US history, but the Senate requires a two-thirds super majority to convict. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),saidWednesday he has “not made a final decision” on how he will vote, after multiple reports emerged that he privately has said he favored impeachment. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), whotoldthelast week she wants Trump to resign,saidThursday she thought the House acted “appropriately” with impeachment, adding she would “listen carefully” during the trial, without indicating how she planned to vote. Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who previously said he believed Trump committed impeachable offenses and urged him to resign,stood byth at statement on Wednesday, adding he thought it “debatable” as to “whether or not the Senate has the constitutional authority to hold an impeachment trial for a president that is no longer in office.”In a statement Wednesday, Senator Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said it was “obvious” Trump “was derelict in his duty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law” during the US Capitol siege, without indicating which way he would vote. A Republican more loyal to Trump, Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, did not shut down the possibility of voting to convict the president in a statement after the House is impeachment vote, saying he would “thoroughly examine the arguments and evidence presented.”Before the House voted Wednesday, Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio)saidhe will do his “duty as a juror and listen to the cases presented by both sides” during the upcoming trial, leaving the door open he could vote to convict Trump. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Representative Jim Clyburn (D-SC) predicted ""there is a good chance” Trump will be convicted by the Senate. He later said he did not believe enough GOP senators were on board to convict Trump at this time.17. That is how many Republicans will need to vote to convict Trump for the effort to be successful, so long as all Democrats are on board. Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, who was the lone GOP senator to vote to convict Trump during the first impeachment trial and Susan Collins of Maine are seen as other moderate Republicans who could vote to convict Trump. Murkowskitoldthelast week she wants Trump to resign. “I want him out,” the Alaska senator said. “He has caused enough damage.”Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Lindsey Graham (R- SC), two loyal allies of the president, said they opposed impeachment on Wednesday. “The Founders designed the impeachment process as a way to remove officeholders from public office—not an inquest against private citizens,” Cotton said in a statement. Graham called Trump is second impeachment “rushed” and claimed it would “do great damage.”Trump was charged with “incitement of insurrection” by the House on Wednesday after lawmakers roundly criticized the president for fomenting a riot that breached the Capitol. McConnell said Wednesday he will not bring the Senate back early, meaning the earliest the upper chamber can begin a trial is January 19, one day before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. With just days left in Trump is presidency, it is extremely likely he will serve out the rest of his term. However, if the upper chamber votes to convict Trump after he leaves office, the Democratic-controlled Senate could the n hold a separate vote to disqualify him from office. Past precedent states that a simple majority is required to disqualify an official from office after they have been convicted by the Senate. Trump has hinted repeatedly he will run for president again in 2024.

Tuesday is accord, days before Congress prepares to return from summer recess, shows that neither President Donald Trump nor Republican or Democratic lawmakers see a political advantage in risking a partial shutdown just ahead of the elections. The agreement on a “clean” stopgap may be shorthand for avoiding “poison pills” or other controversial provisions that could hamper such a measure is enactment. Nevertheless, the door is open to potentially dozens of tweaks to spending provisions and temporary extensions of expiring programs, which often ride on a stopgap, Republican and Democratic aides familiar with the process said. The White House requested three dozen adjustments or “anomalies” to current fiscal 2020 spending laws that would be extended into the next fiscal year in a stopgap, and another 51 extensions of, or legislative tweaks to, federal programs set to expire before the end of the year. The House and Senate Appropriations committees have compiled their own lists of adjustments after conversations with agency officials. One looming question is the stopgap is length, something Mnuchin and Pelosi, D-Calif., did not discuss, aides familiar with their phone conversation Tuesday said. The White House and GOP lawmakers prefer a continuing resolution into December, giving the current Congress and president leverage to negotiate the final fiscal 2021 spending bills before a new Congress convenes in January. It is unclear where Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E Schumer, D-NY, will come down on this. Some Democrats speculate Pelosi may prefer a stopgap that extends into next year, when Democrats hope they will take control of the Senate and the White House in addition to holding the House. The agreement to negotiate a clean stopgap was a bright spot Tuesday in a reportedly otherwise dispiriting Mnuchin-Pelosi phone call over the shape of a new COVID-19 relief bill. In a press release following the conversation, Pelosi said the call “made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to have serious differences understanding the gravity of the situation that America is working families are facing.”During a hearing before a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on the same day, Mnuchin said Schumer and Pelosi “do not want to sit down at the negotiating table unless we publicly agree on a to pline.”“My own opinion,” Mnuchin said, “is we should go piece by piece, and any area of the legislation we can agree on we should have the House and Senate pass.”Pelosi has said Democrats would be willing to go down to a bill costing $2.2 trillion, while White House officials have talked about going up to $1.3 trillion.",2,2,Roll Call
148,Anti-Abortion Activist Abby Johnson Had Quite the Adventure at the Capitol Riot,-14.33,35.0,https://jezebel.com/anti-abortion-activist-abby-johnson-had-quite-the-adven-1846043253,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,15,"It appears Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion zealot and America is most famous former Planned Parenthood employee, was on the Capitol steps during last week is storming of the Hill. In a series of edited and the n deleted Facebook posts as well as a handful of still-available tweets from January 6, the motivational speaker and birth control skeptic conveys the whole spectrum of human emotion during an attempted coup, from “grinning with the president” to “antifa almost pushed me down the Capitol steps” and “I have pepper spray in my lungs.”Johnson is perhaps best known as the author of the disputed memoir that would become, a movie about a woman who is forced to kill babies at an ever-increasing clip to satisfy abortion providers’ desire to become filthy rich. Since the success of her media endeavors, she has launched a podcast, a conference, and an organization that encourages abortion providers and Planned Parenthood employees to quit their jobs. On January 6, she apparently attended the president is rally, where she took a grinning self ie and lauded “the most pro life president in our country.” From there things get somewhat hazier, though a few Twitter users have made a fairly convincing case that news footage from near the Capitol steps shows Johnson milling around in the crowd. After the group broke into the Capitol, Johnson posted two missives on Facebook, one of which has been taken down but is still available via Google cache. In the still-public post, Johnson writes that she is in DC and was “with the president earlier” but is safe despite having “got a little bit of pepper spray in my lungs,” noting she was “only mildly in the fray” earlier. The deleted post tells a somewhat more intimate—and widely debunked—story in which anti fa agitators dressed up as Trump supporters to storm the Capitol, fight the elderly, and nearly push Johnson off the Capitol steps:I am safe and sound back in my hotel. Let me just speak to a few things about today. First, from my observation, over 99% of the hundreds of thousands of people in attendance today at the Capitol were true patriots who came to support this country, our president and election integrity. They were peaceful, law abiding citizens. They were not there to vandalize anything or to cause a disturbance. We now know that some of the people who led the group that “stormed the Capitol” were actually with Antifa. There are multiple pictures of these same people at BLM protests and on Antifa websites. It is unfortunate that the media has portrayed a peaceful event as something that it was not...but that is honestly not surprising. I am not saying that there were not crazies at this event. Of course there were. Just like there are crazy anti-abortionists who bomb clinics. Just like there are women who use abortion as birth control and have 15 abortions. There is “fringe” in every movement. And fringe is usually birthed out of frustration. Some of us turn our frustration into something constructive...and some people resort to unproductive behaviors. Let me be clear with all of you. I KNOW Antifa was there because I was almost knocked down the stairs of the Capitol when a fight broke out between some Trump supporters and some Antifa activists. It was discovered that some of the people in the crowd were actually with Antifa, but were posing as Trump supporters. One of them had gotten physically violent with an elderly woman and had knocked her down the steps. A fight broke out and those men were physically removed by a group of Trump supporters. I saw it with my own eyes. I know they were there. And I know these Antifa activists were inside the Capitol because it was clear they had been gassed. (Their faces were puffy and red). Were there some fringe Trumpers who got pulled into the mix out of sheer frustration? Absolutely. But that was not 99% of the crowd. And that is not who we are. We are not the party that vandalizes and burns down buildings and hurts people. We are about law and order. That is EXACTLY why we are here...because we believe in following the law. We believe in democracy. Please pray for our nation. Jezebel wishes Johnson a speedy recovery from both the pepper spray and the cognitive dissonance. Currently, the activist isposition appears to be that “crazy people who bust into the Capitol do not represent conservatives”—and also, apparently, that Twitter is purge of toxic accounts is a false flag operation to distract from “election integrity.”",1,0,Jezebel

150,What Should We Call the Sixth of January?,-6.67,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-should-we-call-the-sixth-of-january,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"“Big protest in DC on January 6th,”Donald Trump tweeted before Christmas. “Be the re, will be wild!” On New Year is Day, he tweeted again: “The BIG Protest Rally in Washington, DC will take place at 11:00 AM on January 6th.” On January 5th: “I will be speaking at the SAVE AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the Ellipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive early—doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS!” The posters called it the “Save America March.” What happened that day was big, and it was wild. If it began as a protest and a rally and a march, it ended as something altogether different. But what? Sedition, treason, a failed revolution, an attempted coup? And what will it be called, looking back? A day of anarchy? The end of America?Trump called the people who violently attacked and briefly seized the US Capitol building in order to overturn a Presidential election “patriots”; President-electJoe Bidencalled them “terrorists.” In a section of “Leviathan” called “Inconstant Names,” Thomas Hobbes, in 1651, remarked that the names of things are variable, “For one man callet h Wisdome, what another callet h Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice.” On the other hand, sometimes one man is right (those peopleterrorists). And, sometimes, what to call a thing seems plain. “This is what the President has caused to day, this insurrection,” Mitt Romney, fleeing the Senate chamber, told aTimesreporter. By any reasonable definition of the word (including the Oxford English Dictionary is: “The action of rising in arms or open resistance against established authority”), what happened on January 6th was an insurrection. An insurrection is, generally, damnable: calling a political action an insurrection is a way of denouncing what its participants mean to be a revolution. “There hath been in Rome strange insurrections,” Shakespeare wrote, in “Coriolanus.” “The people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.” Insurrection, in Shakespeare, is “foul,” “base and bloody.” In the USs, the language of insurrection has a vexed racial history. “Insurrection” was the term favored by slave owners for the political actions taken by people held in human bondage seeking their freedom. Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, charged the king with having “excited domestic insurrections amongst us.” The English lexicographer Samuel Johnson, an opponent of slavery, once offered a toast “To the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.” And Benjamin Franklin, wryly objecting to Southern politicians’ conception of human beings as animals, offered this rule to tell the difference between the m: “sheep will never make any insurrections.”The term is racial inflection lasted well beyond the end of slavery. In the nineteen-sixties, law-and-order Republicans used that language to demean civil-rights protests, to describe a political movement as rampant criminality. “We have seen the gathering hate, we have heard the threats to burn and bomb and destroy,” Richard Nixon said, in 1968. “In Watts and Harlem and Detroit and Newark, we have had a foretaste of what the organizations of insurrection are planning for the summer ahead.” In that era, though, “riot” replaced “insurrection” as the go-to racial code word: “riots” were Black, “protests” were white, as Elizabeth Hinton argues in an essential, forthcoming book, “America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s.” “Yet historically,” Hinton observes, “most instances of mass criminality have been perpetrated by white vigilantes hostile to integration and who joined together into roving mobs that took ‘justice’ in their own hands.” This remains an apt description of what happened on January 6th. One possibility, the n, is to call the Sixth of January a “race riot.” Its participants were overwhelmingly white; many were avowedly white supremacists. A lot of journalists described the attack on the legislature as a “storming” of the Capitol, language that white-supremacist groups must have found thrilling. Hitler is paramilitary called itself the, the Storm detachment; Nazis published a newspaper calledDer Stürmer, the stormer. QAnon awaits a “Storm” in which the satanic cabal that controls the USs will be finally defeated. So one good idea would be never, ever to call the Sixth of January “the Storming of the Capitol.”What words will historians use in textbooks? Any formulation is a non-starter if it diminishes the culpability of people in positions of power who perpetrated the lie that the election was stolen. It is not a coup d’etat because it did not succeed. It is not even a failed coup, because a coup involves the military. And, as Naunihal Singh, the author of “Seizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups,”told, the word “coup” lets too many people off the hook. “The people who you want to point fingers at are the president, the party leaders, and the street thugs,” Singh said. “And we lose that if we start talking about a coup; it gives a pass to all of the Republican politicians who have been endorsing what Trump is saying.”In truth, the language of the coop seems more appropriate than the language of the coup. I mean chickens. “Coming home to roost” quite aptly describes the arrival of armed terrorists in the hall where, moments before, Senator Ted Cruz had summoned that very flock as he stood on the floor and urged the legislature to overturn the election. Derrick Evans, the West Virginia Republican lawmaker who joined the mob and, as he breached the doors of the Capitol, cried out, “We are in! We are in!” acted with more honesty and consistency than the hundred and forty-seven members of the House and Senate who, later that night, voted to overturn the results of the election after having hidden, for hours, from the very people they’d been inciting for months and even years.“Sedition” is too weak. Noah Webster, in his American Dictionary of the English Language, from 1828, offered this handy way to distinguish “sedition” from “insurrection”: “sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens.” In any case, sedition in the sense of a political rebellion, is obsolete. “Treason,” an attempt to overthrow the government, seems fair, though it almost risks elevating what looked to be a shambles: a shabby, clownish, idiotic, and aimless act of mass vandalism. If I were picking the words, I’d want to steer very clear of ennobling it, so I’d be inclined to call it something blandly descriptive, like “The Attack on the US Capitol,” or “The Sixth of January.”“Remember this day forever!” Trump tweeted at one minute past six on Wednesday night. There is no danger that anyone will forget it, by whatever name. The harder question is not what to call the events of that day, but what to make of the maddening four years and more that led up to it: the long, slow rot of the Republican Party; the perfidy of Republicans in the House and Senate since January, 2017; the wantonness of a conservative media willing to incite violence; the fecklessness of Twitter and Facebook; and, not least, the venality, criminality, and derangement of the President. Whether that story belongs under a chapter titled “The Rise and Fall of Donald J Trump” or “The End of America” awaits the outcome of events.",1,1,The New Yorker
151,Kamala Harris is a complicated choice for LGBTQ+ people,-10.0,45.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/08/kamala-harris-complicated-lgbtq-choice/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"When she was San Francisco district attorney, Kamala Harrisspent Valentine is Day of 2004officiating same-sex marriages. Just two days earlier,Gavin Newsom, the n the city is mayor, had asked city hall clerks to start issuing licenses to same-sex couples. The state is Supreme Courtordered San Francisco to shut down the wedding sand nullified the marriages of 4,000 queer people the following month. The Supreme Court would not settle California is war over marriage equality until 2013. By the n, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had already come out in support of equal marriage. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Many queer voters have historically viewed 2012, when Obama publicly stated his support for marriage equality, as a turning point. Supporting marriage equality has been used to gauge a candidate is true commitment to LGBTQ+ rights: Candidates who came out in favor of the issue before 2012 largely passed the test; candidates who backed equal marriage after just did it for political points. For Kamala Harris, that has left a lot of room for bragging rights. In a field that started with roughly two dozen major contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket, Harris stood out as the candidate who could boast the earliest explicit on-record support for marriage equality (yes, Bernie Sanders backed LGBTQ+ rights in the1970s; but he did not come out for marriage equality until2009,favoring civil unionsfirst). In 2008, when California is Supreme Court overturned the state is LGBTQ+ marriage ban, Harris again officiated queer weddings. She helped create “anLGBTQ hate crimes unit” while district attorney of San Francisco. When she was California is attorney general, she battled the “panic defense,” a legal strategy in which a person claims that anti-LGBTQ+ violence or murder is justified because the victim made sexual advances toward the perpetrator. In 2011, she backed marriage equality by petitioning to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appealsto repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage. But a lot has changed since 2012. A queer electorate that might have held up Harris as its champion eight years ago largely greeted her in 2020 with mixed emotions. At issue is her history as a prosecutor, a string of missteps on trans issues and recent support for bills cracking down on sex work. Last February, Chase Strangio, the renowned attorney who fought the watershed Supreme Court employment cases, summed up the feelings up many progressive queer voters in anop-ed for OUT Magazine.“As a prosecutor, Harris is work has been as an arm of the state fighting to lock people in cages and defending policies that destroyed lives and communities,” Strangio wrote. “Now attempting to position herself as a criminal legal system reformer and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community, Harris seeks to rewrite her past rather than own it.”Harris has faced harsh criticism because she fought to blockgender-affirming medical care for a trans woman in prison in 2015. In 2019, she told the Washington Bladethat legal briefs in her office were often written without her consultation and that as attorney general, she was obligated to defend the state.“But the bottom line is the buck stops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did,” Harris said.“Harris has taken full responsibility for this failing, and reiterated that transition ing inmates are entitled to receive the medical attention they require, need and deserve,” a Human Rights Campaign spokesperson said in a statement to The 19th. If that is how she feels about sex workers’ rights, the n she has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be her supporters.”Mychal Concepcion, a 50-year-old transgender man incarcerated at the Central California Women is Facility and the former board president ofJustice Now, a prison abolition group, said he is “super” excited that Biden chose Harris as his running mate.“She has her own views and is not shy on speaking out,” Concepcion wrote in an email to The 19th. “I believe it will push Biden to be more progressive. He is part of an older generation. He is tied to white male privilege that was/is abusive. She will be the check and balance to that!”LGBTQ+ advocates have repeatedly questioned Harris’ grasp of transgender issues. Harris backed FOSTA/SESTA, a 2018 package of bills that aimed to curb sex trafficking by shutting down sites used by sex workers like Backpage and Craigslist classifieds. But many sex workers, transgender sex workers especially, decried the measures as deadly, wiping out critical screening tools they used to keep the mselves safe. Sex work decriminalization has become increasingly popular among LGBTQ+ rights organizations. A disproportionate number of queer and trans people are engaged in sex work, often the result of employment discrimination. According to the2015 US Transgender Survey,transgender people are three times more likely than the general population to be unemployed (at 15 percent). Harris now says she supports decriminalizing sex work, butin an interview with The Root says she does not regret supporting FOSTA/SESTA— the site Backpage was profiting from ads trafficking children,she claims. Her unwillingness to re-examine the bills has left some uneasy about her as a candidate. Courtney Trouble, a non binary trans sex worker, has some of those reservations.“I feel like she is really proud of the work that she is done to get rid of Backpage and create FOSTA,” said Trouble. “And that is something that really needs to be discussed with her, because if that is how she feels about sex workers’ rights, the n she has completely ignored an entire facet of community who could be her supporters.”Publicly, LGBTQ+ groups have praised Harris as a longtime champion for equality.“Senator Kamala Harris is nothing short of an exceptional choice for Vice President,” said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a media statement. “Throughout her ground breaking career, Senator Harris has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ community, standing with us when many, even sometimes those within her own party, did not.”Equality organizations, like many voters, feel they ca not afford to do anything but push Biden to a win; the prospect of another four years under President Trump is too terrifying, they say. LGBTQ+ media organization GLAAD keeps a running tab of the president is attacks on the community; at last tally the number was 167.“Our community has a stark choice this November, four more years of a Trump-Pence administration dedicated to decimating our rights and dehumanizing us, or a new day where we are not only valued and accepted but put on a path to finally achieving the full equality all people deserve,” said a Human Rights Campaign spokesperson in a statement to The 19th. But behind the scenes, some advocates say they have told the Biden campaign that Harris still has work to do if she wants LGBTQ+ support. Monica Roberts, author of the blogTransGriotand one of the nation is most prominent Black trans advocates, questions what more Harris can do to prove herself. Harris fielded tough questions from “Pose” star Angelica Ross and singer/songwriter Shea Diamond. Both said Harris answered those concerns and took accountability for past shortcomings on trans rights.“I fail to understand why some of these trans folks act like people ca not evolve and grow,” Roberts said. “And if you ca not, or you have reasons to just ignore that fact, the n your problem with Kamala Harris is racial, not policy.”Biden himself represent sa lukewarm option for many young progressive LGBTQ+ voters. Many are no longer captivated by his 2012 support for marriage equality, which has been the law of the land for five years now. This year is expected to be the deadliest on record for transgender people, and trans women interrupted this year is forums demanding that candidates address the epidemic of violence facing their communities. Biden was the last presidential candidate to release an LGBTQ+ platform in March. I fail to understand why some of these trans folks act like people ca not evolve and grow.”He has had his own gaffes on LGBTQ+ issues. At an LGBTQ+ forum last fall, h equipped that being gay no longer came with the same stereotypes — “gay bathhouses” and ”round-the-clock sex.”The Biden campaign declined to comment for this story. Harris, as a presidential candidate, dropped an LGBTQ+ platform in October 2019. On the menu was the usual fare: a rollback of Trump is transgender military ban, an end to discrimination under the guise of religion, passage of the Equality Act. It was released on October 10, the morning of the Human Rights Campaign is LGBTQ+ town hall. That same day, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a much larger12-page platform, and Pete Buttigiegalso dropped a hefty proposal. Few talked about Harris’ LGBTQ+ platform. The Texas Tribune covered Beto O’Rourke ispitch to queer voters last June, and NBC Newsreported on Mike Bloomberg is LGBTQ+ proposals this January. Harris’ platform got little attention outside of queer media.“Something that differentiates her platform from those of other candidates is a pledge to create a White House position dedicated to LGBTQ rights,” theAdvocate noted. Earlier in the year, at a CNN town hall in April, Harris was recounting her history working in the LGBTQ+ community. She drew attention to her work outlawing “panic defenses.”“You will remember the tragic cases involving transgender men who were killed,” Harrissaid. There was just one problem. Transgender murders victims are overwhelmingly transgender women.",2,2,19th News
152,History of Queer Stigma — And How it Affects the Community is Mental Health Today,-16.0,34.33,https://www.theskimm.com/well/history-gay-lgbtq-queer-stigma-mental-health-6twukAmLBZEkbV68GZ7wrr,https://adfontesmedia.com/skimm-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-21,25,"More than one in three LGBTQ+ Americans (including more than three in five transgender Americans)faced discrimination in 2020. And, unsurprisingly, that mistreatment worsened their mental well being. It gets worse. Especially for Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial people. One study found that 43% of non-white respondents reported experiencing discrimination in some form in the past year. That is compared with 31% of white LGBTQ+ respondents. Across the board, LGBTQ+ people are at an increased risk of mental health challenges (such as depression and anxiety disorders) and suicide, compared to straight and cis gender people of the same age. And a2019 survey from the US Department of Health and Human Services found more than 47% of LGB adults said they had a mental illness. (A similar survey of just adult women showed that 24.5% said they had one.)Minority stress, aka when people from historically marginalized groups experience mental health problems because repeated prejudice against them creates a hostile social environment,is real. Particularly for transgender older adults, bisexual women, and LGBTQ+ people of color. A study of areas with high anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice showed that social stigma associated with sexual orientation has a significant impact on quality and length of life for LGBTQ+ individuals. And the risk of developing or worsening mental health issues has only intensified during the pandemic for this group, because of added job uncertainty, a home environment that might not affirm their identity, and social isolation. It was not long ago that being gay was considered a medical disorder and mental illness. The American Psychiatric Associationlisted it as a “sociopathic personality disturbance”in 1952. In 1968, it was recategorized as a form of “sexual deviation.” The classification of homosexuality as a mental illness was finally removed in 1973, but the stigma is continued. Also relevant: conversion “therapy.” About 20 US states have laws protecting minors from it, Queen Elizabeth II announced in 2021 that the UK is set to ban it, andCanadaformally took the step. Yet, an estimated700,000 LGBTQ+ people in America have gone through it. It is a practice that seeks to change a person is sexual orientation or gender identity. And it is proven to be damaging to mental health. The man who founded one of America is most well-known conversion therapy programs has even called it a “lie” and admitted it is “very harmful.”A number of politicians and policies are resisting progress. It was not until the ‘60s and ‘70s that some states began decriminalizing sodomy (including consensual anal sex between males). About a dozen states still have some form of anti-sodomy laws in effect, despite a 2003 Supreme Court decision which declared them unconstitutional. And although same-sex marriage has been legal in all 50 states since 2015, the Vatican said last year that the Catholic Church still will not bless it (thoughsome German priests are giving it their blessing). Another example: Wisconsin became the first state to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982. But it was not until 2020 that theUS Supreme Court ruled workplace discrimination “because of…sex” included an individual is sexual orientation and gender identity. Even now, a number of new anti-transgender bills are getting attention. In 2021, more than 30 states had proposed — and so far at least five states have actually passed — laws that limit the ability for young transgender people to receive certain medical treatments or play on sports teams that match their gender identity (see:Florida is bill signed into law on June 1). And 62% of Americanssurveyedthink that transgender athletes should only be allowed on the teams that correspond with their birth gender. That is despite the fact that studies show that allowing trans women and girls to play on girls' and women is teams does not create an unfair advantage. And the fact that leaving transgender athletes out can cause serious damage to their mental health. Meanwhile, the NCAA has come out in support of transgender athletes, butCaitlyn Jenner has done the opposite. And although the International Olympic Committee has had some trans-inclusive policies for more than a decade, it has not been entirely welcoming to intersex athletes and those with naturally high levels of testosterone who identify as female (see:runner Caster Semenya). But theTokyo Gameshad a record number of LGBTQ+ athletes (including the first transgender athlete). And now the IOC is changing things up a bit, with new guidance for each sport is international governing body. Like discouraging unnecessary medical testing to verify an athlete is sex. And emphasizing that testosterone levels alone ca not predict how an athlete will perform. They say the focus should actually be on whether the re is evidence of a performance advantage. But here is the start of a rainbow. The Biden administration has made a number of pro-LGBTQ+ decisions. The gov restored protections for transgender and gay people against health care discrimination,repealed a ban on transgender troops in the military, and extended federal nondiscrimination protections to cover LGBTQ+ people. And the House passed theEquality Actto ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Plus, the first openly transgender US Senate official was confirmed as assistant health secretary. Meet:Rachel Levine. It is true. Especially when LGBTQ+ individuals still report facing obstacles when trying to access medical care. Nearly three in 10 transgender individuals and 15% of LGBTQ+ Americans overall reported postponing or avoiding medical treatment due to discrimination in 2020. Multiple states have proposed legislation banning gender-affirming care. Including Arkansas, which became the first state to sign a law last yearth at prevents doctors from administering hormone treatment to LGBTQ+ minors (that law has been temporarily halted). And in February 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the state is Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate its use of gender-affirming care after the Texas AG said the treatments could be considered “child abuse”under state law. Oh, and when it comes to family planning, the re is still stigma around same-sex adoption that could negatively affect parents’ mental health. Volunteer at a place like alo cal LGBTQ+ Centeror theHuman Rights Campaign. Or donate time or money toThe Trevor Project, which specifically supports LGBTQ+ youth. That age group is dealing with high rates of mental illness and suicide (More than 40% of high school students who identify as LGBTQ+ said they seriously considered attempting it in the last year.). Learn the best terms to use (and which to avoid)so you are able to converse about sexuality and identity with sensitivity. Prioritize creating an inclusive atmosphere, which could mean anything from sharing your gender pronouns(you can now do that easily on Instagram) to bringing diverse groups of people together or being open to l earning something new. Check in on your friends who might be fighting mental health battles quietly. Vote, and consider LGBTQ+ progress when you do. Do not make assumptions about people and be willing to listen openly. LGBTQ+ people have been fighting for civil rights for decades, but progress is slow and stigma persists. And that stigma adds to a growing list of mental health challenges. If you or someone you know is struggling with anxiety or depression, which may stem from feeling discriminated against, it could be time to seek professional help.

Michael Ziemba, 49, may have lucked out due to a controversial provision of the state is landmark 2019 bail reform -- a perceived loophole that has since been addressed. Soon after Ziemba fled the scene of the crash that killed pedestrian Jason Quackenbush, a new law prohibited the judge from keeping him jailed on bail. Quackenbush was walking to a friend is house for the night when he was struck near the CSX railroad bridge on the Parkway. He died several days later in the hospital. Ziemba fled and ditched the car, which was found with 24 hours. Jason QuackenbushOn Tuesday, a free Ziemba came into court to plead guilty to felony leaving the scene of Quackenbush is crash. He agreed to spend 2 to 6 years in prison. But he gets to remain free until sentencing October 28, his lawyer, Matthew Dotzler, said. Ziemba is freedom during the fatal crash prosecution caused a stir last year when a frustrated judge, Thomas J Miller, said he had no choice to but release Ziemba from jail under the state is 2019 bail reform law. The law at the time did not allow bail to be set in fatal crash cases, beginning January 1, 2020. That is despite the fact that Ziemba had driven in dangerous ways before: hes pent time in prison two decades ago for a drugged-driving crash that injured four -- including a mother and her 14-year-old daughter. The bail reform law that sprung Ziemba has since been amended: bail is now allowed to be set on any case that causes a death. But that amendment only applied to crimes committed beginning this summer. (As an aside, the re is a legal question over whether Ziemba is crime caused a death -- he was accused of leaving the scene of a fatal crash, not being criminally responsible for the death itself -- he is not charged with speeding or drinking, for example.)In any case, the bail law at the time required Ziemba to be released as of January 1. Onondaga County prosecutor Susan Azzarellidelayed Ziemba is release for months by reopening an old domestic violence case against Ziemba, forcing him to serve an eight-month jail sentence (shortened due to prior jail time and standard reductions for good behavior). That was supposed to be enough time to prosecute Ziemba in the Parkway fatality. But the court shutdown during the pandemic adjourned Ziemba is case for so long that his sentence in the domestic case ran out a couple months ago, and he was released from jail, his lawyer said. There was nothing more prosecutors could do to keep him locked up on bail. State Supreme Court Justice Gordon Cuffy continued Ziemba is release after his plea Tuesday: after all, Ziemba had come back to court when required, which is the legal purpose of bail in the first place. Ziemba will begin his 2-to-6 year prison sentence when he returns to court for sentencing October 28. He had faced a maximum of 2 1/3 to 7 years in prison, if convicted after trial.",2,2,Syracuse Post-Standard

Howard, in Washington, also recently announced a string of high-profile hirings, including the writers Ta-Nehisi Coates and Nikole Hannah-Jones and the actor Phylicia Rashad, who was appointed dean of the fine arts program.

155,New EPA Rule Change Saves Industry Money but Exacts a Climate Cost,-6.0,46.33,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28022020/epa-hfc-refrigerant-emissions-climate-hydrofluorocarbons-pollutant-andrew-wheeler/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-02-28,21,"For the latest Trump Administration rollback of Environmental ProtectionAgency rules, the math goes something like this: The change will save businesses and industries $24 million a year. Earth is atmosphere, on the other hand, will receive emissions of pollutants equivalent to at least 625,000 new cars being added to the road. This week, EPA Administrator Andrew R Wheelersigneda new rule that relaxes the requirements that owners and operators of refrigeration equipment have leak detection and maintenance programs for hydrofluorocarbons, a set of refrigerants often referred to as“climate super-pollutants.”The rule change—the latest reversal of an Obama-era regulation—was part of the administration isagendato ease burdens on industry.“We just think it is a baffling and wrong-headed move,” said David Doniger, a senior strategic director with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposed the rollback. “Considering there are thousands of facilities subject to these rules, [$24 million] is pocket change savings.”We are hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The rule applies to a large segment of the nation is commercial sector, from agriculture and crop production to the manufacturing of food and beverage products, petrochemicals, plastics, electronics, medical equipment and even the operation of ice skating rinks. The NRDC said the agency used old data to underestimate the additional greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the rule change. In fact, Doniger said, the rule change will release into the atmosphere pollutants equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of 1 million cars. An EPA spokeswoman defended Wheeler is decision, saying that the agency determined that in 2016 it had exceeded its statutory authority by extending leak-detection and maintenance requirements to equipment using refrigerants like hydro fluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs replaced earlier refrigerants that severely damaged Earth is protective ozone layer, and their use has beengrowing. In its new rule, the EPA echoed an industry assertion that the agency lacked the legal authority to retain the Obama-era requirements for HFCs. One of the industry groups backing the Trump administration is rule change is the National Environmental Development Association is Clean Air Project, representing major companies such as Boeing, BP, Procter & Gamble, Lilly and Koch Industries. The law firm representing the association did not respond to a request by InsideClimate News for comment. But in written comments to the EPA, a lawyer representing the association called the Obama-era rule “arbitrary” and “punitive.”HFCs are among a group of chemicals known as “short-lived climate pollutants,” which do not last very long in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide, which in some cases can remain in circulation for thousands of years. Once released into the atmosphere, however, HFCs remain for only about 15 to 30 years, and their impact on global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide,according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a global partnership working to curb short-lived climate pollutants. Fifteen states and Washington, DC, tried to persuade the EPA to retain the Obama administration is leak detection and maintenance rules for HFCs. Led by Massachusetts and California, they argued that the Clean Air Act gave the EPA broad authority to stop leaks from ozone-depleting chemicals and their replacements.“Stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change are among the most severe environmental threats faced by modern human civilization,” the states argued. “The states strongly oppose any EPA action that unlawfully licenses industry to emit more ozone- and climate-damaging chemicals at the expense of human and environmental health and in contravention of the Clean Air Act and its core purposes.”Last year an amendment to the Montreal Protocol—the 1987 treaty that put in check ozone-depleting chemicals—went into force, requiring the phase-outof HFCs by 2030. Ninety-threecountries and the European Union have signed the treaty, although the Trump administration has not yet sent it to the Senate for ratification. Congress is also weighing bipartisan legislation to phase out HFCs. In November, Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.), and John Kennedy (R-La.)introducedthe American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM), a bill that would authorize a 15-year phased own of HFCs and has31 cosponsors, including both Republicans and Democrats. Representative Paul Tonko (D-NY), has introduced a similarbill, with 21 co-sponsors, also including a mix of Republicans and Democrats. Doniger said the strong bipartisan support to tackle HFCs is a sharp contrast to the EPA is decision to relax the rule on leak detection and maintenance in refrigeration. One provision of the bill, he said, “makes clear EPA has the authority to require refrigerant leak management.”James Bruggers covers the US Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

The public health department received reports of 112 new positive cases during those four days, causing the incidence rate, based on population, to hit a stratospheric high of 1,824 on Sunday.“Pitkin County now has the third-highest 14-day incidence rate in the state,” according to a Monday note on the county is daily epidemiology report. The incidence rate was above 1,700 on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, though it dropped to 1,593 on Wednesday, according to the local data. Only Bent and Crowley counties in the southeastern corner of the state had higher incidence rates, with both to pping 2,000 as of Wednesday,according to the state COVID Dial. By comparison, anything above 350 is considered above the Red level restriction threshold. The spike in Pitkin County cases also prompted the county is positivity rate — which is based on the total number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests conducted — to hit a high of 10.9% on Friday, and remain around 10% for the following three days. Anything above 10% is considered Orange level restrictions, while 15% and above is considered Red level restrictions. The positivity rate among children in Pitkin County has increased substantially in the past week, from 7.4% on December 23 to 10.9% on Tuesday, for an overall rate of 10.2% over the past two weeks, according to the local data. Pitkin County is hospitalization rate — the third metric tracked by the state — remains comfortable, though 10 people with COVID-19 symptoms were seen at Aspen Valley Hospital on Tuesday, according to the local data. Three of four ICU beds were available as well, according to the data. Beyond the rapidly increasing numbers, the troubling development for local public health officials was that Pitkin County is neighbors were seeing the opposite trend. Eagle County is 14-day incidence rate, for example, was 553 as of Wednesday, while Summit County is was 742 and Garfield County was at 1,003, according to the state is COVID Dial.“Pitkin County continues to see an increase in cases,” Vance said. “It used to be the opposite. Now it is flipped on its head. We are really trying to dive into why that is the case.”The answer remains elusive, he said. Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock was a bit more optimistic Wednesday that further restrictions put into place by the board of health starting December 22, along with at raveler affidavit program, could bring numbers down in the near future.“We really need two weeks of a data run since the last restrictions to see what impacts there are,” he said. “It is still too early to tell.”As for the trends in neighboring counties, Peacock said that Pitkin County is numbers have generally lagged behind those other counties by two to three weeks. He said he is hoping the county continues to follow that trend and the numbers start falling. The one bright spot in the latest batch of COVID numbers in Pitkin County is a drop in the percentage of positive cases attributed to community spread, or those cases where the point of transmission cannot be determined, Vance said. That rate has fallen from 35% of all cases on December 16 to 23% on Tuesday, according to local epidemiology data.“(That is) the lowest since September,” Vance said. “(It means) we are identifying the (origin of) majority of cases we find.”Increased local testing, while driving up case numbers, also is identifying more asymptomatic cases, he said. Previously, patients in 97% of positive cases in Pitkin County displayed symptoms of the disease. Now, 86% report symptoms, an important drop when talking about a virus where 15% to 20% of those infected register no symptoms.“That is sort of the one upside to this data,” he said. Beyond the travails of the next month or so, the rest of the winter and early spring is “anyone is guess,” Vance said.“February and March could continue to be dire and challenging, some say,” he said. “While others say vaccination of health care workers (and others) will bring case counts down.”The longer-term picture brings hope, though questions remain. Vance said he hopes the vaccine will be widely available to most people by late spring or early summer, though achieving “herd immunity” is contingent on how many are vaccinated. The other main question involves how effective the vaccine is in tamping down transmission, and whether the vaccine blocks symptoms or blocks both symptoms and transmission. In other words, Vance said, if a person who received the prescribed two doses of the vaccine is later exposed to the virus, does the vaccine merely block the person from feeling the effects of the disease while allowing the person to freely transmit it? Or does it prevent both, he said.“That could lead to quarantine if the person is exposed again,” Vance said. “It is an important question.”However, he said the public should have “great confidence in the vaccine and the protection it will provide.”Feb 4, 2024The Aspen High School boys basketball team is home game against Steamboat Springs on Saturday was postponed due to weather and travel concerns.

Ryan Hurley, Iowa State College Republican president told that the tweet did not intend to promote violence. Now, university officials have written a response to an “open letter” that called for disciplinary action against the conservative student group. The open letter, created by journalism Professor Kelly Winfrey (), called for “removal of recognition as an official student organization” until every “remaining current student member from the roster has graduated from the University.”Another journalism professor, Novotny Lawrence, and an academic adviser for the journalism school, Kelsi Poe, signed onto the demand to restrict free speech. In total, over 500 people signed the letter, primarily a mixture of professors, students and alumni. The letter said:We are appalled that the Iowa State University administration has decided it will not invoke disciplinary action on a student organization, the Iowa State University College Republicans (@IStateCRs), for a tweet that, having nothing to do with the political nature of the organization, incites violence and creates a campus climate that feels threatening to and isolates students, faculty, and staff of marginalized and historically oppressed populations. Privileging the free speech of those causing harm over the safety of the historically marginalized members of our community furthers the damage and sends the message that the Iowa State University community does not value their presence, despite numerous condemnations in recent months of this exact kind of behavior. It is clear that the administration is statements during a summer that served as a referendum on racism in this country, were merely symbolic and they now serve as further evidence of its history of denouncing some harmful behaviors, only to abdicate the mselves of responsibility when given the opportunity to show their commitment through action. The signers also want an updated student conduct code to address responses “to speech by students and student organizations that promote hate, directly or indirectly threaten the physical safety and free movement of members of the campus community,” or could “potentially incite violence, or violates the Principles of Community.”Finally, it wants “the Provost to begin working with academic units on campus to increase the University-wide US diversity requirement and review the approved courses to ensure the course content is centered on diversity issues.”However, the university administrators were not going to cave to the demands.“At the core of this demand [derecognition of the College Republicans] is a disconnect between the law and First Amendment freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution,” the administrators said. They explained how the First Amendment worked and concluded, “this demand asks that the university proactive ly violate the law, and we will not do so.”It corrected Winfrey for falsely claiming that student group tweets were not “protected speech if they violate university policy.”The administration explained to the journalism professor:The tweets that are the focus of this demand are protected speech, and standing alone,they do not violate university policy. The university cannot, and will not, punish students or student organizations for their constitutionally protected expression. University officials also explained again to Winfrey that First Amendment jurisprudence forbids the speech codes she seeks:Student codes of conduct at other universities that have attempted to punish students for speech deemed “hateful,” “derogatory,” “threatening,” “insensitive” or described with other such terms have consistently been struck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, the university cannot establish its own thresholds for threatening or hateful speech that are broader than the limited exceptions currently allowed in federal lawFinally, it responded to her demand for a diversity audit, pointing out to her that the faculty senate is already working on a curriculum review.“The Working Group has prepared a report which includes new, contemporary learning outcomes, and a draft process for the review and approval of courses that will meet the diversity course requirement,” the administration said.andread the full university response.

Kemp has been firm that Georgia is election was free and fair.“Any attempt by the legislature to retroactively change that process for the November 3rd election would be unconstitutional and immediately enjoined by the courts, resulting in a long legal dispute and no short-term resolution,” Kemp and Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncansaidin a statement addressing calls for him to convene a special session. Trump has often asserted that Georgia is recount efforts are “fake” and claimed without evidence that state election officials are unable to verify signatures on absentee ballots. His claim is incorrect. The Associated Press already conducted af act check that showed “There is nothing in the consent decree that prevents Georgia election clerks from scrutinizing signatures.”“The legal settlement signed in March addresses accusations about a lack of statewide standards for judging signatures on absentee ballot envelopes,” the AP continues, noting that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has said that verifying signatures is both possible and required by the state.

159,How to Close the Democrats’ Rural Gap,-15.5,37.0,https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2019/how-to-close-the-democrats-rural-gap/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-01-01,25,"The midterm elections made two things very clear about Democratic voters in the Donald Trump era. First, they vastly outnumber Republican voters: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives and won the popular vote by more than eight percentage points, the biggest midterm “blue wave” since Watergate. But, second, those Democratic supporters are geographically clustered in a way that wastes millions of their votes. While the party improved its margins among rural voters compared to 2016, its candidates still lost by a whopping fourteen to eighteen percentage points outside of metro areas, lagging well behind Barack Obama is 2012 performance. As a result, Democratslosttwo net Senate seats. The Senate map in 2020 is only slightly less foreboding, as statewide races in heavily rural states like Iowa, Missouri, and the Dakotas seem to slip ever further out of reach. There was a time in the very recent past when many on the left were confident that an era of Democratic dominance was just around the corner, the inevitable result of a “rising electorate” of younger, better educated, and more diverse voters. The midterms were a wake-up call. The rising electorate may be swinging left, but there has been an equal reaction among older and less educated whites—and they represent a lot more of the political map. Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. Mindful of this reality, many Democratic strategists are rightly warning that the party desperately needs a strategy to win back rural voters. Unfortunately, the most prominent plans tend to combine small-bore ideas that are insufficient to the scale of the problem (like more money for rural broadband) with attacks on Trump is agricultural tariffs, which Trump-supporting farmers actually tend to give the president a pass on. While the notion that all Trump voters are motivated by “economic anxiety” has been thoroughly debunked, the re is no denying that America is agricultural communities have been starkly declining for years-struggling to turn profits through farming, suffering epidemic levels of op io id addiction and suicide. Democrats thus have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to try to win these voters back by offering policies that will improve their livelihoods in a way that stoking white cultural grievance never will. Just ask JD Scholten. The thirty-eight-year-old former minor league baseball player garnered national attention in November for almost unseating Iowa Representative Steve King, an eight-term Republican incumbent in one of the reddest districts in America—and perhaps the most unabashed racist in Congress. The last Democrat to run against King lost by 22.6 percent; in 2016, the district went for Trump by twenty-seven points. Yet Scholten lost by only 3.4 percentage points—a swing from 2016 that, if it could be replicated nationally, would all but wipe out the current incarnation of the Republican Party. How did he do it?“I have a lot of folks calling me thinking of running for president and they want to know what their rural message should be,” Scholten says. His answer: “Talk about market consolidation.”Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote. At his thirty-nine town hall meetings, across every county in Iowa is Fourth District, Scholten spoke about improving the economy by addressing the growing power of agribusiness monopolies, which, by raising prices on what farmers buy and pushing down prices of what farmers sell, are devastating farm incomes. “Agriculture is the backbone of this district,” Scholten says. “At every [town hall] I talked about how farmers are being squeezed on the input and on the output side. . . . That resonated more than tariffs ever did, and I think that is one thing that national reporters never understood.“I think farmers view tariffs as temporary, whereas market consolidation is a long-term issue,” he adds, noting that the call for fair competition has bipartisan appeal. “Anti-trust . . . has not been a partisan issue. Traditional Republicans, they want competitive markets, and that goes against what is happening in the ag business.”Scholten is message on agribusiness monopolies may have resonated with farmers, but it has not yet broken through with big-city liberals, too many of whom write off the possibility that progressive economic populism could appeal to rural voters more than right-wing cultural warfare. Until Democratic leaders and candidates find their voice on the key issue affecting rural communities’ economic fortunes, even the biggest blue wave will not be enough to take back the map. If you have heard about the plight of America is farmers, it was likely in the context of Trump is media vortex. You may have seen stories about dairy farms closing because Trump made a fuss about Canadian dairy markets while renegotiating NAFTA Or you know that China aimed retaliatory tariffs at farmers to target Trump is base. But while Trump is trade policies have certainly made matters worse for many farmers, they are hardly the prime cause for the full-blown crisis gripping America is farm economy. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. The three years leading up to the 2016 election saw the sharpest decline in farm incomes since the Great Depression. In 2015, more than half of all farm households lost more money than they made farming. By now, many observers are predicting that we are on the verge of a farm crisis more dangerous than the one that ripped rural America apart in the 1980s. The downturn is particularly devastating for grain and dairy farmers, who rely on large annual operating loans to keep going each season. After four to five years of losing money on every acre of grain or gallon of milk, these farms have exhausted their credit lines. Farmers’ debt-to-income ratios are the highest they have been in three decades. Wisconsin alone has lost 1,100 dairy farms over the past two years. One large dairy co-op in the Northeast sent its members a list of suicide and mental-health hot lines along with their dairy checks. As farm income declines, so do whole regions. First, local equipment dealers and seed and feed suppliers close. Then, with the decline in economic activity and eventual loss of population, so do local banks, schools, and hospitals. Most people in rural America are not farmers, but in traditionally ag-dependent regions, even non-farmers’ livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on farm income, which is often the only substantial source of incoming wealth. What is behind the accelerating decline? One popular idea in elite quarters is that the plight of rural America was foreordained by technological change. As agriculture becomes more productive, the thinking goes, we need fewer farmers, and so rural communities naturally depopulate. Meanwhile, a digitized, global economy naturally gives the highest reward to highly skilled “knowledge workers” who feed off each other is creativity by clustering in elite cities. That is the the me of a recent report by the Brookings Institution, revealinglyentitled“Strategies for Left-Behind Places.” It concludes that the growing gap between elite cities and rural America is the inevitable result of digital technology, which has “increasingly rewarded the most talent-laden clusters of skills and firms.”That is a narrative that appeals to many experts, who not coincidentally live in those “talent-laden clusters.” It suggests that the plight of Left-Behind Places is nobody is fault—it is the result of an impersonal evolutionary process that just happens to favor coastal elites while crushing the maladapted. Well, here is a different take—one that has far more resonance in heartland America and is backed up by overwhelming evidence. The biggest cause of growing regional inequality is not technology; it is changes in public policy, embraced by both parties, that have enabled predatory monopolies to strip wealth away from farmers and rural communities and transfer it to America is snazziest zip codes. Here is how it works. Farmers are caught between monopolized sellers and buyers. They must pay ever higher prices to the giants who dominate the market for the supplies they need, like seed and fertilizer. At the same time, they must accept ever lower prices from the giant agribusinesses that buy the stuff they sell, like crops and livestock. Start with how corporate concentration affects the prices farmers pay. In 1994, the top four seed companies controlled only 21 percent of the global seed market. By 2013, just the top three controlled 55 percent, with Monsanto alone controlling more than a quarter. With that increase in concentration has come a shocking increase in the cost of seed, because these giants face little pressure to compete on price. USDA data shows that the per-acre cost of soybean and corn seed spiked dramatically between 1995 and 2014, by 351 percent and 321 percent, respectively. Today is seeds are often genetically modified to produce higher yields, but that does not translate into more net income for the farmers. Not only is the cost of genetically modified seed high, but patent monopolies often make it illegal for farmers to use a portion of their crops to produce their own seeds, as most did in the past. Moreover, even as farmers are paying monopoly prices for a diminishing selection of seed strains produced by handful of giant corporations, they also are paying monopoly prices for fertilizers and pesticides, often to the same corporations. Since 2017, the Big Six seed and agric hemic al companies have shrunk to four, after Dow merged with DuPont and Bayer purchased Monsanto. The top four producers of nitrogen fertilizer controlled 34 percent of the market in 1977, but by 2015 had increased their share to more than two-thirds. As crop prices fall and farmers look for areas to cut back on the cost of inputs, many feel up against a wall. “[Seed companies] figure out, how much will a farmer actually pay for seed corn before he will go switch to some other company,” says Nebraska farmer Vern Jantzen. “If I do not like what Mycogen is charging for seed corn I can go to Pioneer and I can go to Dekalb, but the re is only three guys. If they all kind of talk to each other a little bit, there is not a whole lot of difference in prices.” That is, of course, when there are even multiple sellers to choose from. The same story holds for chemicals used in agriculture, whose prices roughly tripled from 1990 to to day, with the steepest increases after 2007. The fertilizer market is dominated by several international phosphorous and potash cartels, and a 2013 monograph by the American Antitrust Institute made the case that price swings in these markets were due tooligopolistic behavior. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. While Trump is trade policies have certainly made matters worse, they are hardly the prime cause. All together, the average farmer spends three times more on inputs per acre today than in the 1990s. Recently, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, John Hansen, looked up the corn prices from 1973, when he started farming. At that time, he sold corn for $3.30 a bushel; in 2017 the average price per bushel was $3.33. “So, how does it work to live and farm in 2017 and pay for those 2017 costs with 1973 prices?” Hansenaskedin a message to NFU members. “The honest answer is that it does not work.”It does work, though, for the seed and chemical companies. Before their acquisition by Bayer and recent legal trouble, Monsanto touted record seed sales and profits in 2017. “They have had a boom while farmers have gone broke,” says Joe Maxwell, who is a farmer, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets. Even as monopolization means that farmers pay more for the supplies they need, it also means that they receive less for the food they produce. Nationally, the top four beef packers slaughtered 25 percent of cows in 1977; today that is up to 84 percent. As recently as 1990, four companies processed 61 percent of all soybeans; today those same four process 85 percent. These statistics actually understate the problem, because at the local level, dominant agribusinesses often have total monopolies. “Today you will find that in most all this country, really, the re is just one buyer,” says Maxwell. “It is as if they all sat in a room somewhere and carved the country up.”This degree of corporate concentration has turned farmers into price takers. If the re is a single statistic that captures the plight of rural America, it is this: In the 1980s, when American consumerss penta dollar on food, 37 cents out of that dollar went back to the farmer. Today, farmers receive less than 15 cents on every dollar. The difference is increasingly flowing to powerful and concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. In 2016, the big meat-packer Smithfield openly bragged about how its record profits were due to a fourteen-year low in the prices paid to hog farmers and simultaneously higher consumer prices for packaged pork products. The same story repeats across agricultural sectors, from grains and produce to eggs and poultry. The Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginias says its chicken farmer members have not seen an increase in base pay for the past twenty years. Nor do consumers benefit. Chicken and turkey retail prices grew steadily over the last decade, by 19 percent and 47 percent from 2007 to 2013, respectively, before finally slowing and the n slightly declining over the past three years. As Big Ag cuts farmers’ margins, often the only way farmers can see to stay in business is to try making it up on volume. This is what accounts for the emergence of “confined animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs, in which thousands of animals are crammed together in inhumane conditions. CAFOs reflect the ruinous competition farmers face with one another. They also pose a massive threat to human health, as some farmers routinely use nontherapeutic antibiotics on animals crowded into confined spaces, producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they cause vile pollution from large manure lagoons, further detracting from the quality of life across expanding sections of rural America. When Barack Obama was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, he seemed to understand the role that corporate concentration was playing in immi ser ating much of rural America. Campaigning in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, he promised to take on abuses by monopolistic agribusinesses, particularly meat-packers. Early in his presidency, he followed up on these promises by having top Agriculture Department (USDA) and Justice Department officials hold hearings across the country to investigate malpractice in the poultry, cattle, dairy, and seed industries, as well as the growing gap between the prices consumers paid and farmers received. At the conclusion of these hearings the USDA proposed rule changes that would have given farmers far greater power to stand up to abuses by ag monopolies. But the blowback was immediate. Big Meat threw its lobbying weight behind an effort to block the reforms. Soon, sixty-eight Republicans and forty-seven Democrats delivered a letter to the USDA saying that the new rules were unjustified and required more industry input and economic analysis. Obama could have implemented the rules unilaterally, but for whatever reason his secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, hesitated. Then, in 2010, Republicans took the House and began passing appropriations riders that stripped the USDA of the necessary funds to implement the rules even if they had gone into effect. In December 2016, Vilsack finally signed off on a significantly watered-down rule change. But shortly after President Trump took office, new Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue shot down even these modest reforms and dissolved the USDA is antitrust agency entirely, burying its duties within the agribusiness-friendly Agricultural Marketing Service agency. So it turns out that the Democrats briefly did have a rural policy that took monopoly seriously, but gave it low priority and retreated in the face of corporate opposition. Today, this record leaves many farmers bitter, especially those who risked retaliation by testifying at the USDA hearings about the abuses they suffered at the hands of monopolists. That bitterness is only amplified when they hear voices in the Democratic Party arguing for solutions that fail to acknowledge the party is own role in fostering agribusiness monopolies. Writing in the New York Timesshortly after the election, columnist Michael Tomaskyrecommendedthat the party embrace a “four pillar” plan written by Tom Vilsack, which calls for, among other things, spending more money on op io id addiction treatment, encouraging more local farmers’ markets, and directing more payments to farmers who set aside land for conservation. But Vilsack is plan pointedly fails to mention a central cause of American farmers’ misery, let alone any strategies for taking on the agribusiness monopolies he failed to roll back during his time in office. Perhaps not coincidentally, Vilsack is currently the president and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council, an agribusiness lobbying group. Other plans circulating in Democratic quarters embrace a kind of social Darwinism to explain the growth of regional inequality and the n propose solutions that are almost insulting in their inadequacy and implicit victim blaming. Brookings Institution is “Strategies for Left-Behind Places,” for example, states flatly that it would be “inefficient to ‘save’ every left-behind small city or rural community in the US” It the n argues that the best that can be done is to offer displaced farmers and rural workers more broadband networks, some targeted federal economic development programs, and training in programming skills. The report concludes by calling for changes to zoning laws that would produce more affordable housing in high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco, the reby allowing more heart landers to move to those thriving metropolises—a solution that would, of course, only exacerbate the problem of coastal population clustering. Though the report does mention rising monopoly as a cause of regional inequality, it stops short of recommending anti-monopoly measures as part of the solution. Big Ag would obviously oppose any Democratic effort to win in rural America with an anti-monopoly playbook. But policy levers, large and small, are available at every level of government to politicians who want to show their solidarity with ordinary voters in rural communities. The big policy levers include things like busting up ag monopolies and reforming giant food co-ops. An encouraging start is a pair of complementary bills, introduced by Senator Cory Booker and Representative Mark Pocan, both Democrats, that would put an eighteen-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers while a new commission studies ways to improve competition policy enforcement. (For more details,see“The Three Ways Democrats Can Fix the Farm Economy” by Adam Diamond.)Smaller-scale but still substantive measures include legislation that would prevent meat-packers from vertically integrating into owning livestock or forcing farmers into exploitative contracts. Booker and Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would have addressed agricultural monopoly in still another way, by reforming so-called “checkoff” programs. These are federally sponsored programs that collect money from farmers to market their product but that often wind up financing agribusiness lobbying groups (The amendment failed, but did draw thirty-eight votes from across both parties.) At the local level, mandating that schools use more locally grown food in their cafeterias is one available weapon for combating agribusiness monopoly. In the 1980s, when American consumers spent a dollar on food, 37 cents went back to the farmer. Today, it is less than 15 cents. The difference is increasingly flowing to concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. Advocating for such policies could appeal to a far broader set of Americans than just farmers. One reason is that monopolization in agriculture has by now become so extreme that even as it drives down prices for farmers, it can also drive up prices for consumers. This reality has been reinforced by recent investigations into price fixing at tuna companies, mega-brewers, dairy co-ops, chicken processors, and pork packers. Monopolization also affects urban and suburban consumers by forcing farmers into a system of industrial-scale monoculture that lacks resiliency in the face of climate change, poses substantial human health and environmental threats, and produces a level of cruelty to animals that more and more Americans can no longer abide. Though rural and urban Americans may differ on many cultural wedge issues, their common victimization by monopolists provides an issue that bridges the divide. Taking on agribusiness monopolies also provides a way to do something important for farm and food chain workers exploited under the current system. Many of the people who pick our food and cut our meats, whether they are undocumented immigrants, refugees, people of color, or working-class whites, are further marginalized when a single agricultural giant controls all the jobs available to them across whole regions. Rural communities are also deeply oppressed by other forms of monopoly. These include the closing of local hospitals bought out by giant corporate chains; the takeover of locally owned financial institutions by taxpayer-subsidized “too big to fail” banks; the loss of connectivity to the global economy that results when airlines cut off service to “flyover country”; and the threats posed by deregulated freight railroad monopolies that are abandoning service to farms and industries along branch lines while charging monopoly prices on the mainline traffic they keep. JD Scholten also points to how large chain stores like Dollar General “sink money out of the community” by shutting down locally owned retailers. Restoring antitrust enforcement across the board, including against companies like Walmart and Amazon, would go a long way toward allowing local economies to once again compete on an even playing field. “Part of that rural identity is being independent,” argues Scholten. “Now [rural communities] are reliant on a corporation rather than being self-employed, and I think that is part of the issue.”In the face of such challenges and opportunities, leaders interested in addressing the nation is growing economic and political divides should stop listening to people who think we can fix the problems of rural America with more broadband, coding classes, and zoning changes. Instead they should pay attention to people like Scholten who know what they are talking about and are willing to say it out loud.",1,1,Washington Monthly

Thousands of Californians have fallen behind on their rents and mortgages as joblessness skyrocketed – with the Legislative Analyst is Office estimating that even with unprecedented government assistance, Californians owed $400 million in unpaid rent in 2020. Even before the pandemic, middle- and low-income residents were leaving the state for more affordable options. At the heart of this is what we have long known: exorbitant housing costs have made it extremely difficult for families to save for a rainy day, keep paying their rent and mortgages in the case of an emergency, and work their way into the middle class. Governor Newsom and legislative leaders have indicated their commitment to figuring out long-term solutions to California is housing crunch, and much policy work in the Legislature has focused on affordable housing options for California is most vulnerable citizens. We applaud this commitment and the work done thus far; however, housing afford ability is an issue that impactsmiddle-classCalifornians as well. Even before the pandemic, middle- and low-income residents were leaving the state for more affordable options, with fewer people moving into the state to replace them. Most leaving the state had an income of less than $100,000, with most moving into the state making over $100,000 – exacerbating problems of income inequality. As we work to rebuild from the pandemic and create a California that is accessible for all, new housing construction that reduces costs and lessens time to project completion is vital to those efforts. The Housing Contractors of California, as the dedicated businesses building housing options for California is middle class, stand ready to work with Governor Newsom, legislative leaders, and other stakeholders to spur new housing construction, yet are increasingly concerned about solutions to the “missing middle” housing problem. One immediate way that Governor Newsom and legislative leaders can partner with us to lower the cost of housing on all Californians is to help end unscrupulous lawsuits against housing contractors that drive up the cost of housing. The Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, was designed to help workers remedy violations of state labor code through civil suits, but has ballooned to costly and prolonged legal battles even when no substantial violation occurred, often ending with settlements before they reach the court. When it comes to the state is housing crisis, the threat of PAGA litigation diminishes the ability of private contractors to help make a dent in the housing crunch. Many of these frivolous lawsuits have resulted in millions of dollars in unforeseen construction costs that ultimately get passed on to the homebuyer, needlessly driving up price of home ownership for Californians across the state. Unfortunately, these barriers of entry put on home buyers are not getting enough attention. Housing contractors, state agencies, and the business community at large have all noted that PAGA has primarily benefitted attorneys who bring claims with or without merit, only to settle quickly out of court for little money and with their fees reimbursed. A recent report showed that PAGA claims through private attorneys cost twice as much, deliver half the benefit to workers, and take longer than when the state Labor Commissioner resolves the claim directly. PAGA reform is essential to reducing housing costs. The Housing Contractors of California are eager to get to work on solving our state is most intractable housing challenges, furthering the construction of market rate housing for the middle class and expanding home ownership and opportunity to all. Creativity must match political will in order to help heal the inequalities the pandemic has brought to light and the ways in which Californians looking to get ahead are unfairly being punished. We call on Governor Newsom and legislative leaders to help us grow the middle class and make housing more affordable, prio rit izing missing middle housing with equal urgency as other sectors of the housing crisis.

LOUIS — Circuit Attorney Kimberly M Gardner won Tuesday is Democratic primary for the city is top prosecutor by a healthy margin. Gardner, who is completing her first term, defeated former assistant prosecutor Mary Pat Carl, 61% to 39%, according to final and unofficial results. She will face Republican challenger Daniel Zdrodowski in the November election. He ran unopposed Tuesday. Gardner, 45, the first Black woman elected circuit attorney in St. Louis, has promised to continue efforts to reform the criminal justice system. Her controversial first term has been highlighted by tensions with police and criticism of her leadership as well as prosecutions of powerful people including a Missouri governor. She has described her opponents as “status quo tacticians” who have wagedracial,politicalandsexistattacks on her reform efforts. She said she also has received racist death threats.“I feel humbled,” Gardner told supporters at a rooftop warehouse watch party Tuesday night. “This is an exciting time, but this is also the people is time. This is about the people who elected me, the people in this room who fought for equality and justice and this is about people who sent a resounding message that they want reform in the city of St. Louis.”Carl, 43, came in second to Gardner in a field of four Democrats in the 2016 primary. She campaigned on her more than 14 years of experience prosecuting crimes in St. Louis. She pledged to restore stability to a Circuit Attorney is Office that has weathered dramatic turnover under Gardner. Carl said she had hoped to give crime victims a voice in the courtroom, end cash bail and hold amnesty days for those who miss court dates. She, like Gardner, supports closing the city is Medium Security Institution better known as the workhouse.“We ran a strong campaign under unprecedented circumstances,” Carl tweeted Tuesday night. “I am proud of what we accomplished, and grateful for the commitment so many made. I wish Ms. Gardner a successful term. I urge her to be transparent with the public, and build working relationships for a safer St. Louis.”During her campaign, Gardner said she had worked to hold police accountable and reduce crime by focusing on its roots — poverty, addiction and mental health. Gardner took credit for a declining city jail population through pretrial diversion programs and no longer prosecuting people for small amounts of marijuana. A central issue in Gardner is first term has been her office isongoing legal fight to win a new trial for a St. Louis man imprisoned for 25 years for a murder Gardner insists he did not commit. Carl and Gardner both picked up last-minute financial support from dozens of donors in the two weeks before Tuesday is primary, according to campaign finance reports. Carl is campaign took in at least $313,000. Backers included lawyers and businesses, and the St. Louis-Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council. The STL Justice PAC received an $44,000 donation from theJoseph Wingate Folk Societyon July 23 toward Carl is campaign.

After the rioters were finally driven from the Senate chamber on January 6, while Capitol Police received first aid for their wounds and broken glass lay scattered in the halls, Sens. Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall came back to the floor and voted to set fire to millions of Americans’ votes in the 2020 election. Neither Blunt nor Moran played their colleagues’ dangerous, seditious game of political the ater. So I thought there was a chance our states’ senior senators would surprise us this week. Both have lengthy, distinguished careers in Washington, with an almost 50 years’ combined service that long predates Trump is takeover of their party. And while they can show their partisan stripes with the best of them — Blunt dipped more than a to e into theBarack Obama birth er waters— both men can also point to records of solid bipartisanship and legislative seriousness. Blunt rose to the occasion with afine, patriotic speech at the inauguration of President Joe Biden — an event Trump and his minions continue to decry as illegitimate. Moran notably remained a vocal Trump skeptic as late as May of 2016, concerned about the likely nominee is ability to “unite the Republican Party around our common goal of securing a brighter future for our kids and grandkids.” Famed DC journalist Carl Bernstein named them both on his long list of Republican senators who secretly express “extreme disdain” for President 45. Yet Blunt and Moran still voted to absolve Trump of clearly impeachable conduct. Twice. We should have expected democracy would strike out a third time on the commission. Today is Grand Old Party, its base terrorized and lied to all day by the Fox News/Breitbart/Facebook entertainment-industrial complex, is no place for statesmanship — especially when the states you represent are as deep red as Missouri and Kansas. And with Facebook is to p-performing posts overwhelmingly dominated by ring-wing misinformation on a daily basis, that does not look likely to change any time soon. It is not yet been even six months since the riot. We ca not begin to know what the inevitable investigations will uncover. But we can be certain the images from that disgraceful coda to Trump is chaotic term — the mob marching from his rally to fly his flags alongside the Confederacy is under the Capitol rotunda — will be seared into our national memory for generations to come, alongside the last chopper fleeing Saigon and the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr. is assassination. Roy Blunt and Jerry Moran, you had the chance to stand, for posterity, with Sens. Mitt Romney and others in your party who chose not to tie the mselves to a two-time popular vote loser. You chose otherwise. And the most enduring lines in your biographies have been written. This story was originally publishedMay 28, 2021, 11:00 AM.",1,1,Kansas City Star

Notably, the hall will also welcome several other artists that did not appear on the general ballot this year but are being inducted in other categories, including two artists that have been repeatedly nominated in the past without being voted in, Kraftwerk and LL Cool J Among the main crop of performer inductees, women were voted into three of six slots — representation that is likely to be welcomed after years of complaints that rock is female pioneers have gone underrepresented — and two out of six are Black artists. Among the main crop of a half-dozen inductees, King and Turner are receiving their second inductions. Tina Turner was voted into the hall all the way back in 1991 as half of the duo Ike and Tina Turner. King is previous induction goes back even a year prior to Turner is. She was brought in as half of a duo, too, when she was inducted along with former partner Gerry Goffin in the songwriting category in 1990. Neither had ever been nominated as a solo artist until this year. King and Turner are the second and third women to be selected for induction twice, after Stevie Nicks came in as a solo artist in 2019 following her previous membership as a member of Fleetwood Mac. Most of the class of 2021 got in the first time they appeared on the ballot, although that should come with a big asterisk for some who had been long eligible. The Go-Go is had never been nominated before — a huge point of controversy and contention for a hall that had been accused of recognizing pioneering women rockers late, if ever (with some seeing New York vs LA bias also figuring into their previous exclusion). Interviews around the Go-Gos’ Sundance/Showtime documentary last year led to inevitable media discussions of why the band had never been in contention despite being eligible for roughly 15 years. Meanwhile, Foo Fighters also got in their first time on the ballot, but this was their first year of eligibility, with a mere quarter-century having passed since the band is debut album. Dave Grohl, of course, will join Turner and King as a double inductee, having previously been brought in as the drummer for Nirvana. Todd Rundgren got the nod on only his third nomination, although he became eligible in 1996; he was previously nominated in 2019 and 2020. King was previously nominated as a performing artist only once before this year, remarkably… all the way back in 1989. Special awards being given out in three other categories are certain to get a lot of attention, especially because of the inclusion of artists who’d previously been repeatedly put before voters in the main performer category without success. Kraftwerk is being recognized with an “Early Influence Award.” The pioneering electronic group had previously been nominated as performers six times, starting in 2003 and as recently as last year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame finding a different way to get them in may be seen as the inner circle saying: If the general voter ship will not do the right thing, after repeated opportunities, we will. The same goes for LL Cool J, who is being given a “Musical Excellence Award.” Like Kraftwerk, the rapper-actor, too, had been nominated six times before, starting in 2010 and continuing through this year is ballot. Joining LL Cool J in getting that Musical Excellence honor are solo star and “fifth Beatle” Billy Preston and metal guitarist Randy Rhoads. Those being recognized with an Early Influence Award besides Kraftwerk are soul-jazz performer (and seminal hip-hop influence) Gil Scott Heron and early 20th century blues musician Charley Patton. Finally, the singular Ahmet Ertegun Award, typically given to executives or other non-performing figures, this year goes to Clarence Avant, the celebrated industry trailblazer who was subject of the 2019 Netflix documentary “The Black Godfather.”And now, a moment of loud rock ‘n’ roll silence for those 10 artists on the 2021 ballot who did not make it to the final six, a highly illustrious crop in and of itself: Kate Bush, Devo, Dionne Warwick, Rage Against the Machine, Chaka Khan, Iron Maiden, Mary J Blige, the New York Dolls, Fela Kuti… and LL Cool J, who, as previously noted, is getting a separate entree. The 36th annual ceremony is set for October 30 at Cleveland is Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, a welcome return to live proceedings after last year is class had to settle for a virtual, pre-recorded HBO induction due to the pandemic. SiriusXM subscribers will be able to hear a live simulcast and, as always, an edited version will be seen later on HBO (and, now, the streamer HBO Max).",2,1,Variety

By July 4th, he wants 70% of all Americans adults to have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. That is 160 million people.“Let is celebrate our independence as a nation and our independence from this virus,”Bidensaid from the White House on Tuesday afternoon. He said new pop-up clinics – including mobile clinics – will be deployed to help meet the new benchmark. Pharmacies will also expand walk-in appointments. Additional resources will be devoted to rural areas, where inoculations have lagged. NEW: Pres. Biden gives COVID update:– 220 million vaccine shots given as of last week– Over 105 million Americans fully vaccinated– 70% of seniors fully vaccinated– Cases down in 40 states over last two weeks– Deaths down over 80% among seniors.— ABC News (@ABC)May 4, 2021Biden said his administration is also preparing to vaccinate young Americans if the FDA approves it. He said federal officials will ship vaccines directly to pediatricians. “The administration is “challenging” states to administer at least one shot to as many teens as possible by July 4, so they can be fully vaccinated by the time school starts in the fall,”reports USA Today. More than 40% of US adults – some 105 million – are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data, and 147 million Americans have received at least one dose. The New York Timesprovides more details on Biden is remarks:In an afternoon address, the president pledged more funding for outreach campaigns designed to convince those reluctant to get shots of the need to protect their own health and that of others. Despite a flood of vaccine available, providers are administering about 2.29 million doses per day on average, about a 32 percent decrease from the peak of 3.38 million reported on April 13, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senior health officials have decided that herd immunity — the point at which the virus dies out for lack of hosts to transmit it — will likely remain elusive. But if 70 percent of the population is at least partially vaccinated, the nation can keep gradually removing restrictions that impede normal life, one senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity at a briefing for reporters.",2,1,News and Guts

Considering this is the same nation that houses Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and Saint Louis, that is saying something. However, in most of those cities, if someone tries to hurt the police, they will be arrested, prosecuted, and possibly convicted in a court of law. Due process will be carried out, but an effort will be made to right the wrong of someone trying to injure a law enforcement officer. In Portland, though,that does not seem to be the case. Scores of the500 people who were arrested during the nearly 75 days of violent Portland riots will have their charges dropped by the newBlack Lives Matter-approveddistrict attorney. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt announced that his default position is not to prosecute and that most crimes by rioters will be forgiven and forgotten. That list of crimes includes interfering with a police officer, disorderly conduct, and rioting.-interfering with a police officer-disorderly conduct-criminal trespass-harassment-escape in the 3rd degree-riot (somtimes in some circumstances)Attacks on police officers and resisting arrest will be scrutinized based on whether – and we are not making this up – police caused rioters to react because they used tear gas or other crowd-control measures causing rioters to “instinctively lash out.”Sweet dancing baby Elvis on a cold-fusion-powered surfboard, really?Schmidt is actually taking the “look what you made me do” defense seriously?After all, this is what he is arguing. He is claiming that police using well-proven crowd-control techniques on rioters somehow makes it their fault if those rioters hurt them. I’d ask if he was kidding me with this crap, but this is Portland. No, people there actually mean this kind of nonsense. They actually seem to believe that anything they do to the police is justified. And what is worse is that the people of Portland seem to want this kind of thing. While I do not think police should have to do whatever they want free from repercussions, the use of tear gas and these other crowd control measures have long been established policy for trying to break up things like riots. Now, they are basically being told that if a “protestor” physically assaults them and causes injury, the DA is office will not do a damn thing. So what are they suppose to use, harsh language?Schmidt is also not prosecuting people for curfew violations, either. In other words, Portland is pretty much lawless right now because the DA is more concerned with appealing to the mob than doing his damn job. It is absolutely pathetic. It is also a case of all but begging for Portland to burn. The rioters will likely feel more emboldened and continue their antics until things get even more out of control. Do not be surprised to see Portland do a reenactment of the city of Atlanta following General Sherman is visit there. After all, if no one is going to stop them now, why should they believe anyone will try and stop them later?If and when that happens, the last people Schmidt needs to look to for blame is the Portland Police Department.",0,0,Bearing Arms
167,Trump administration is ignoring Supreme Court ruling on LGBTQ discrimination,-18.0,33.67,https://americanindependent.com/trump-administration-supreme-court-ruling-lgbtq-rights-transgender-discrimination-department-of-education-housing-urban-development/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"The administration has taken a piecemeal approach, experts say, continuing to target transgender Americans following the historic ruling. The administration has taken a piecemeal approach, experts say, continuing to target transgender Americans following the historic ruling. Experts on LGBTQ equality say the Trump administration is uninterested in fully enforcing a Supreme Court ruling on workplace discrimination from earlier this summer, and that slow-walking that decision could have larger implications for the broader LGBTQ community. According to those experts, Trump administration agencies have been slow to respond to the landmark ruling in, which states that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employment discrimination based on sex, also prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ people. Other agencies have altogether denied the ruling is relevance to other proposed regulations or decided to focus on certain parts of the decision and not others. The court ruled this summer that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”On Monday, however, the US Department of Education is Office for Civil Rights decided it would only heed part of that decision, publishing two letters signed by Kimberly Richey, the acting assistant secretary for the Office for Civil Rights, that addressed how the department would respond to complaints of LGBTQ discrimination in light of the ruling. In one letter, the office said it would investigate a complaint related to sexual orientation discrimination because ofBut in the second letter, Richey said that schools have a right to keep transgender students out of athletic teams that correspond with their gender and that schools that do not discriminate against transgender students are not complying with the law. The department argued that Title IX, the federal civil rights law that protects people from discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities, is too different from Title VII for the recent Supreme Court decision to be relevant in this case. Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN, a group focused on ending discrimination against and harassment of LGBTQ students, responded to the second letter this week, saying that the department is actions were part of a “cruel and discriminatory” agenda.“We urge the Department to cease these attacks and fully embrace the recent decision in Bostock that affirms what GLSEN has long known: Discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is prohibited under federal civil rights laws,” Byard said. Sharita Gruberg, senior director for the LGBTQ research and communications project at the Center for American Progress, explained in abri ef released last week that there are many reasons to think has much wider reach for LGBTQ people than simply employment discrimination. Gruberg wrote that Title IX is language is “closely modeled” on Title VII is language and that courts often look to case law on the latter for guidance on sex discrimination under Title IX In response to the Department of Education letters and the attempt to separate workplace and school discrimination, Gruberg said, “I ca not imagine working as a civil rights attorney and with a straight face claiming these are not related.”“A government that actually did care about the law and ensuring that it is correctly enforcing it would direct a whole government approach to the enforcement of sex discrimination prohibition that would be inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity,” she said. Gruberg added that the difference between the letters shows how the administration has focused on policies that harm transgender people specifically. Although the administration, and the education department specifically, has advanced regulations that hurt queer people is rights, its anti-transgender actions have been particularly bold, she said.hey have been more explicit and more public in their attacks on transgender people.”Gruberg said the letter speaks to the “anti-trans animus” throughout the administration, including its proposed and current regulations rolling back Obama-era protections for trans people in health care,housing, and one of its first anti-LGBTQ actions, which was to rescind guidance that provided protections for transgender students. The letters are just one example of how the administration has largely disregarded. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a rule, for instance, that encourages discrimination against transgender homeless people in single-sex shelters. In June, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Jennifer Wexton (D-VA)wroteto Secretary Ben Carson to raise concerns about the shelter regulation in light of the court is decision in June. Carson responded in July and claimed that the ruling “has no impact” on the proposed HUD rule. The Justice Department has also failed to respond to the court is decision in. According toThe 19th, the agency has not withdrawn guidance on anti-LGBTQ employment discrimination since the Supreme Court ruling. It had claimed previously in 2017 that Title VII does not protect LGBTQ workers from discrimination. The department alsofiledbriefswith the Supreme Court last year for the case, which argued against LGBTQ equality for workers. Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissuedits own guidance following the landmark decision this summer; that guidance avoids the words “transgender woman,” “transgender man,” or “nonbinary person.”The guidance, instead, in one example refers to a person that “was identified as male at birth, but uses feminine pronouns and identifies as a female.”Top White House officials are urging schools to double down on tutoring, extra learning time, and efforts to boost attendance as the spending deadline for pandemic aid nears. House Republicans are looking for a permanent fix, ‘not a Band-Aid,’ a leading lawmaker saysCruz is remarks fit into a larger trend of Republicans trashing schools and teachers.",1,1,American Independent

We had a fight a little earlier this same day during B lunch. You should bring this and post it on the news. This cop is a problem and the school will not do anything.”The video was posted on social media by several students, including on TikTok, and spread to Twitter and Facebook, before authorities provided information about the incident. In the video, another officer can be seen. That officer has not been identified and it is not clear if he is being investigated. Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopezheld a press conference on January 27 and said the department made the decision to turn over the criminal investigation to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement so that it is “completely independent” with “complete transparency.” The county attorney is office is also assisting. Lopez said there is “zero tolerance” for excessive force and police misconduct in the sheriff is office. He was elected as sheriff in November 2020 and sworn into office in early January 2021. Lopez said the “juvenile is fine,” despite her family saying she suffered injuries and is continuing to experience medical issues as a result of the traumatic experience. Lopez said the “deputy is also fine,” and that he “experienced some injuries when he hit the ground.” He also said there have been death threats made toward the deputy and his department will investigate those and “come after” anyone threatening Osceola County Sheriff is Office employees.“My understanding, it was a disruption of a school function. The student was not complying with lawful commands. She went after another student,” Lopez said. The deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave, the sheriff is office said. Fournier has worked for the Osceola County Sheriff is Office for 10 years, according to authorities. It was not immediately clear how long Fournier has been working as a school resource officer at Liberty High School. According to the Kissimmee high school is website, Fournier was also the girls’ flag football team coach. The school district has not commented about the incident or whether he has been removed from that role. In a statement to ABC News, district spokesperson Dana Schafer said, “It has been a difficult week for Liberty High students and staff. The entire staff and administration of Liberty High School remain committed to ensuring that we have a safe and positive learning environment for all students.” Schafer told ABC News the district is cooperating with the investigation. Fournier, who was paid $48,000 in 2017, was named as employee of the month by the Osceola County Sheriff is Office in August 2016,according to a Facebook post. The office did not say in the post why Fournier received the award. Osceola County SheriffDeputy Ethan Fournier. Osceola County SheriffDeputy Ethan Fournier. Sheriff Lopez said “the deputy does not have a history of misconduct, other than minor damage to property.” He did not explain what incidents led to misconduct charges for damaging property. According to online records, Fournier was cited in Osceola County in 2015 for careless driving. He was also cited again in 2017 for the same offense. According to online court records, the 2017 incident stemmed from a traffic crash while Fournier was on duty and driving a patrol SUV on Country Road 532 in Davenport. Fournier told the Florida Highway Patrol he was distracted by a loose radar mount in his vehicle and rear-ended a car that had stopped. He was fined $166 for careless driving. The 2015 careless driving incident was also the result of a crash while on-duty that caused $3,000 in damage and injured someone. He was also fined $166 for that incident. A Liberty High School student also told TMZabout an incident involving Fournier at the school. Junior Daijah Watts said she thought Fournier was a “chill dude,” but “Watts claims she saw Fournier use pepper spray on a group of kids who were fighting 2 years ago. She now thinks the whole department is suspicious.”The gossip site also wrote, “Trey’vion Telfair … who tells TMZ he used to think Officer Fournier was a good guy. He says Fournier participated in police brutality seminars for Liberty is Black Student Union back in September, and seemed genuine … saying he stood with them. Telfair now thinks it was all an act. At a press conference, Crump, who has represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and many other victims of police misconduct and brutality and other civil rights violations, called for Fournier to be fired, arrested and barred from ever working as a police officer again, especially at a school.“I would not allow that to happen to my child,” Crump told reporters at the press conference. “It is unacceptable.” Crump added, “I am just angry that a trained professional, adult man feels that he has the right to pick up and slam a young Black girl. They do not do this to other people is children. Why do they feel like it is OK to do it to our children?”Crumphas started a petition to call for Fournier to be held accountable. Crump wrote, “Taylor, a Black child with a bright future, was unarmed and posed NO threat to Deputy Fournier. Why did he think it was okay to ruthlessly throw her against the hard ground?”The attorney added:Black students already have a hard time feeling safe. We do NOT need to add school resource officers to their list of daily fears. We must treat our next generation with respect and dignity. They deserve to learn in a safe, non-hostile environment, NOT to get beaten and traumatized by adult bullies like this deputy!Unfortunately, this may be emblematic of a bigger problem. The Osceola Sheriff is Office has been subject to scrutiny in recent years for arresting students for first-time offenses connected to fights, typically on misdemeanor battery charges. A recent study by the Carruthers Institute said they have had the fourth-most youth arrests in lieu of juvenile civil citations for “common youth misbehavior.”There is no excuse for Deputy Ethan Fournier is overzealous behavior. He could have killed Taylor and we will not tolerate these actions in our schools. We must hold this SRO accountable!A petition has also been started by students at the high school, calling for Fournier to be fired. It has received more than 3,800 signatures.“The victim could have died in this situation and the deputy should not able able to walk away from this without any proper action taken to punish him. This deputy has a known history of not being able to handle situations with students in a proper manner, he is known for pepper spraying kids at school whenever a situation gets out of hand instead of properly detaining the m,” the students wrote. The Change.org petition adds, “Our school is principal has not addressed the situation after this incident , when other incidents with this officer happened and was recorded the school suspended anyone who recorded and tried to address the issue. This needs to end now and should not go on in our community any longer.”",2,2,Heavy

170,A look inside NYC is 2019 antisemitic hate crime reports,-5.67,46.67,https://forward.com/news/460612/a-look-inside-nycs-2019-antisemitic-hate-crime-reports/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-21,25,"Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonSome New York police officers, even those who respond to cases of antisemitic graffiti in Orthodox swaths of Brooklyn, do not seem to know how to spell “swastika” or “yarmulke.”Surveillance cameras, even those in the subway, cannot always be relied upon to capture vandals who paint or carve hateful messages. And police officers frequently either fail to inform victims about their rights to seek compensation from the state, as is required by law, or fill out the related forms inaccurately. These are some of the things we learned combing through more than 1,800 pages of New York Police Department records on crimes referred to the Hate Crime Task Force because officers suspected anti-Jewish motivation in 2019. What we did not learn was what percentage of such crimes led to arrests and prosecution that year; whether the perpetrators or victims fell into any distinguishable demographic patterns; or how much worse antisemitic activity was across Brooklyn than it had been in prior years. That is because the NY PD, which turned over the records via DVD only after the Forwardsueddemanding them under the state is public records law, did not include the more than 30 cases that are pending in criminal court. (The department did not tell the Forward how many records were withheld — this number is based on a comparison between the number of cases that were delivered versus the department is tally of antisemitic hate crimes from 2019). The records officer for the department said that the “disclosure of the records would interfere with ongoing judicial proceedings or criminal investigations.” Joseph Aron, the lawyer from Aron Law who is representing the Forward, said that the NY PD is assertion is “completely misplaced.”“Many of these documents have already been handed over to the alleged perpetrator/defendant in the underlying criminal proceeding,” he said in an email. “It is the refore perplexing to understand how their release to the Forward would necessarily interfere with those judicial proceedings.”While the department rejected our attempts to access the records administratively, we anticipate that the court will compel the NY PD to disclose the withheld records. A spokesperson, after initially indicating she would make officers available for an interview, ultimately declined. The department, in response to nearly 50 emailed questions about the patterns outlined in this report, provided only the following statement:“The NY PD will never tolerate hate in our city in any form. The NY PD has the largest Hate Crime Task Force in the country comprised of investigators that work tirelessly with our patrol officers, detective squads and community leaders to vigorously investigate every reported hate crime.”Without the criminal-court cases, it is impossible to do any meaningful macro-analysis of the trends. But the records we have do provide at least a foggy window into how the police handle antisemitic hate crimes. Here are some of the interesting things we found:Of the 208 cases that we got records about, the majority, nearly 80%, involved vandalism or graffiti, and most of those involved swastikas. That is consistent with the findings of the city is Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, which said that 76% of anti-Jewish complaints in 2019 were for swastika vandalism. But on February 17, 2019, on 11th Avenue in Manhattan, officers discovered a “swatzika” on the front of Bedrock Mini Storage. On May 10, a vandal drew a ten-inch “swasticka” on the inside of a bathroom door at a subway station in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn. In Astoria on June 13, an officer discovered “swatzstikas,” carved into trees in front of stately brick homes on 28th street. A little more than a week later, an officer wrote of three “swatstikas” carved into a wall, door and staircase in the apartment building Boro Park Village. On August 20, officers learned of a “swatsticka” drawn on a pillar at a subway station at 44th Drive and 21st Street in Queens. Yarmulke, the Yiddish term for the skullcap religious Jews wear, is an admittedly difficult word to spell. It might be derived from the Polish word “jarmułka,” which also means skullcap, and many prefer the simpler “kippah,” which means “dome” in Hebrew but refers to the same head covering. But some of New York is finest have taken phoneticization to a new low in these reports. It is, variously, rendered as “yamaka” and “yamica,” which at least sound basically right if said fast in a Brooklyn accent, but also the just plain wrong “yakama,” which is the name of a Native American tribe in Washington state.

Officers sometimes misspelled words like “yarmulke” and “swastika” in police reports. Illustration by Molly BoigonTo be fair, these mistakes were made by regular beat cops at precincts around the city. The reports filled out by members of the Hate Crimes Task Force did not contain such errors. Indeed, some of the butchered words were on reports about incidents in neighborhoods with few Jews where antisemitic hate crimes are rare, and perhaps those offending officers should be forgiven. But what about the officer in the 77th precinct, home to Educational Institute Oholei Torah, the flagship yeshiva for the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, who responded to the November 25, 2019 case of a “yakama” knocked-off the head of a 14-year-old white male whose name was redacted?Another officer twice described the “swatzika” painted on a street sign at Astor Place and 8th Street on Sept. 30 — a central stomping ground for New York University students,14% of whom are Jewish.

Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonIn a post-9/11 world, many Americans, and especially New Yorkers, assume we are under constant video surveillance. Some of the NY PD is hate-crime police reports indicate otherwise. Perpetrators responsible for antisemitic graffiti found on a movie poster on a subway platform at 4th Avenue & Union Street on August 20, for example, went unapprehended in part because there was not surveillance video trained on the spots where the graffiti was made. So, too, for whoever drew swastikas and wrote “Heil Hitler” on an MTA bus in Queens on June 17, spray-painted a black swastika on a park bench in the Marine Park Salt Marsh Nature Center last December 28 and wrote in black marker in an 103rd street subway stop, “Kill all Jews” with two swastikas on November 10. Then there are cases like the Sept. 29 one in which someone pulled a visibly Orthodox woman is wig off and threw a bottle and rocks at her near Tompkins Avenue and Ellery Street in Brooklyn, an incident caught on video. The closing report on the incident, though, says the “video collected is not identification quality,” and the case was closed without an arrest under the classification “investigative leads exhausted.”After a Sept. 29 case in which someone pulled a visibly Orthodox woman is wig off and threw a bottle and rocks at her near Tompkins Avenue and Ellery Street in Brooklyn, a closing report on the incident said that the “video collected is not identification quality,” and the case was closed without an arrest under the classification “investigative leads exhausted.”Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonWhen a photo mural in front of the Jewish Children is Museum in Crown Heights was vandalized on January 1, the department noted that the “video cameras at location are not working.” That case, too, was closed under “investigative leads exhausted,” with a report noting that there were “no cameras facing location of occurrence.”For the more than 200 incidents for which the department shared records, there were complaint reports that are supposed to include details about how cases were classified and whether victims were notified of their rights to apply for compensation. But the manner of classifying crimes was not consistent — some nearly identical swastika-graffiti crimes, for example, were classified as “making graffiti” while others were “criminal mischief” and still others were “aggravated harassment.” The department declined to answer questions about why officers would be classifying these crimes differently. The shorthand officers use was also inconsistent: some cases were marked “agg harassment” and others “harass agg.”Officers also noted in the vast majority of cases that victims were not told of their rights to victim is compensation, a notification that is required by law. The state will sometimes pay — up to $30,000 in some cases — to people who lost wages, have to pay for a burial, need transportation to court, have to pay for medical and counseling expenses, have to replace lost or stolen essential property like eyeglasses, or who need to move as a result of the crime. Applicants complete a form and are granted money if they meet certainrequirements, including physical injury or psychological trauma. The NY PD has cards with information about how victims can apply for these funds and other help from victim-assistance programs, said Janine Kava, a spokesperson for New York is criminal justice services office. And, she noted, the law also requires police reports to include a place where officers can acknowledge whether (or not) the information has been provided to a victim as required. But for 191 of the 222 victims listed in the reports, the officers wrote that they did not notify them of their rights. (Some cases had multiple victims.)In one case on August 29, a Hasidic man was struck by what appeared to be blocks of ice while driving in his work truck in Crown Heights. He suffered a small injury to his head and was treated by emergency-medical services, but according to the police report, he was not notified of the crime-victim compensation law. In one case on August 29, a Hasidic man was struck by what appeared to be blocks of ice while driving in his work truck in Crown Heights. He suffered a small injury to his head and was treated by emergency-medical services, but according to the police report, he was not notified of the crime-victim compensation law. Photo-illustration by Molly BoigonThe NY PD did not respond to requests for comment on this matter. Joseph Giacalone, a former NY PD detective and a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that officers may be notifying victims but not noting it on the forms.“It could be done verbally; they just forgot to check the box,” he said. But Brandan Davies, a criminal defense lawyer at Roth Davies, said the inconsistencies in the records suggest at least a lack of clarity — and perhaps a lack of care.“If an officer values the importance of their role in pursuing justice for a victim or preventing future crimes, it will be reflected in the level of attention and completeness with which the officer completes their reports,” he said in an email. “Similarly, if an officer personally feels there is little value or little chance of success in their pursuit of a particular crime, they are far more likely to produce substandard or inaccurate reports.”In several cases, the police reports show the importance of witnesses who see crimes in action and those who call in crimes already completed like swastika graffiti. This was an upshot in the hundreds of pages of reports about acts thought to be motivated by Jew-hatred last year. Some were individuals who took time out of their days to report antisemitic graffiti on the street to the police. Others were victims the mselves who swallowed their fear to make sure the police had their experiences on record. On November 2, 2019, a witness observed “several persons chase after a Hassidic male and possibly assault him” in Borough Park, according to a police report. “He was able to jot down a possible license plate.”While it is not clear if the victim himself ever came forward, with the help of this 46-year-old male witness, whose name was redacted, the police department closed the case after making an arrest in January of 2020. In another case, on March 3, 2019, a 28-year-old woman left her home in Greenpoint and noticed black swastikas in front of 113 Newell Street. She notified the police, and a month later, officers from the 94th precinct caught Glenn Merto, a white-supremacist responsible for multiple instances of antisemitic graffiti, in the act of “placing a slap sticker containing a swastika on a NYC call box.” Merto pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment and was sentenced on November 12, 2020, to three years of probation, according to court recordsA 28-year-old woman left her home in Greenpoint and noticed black swastikas in front of 113 Newell Street.

171,Politicos explain Montana is red wave,0.0,46.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/11/11/politicos-explain-montanas-red-wave/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,15,"3 results to continue the state is long tradition of split-ticket politics. Instead, Republicans won every seat on the statewide ballot, from president to state auditor, and expanded their majority in the state Legislature for good measure.“I was completely shocked,” said Representative Barbara Bessette, one of several Democratic lawmakers unseated last week in Cascade County, referring to the lopsided Republican wins there. The decisive victories across many counties surprised more than just Democrats.“I was as surprised at the margins as everyone else,” said Jeff Essmann, a former state lawmaker and GOP party chairman from Billings. Essmann noted that when he started in the state Legislature in 2005, Cascade County was dominated by Democrats. In the 2004 election, Cascade County voters chose seven Democrats and two Republicans to represent them in the Montana House. This year, every state representative elected in the county is Republican. Great Falls is not the only place in the state where Republicans made significant gains this year. Preliminary vote counts show Republican Governor-elect Greg Gianforte having beaten Democrat Mike Cooney by nearly 13 percentage points across the state — roughly the same margin by which Matt Rosendale took the US House seat in his race against Kathleen Williams. Incumbent US Senator Steve Daines won his race against Governor Steve Bullock by a slightly smaller but still substantial 10%. In the down-ballot races for attorney general, secretary of state, state auditor and superintendent of public instruction, Republicans beat Democratic candidates by margins ranging from eight to 20 percentage points. Only one Democrat, superintendent of public instruction candidate Melissa Romano, managed to keep the gap between her and her GOP opponent, incumbent superintendent Elsie Arntzen, to single digits. Montana voters have historically been ticket splitters — reliably supporting Republican presidential candidates over the past two decades, but often choosing Democrats for other offices. In 2004, for example, the state backed Republican President George W Bush by more than 20 percentage points even as it elected Democrat Brian Schweitzer governor. Voters that year also sent Republican Representative Denny Rehberg back to Washington, DC by 30 points while picking Democrats to serve as superintendent of public Instruction and state auditor by 10-point margins. But recent presidential elections, with Donald Trump atop the ticket, have seen Montana turn more red. In 2016, Governor Bullock was the only Democrat to win a statewide race. This year, Republicans not only won every statewide race on the ballot, they did so by hefty margins. Longtime political watchers say the Republican dominance in 2020 can be attributed to a combination of factors.“It is not what the Republicans did right. It is what the Democrats did bad,” said one Republican official who requested anonymity to comment candidly. “It was kind of the perfect storm that just kicked the shit out of them.”In interviews with Montana Free Press, nearly a dozen elected officials, campaign strategists, and political analysts described what they believe are the reasons behind the results, citing the popularity of President Trump and national attacks against the Democratic Party and the COVID-19 pandemic is economic fallout and the ways in which the virus complicated campaign strategy. Throughout the general campaign, Montana Democrats faced a slew of negative messaging that aligned them with divisive national figures and issues. One attack ad against Bullockfeatured a narrator saying the candidate was supported by “the liberal mob” and included images of people jumping on a police vehicle — a reference to protests against racial injustice that swept the country this summer. In her race for the US House, Williams was depicted as supporting policies that were too “extreme” for Montanaand more ideologically aligned with California, where she was born. The coronavirus pandemic made it harder for candidates to defend the mselves against those attacks by limiting their ability to campaign in-person, Democrats said.“Ultimately, it was less face-to-face time,” said state House Minority Leader Casey Schreiner, who has represented a Great Falls district since 2013 and was on the ballot this year as Democrat Mike Cooney is running mate in the race for governor. Democratic campaigns still held in-person events, such as drive-in rallies, but decided against aggressive door-knocking and community engagement because they were worried about spreading the virus. Republicans, for their part,were less cautious about the virus, holding larger gatherings and rallies that allowed for more direct contact between candidates and voters. When Democratic candidates have won Montana in the past, Schreiner said, it is been by diligent shoe leather campaigning — talking to enough of their neighbors that they get a critical mass of voters to see past national partisanship and cast ballots for candidates as individuals.“For some reason, voting for the individual did not seem to happen this time,” Schreiner said. Voter turnout was also a factor in this year is election, though not in the way that many observers expected. While Montana Democrats have historically presumed that higher voter turnout would work in their party is favor, this year is record turnout — 100,000 voters more than the number who cast ballots in 2016 — appears to have benefited Republicans. In his unsuccessful bid for the US Senate, for example, Bullock received more than 272,000 votes, 16,000 more than he received when he won re-election as governor in 2016. But Bullock is opponent, Daines, received more than 333,000 votes this year — nearly 78,000 more than he’d won when he was first elected to the Senate in 2014. Increased voter participation was partly due to the fact that 46 of 56 Montana counties chose to conduct all-mail elections in light of the pandemic, mailing ballots to active registered voters regardless of whether they had previously signed up to vote by mail. Some prominent Democrats who were involved with statewide campaigns said the increase in new voters likely included Montanans who were not previously engaged with politics.“Low-information, low-propensity voters. People who do not vote all the time and people who are not on Twitter and not reading the newspaper and not seeking new information,” said one Democratic politician who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the election. Many of those voters, the Democrat said, voted a ticket informed primarily by their preference for a presidential candidate who campaigned aggressively against the Democratic Party.“Trump truly has a unique way of nationalizing everything. Now there are newly engaged voters with a ballot on their doorstep. They are going to know about Trump and not much else,” he said. This wave of new voters especially affected down-ballot candidates without substantial name recognition. Democrats hoping to ride the coattails of Bullock and Biden were not able to compete with Republicans enjoying the boosted turnout driven by Trump, Daines, and Congressman Gianforte.“I think that what we learned this election cycle is that Montana is a very conservative state and when new people vote in this political process, they vote in a very conservative way,” the Democrat said. Other politicians and strategists say the high mail-ballot turnout alone does not account for the dramatic margins. Jake Eaton, a GOP strategist who worked on the Gianforte campaign, said he believes Republicans won by such large margins in part because their message was compelling to independent voters and the party was effective at getting its base to turn out and vote. Internal polling data, Eaton said, indicated Montana voters were worried less about the health care issues Democrats focused on than about their livelihoods, particularly given the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic. Other Republicans and some Democrats concurred, citing a perception that the Democratic Party has become increasingly disconnected from low- and middle-income people and communities.“[Democrats] kind of lost touch with who their voters have been over the years. They do not really represent the working class voter anymore,” said Senator Steve Fitzpatrick of Great Falls. “It is kind of become the party of the narrow elite, highly educated people from university towns.”“To a certain degree, their base has just washed away,” he continued. “If that is your party — rich liberals — you are not going to win in the state of Montana.”Asked about Fitzpatrick is analysis, the Democrat quoted earlier said, “I agree with all that. Of course you need a jobs message. Of course you need a working people is message . . . it is the economy, stupid.”Despite their failure to appeal to a winning coalition of voters statewide, Democrats did maintain strong support in university towns this year, as well as a majority of the vote in Butte and several counties with large Native American populations. Bullock, for example, won 64% of the vote in Missoula County and 55% of the vote in Gallatin County, around Bozeman. He also won 65% of the vote in Butte-Silver Bow County, down from 70% in 2016, as well as 70% of the 2020 vote in Glacier County, which includes most of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. With the 2020 election season in the rear view mirror, the Republican Party is turning its attention to the jobs Montana voters have handed its candidates:governing the state. Democrats, for their part, are facing a journey into the political wilderness, looking to recalibrate the party so it can compete in the next election cycle and further Montana is legacy of purple politics. Some Democrats are hoping to change how the party organizes around the state, making the case that short-term campaign cycles do not translate to sustained support or grassroots relationships.“I think it is about empowering people to be connected to their community,” said Representative Bessette. “And you ca not do that coming in six months before Election Day or before people get their ballot.”Bessette, who has spent years working on public health issues and substance abuse prevention, said she wants Montana Democrats to start thinking about political organizing in a similar way.“We use local organizing and coalition building,” she said about countering drug and alcohol abuse. “You are going to the local level because they are the ones who know what they need … We do not think about long-term solutions and sustain ability [in politics]. It is short-term.

Three trays of mail we refound in a ditch in Greenville last week, and the Outagamie County Sheriff is Office said at the time it included several absentee ballots. Meagan Wolfe, director of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said during a virtual news conference Thursday that no Wisconsin absentee ballots were found. She said she did not know if there were ballots from other states.""There was mail found outside of Appleton and that mail did not include any Wisconsin ballots,"" Wolfe said. When news broke about mail in a ditch, the White Houseseized on the situation to rail against mail voting as ""a system that is subject to fraud.""""In fact, in the last 24 hours, police in Greenville, Wisconsin, found mail in a ditch, and it included absentee ballots,"" said Kayleigh McEnany, President Donald Trump is press secretary. In Tuesday is debate with Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trumpcontended ballots had been found in creeks, in what may have been a reference to Wisconsin. The Republican president has repeatedly raised doubts about mail voting, but election experts have said the mail provides a safe and reliable way to cast ballots. The US Postal Service has said it is investigating what happened in Greenville. The Postal Service has been under fire in recent weeks for mail slowdowns ahead of the November 3 presidential race. Absentee voting in Wisconsin is expected to hit a record this fall because of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 1.2 million Wisconsin voters have requested absentee ballots so far. Wolfe said Wisconsin election officials have ways to track down ballots when they go missing but emphasized the importance of returning absentee ballots as soon as possible. It is easier to fix problems that might arise when clerks have more time to respond to the m, she said. Also Thursday, Wolfe said Wisconsin is ban on ""electioneering"" at polling sites applies to campaigning for candidates and issues. It does not apply to general pushes to encourage people to vote, she said. The issue has surfaced because the state Republican Party has warned Milwaukee officials that it believes athletes, the Bucks mascot Bango and the Brewers' Racing Sausagescannot be present at Fiserv Forum and Miller Parkwhen they are used as voting sites. The presence of athletes and mascots would amount to a form of electioneering because it would encourage people to come out to vote, argued the party is chairman, Andrew Hitt.

The organization traces the name “Guardians” back to an old Air Force Space Command motto from 1983, “Guardians of the High Frontier,” according to a short post on the US Space Force website. While a distinct entity, Space Force is part of the Air Force per its establishment with the National Defense Authorization Act. As it exists to day, Space Force is mostly a rebrand of Air Force Space Command, but with the authority to make decisions independent from the Air Force. Space Force personnel also mostly come from the Air Force, but the re is been notable transfers —like astronaut Mike Hopkins— who have joined from other government organizations. Unlike Hopkins’ former employer NASA, Space Force is less concerned with exploring space, than it is controlling it and protecting American assets like satellites. Choosing “Guardians” as an official name comes with some unavoidable (and maybe intended) pop culture associations. There is Disney isfranchise, which introduced Marvel film fans to the “cosmic” side of the Marvel universe. And from the world of video games, Guardians also show up again inDestiny 2as undead warriors charged with defending the Last City on Earth from alien enemies. This would not be the first time that Space Force appeared to be cribbing from pop culture, either. When the organization revealed the official logo, many pointed out its similarities to the Starfleet emblem used in the television show. The US Space Force later attempted to clarify that it was inspired by older Air Force Space Command logos rather than the hit series. Whatever the source of the name, you can count on Space Force being a lot more mundane than any of the pop culture we associate with it. It may be a bit of a branding exercise to satisfy the President, but the Biden administration appears to have no plans to change course. With Space Force and recent work to return to the moon, the US is focusing even more on space heading into the next decade.",2,2,The Verge

This ""throwaway"" culture often means consumers are guilty of getting rid of old devices as soon as new ones come to the market, a habit that can have a significant effect on waste streams and the environment. A recent report found that 53.6 million metric to ns of e-waste was produced in 2019, with just 17.4% of this amount ""officially documented as properly collected and recycled.""The Global E-waste Statistics Partnership published the ""Global E-waste Monitor 2020"" report in July and described e-waste as containing harmful substances including mercury, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, chloro fluorocarbons and brominated flame retardants. It also painted a stark picture of the dangers posed by e-waste, stating: ""The increasing levels of e-waste, low collection rates, and non-environmentally sound disposal and treatment of this waste stream pose significant risks to the environment and to human health.""With concerns about e-waste growing, some companies are now turning to chemistry to develop solutions to recycle items like old cell phones, extracting value at the same time. One such example is the work being carried out by Mint Innovation, a clean tech firm based in Auckland, New Zealand.""We have developed a biological process for recovering valuable metals from weird and wonderful feedstocks, such as electronic waste,"" Ollie Crush, the company is chief scientific officer, told CNBC is ""Sustainable Energy.""Crush explained that Mint Innovation is system involved taking scrap material and ""grinding it up into a sand like consistency.""""The reason we do this is that we need to make sure that we are exposing all the metal contained within to a subsequent chemical leaching process,"" he added.""For instance, when you look at circuit boards, they have got lots of chips on them – a lot of the value is contained within those chips, so we really need to make sure it is exposed.""When it comes to recovering a valuable material like gold, the technique used by Mint Innovation – which it is described as a ""biorefining process"" – involves a number of steps.

Barely two months into the Biden presidency and we are suddenly seeing a concentrated campaign to convince the nation that there is some sort of major crisis unfolding at the border as thousands of undocumented migrants, many of them children, arrive in search of asylum and opportunity. The “crisis” narrative is quickly being picked up even by usually somewhat objective media outlets.“There is a new surge of kids at the border, but the Biden administration will not call it a crisis!” warns Zachary B Wolf at CNN.com, while Reuters announced, “Number of migrant children in US border facilities soars amid growing crisis.” Congressional Republicans were delighted and continued pounding the message, spending the past week holding press conferences and border-wall photos hoots warning about the “Biden Border Crisis.”What is happening at the border is more than a crisis.

What i tis is a problem of logistics and red tape that can and must be aggressively dealt with by the government, but it is not a “crisis.”The insistence on calling it a crisis is a reflection of the right-wing is need to rile up xenophobes and smear all undocumented migration as an implicit threat to economic stability and white livelihoods, ironically representing the white supremacist values our nation was founded on. It is painfully clear that the status quo among the Very Serious News Media is that they consider undocumented migration as inherently a negative thing and that deportations, asylum rejection, and disincentivizing migration are somehow a “moderate position.”Even worse, the media is playing into the false Republican narrative that Joe Biden is reversal of the sadistically cruel policies of the Trump administration is being interpreted as a green light for anyone and everyone to come to the USs, because this time they know that they will not have their children to rn away from them or be dumped across the border in a Mexican shantytown. Every so-called “patriot” or Beltway bozo who criticizes the Biden administration for treating immigrants with a modicum of basic human decency should take a long look in the mirror and reflect on what it actually means to be an American and what they want this country to stand for. There is nothing moderate or good about turning our back on people seeking safety and economic opportunity, especially since the instability and violence in their home countries can inevitably be traced back to American imperialism in the first place. Yes, there are too many people at the border for our inherently racist and cruel immigration system to take care of at the moment. Much of the blame for that rests with Donald Trump, whose administration deliberately fought to create the perception of a “crisis” and thus justify the vicious “solutions” that skull-faced freaks like Stephen Miller concocted to punish migrants for seeking safety and opportunity in the USs. This does not make it “Biden is fault,” nor does it change the fact that the Biden administration will not be able to flip a switch overnight —especially since the outgoing Trump officials did everything they could to sabotage the incoming administration. It is true that the Biden team needs to act decisively and quickly to unstick the gears on processing immigrants and finding them good lodging, and all indications show that the Biden team is working to do so. But too many “people want to emigrate to America” should never be considered a and playing into this rhetoric accomplishes nothing but promote white nationalist narratives and distortions.",0,0,Occupy Democrats
177,Texas Supreme Court delivers a massive setback to the GOP in curbside voting decision,-24.33,28.33,https://occupydemocrats.com/2020/11/01/texas-supreme-court-delivers-a-massive-setback-to-the-gop-in-curbside-voting-decision/,https://adfontesmedia.com/occupy-democrats-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-01,25,"The Republican party is antipathy to the full exercise of every American citizen is right to participate in our democracy has long been documented with suppression efforts ramping up since the Supreme Court invalidated the Voting Rights Act back in 2013. Since that fateful decision,voter suppression efforts have taken many forms, from the purging of voter rolls — a significant factor in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election — to the elimination of polling places in historically Democratic districts to attempts to intimidate voters with threats of violence that have already been taking place in this current election to e vena slow down of the US Postal Servicedelivery to prevent ballots from arriving on time to be filled out or counted. No attempt to disenfranchise voters who have already cast their ballots legally has been more blatant than the actions of the Texas Republicans who took their case trying to invalidate nearly 127,000 ballots — cast at drive-thru polling sites set up in order to make voting safe during the COVID-19 pandemic in the relatively blue bastion of Harris County which includes the city of Houston — to the Texas Supreme Court. The GOP activists tried to argue that the drive-thru program was an expansion of curbside voting, and under state election law should only be available for voters with disabilities, despite the fact that drive-thru ballots account for about 10% of all in-person ballots cast during early voting in Harris County. The rejection of these ballots could determine the outcome of an election in Texas that has turned much more competitive than any Republican could have imagined before Donald Trump is disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemic sent normally reliable GOP voters scrambling for an alternative and motivated Democratic-leaning voters to rejoin a political process they may have skipped in the last presidential election. Any hopes that these anti-democracy forces in the GOP had having the Texas Supreme Court assist them in stealing the rights to have the drive-thru voters’ voices heard in this election were dashed today when the court denied their petition to have the ballots disallowed in a decision issued without a written opinion. Local election officials in Harris County rejoiced at the news.“We know that the law is on our side,” Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins told CNN after the Supreme Court issued its ruling. “We know that we should be protecting these votes, making sure that all of our residents here can have their voice heard, can have their say in our democracy.”The citizens who have already submitted their ballots assuming that they were making valid votes are still not assured that their votes will be counted, however. The Republican plaintiffs are still pursuing a similar lawsuit in federal court, hoping to get the votes thrown out by arguing that drive-thru voting violates the US constitution. It will be interesting to see how the originalists on the Supreme Court, including the recently installed Amy Coney Barrett, tackle this issue that was likely never contemplated in the horse and buggy days of our nation is founding fathers. Suffice it to say that any attempt to invalidate the ballots of legitimate voters — no matter how they cast their votes — simply demonstrates the fact that, despite their attempts at portraying the mselves as the party of the educationally-challenged blue-collar class, the GOP is a party of elitists who are afraid to face true democracy and can only retain power for their oligarchical masters by cheating in any manner that they can and invalidating legitimate votes.

His response to the initial reports was too dismissive, and last night he was not able to fully articulate how he would stop it from happening again, other than saying that his campaign is committing lots of resources and he will have the “strongest protocols” and utilize an “independent commission” that people can bring their complaints to, without really elaborating on who or what that commission would do.

This is a lightly edited transcript. Janine Jackson:You probably are not surprised to learn thatZoommade a lot of money this past year, though the fact that their profits rose more than 4,000% is remarkable. It seems like textbook capitalism: The company sold a better mousetrap, or at least a more popular one. What, though, do we do with the fact that on its $660 million take,Zoompaidzero in federal taxes? What textbook is that from?They are not alone, of course; at least 55 of the country is largest corporations paid no federal income taxes, according to new research. They have figured out a game, but it is us that are getting played—not just as individuals, who have to pay our own taxes, but as a country that is constantly claiming that we ca not afford various social goods, while handing billions of dollars back to companies whose profits are, after all, ultimately built on individuals and on social goods. Joining us now totalk about that problem is Amy Hanauer. She is executive director at theInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy, as well asCitizens for Tax Justice. She joins us by phone from Washington, DC Welcome toCounterSpin,Amy Hanauer. Amy Hanauer:Thank you so much, Janine. It is great to be here. JJ: “Them that is got shall get” is an old story, but it is still wrong, and galling. These companies are making money hand over fist. So what is going on? What are they doing to get out of paying federal taxes?Amy Hanauer: “we have a corporate tax code that is just riddled with loopholes that enable companies like this to get away with avoiding taxes.”AH:Yeah; thank you so much for that question. You are right. My organization, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,foundthat 55 of the largest Fortune 500 and S&P 500 corporations paid zero in taxes despite being profitable in 2020. And, together, those 55 companies had $40.5 billion in income. If you looked at our statutory tax rate of 21%, you would think that they would have paid $8.5 billion, but instead they actually got $3.5 billion in rebates. And your question is, how? Well, we have a corporate tax code that is just riddled with loopholes that enable companies like this to get away with avoiding taxes, in ways that really leave regular people responsible for a larger share of our tax payments, and leave us unable to pay for the things that our communities need. JJ:Well, that is the question. It sounds like unfairness; it is unfairness. But is itillegal?AH:That is a great question. And should you blame their accountants and their lawyers, or should you blame Congress? And I think the responsibility lies clearly with the lawmakers who have created a tax code that enables this kind of avoidance. So we have a handful of tax loopholes that companies can use. One is, we have an unequal tax rate between profits earned overseas and profits earned here domestically. If that were made the same, a lot of this tax avoidance could be stopped in its tracks. We have ways of compensating executives with stock options that enable companies to tell their stockholders that they are highly profitable and earning one thing, but the n allow them to tell the IRS that they are far less profitable and earning less, and reduce what they pay in taxes as a result. So there are just a whole bunch of these kinds of loopholes. And I think it rests clearly with Congress and the president to close these loopholes and get a more rational tax system in place. JJ:I wanted to just say, ITEP is findings on corporate tax avoidance are based on available data, because the secrecy is rather the point, and that is part of the problem also, right?AH:That is right. And, of course, you at FAIR have looked at this kind of issue for a long time. But we could have more transparency. We could require, particularly for those overseas earnings, we could do a lot more to say that these corporations have to divulge more to the American public. And I think a related issue is that we could just do a lot more to empower the Internal Revenue Service to be able to enforce the tax code, because they are underfunded, and every dollar that the IRS gets results in much more than a dollar in returns to the American people. So we could be more transparent, and we could do a better job of enforcing even the laws that we have, as well as fixing these laws. JJ:Let me ask you a question about history. I know that ITEP has been measuring this for decades. So it did not start with Trump, right? And also, there have been efforts to fix it, these loopholes, and how has that fared? Can you tell us a little bit about the history on this?AH:The fact is that this has been a problem for a long time, under administrations of both parties, and it also got a lot worse with the Trump tax regime. So of the 55 corporations that paid nothing, there are another 26—a 26-corporation subset of those—that have actually paid no taxes if you take all three years of the Trump tax regime combined. And the reason is that the Trump tax law lowered the tax rate, it failed to close loopholes, and it actually made the problem of overseas tax avoidance worse in a way that they said they were going to make it better. So it has been a problem under both parties, but it certainly got worse with the Trump tax law. And I think that is where we see some potential promise for reform going forward. JJ:Let is talk about that. Are there things concretely that could be done now? And we understand that sometimes, you know, one measure, and the n another measure, and the n another—it does not have to necessarily be a sweeping thing. But are there things that could be done right now?AH:Absolutely. As I mentioned, we think we ought to equalize the tax rate between profits earned offshore and profits earned domestically. There is no reason why a corporation should be able to move jobs overseas, or move equipment overseas, and the n pay a lower tax rate. There is another challenge withdepreciation, where corporations are able to write off a lot of the costs of their equipment, and they are able to write it off very quickly—and that is another thing that the Trump tax law made worse. We think we ought to be able to depreciate equipment at the rate that it actually wears out, and that that is a much more rational way of doing things. And the n, as I mentioned, we could end the tax break for stock options that enables corporations to say they earn one thing to their shareholders and say something different to the American government. So there are all of these fixes out there. And I think, actually, the Biden administration is taking quite a few of these on, in ways that are pretty encouraging, and that would be kind of a generational shift, Janine, that would be different from anything that I think we have seen in a long time of looking at these issues. JJ:Is there anything you would call on reporters to maybe dig into more deeply, or to jettison as frameworks? Or is there anything you would like to shift in terms of media is way of addressing this set of issues?AH:Yeah, absolutely. TheBiden plan raises the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%; that will make a difference. And I know the re is negotiations with some members of Congress, and of the Senate, that may change that. He also raises the offshore tax rate. He does not equalize it, which is what my researchers recommend; but he does raise it about halfway back up. So the offshore tax rate will be 21% and the overall tax rate will be 28%. And the other really great thing that I think the Biden plan does is it just simply imposes a minimum tax, so that if your accountants and attorneys are able to identify a bunch of loopholes, you still, as a corporation, would pay amini mum tax of 15%on your book profits. So we think that would make a big, big difference. And we definitely think it is a ripe area for reporters to explore, because one of the challenges with our tax code is that most people do not understand it very well, including many members of Congress. So it is exciting that the Biden administration wants to take this on. I think that they really get that just looking around, looking at the problems that we have had in the USs over the past year, and the n recognizing that some of our very most profitable corporations are not contributing to our basic needs—that just does not add up, does not seem right. JJ:We have been speaking with Amy Hanauer from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and Citizens for Tax Justice. You can find them online atITEP.organdCTJ.org. Amy Hanauer, thank you so much for joining us today onCounterSpin. AH:Janine, it was great totalk to you.",1,1,FAIR
180,"“City Hall Put the Kibosh on That”: The Inside Story of How de Blasio Promised, Then Thwarted NYPD Accountability",0.0,54.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/city-hall-put-the-kibosh-on-that-de-blasio-nypd-accountability,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they are published. Years ago, before he was mayor, Bill de Blasio laid out the essence of any effort to reform the country is largest police department. New York City needed true civilian oversight. Describing the city agency tasked with investigating police misconduct as “more of a lapdog than a watchdog,” he propose din 2009 to give it more independence, authority, and guaranteed funding. A few months later, he again pledged change,sayingin a statement, “the NYPD cannot oversee itself.”Then, in 2013, he was elected mayor. And rather than create more independence for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he ended up asserting ever-more control over the agency, intent on avoiding conflict with the Police Department, according to internal communications obtained by ProPublica and interviews with more than two dozen current and former officials. The mayor is office edited reports and testimony to soften criticism of the NYPD and roll back proposals for more effective oversight. It maneuvered to block some of the same policies de Blasio had advocated for years before. And when the civilian officials were faced with obstruction by the NYPD, the mayor is office ignored their pleas for support. When the CCRB in a draft report two years ago noted that police were withholding footage from body-worn cameras, an aide to the mayor ordered the CCRB to take out the direct reference to the department: “Let is simplify and remove the acronym ‘NYPD.’”New Yorkers and others have seen de Blasio isdeferenceto the police play out on the public stage, perhaps most infamously when he defended NYPD is response to last summer is racial justice protests. But the internal accounts show how City Hall worked behind the scenes to protect the NYPD from scrutiny. De Blasio will leave office at the end of the year, and his administration has defended his efforts to improve police oversight, telling ProPublica that while the CCRB “was left to languish under previous administrations, it is clear this mayor took a different approach.” But his record is a warning to the field of candidates vying to succeed him. They too are facing both calls for racial justice and concerns about crime, which has risen in New York over the past year as it has in other cities. Rather than seeking to slash the size of the police force, many candidates have echoed the promise de Blasio once made to institute genuine civilian oversight of a department that has long chafed at it. Some of the leading candidates in this month is mayoral primary have seen that resistance up close, including Eric Adams, a former NYPD commander who often criticized the department; Scott Stringer, the city comptroller; and Maya Wiley, the onetime head of the CCRB under de Blasio. Wiley, who was the mayor is chief legal adviser before joining the CCRB in July 2016, has made police reform a central part of her campaign platform. But after de Blasio chose her to chair the agency, the CCRB shifted toward tighter mayoral control. During Wiley is tenure, the office removed recommendations from adraftreportthat faulted the NYPD is use of Tasers after City Hall objected to the findings. After The New York Times revealed the changes, Wileydefendedthem. City Hall is grip continued after Wiley left in the summer of 2017. When her successor was scheduled to ask a city commission for more oversight power in late 2018, the mayor is office intervened and canceled the testimony. As one agency official informed a colleague in a text: “City Hall put the kibosh on it.”“Every testimony, every report, every hearing was completely controlled by what City Hall wanted or did not want,” said Nicole Napolitano, who was a senior policy analyst for the agency. The goal was to give a “veneer of accountability.”Napolitano and three others at the agency who pushed for more aggressive oversight were let go last November in what the mayor is office described as a reorganization and a “step forward.” (In alawsuit, Napolitano and the others argue they were fired in retaliation for raising concerns about the agency is independence, which they say was a violation of their free speech; the city is seeking to dismiss the case, arguing the concerns were not protected speech.)Astatementprovided by City Hall spokesperson Avery Cohen noted that a recent administration proposal would consolidate police oversight agencies under the CCRB, and said edits of reports and testimony were just part of the governing process.“On matters of police accountability, as with any issue that requires the cooperation of multiple agencies, City Hall is always in dialogue with both the NYPD and CCRB,” the statement said. “All our work with CCRB has been done to achieve our shared goal of greater police oversight and accountability.”In a statement to ProPublica, current CCRB chair Rev. Frederick Davie said that the agency has repeatedly advocated for strengthening oversight. “We will continue to work together — and disagree with — the NYPD and the Mayor is Office,” Daviesaid. Wiley, through her campaign, declined to be interviewed; a spokesperson pointed to the candidate is recent defense of her tenure at the CCRB For decades, the NYPD has been the most powerful fiefdom in city government. With a $5.4 billion budget and a direct line to the mayor, the NYPD operates with far more independence than other city departments. External oversight has expanded in recent years, with the creation of an inspector general and the appointment of a court-mandated monitor. And prosecutors, working with the FBI and NYPD is Internal Affairs Bureau, are responsible for investigating potential criminal conduct by officers. But it is the CCRB that thousands of people turn to every year to lodge complaints against officers for everything from offensive language to police brutality. Under the city charter, it is an “independent” office charged with conducting “complete, thorough and impartial” investigations of police misconduct. That mandate, though, belies the agency is limited powers. It is governed by a board that is effectively controlled by the mayor through his appointees and those of his police commissioner. And when the CCRB does substantiate a complaint, it can only recommend discipline to the NYPD. (In a statement to ProPublica, the NYPD said it is committed to oversight: “We fully support the CCRB.”)Through de Blasio is nearly eight years in office, even as public concern about police misconduct mounted, the CCRB has remained on the margins of efforts to investigate and reform policing in New York. While others in city and state government have issuedstingingfindingsabout the NYPD is conduct during last summer is protests, the agency tasked with investigating complaints about officers’ misconduct has largely stayed silent. Mina Malik served for two years as the agency is executive director, resigning five months into Wiley is tenure as board chair. She said that during her time the re, “it became clear that City Hall has significant influence over the CCRB and its operations.” That is not how she thinks it should work. “It is vital for any police oversight agency to be independent and free from political influence or police control.”For many of those who were drawn to a mayor whose campaign had taken off with an ad where his biracial son speaks about racial injustice, de Blasio is increasingly vocal defense of the NYPD has been mystifying. But long before he was elected mayor, de Blasio had seen up close the political risks of being the boss of the Police Department. De Blasio first worked in City Hall about 30 years ago, under Mayor David Dinkins, who inherited soaring crime rates and deep distrust of the NYPD, especially among Black people. After Dinkins moved the CCRB out from under the management of the NYPD, thousands of off-duty officers stormed Lower Manhattan,taking over the Brooklyn Bridge and deriding Dinkins, the city is first Black mayor, as a “washroom attendant.”“It was a formative experience” for de Blasio, recalled one former top aide who worked with the mayor over two terms, and who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing their continued connections to him. “I heard him talk about it many times.”Dinkins ended up brushing aside the police riot and implemented his plan to create stronger civilian oversight. But he also ended up a one-term mayor. The lesson de Blasio took from the experience was that a mayor should “keep conflict with cops to a minimum,” the former aide said. “The orientation toward CCRB was, ‘Do not have them cause problems for the Police Department.’”After he was elected, de Blasio did deliver on a promise to drop the city is appeal of a federal court ruling against the NYPD over how it used“stop-and-frisk” tacticsinBlack and Latino communities. But De Blasio also sought to send a signal to those who worried his agenda would threaten the city is progress in reducing crime. The mayor enlisted the country ismost well-knowncop, William Bratton, to return to New York to lead the department, which he had done two decades earlier under Mayor Rudolph Gulliani. While Bratton gave the new mayor a measure of credibility on policing, it came with a price, according to several of those who worked with both of them. Bratton ran the department “completely independently,” said Richard Emery, who was de Blasio is first chair of the CCRB.(Bratton, who retired from the NYPD in 2016, declined to be interviewed or to respond to questions from ProPublica. In a recently published memoir, he writes that de Blasio was supportive of the police and backed his efforts as commissioner.)It was through Bratton that de Blasio picked Emery. He was a high-profile lawyer who routinely sued the city on behalf of people alleging civil rights violations by the NYPD He was also friendly with Bratton. When de Blasio held a press conference on July 17, 2014, announcing Emery as head of the board, the mayor underscored the need for change, just as he had a few years before. “This is a chance to get it right,” he said. “This is the first time we are actually going to get to see a CCRB function properly. And I think it is going to be a breath of fresh air. ”That same day, NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo tried to arrest Eric Garner in Staten Island and ended up putting him in a chokehold. Garner is friend Ramsey Orta filmed the encounter, leading the world to hear Garner cry, “I ca not breathe”11 times before he died. While the district attorney is office in Staten Island began to consider criminal charges against Pantaleo, the CCRB also began digging in, and it seemed like the agency might have a moment. “The CCRB had never done anything even remotely as important or high-profile” as the Garner case, Emery recalled. “It would bolster the integrity and reputation of the agency if it were done right.”The agency initially made progress. The NYPD allowed CCRB investigators complete access to internal records in the case, which they’d rarely had in other cases. But after a grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, de Blasio found himself once again in no-man is land, trying to address residents’ pain and anger without losing his grip on the Police Department. In an emotional address at a press conference about the grand jury is decision, de Blasio talked about how he and wife had had to “literally train” their teenage son Dante to “take special care” with officers. The police unions excoriated the mayor is comments, which came amid protests following the killing of not only Garner but also Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. De Blasio had thrown officers “under the bus,” said Patrick Lynch, the head of the city is largest police union. Less than two weeks after the mayor is remarks, a 28-year-old man, who had traveled to Brooklyn from Maryland and posted on social media about police killings, walked up to an NYPD car, and shot and killed the two officers inside, and the n killed himself minutes later.“There is blood on many hands tonight,”saidLynch.“That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor.”When the mayor later spoke at a memorial service for the two officers, hundreds of officers turned their backs on him. When de Blasio went to pay his respects at a funeral home, officers aga inturned their backs on him.“It crushed him,” recalled one of the aides who was often with him the n. “I remember his whole demeanor changing. It also got to his worst fear. The Dinkins thing, looking like you have lost control.”Indeed, as the fallout from the Garner case intensified, Emery said he sensed that de Blasio had “far more fear of the Police Department.”When Legal Aid lawyers sued to obtain limited disciplinary records for the officer who killed Garner and a judge backed the request. Emery had wanted the CCRB to release at least some of the requested records, which were similar to records the agency had released about other officers. But the city appealed the ruling and prevailed in blocking release of the records. It was the first of multiple moves under de Blasio in which the city and NYPDblocked access to disciplinary records that had long been available in the past. De Blasio and others argued that they were simply following a state law, known as 50a, and that the solution lay in changing the statute, which has long been invoked to shield records about policeofficers. But de Blasio opposed repealing the law. “He was a huge impediment on 50a,” said the former aide who worked with de Blasio across two terms. “I do not know how many memos we wrote him about why 50a should be repealed. And we’d talk to him and he’d twist himself into a pretzel.”The summary of Pantaleo is record eventually did come out, after a CCRB staffer leaked i tin 2017. The staffer was forced to resign that week. At the time, Pantaleo was still on the force and had not faced any discipline. The US Justice Department had launched its own investigation, and, as was standard practice, the CCRB put its investigation on hold. Emery thought he had a workaround. If the CCRB were granted access to the minutes of the Staten Island grand jury, the testimony, which by law is secret, might allow the CCRB to move ahead without interfering with the federal investigation. When CCRB is motion for the minutes was rejected by a judge, Emery issued a statement calling the decision “plainly erroneous” and promising to appeal. Instead, the city is lawyers stepped in and stopped the CCRB from appealing. As Emery continued to be outspoken, he drew the ire of police unions. When unions complained that he had a conflict of interest, Emeryrespondedthat they were “squealing like a stuck pig.” That landed him on the cover of the New York Daily News and the editorial page of the New York Post, which called for his ouster: “Cop-hating CCRB Chief Must Go.”De Blasio ended up accepting Emery is resignation two months later, after Emery was sued by Malik and another staffer who alleged he had made sexist remarks. (He denied the allegations and the suit was dropped soon after he quit.)With Emery gone, the mayor decided to turn to his own inner circle, appointing one of his closest aides, Wiley, to lead an agency whose independence the mayor had said was crucial. The daughter of civil rights activists, Wiley had spent two and a half years as de Blasio is in-house legal counsel, advising him on what turned out to be controversial decisions regardingfundraisingandother issues. When Wiley had her first senior staff meeting at the CCRB in the summer of 2016, people there remember her as being friendly but far more circumspect than Emery.“I asked Maya what her plan was on getting NYPD records, because Richard had finally gotten the CCRB to start getting the m, and she would not give a clear answer,” recalled Winsome Thelwell, who at the time oversaw the agency is investigators. (Thelwell, who worked at the agency for 25 years, is one of the four former staffers suing after being let go in November.)Wiley soon found herself dealing with a report that City Hall had already objected to. In early 2016, the CCRB completed a draft report about officers’ use of Tasers, which the NYPD was beginning to roll out more widely. Theoriginal report documented a number of troubling findings: The CCRB found that in nearly a third of the roughly 150 cases it looked at, officers used Tasers on people already in custody; it found almost all of the Taser uses involved unarmed civilians, the majority of whom were Black. As the CCRB was preparing to release the report in March of 2016, the agency followed its practice of sharing the draft with City Hall.“They were upset right away,” recalled Janos Marton, who was an analyst at the CCRB and the primary author of the report. “The mayor is office is response was to shelve it.” (The mayor is office said that its review of CCRB is draft reports “in no way compromises the independence of the agency.”)Marton had gotten another job offer and soon quit. But he said the report was “one of my babies,” so he kept checking on its progress. In mid-May, the CCRB is interim chair was asked at a board meeting why the report had not been published and replied that it would be released “in the next couple of weeks.” That did not happen. Instead, a New York Daily Newsstoryin June revealed the existence of the report and quoted unnamed NYPD officials criticizing it. When Wiley became chair of the board in July, the report was still under wraps. She was asked about it at board meetings in September and in October, according to the meeting transcripts. It was finally published late in October, on a Sunday, and without an accompanying press release. The report also removed recommendations for the NYPD, including one proposal to ban officers from using Tasers on people in handcuffs. As DraftedAs PublishedWiley later said she accepted “full responsibility” for the delay. In a board meeting, shes aid the report was of limited value because it included relatively few cases. She defended her edits: “I stand by the report that we finalized and got out there.”In response to questions, Julia Savel, a campaign spokesperson, referred ProPublica to Wiley is past defense of her role editing and overseeing the release of the Taser report, including her position that the report did not contain enough data to justify its conclusions. Savel also pointed to Wiley is 2017 role in pushing the agency is board to refer the case against Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a fatal chokehold, to the NYPD Pantaleo eventually faced a departmental disciplinary hearing in 2019 and was fired from the force after an NYPD judge found he’d violated department rules. Many staffers inside the CCRB perceived Wiley and her top aides as being too close to City Hall. In late September 2016, Malik, a lawyer and the agency is executive director, wrote to board members that Wiley was seeking to hire her former chief of staff at City Hall in a manner that “could compromise the integrity of our agency.”Wiley wanted to hire her ex-aide to a newly created senior position that would give the aide effective day-to-day control of the agency — Malik is role — even though Wiley is former staffer had missed the window to apply, em ails show. Wiley prevailed. And two weeks later she emailed the agency is staff about the hiring. The email noted that Wiley and two other board members formed a subcommittee “to intervene and select the candidate.” About a month later, Malik left the CCRB to teach at Harvard Law School. Later on in Wiley is tenure, another agency staffer raised concerns about the agency is ties to City Hall. In March 2017, a staffer who had filed a complaint about unrelated wrongdoing by other agency officials told investigators from the city is anti-corruption agency that Wiley and her top aides were taking direction from the mayor is office and improperly sharing media inquiries and public records requests, according to officials and records. The investigators, sent by the Department of Investigation is inspector general for the NYPD, looked into the allegations but ultimately could not confirm the m, a spokesperson for the agency said. Wileyleftthe CCRB after 13 months, explaining that she needed more time to focus on her work in The New School, where she had been teaching and leading a social justice office. City Hall is influence continued. Napolitano, the former CCRB policy expert, experienced it firsthand. She joined the agency in the fall of 2017 just a few months after Wiley left. One of the first subjects she turned to was body-worn cameras. A federal judge had ordered the NYPD to use them as part of a landmark ruling in 2013 that found the department isstop-and-frisk tactics were discriminatory and unconstitutional. The cameras have become a critical part of police oversight. If CCRB investigators have footage, they are more likely to get to the bottom of a case. But Napolitano learned that though the NYPD was rolling out the cameras to patrol officers, it was slow to share the footage with the CCRB Napolitano and others pushed for a solution that some other cities have adopted: civilian investigators should have direct access to recordings. City Hall and the Police Department rejected the idea. The NYPD, in turn, became even worse at sharing footage. In August 2019, CCRB officials proposed noting in an annual city report that its investigations were being delayed because the NYPD was not turning over body-worn camera footage. The report is meant to give status updates about all agencies. An introduction describes it as an opportunity to “hold ourselves accountable.”An assistant to the mayor kept a reference to the delay but cut out the explanation that the NYPD was the reason for it. She wrote that the report was not the place “for one agency to call out or point fingers at the slowness or inaction of other agencies,” a policy the mayor is office told ProPublica “is universal to agencies across the board.”As DraftedAs PublishedThat same month, the CCRB finally prosecuted Officer Pantaleo in a departmental tribunal court, leading to his firing. The agency is chair by the n was Davie. Like de Blasio is previous picks, he came with civil rights bona fides — and close ties to the mayor. Heofficiated at de Blasio is wedding. Davie wrote anop-edfor The Washington Post lauding Pantaleo is firing, concluding that the ruling was “evidence that civilian oversight of police works.”The op-ed prompted as harp email from the mayor is the n press secretary, Freddi Goldstein, with the subject header, “What is this?”“Do not remember ever giving approval for this let alone being asked,” Goldstein wrote. (Goldstein mistakenly CC’d a reporter at the Gotham Gazette, who shared the email with ProPublica.)Asked about the email, Goldstein, who left City Hall last year, told ProPublica she was surprised to see the op-ed in print since it was standard practice for all city agencies to discuss upcoming stories with the mayor is office.“I do think that we tried to be sensitive” to the agency is independence, she said. “But I do think we expected them to give us a heads-up when things were happening.”A month later, Davie again ran afoul of the mayor is office. He was set to testify before the state senate, where a bill to finally repeal the 50a secrecy law was being considered. As chair of the CCRB, Davie was going to call for an end to the law. “If New York is indeed sincere about our commitment to transparency in policing, we must repeal 50-a,” Davie planned to say, according to hisdrafttestimony. But the mayor is office objected. “City Hall was adamantly against it,” recalled Napolitano, who worked on the draft. She said Davie is testimony, along with planned remarks from an NYPD official, were canceled just minutes before the hearing. A spokesperson told ProPublica the mayor was “not involved.”After the New York Postreportedthat the mayor is office had scuttled the testimony, Davie did testify a week later,softening his call for repeal and explaining it was just his opinion. As DraftedAs DeliveredA few months later, Davie organized a letter signed by other CCRB board members calling for repeal. A City Hall spokesperson at the time disavowed the letter, saying it did not represent the agency is official position. Last summer, state legislators repealed the law. When de Blasio first pushed for stronger oversight for the NYPD more than a decade ago, he recognized the importance of independent funding. Heproposedthat the CCRB is budget be set to a fixed percentage of the NYPD is, so the agency would “never be subject to politically charged budget negotiations.”Two years ago, there was an opportunity to make that reality. A commission had been convened to propose reforms to the city is charter, including rules on police oversight. Like other agencies, the CCRB prepared recommendations in the fall of 2018, including the idea de Blasio had once advanced about the budget. But as one agency official had text ed a colleague, the proposals prompted a “fight” with the mayor is office and City Hall “put the kibosh” on the planned testimony. After push back from police-reform advocates, the CCRB did offer its proposals to the commission the next spring. But the agency struggled to find support, including from the mayor is appointees to the commission. One commission member who pushed for independent CCRB budgeting recalled having to drop the idea to secure support fora nother proposal to bolster the agency. It was “baffling,” said Sateesh Nori, who had been appointed by the city is elected public advocate. The commission ended up endorsing apropos alt hat linked the CCRB is head count to the size of the NYPD, but did not guarantee a budget. It also allowed the mayor to ignore the head count provision based on “fiscal necessity.” Voters approved the proposal in November 2019. Four months later, the CCRB prepared testimony to the City Council requesting money for a “public education campaign” so more New Yorkers would know where to go with complaints about police. City Hall cut the request, arguing that a unit within the agency dedicated to outreach was already sufficiently funded. (Here is the final testimony.) Currently, the CCRB has a roughly $20 million budget and about 200 employees. By that summer, there was a push inside the agency to swiftly complete investigations into the Police Department is aggressive response to the racial justice protests that had swept the city after George Floyd is killing. But investigators were overwhelmed by hundreds of complaints and stymied by alack of cooperation by the NYPD under Commissioner Dermot Shea, who had been appointed to the top job by de Blasio in December 2019. As of Wednesday, the CCRB had brought charges against 11 officers. Last September, the CCRB was going to note in a report another reason for the delays. Some officers had covered their badge numbers, making it hard to identify them. City Hall softened the wording to say there had just been allegations of badges being covered. When Napolitano objected, CCRB general counsel Matthew Kadushin replied: “Nicole – Please make the changes that City Hall recommended.” (Kadushin did not reply to a request for comment.)Read MoreTwo months later, Napolitano and three other senior CCRB staffers were called for video meetings with two agency officials. Napolitano and the others were told they were being let go and that their access to agency em ails and records was being cut off. When Napolitano asked why, one official said they could not discuss it but that the agency was “restructuring.” In a statement at the time, board chair Davie said the moves were made to “address redundancies.”Napolitano had voted for de Blasio multiple times, including as her local council member. She had joined city government soon after he was elected, believing in his message that building trust in the NYPD was critical and could lead to more effective policing. “I was hopeful,” she recalled. Despite everything, Napolitano said she still has hope. For real change to happen, people “need to understand how the system really works.”Has the NYPD Stopped a Teen You Know?

181,House Oversight Committee debates Texas abortion law,-5.0,45.0,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/30/house-oversight-committee-debates-texas-abortion-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-30,23,"| Representative Cori Bushwas raped at a church camp as a teenager. A month later, she realized she was pregnant and sought out an abortion, she said at a hearing Thursday.“I knew it was a decision I needed to make for myself, so I did,” said the Missouri Democrat, who called it the hardest decision she ever made. “Today, I sit before you as that nurse, and as a pastor, activist, survivor, single mom, and congresswoman to testify that in the summer of 1994, I was raped, became pregnant, and chose to have an abortion.”Bush was one of four congresswomen testifying about deeply personal connections during a tense House Oversight and Reform hearing Thursday about state restrictions on abortion in light of a new Texas law banning almost all such procedures. Bush said she mostly kept the experience to herself, a sentiment shared by the two other Democrats who spoke about their abortions. Representative Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., first spoke publicly about her abortion in 2019. On Thursday, she was candid about its significance in her life.“For me, terminating my pregnancy was not an easy choice, but it was my choice. And that is what must be preserved, for every pregnant person,” she said. “Today, I am testifying before you because I want you to know that there are so many different situations that people face in making these choices.”Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus Co-ChairBarbara Lee, D-Calif., also spoke about her experience having a “back-alley” abortion as a teenager in the mid-1960s.“My personal experience shaped my beliefs to fight for people is reproductive freedom,” she said. Representative Kat Cammack, R-Fla., approached the topic from a different perspective — as the child of someone whose doctors and family encouraged an abortion but decided not to follow through with it.“I would not be here were it not for the very brave choice my mother made 33 years ago,” she said. “Because of her strength, she chose life. That was not an easy decision for a single mom, a working-class mom.”The House Oversight and Reform hearing came a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee held a similar hearing on the legal ramifications of a controversial Texas law. On Sept. 1, the state implemented a law that bans almost all abortions with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law essentially guts the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe vs Wade, legal scholars say. ChairwomanCarolyn B Maloney, D-NY, said she felt compelled to hold this hearing, two years after a similar one on state abortion laws.“If we do nothing, the consequences will not be limited to Texas,” she said, adding that other states are on the path to follow Texas’ example with copycat laws. The Texas ban incentivizes lawsuits against individuals who aid in an abortion, which could include a variety of health care workers or anyone who provides transportation to an appointment. Republicans criticized the hearing and questioned the committee is jurisdiction over state laws. GOP lawmakers also defended states’ rights to pass their own restrictions.“What the hell is going on here today? We do not have oversight over state abortion rights. This is not the purpose of this committee,” said Representative Nancy Mace, R-SC Representative Virginia Foxx, R-NC, called it a “solemn duty” to oppose the expansion of abortion.“Instead of glorifying this awful act of desperation, we ought to grieve for the tens of millions of Americans who never have a chance to take their first breath,” she said. “We live in a society that mistakes choice for liberty and denies the dignity of unborn life.”Democrats spoke in favor of two bills that would expand abortion rights. The first is a House-passed bill by Representative Judy Chu, D-Calif., that would expand abortion protections for providers and patients, limiting state-level restrictions. The Senate placed the bill on its calendar Wednesday. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas-based obstetrician-gynecologist and board member of the Physicians for Reproductive Health abortion rights group, called the bill “an important and critical step, but it is not enough.”“We need legislation that will protect pregnant people and birthing people in all of their decisions so they can live their healthiest lives,” she said. Chu also testified in support of her bill, which no House Republicans voted for last week. The second bill, also from Lee, would require federal health care programs to cover abortion and require access to abortion in federal health facilities. It would also allow qualified health insurance plans to use premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies to cover abortion-related costs. Lee also mentioned her sexual education bill, which she said was necessary to provide students with comprehensive knowledge to limit unintended pregnancies. A discussion over whether abortion laws should include exceptions for rape and incest became intense. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., called out the minority witness Ingrid Skop, a Texas-based member of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists and associate scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, over her support of the Texas law. He asked her if she would accept her daughter hypothetically having an abortion if she were to be raped.“There is adequate time in this law for a woman who is been raped to discover if she is pregnant and, if she wants to terminate the pregnancy, she has time to do it,” Skop said. The two volleyed back and forth, with Krishnamoorthi concluding by calling the witness’ replies “unresponsive.”Foxx called the questioning “disrespectful” and Mace called it “offensive and disgusting.”On the other side, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezof New York, questioned Skop is statement.“Six weeks pregnant is two weeks late for one is period. When you are raped, you do not always know what happened to you. I speak about this as a survivor,” she said. Representative Jamie Raskin, D-Md., asked every witness if they think the law should be changed nationally so that women and girls who are raped should be forced to bear their rapist is child. Maleeha Aziz, a community organizer with the Texas Equal Access Fund; Melissa Murray, a New York University School of Law professor; Loretta Ross, a co-founder of the reproductive justice movement and Smith College associate professor; activist Gloria Steinem; and Moayedi said no.“I think the answer is obvious because my son had a complicated life getting to know his pedophile father,” said Ross, who talked earlier about her experience being raped at 14 by a married older cousin and not having the option to have an abortion. Skop also said she did not want the law changed, but for different reasons.“No, I do not want to see the law changed. I want to see people is hearts and minds changed about this unborn human,” she said.",2,2,Roll Call

Despite Blake is incapacitation—and his clear need to continue to receive treatment—his father says Blake is currently handcuffed to his hospital bed. Blake is father, also named Jacob Blake, shared the detail withCNNon Thursday. The younger Blake is still recovering from gunshot wounds to his spinal cord, liver and kidney at a Wauwatosa, Wisconsin hospital, where he has been since being shot on Sunday night. Blake is father said he was “heartbroken” to see his son shackled to his hospital bed. His uncle, Justin Blake, called it “insult to injury.”“He is paralyzed and ca not walk and they have him cuffed to the bed,” he said. “Why?”No one seems to have an answer, though the practice of shackling those in state custody—even as they receive critical medical care—has a long history in this country, and it is still ongoing. For instance, guards from local and state prisons and jails stills hackle pregnant incarcerated women while they give birth. At a press conference on Thursday, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said he had “no personal understanding why [the handcuffing] would be necessary.”“I would hope that we would be able to find a more—a better way to help him ... in recovering,” Evers said. “That seems counterintuitive. It seems to be bad medicine.”The practice, of course, is not intended to help the detained person in any way. Ostensibly, it is to prevent people who are of interest to, or in custody of, the state from “escaping”—logic be damned. What it explicitly does is reinforce ownership. Blake—and the many other Black men and women who have shared this cruel experience—is being treated like state property. Blake has been hospitalized for five days because of actions undertaken by Kenosha police officers; he may very well never walk again because of the choices those cops made. But the handcuffs holding Blake to his bed make clear what Kenosha police and the district is attorney intend for him once he recovers adequately. More chains.: The handcuffs have been removed and the warrant that led to Blake being shackled to his hospital bed has been vacated, his attorney, Patrick Cafferty, told CNN From CNN:Kenosha County Sheriff is Department spokesman Sgt. David Wright explained earlier Friday that Blake was handcuffed to the bed because he “has felony warrants for his arrest from crimes he committed prior to the shooting incident.”“Anyone with this classification level that we are guarding in the hospital would be treated in this manner,” Wright said in a statement. In response to the statement from the sheriff is office, Blake is uncle, Justin Blake, told CNN, “It shows how little class and compassion the sheriff has.”",0,0,The Root

She appeared on “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on Thursday to give additional details about Dominion and Smartmatic voting software, which is now being referred to as a “Cyber Pearl Harbor.”“They designed and developed the Smartmatic and Dominion programs and machines that include a controller module that allows people to log in and manipulate the vote even as its happening,” Powell said. “We are finding more and more evidence of this.”Powell claims that she and her legal team have compiled “reams and reams of actual documents” from the firms showing that Dominion and Smartmatic “planned and executed all of this.”“We know that 400 million dollars of money came into Smartmatic from China only a few weeks before the election, that there are George Soros connections to the entire endeavor,” Powell said – bringing up Eric Coomer and Mark Malloch Brown as two individuals she believes are involved with the entire scheme. Powell explained that the documents are still being reviewed but investigators are getting a clear picture of who the major players are. Some of these individuals reportedly include former Venezuelan communications director Jorge Rodriguez, Hezbollah liaison Khalil Majid Mazoub, software designer Gustavo Reyes Zumeta, and Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mujica.“Frankly, our national security agency and defense intelligence agency need to be all over this immediately. The evidence is overwhelming and extremely troubling that this has been going on and did not just start this year,” Powell said.

She effectively started The Krakening at a press conference today.“We will not be intimidated…We are going to clean this mess up now. President Trump won by a landslide. We are going to prove it. And we are going to reclaim the USs of America for the people who vote for freedom,” Powell said at the press conference…“We have already had that electoral breakdown, but the Constitution…has provisions in it for how you fix this, and there should never be another election conducted in this country, I do not care if it is for local dog catcher, using a Dominion machine and Smartmatic software,” she explained. “We have got to have an American company that uses paper ballots that we can all verify so every one of us can see that our vote is our vote.”…Powell also detailed the many ways that Dominion software enabled the transfer of votes from President Donald Trump to “president-elect” Joe Biden on election day.“I have gotten multiple em ails from people in other countries who watched the same pattern happen there. We have witness testimony that the same things were done in those countries as this was exported by Maduro, and by Mr. Chavez, and by Cuba, and, of course, we know China also has a substantial presence in Venezuela and a substantial interest in making sure that President Trump does not continue in office,” she explained.“This is the consummate foreign interference in our election in the most criminal way you can possibly imagine. It must be shutdown. We know, for example, that one of the Dominion is highest level employees, or officers, went to Detroit himself to man the Detroit operations center where he could watch the votes coming in real time and decide what file folder in the system to put those votes into,” Powell continued.“That is why you see massive spikes after hours when people were told that all the votes were in and all the votes were counted. Many Dominion employees have already reached out to us to tell us the truth. They are Americans who want to ensure election integrity like we do. I would encourage every Dominion or Smartmatic employee who is fed up with the corruption in this country to come forward as soon as possible because these are serious federal offenses that I am confident that the Department of Justice will be in pursuit of in very short order if they are not already,” she added. Although she has yet to produce a smoking gun, Powell continues to diligently work behind the scenes to get to the bottom of the incredible and unprecedented fraud that happened during the election.

Wouldmass transit take a hit as individuals opt for personal transportation? Would car sales boom in the following years? We do not have clear answers yet, but a snapshot of data at least gives us some indication of the pandemic is affect in the near-term. According to a report from the New York Times, citing data from the Department of Motor Vehicles, car registrations jumped 37% between August and October of last year in New York. You know, the city that was famed for congestion and vehicle traffic even before the pandemic. The 37% rise includes the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, but breaking the data out shows an even more intriguing picture. In Manhattan alone, new car registrations rose 76% and in Brooklyn, registrations climbed 45%. That is a serious amount of new vehicles roaming around tight city streets, and the Times report highlighted the problem that brings with available parking spaces. With more cars, parking quickly started to vanish, especially as city authorities began converting streets, parking lots and other areas into large outdoor dining spaces to try and compensate for tight restrictions on indoor dining. On the flip side, proponents for more mass transit and cycling lanes underscored now is the time to fix the problem for good as we hopefully begin to put the pandemic in the rear view this year. Additional cycling lanes and room for other forms of transport can allow people to move more freely throughout the city. But advocates will still need to convince the thousands of new local vehicles owners first.",2,2,CNET

A worker fills a bottle with water on a farm during a drought in Firebaugh, Calif., on July 13. Outdoor workers in the USs could face four times as many days with hazardous heat by mid-century if action is not taken to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, according to a report published Tuesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). The consequences of that extreme heat can be severe: a new NPR/Columbia Journalism School investigation found that at least 384 workers have died from environmental heat exposure in the last decade. And the problem is getting worse: the three-year average of worker heat deaths has doubled since the early 1990s.""The last seven years have been the hottest on record,"" said Rachel Licker, the senior climate scientist and an author of the UCS report, said in a statement. ""Without additional protections, the risks to workers will only grow in the decades ahead as climate change worsens, leaving the roughly 32 million outdoor workers in our country to face a brutal choice: their health or their jobs.""The report also projects a severe economic toll, with the average outdoor worker losing more than $1,700 each year because of work stoppages on days when heat and humidity top 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends employers reduce work schedules. Lost wages from extreme heat are projected to amount to more than $55 billion annually. People of color, who are disproportionately represented in outdoor occupations, stand to be hit especially hard hit. More than 40 percent of US outdoor workers identify as African American, Black, Hispanic or Latino, according to the report, and they could lose $23 billion in annual earnings by 2065 if no action is taken to reduce emissions. The finding mirrors previous research that has shown that residents of low-income areas and communities of color in American cities endure far higher temperatures than people who live in whiter, wealthier areas. Kristina Dahl, a UCS senior climate scientist and and an author of the report, said in statement that existing inequities faced by people of color, including ""increased exposure to air pollution, lack of access to quality health care and adequate cooling, and under funded social services,"" can compound the impact of extreme heat. Migrant workers, she said, including those in the country illegally, are especially at risk. In addition to the heightened risks posed by climate change, the UCS report highlights the lack of federal worker protections as a major issue for worker safety. As NPR has previously reported, at least a dozen companies have had multiple employees die from environmental heat exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not adopted a national heat standard to safeguard workers and often decides not to penalize companies for worker deaths. The report is authors call for a number of policy changes, including adapting worker schedules to coincide with cooler times of day and lessening overall workloads. Employers, the report says, should also implement mandatory heat safety plans, heat monitoring and reporting requirements, and multilingual training for supervisors and workers to facilitate better and faster responses to dangers imposed by extreme heat.""We know this risk is worsening and has significant implications for workers, employers and the broader economy, so we need to be prepared,"" Licker said. Regulation and adaptation alone will not be enough to address the problems faced by workers as long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to warm the planet. The projections in the UCS report, though, are based on a scenario that seems increasingly less likely: a constant level of emissions through mid-century. That projection would place the world far out of step with the goals set by the Paris Agreement — a commitment signed by nearly all of the world is countries which seeks to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F). As part of the deal, the USs has pledged to halve its emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Other countries have set similar targets. Right now, though, few of the world is biggest economies, including the US, are on track to meet those goals — something the report is authors say needs to change.""To limit future extreme heat, the USs must urgently contribute to global efforts to effectively constrain heat-trapping emissions by investing in just and equitable solutions that get us to net-zero emissions no later than 2050,"" Licker said.",2,2,NPR
186,A Nightmare COVID Winter Could Force a GOP Awakening on Stimulus,-12.33,38.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/a-dark-covid-winter-could-force-gop-to-make-deal-on-stimulus.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2020-11-14,25,"The number of Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 is higher now that it has ever been. The seven-day moving average of confirmed cases in the USs is 40,444 cases higher today than it was one week ago. Hospital systems in several states are under severe stress. Utah and North Dakota have begun to exhaust their limited capacity of hospital beds. And winter has not even begun. Barring some great good fortune — or the rapid dissemination of a working vaccine — the next few months could be the most difficult of the pandemic thus far for the US writ large. Across the northern hemisphere, the not-so-novel coronavirus is exhibiting clear signs of seasonality. The bug seems to spread more easily in cold dry air and when humans are huddled indoors, sharing spaces with limited ventilation. Meanwhile, winter is also shattering the fragile accommodations that many small businesses have made to the pandemic. Summer offered restaurants and bars relatively comfortable and safe conditions for serving their customers (when the rain was at bay). And by keeping case growth within certain regional and epidemiological bounds, the warmer months also enabled businesses in many fortunate areas — those with high levels of public-health skepticism and low levels of infection — to operate at something approximating normal capacity. This said, even during a favorable season — and before the CARES Act is direct and indirect supports for small businesses were depleted —tens of thousands of firms closed their doors. The sane response to this state of affairs was, oddly enough, articulated by someone in proximity to presidential power on Wednesday. Dr. Michael Osterholm, a pandemic adviser to President-elect Joe Biden,suggestedthat Congress could establish open-ended wage and revenue replacement for workers, firms, and sub-federal governments for four to six weeks — during which the nation could enter a unified lock down of nonessential businesses. Implemented correctly, this could flatten the curve of infection, saving untold lives while keeping Americans financially stable. These measures would make sense if we did not appear to be only months away from a widely available vaccine. With a path to vaccine-induced herd immunity in sight,it is obscene for our society to acquiesce to mass death. Alas, our society has a thing for such obscene acquiescence. Osterholm is approach looks impossible in a country as demented and divided as our own. But as our COVID winter darkens, the outlook for a robust stimulus package just might brighten. Most of my analysis on the prospects for another round of COVID relief has been premised on the assumption that — if Republicans retain control of the Senate — the next round of stimulus will be either meager or non-existent. After all, if Mitch McConnell was unwilling to meet Democratshalfway earlier this year(when reaching a deal would have been a political boon to a Republican president as well as the most vulnerable members of his own caucus), why on earth would he do so now (when reaching a deal would be a political boon to Joe Biden)? The Senate Majority Leader is core strategic insight during the Obama years was that the American people hold the president is party responsible for conditions in the country and legislative failures on Capitol Hill. Thus, if an opposition party secures control of one chamber of Congress, it can increase its odds of winning back power in ensuing elections by obstructing the president is agenda and/or sabotaging the economy. Under Barack Obama, Mitch McConnell is caucus agitated for spending cuts when unemployment remained near double digits; under Donald Trump, it embraced deficit spending when unemployment was near historic lows. But I am not sure if the congressional GOP ever allowed itself to comprehend what this winter was liable to look like. Already, Republicans have made half-hearted efforts to pass further relief for small-business owners, who comprise a significant portion of the party is activist and donor base. McConnellheld a vote on a $500 billion relief package that would have renewed funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. As the coronavirus digs deeper and more durably into deep red areas of the country, and winter makes it even more difficult for many small service-sector firms to survive, it is not clear whether the GOP will be able to withstand internal pressure to actually deliver substantive aid to one of its core constituencies. Which is to say: There is a good chance that, eventually, McConnell will feel that he needs to make a deal. And he may well prefer to make it during the lame-duck session, when Biden will reap less credit for the legislation (even if the new president enjoys some benefit for its effects). Of course, small business has a major presence within the Democratic coalition too. And so it is possible that all of the factors cited above will break House Democrats’ will and force them to acquiesce to McConnell is terms on relief. But the Democratic Party is main sticking point in previous negotiations — their insistence on massive fiscal aid to states and municipalities— will only look more reasonable as local governments across the country hemorrhage tax revenue. The end product is almost certain to be too little, too late. But given enough death and bankruptcy, Republicansbe forced to back the kind of robust relief package they refused to put on Trump is desk when they had the chance. ",1,1,New York Magazine
187,Trump Should Simply Ignore Senate Impeachment Trial,14.33,30.33,https://thelibertyloft.com/trump-should-simply-ignore-senate-impeachment-trial/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,15,"Charlotte, NC — Over the weekend, multiple mainstream media outlets were making a big deal about former President Donald Trump is legal team. Many of them reported that President Trump had asked for his impeachment defense to consist of arguments that the election was stolen. They said that those requests caused his legal team to simply walk away. This seems to be the side of the story that the mainstream media wants to push. Other reports shared that Trump had never signed letters of intent and that no money was exchanged for services. In either case, President Trump has no need for a legal defense. At this point, President Trump should simply ignore the impeachment hearing altogether and pretend it is not happening. The Democrats have no chance to convict President Trump. There are simply not enough Republicans that are willing to go along with the ridiculous nature of this trial. Sure, they will get a few of them (think Romney, Collins, etc.), but they will not get 17 of them. They need 67 votes to convict and Vice President Kamala Harris’ vote would not apply here. There is also the fact that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will not be at the trial. The Left will argue that it is procedural because Trump is no longer President. If that is the case, the n you have no legal basis for impeaching him either. That is the exact argument that Senator Rand Paul(R-KY) made just a couple of days ago. There is no precedent for an impeachment conviction of a President that is no longer in office. While the Democrats want to proceed with the trial to try and prevent Trump from ever holding office again, there is no indication that it would be a constitutional act. The Democrats will ram this impeachment hearing through the Senate and attempt to put on a show to the American people. Donald Trump should not fall for it. Instead, he should simply ignore it for the ridiculous government show that it is. The Left is banking on the fact that Trump will want to try to argue his point and defend his position. Why bother if you cannot be convicted? They want his sound bites and his press releases to try and use against him. If he ignores the trial, the Democrats gain nothing but a waste of American tax dollars and their time. Republicans can use the opportunity to continue to show Americans that Democrats are not interested in helping the m, they are only interested in power and the radical agenda. They are only interested in the mselves, instead of representing those who elected them to Congress. While I certainly believe that there are some issues on the Republican side of the aisle, this is one area where Republicans can do the mselves some favors. They can use the impeachment trial to their advantage and against Joe Biden. Let the Democrats perform the impeachment trial. Let them present little to no evidence to support their claims. As Republicans start their defense, they should simply start telling stories from across the country. Tell the stories of small businesses that have closed while the Democrats refuse to do anything. Tell the stories of the people whose lives have been changed at the hands of Antifa and the riots that the Left has supported. Finally, tell the story of Hunter Biden and the corruption of the Biden family. There is absolutely nothing that the Democrats can accomplish through the impeachment trial of President Trump. It is a golden opportunity for Republicans to start laying the groundwork for 2022 and 2024, however. Washington is the Editor-in-Chief atThe Liberty Loftand host ofThe JD Washington Show.

188,The Cuba protests are a cry for help. America needs to listen.,-18.33,32.67,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/cuba-protests-are-cry-help-america-needs-listen-n1273785,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-13,25,"This weekend, thousands of Cubans poured into the streets in the largest display of anti-government sentiment since 1994. We are only aware of what is happening in Cuba thanks to a handful of videos that slipped out before the government closed off communications with the outside world and publicly threatened to crush the protests by force. Rolling, hours long blackouts outside of the country is cities has upended Cuba is governable consensus. But we saw enough:Demonstrators chanting slogans like “we want freedom” and flying the American flag. The accounts of this event in mainstream American media venues are mechanically nuanced. The Cuban economy has been decimated by the pandemic-related tourism drought. Shortages of food, medicine and doctors have created intolerable conditions. Rolling, hours long blackouts outside of the country is cities has upended Cuba is governable consensus. But the Cubans demonstrating in the streets chanting “anti-government slogans” of “Freedom!” in this Communist island “known for repressive crackdowns on dissent,” as TheNew York Timesdamningly observed, are demanding something more from Havana than functioning public utilities and basic social welfare. In his second inaugural address, George W Bush committed his administration to a “freedom agenda.” Both to preserve America is national security from rogue regimes and the malefactors they incubate and to promote the flourishing of the human condition around the world, Bush pledged to pursue policies with the lofty “ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”Bush is opponents dismissed the notion as naïve and unworldly. The president is supporters regarded it as purely aspirational. Voters came to see it as a veiled commitment to more military adventurism around the world, and they rejected it unmistakably in both 2006 and 2008. America has not had anything close to a “freedom agenda” since. But the oppressed peoples of the world have not abandoned their desire to breathe free, even if our support for their ambitions is now only rhetorical. Bush pledged to pursue policies with the lofty “ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.”In Cuba is case, all the usual proximate causes that can be rationalized away as something other than a demand for essential liberties are on full display in the mainstream press. But there are always proximate causes behind the upheavals that result in the destruction of an oppressive schema. And that schema is never far from the forefront of oppressed minds. Poland is Solidarity movement owed its existence to the rising price of food. The unrest in the Baltic republics that culminated in the dissolution of the Soviet Union arose in response to Moscow is plan for a strip mine in Estonia. The self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor that produced one of the most responsive and democratic governments in the Muslim world occurred in response to high unemployment and inflation. Seismic geopolitical events begin with banalities, but they are also almost always a symptom of the maladies associated with autocratic illiberalism. And eventually, an autocracy is restive public will begin to treat the disease over its symptoms. Rather commendably, President Joe Biden welcomed the protests as a “clarion call for freedom” — an outpouring against what the president deemed the “repression” meted out by “Cuba is authoritarian regime.” This is due to a rejection of the “proximate causes” theory of unrest in oppressive states, but the Biden administration did not initially speak with one clear voice on the subject.“We are deeply concerned by ‘calls to combat’ in #Cuba,” acting assistant secretary for the State Department is Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, July Chang, tweeted in whatThe Washington Post accurately characterized as a rebuke of Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who called on the Cuban military to “defend the people, not the Communist Party.”“We stand by the Cuban people is right for peaceful assembly,” Chang said. “We call for calm and condemn any violence.”But Biden isnational security adviser, Jake Sullivan, quickly clarified the administration is position: “The US supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal rights.” There is a subtle distinction here — one that speaks to the traditional American orientation toward the support of even revolutionary struggles against tyranny, particularly those that target unfree governments hostile to American national ambitions. Eventually, an autocracy is restive public will begin to treat the disease over its symptoms. And why should not that be the case? We have seen what the laissez-faire approach produces, and no one should be satisfied with the results. When the Venezuelan people rose up against their oppressive and regionally destabilizing government in 2014, President Barack Obama letCongress take the lead. The president signed a bill imposing sanctions on Venezuelan officials into law only after at least 43 demonstrators had been killed and the movement that threatened to topple the regime in Caracas had been all but quelled. Obama was just as reluctant to provide any meaningful support for the demonstrators who made up Iran is “Green Revolution” in 2009. For fear of jeopardizing the prospects for diplomacy with Tehran or inflaming an already tense situation, Obama downplayed the prospects for revolutionary social change in Iran. Indeed, he hoped to avoid making the US “the issue inside of Iran,” and could not be moved to even question the results of what few observers concluded w asa free and fair election. Obama is Republican successor was similarly if not equally inclined against providing any meaningful support for anti-authoritarian dissidents. Donald Trump got a second bite at the apple of Iranian democracy in late 2019 and early 2020 when violent protests erupted, ostensibly over rising gas prices (more proximate causes). And while Trump was more willing than his predecessor to express support for anti-regime demonstrators’ goals, he stopped short of advancing them himself. “US officials say the administration needs to avoid any overtures that could draw accusations of foreign meddling — like direct financing,”Reuters reported, “and increase the chances of a violent crackdown on the people it wants to support.”That caution seemed to inform the Trump administration is handling of the outpouring of anti-Beijing sentiment in the streets of Hong Kong in 2019. Akin to Obama is administration of the crisis in Venezuela, Trumplet Congress lead the way. And while the Trump White House was rhetorically supportive of the pro-democracy protesters, the president is pronouncements surely confused the Chinese. He described the anti-Beijing protests as “riots,” which advanced a narrative preferred by the Chinese Communist Party. Trump coupled the issue of democracy in Hong Kong with ongoing trade negotiations, which his advisers insisted were entirely unrelated. And ultimately, he sought to avoid the very circumstances Obama feared: allowing the demonstrations to be affiliated with the USs — something that did not similarly concern the thousands of protesters who waved American flags and sang the American national anthem. And what has our stance gotten us? In Venezuela, our refusal to capitalize on the momentum of the moment allowed it to fizzle, leaving Washington to support a parallel government only belatedly and without many prospects for success. In Iran, it has led to the sacrifice of every opportunity to be rid of a medieval cabal that seems determined to one day present the world with a nuclear crisis that may only be resolvable through war or the extirpation of this regime. In China, democracy in Hong Kong is all but crushed. The regime in Beijing is now so emboldened by its success that it is intimating in every possible way that retaking Taiwan by force is no longer a hypothetical but a potentially imminent threat. So, what can Biden do for the persecuted Cuban people beyond speaking the truth about their persecutors? The White House can and should pressure countries and businesses operating inside Cuba to help the Cuban people evade the government is efforts to limit their access to communications networks. Washington should do what it can to boost the shortwave radio signals carrying Miami-based Radio Martí. The Biden administration should threaten Cuban leaders with sanctions as well as travel and visa restrictions if they carry out Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel is threat to violently suppress the protests. And if these demonstrations are put down, the US should reduce its diplomatic presence in Cuba and restrict the movements of Cuban operatives inside the USs. Yes, the usual suspects will wring their hands over Washington taking tacit ownership of the protesters and their cause. So what? A more active defense of the world is unfulfilled aspirations for freedom at least has the potential to change the course of history for the better. We know that doing nothing begets nothing. At the least, we should be honest with ourselves. We must admit that advancing the mutually compatible goals of seeking a freer world that is more stable and, the refore, more amenable to American geopolitical objectives is just a happy story we tell ourselves. If that is not a palatable option, maybe it is time to take a second look at the “freedom agenda.”Noah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary Magazine.",1,1,MSNBC

190,"COVID Delta variant puts men, people of color at risk, Biden official warns",-1.0,48.0,https://19thnews.org/2021/07/the-covid-delta-variant-puts-men-and-people-of-color-at-risk-biden-official-warns/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"The highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 — on track to become the dominant strain in the USs — could exacerbate stark race and gender-based coronavirus disparities, undercutting the possibility of a nationwide return to normal, a top adviser to the president told The 19th.“I am worried about Delta, and I am worried about Delta especially for people who are not vaccinated, and for communities where the uptake of vaccination has been low,” said Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who chairs the White House is COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. The Delta variant, which was first seen in India and is already the dominant coronavirus strain in many other countries, is more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and can potentially result in more serious infections. It has already been detected in every state, and government officials believe it will become the main source of American infections within weeks. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Although cases have been trending downward, the Delta variant creates a coronavirus outbreaks in communities where a significant number of people remain unvaccinated, which can put specific, hard-to-reach populations at risk. The impact could be particularly severe for men, Nunez-Smith acknowledged, since they have generally been more likely to develop complications, sometimes fatal, from COVID-19. Nunez-Smith said that adds to the imperative of getting more men vaccinated. Currently, 53 percent of people who are fully vaccinated are women, and only 47 percent are men, according to data collected by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The data does not disaggregate sex and gender or account for non binary people. The only age group in which men are more likely to be vaccinated is for adults older than 75, per a separate CDC analysis. You have been subscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]to subscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving em ails (according toBouncer). You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. White people are more likely to have been vaccinated than Black or Latinx people, the CDC data shows. That has been a concern for months, especially since Black and Latinx people have been more likely to work jobs that expose them to the virus and have been more likely to end up in the hospital. The introduction of the more contagious variant, coupled with that vaccine disparity, could create greater risk of localized, unequally distributed COVID-19 outbreaks, Nunez-Smith said.“There is more work to do,” she said. “The dynamics of COVID-19 are local. And so it really comes down to the dynamics of one is community. How many people in one is community have been vaccinated? The risk is there for these localized surges.”Efforts to vaccinate more Americans have lagged since spring. Though President Joe Biden initially set a target of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated by the July 4 holiday, the administration acknowledged last week it was unlikely to meet that goal. So far, 66.5 percent of adults have gotten at least one shot. The Biden administration has vowed to distribute vaccines equitably — touting targeted outreach for Black and Latinx people in particular, given their disproportionate harm experienced — but those efforts have not been enough to close vaccine disparities. Nunez-Smith would not say whether federal guidance might change around indoor mask mandates, but she did suggest that more local areas — especially places with low vaccination rates or new surges of COVID-19 — could reintroduce indoor mask mandates even for people who are vaccinated. That is in line with guidance from other officials, notably Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Currently, the CDC does not recommend requiring indoor masks for people who are fully vaccinated. The World Health Organization does recommend indoor masks, though, citing the risk of the Delta variant. This past week, Los Angeles County is health department put out a strong recommendation that people wear masks indoors even if fully vaccinated.“It is really up to locals and states around mask requirements,” Nunez-Smith said. “But I particularly encourage people to pay attention to the local dynamics.”All evidence suggests that people with two shots of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine will not develop severe illness from the Delta variant, and are unlikely to transmit the virus to others. On Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said its vaccine also protects against the Delta variant. But if large pockets of people remain unvaccinated — in the USs or abroad — the virus could further mutate and develop even more potent variants that eventually undercut the power of those vaccines. At the current pace of vaccination, it could take another year for enough of the world to have coronavirus immunity, according to data analyzed byBloomberg News.",2,2,19th News
191,Coronavirus relief bill: Extend the $600 unemployment benefit,-4.67,35.33,https://fortune.com/2020/08/13/unemployment-benefits-relief-bill-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"Congress must act now, or millions more workers will lose their jobs without a safety net to catch them. Every job we lost has a ripple effect, and all the warning signs for our economy are flashing red. Since the pandemic began,55 million Americans have filed for unemployment. That is not even counting the undocumented workers who are ineligible for benefits or parents—mainly women—who left the workforce to care for their kids. Without a real relief package, millions more will soon join the m, including hundreds of thousands of flight attendants, pilots, baggage handlers, gate agents, and other aviation workers. So far, almost no aviation workers are out of work, thanks to thePayroll Support Programour unions fought for in the CARES Act. The program stabilized 2.1 million jobs so efficiently that overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both chambers support a clean extension. But if the re is no relief package, aviation will join the long unemployment lines and our country will lose more of the jobs we support—in manufacturing, hospitality, transportation, and beyond. And the crisis for workers will be even more disastrous. Many of the 55 million who filed for unemployment have stayed afloat because of the $600 enhanced unemployment benefit Congress included in the CARES Act. But that program ended on July 31, and economists from across the spectrum are warning that we are headed for disaster unless Congress acts. Last week,JPMorgan Chase released a study showing the extra $600 propped up and spurred consumer spending, while warning that delays in processing benefits could cause a drop in spending bigger than the 2008 Great Recession and significantly shrink our economy. After talks broke down and the White House issued empty executive orders, JPMorgan followed up its study with another dire warning toCongressthat it must act soon. The National Bureau of Economic Research agrees, saying failure to reach a deal will lead to a 44% drop in local spending. Even if the benefit is reduced to $400, we’d see a steep drop we ca not afford (and for most, Trump is executive orders will never deliver a single dollar). And these awful projections might be best-case assessments. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) shows the spending generated by that extra $600is supporting 5 million jobs. If the dollars disappear, so will the jobs they support. Millions of workers ca not make ends meet even with the $600. One in three Americansis behind on housing payments, and30 million to 40 million people face eviction in the coming months. Without a deal in Congress, those numbers will skyrocket. It is utter nonsense that enhanced benefits are keeping people out of the workforce. Tens of millions of workers are competing for far fewer jobs than were available just six months ago. For every job available, there are five people looking for work—and those few jobs are now in jeopardy too. Letting the enhanced benefits lapse is far from the only thing that will cause massive job loss. State and local governments are facing huge shortfalls, and begging Congress for help. Without it, the re is another huge unemployment wave coming. How big a wave? EPI is research estimates5.3 million critical public workers will lose their jobs over the next 18 months without a major federal investment in our state and local governments to keep public transportation going, rural hospitals open, teachers educating, and sanitation workers doing their jobs. It takes a pretty big crisis to see unions, economists, and corporations calling for the same outcomes. Now add in Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, who practically begged Congress to extend the$600 benefit and fill the gaps in state and local budgets. All of these numbers are predicated on the economy staying about where it is, but that is no guarantee. As coronavirus case numbers remain staggeringly high,consumer spending is dropping again and businesses that reopened may be forced to close again. Much of the money Congress allotted for the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) is spent and gone, even as millions of small businesses struggle to stay afloat. If Congress acts to maintain the $600 benefit, provide aid to state and local governments, revamp the PPP, and extend the Payroll Support Program, we can save more than 10 million jobs, while preventing millions of unemployed people from falling into total crisis. Throw out everything you have learned about how the economy works. We have never faced a situation like this. The cost of letting our economy go into a free fall is far greater than the cost of protecting jobs and keeping people safe while we fight the COVID-19 pandemic. As we stand on the precipice of a second Great Depression, we ca not afford to go small. When the virus surges again, more jobs will disappear. Without real relief, there will be nothing to slow our descent this time. FromUS Postal Serviceworkers to educators to sanitation workers to bartenders to flight attendants, working people are looking to Congress to take action for our jobs. I know the re is broad support across parties for reaching a deal today. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can agree with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a relief bill, we can save millions of jobs, fight the coronavirus, and prevent years of suffering. But the time to act is running out.",1,2,Fortune

The threatened evictions fueled protests and clashes in the run up to last month is 11-day Gaza war and pose a test for Israel is new governing coalition, which includes three pro-settler parties but is hoping to sideline the Palestinian issue to avoid internal divisions. Israeli police and border officials said they arrested four suspects in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. It was unclear who started the brawl. The officials said someone launched fireworks at police forces and residents' houses and that 'œseveral Molotov cocktails were thrown and stones were thrown.'ť One woman was reportedly injured when she was hit in the back by a stone, police said. The Red Crescent emergency service said its crews treated 20 Palestinians, including 16 suffering from pepper spray and tear gas and others wounded by rubber-coated bullets. Two other people were wounded, including an elderly man who was hit in the head, it said. The Red Crescent said settlers threw stones at one of its ambulances and Israeli forces sprayed skunk water on a second ambulance belonging to the service. The eruption of violence is the latest friction in Sheikh Jarrah, where weeks of unrest captured international attention ahead of the 11-day Israel-Hamas war last month. The cease-fire took effect on May 21, but the long-running campaign by Jewish settlers to evict dozens of Palestinian families continues. And so the cycle of tension endures, in a stark early test for Israel is new coalition government, which is just over a week old. At the helm under a rotation agreement is Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the right-wing Yamina party. In two years, he will be replaced by Yair Lapid, leader of centrist Yesh Atid. And leading the opposition is Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, ousted from the premiership after holding the post for 12 years. An intervention by Israel is attorney general at the height of the unrest has put the most imminent evictions on hold. But rights groups say evictions could still proceed in the coming months as international attention wanes, potentially igniting another round of bloodshed. The settlers have been waging a decades-long campaign to evict the families from densely populated Palestinian neighborhoods in the so-called Holy Basin just outside the walls of the Old City, in one of the most sensitive parts of east Jerusalem. Israel captured east Jerusalem, home to holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. Israel views the entire city as its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. The settlers say the homes are built on land that was owned by Jews prior to the 1948 war surrounding Israel is creation. Israeli law allows Jews to reclaim such property, a right denied to Palestinians who lost lands and homes in the same conflict.___Kellman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.",2,2,Daily Herald-Chicago

The researchers found even one presentation of a headline (such as “Donald Trump Sent His Own Plane to Transport 200 Stranded Marines”,based on claims shown to be false) was enough to increase belief in its content. This effect persisted for at least a week, was still found when headlines were accompanied by a fact check warning, and even when participants suspected it might be false. Repeated exposure can increase the sense that misinformation is true. Repetition creates the perception of group consensus that can result in collective misremembering, a phenomenon called theMandela Effect. It might be harmless when people collectively misremember something fun, such as a childhood cartoon (did the Queen in Disney is Snow White really NOT say “Mirror, mirror…”?). But it has serious consequences when a false sense of group consensus contributes to rising outbreaks of measles. Scientists have investigated whether targeted misinformation can promote healthy behaviour. Dubbed false-memory diets, it is said that false memories of food experiences can encourage people to avoid fatty foods,alcoholand even convince them to love asparagus. Creative people that have a strong ability to associate different words are especially susceptible to false memories. Some people might be more vulnerable than others to believe fake news, but everyone is at risk. Biasis how our feelings and world view affect the encoding and retrieval of memory. We might like to think of our memory as an archivist that carefully preserves events, but sometimes it is more like a storyteller. Memories are shaped by our beliefs and can function to maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record. An example of this is selective exposure, our tendency to seek information that reinforces our pre-existing beliefs and to avoid information that brings those beliefs into question. This effect is supported by evidence that television news audiences are overwhelmingly parti sanand exist in their own echo chambers. It was thought that online communities exhibit the same behaviour, contributing to the spread of fake news, but this appears to be a myth. Political news sites are often populated by people with diverse ideological background sand echo chambers are more likely to exist in real life than online. Our brains are wired to assume things we believe originated from a credible source. But are we more inclined to remember information that reinforces our beliefs?This is probably not the case. People who hold strong beliefs remember things that are relevant to their beliefs but they remember opposing information too. This happens because people are motivated to defend their beliefs against opposing views. Belief echoes are a related phenomenon that highlight the difficulty of correcting misinformation. Fake news is often designed to be attention-grabbing. It can continue to shape people is attitudes after it has been discredited because it produces a vivid emotional reaction and builds on our existing narratives. Corrections have a much smaller emotional impact, especially if they require policy details, so should be designed to satisfy a similar narrative urge to be effective. The way our memory works means it might be impossible to resist fake news completely. Read more:How to help kids navigate fake news and misinformation onlineBut one approach is to start thinking like a scientist. This involves adopting a questioning attitude that is motivated by curiosity, and being aware of personal bias. For fake news, this might involve asking ourselves the following questions:Many people rely on social media and aggregators as their main source of news. By reflecting on whether information is news, opinion or even humour, this can help consolidate information more completely into memory. Paying attention to where information is published is crucial for encoding the source of information into memory. If something is a big deal, a wide variety of sources will discuss it, so attending to this detail is important. Reflecting on who benefits from you believing the content helps consolidate the source of that information into memory. It can also help us reflect on our own interests and whether our personal biases are at play. Some peoplet end to be more susceptible to fake news because they are more accepting of weak claims. But we can strive to be more reflective in our open-mindedness by paying attention to the source of information, and questioning our own knowledge if and when we are unable to remember the context of our memories.

But owners shuttered it this May Jess Anderson, brand and public relations director for Oxford Commons, the Florida group that owned the restaurant, said ""it was not sustainable"" for the Alexander Brown to be closed for such a long period of time. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Wednesday ordered city restaurants to suspend indoor dining by the end of the week and announced expanded requirements for face coverings. Young, a Democrat, is among a group of local leaders pushing for Maryland Governor Larry Hogan to take statewide action and renew certain dining restrictions in an attempt to curb the recent spike in coronavirus cases. The city is now moving ahead on its own.“I have always said we would continue to monitor the data and not hesitate to tighten restrictions if the data tell us it is needed,” Young said in a virtual news conference following the weekly Board of Estimates meeting Wednesday. Baltimore restaurants and bars will be required to suspend indoor dining for at least two weeks, starting at 5 p.m. Friday. The city health department will review COVID-19 data daily to monitor whether the suspension will continue after that period. Eateries can continue serving customers outside and offering takeout and delivery. The city will also require all people over the age of 2 to wear face coverings in public, Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said. But the health commissioner clarified that the mask order applies to outdoor situations in which people are unable to social distance, like a cookout or a barbecue.“When you are walking your dog and are not around people, no mask is required,” she said. In a grim irony, the end of indoor dining coincides with the start of Baltimore Restaurant Week, a semiannual event meant to boost revenues at restaurants. A spokesman for organizer the Downtown Partnership said in a statement that the event would still happen but be limited to outdoor dining and carryout meals. One business scheduled to participate was CookHouse, a Bolton Hill bistro that opened in February, just one month before it closed for COVID-19.“It is very challenging, as you probably can imagine,” said owner George Dailey. On the plus side, the restaurant has a patio, where staff will continue to serve its smash burgers and steak frit es after Friday. Many guests already preferred to eat al fresco. “Outside, people are happy, so we are just going to continue this way, weather permitting.”The limitation on outdoor dining falls in line with what many public health experts have been recommending. On Monday, health officials from the state is five largest counties wrote Maryland is deputy health secretary urging a stop to indoor dining in bars and restaurants. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a former state health secretary and Baltimore city health commissioner, praised Young is decision as “a sensible action to make sure Baltimore does not turn into the next Miami or Houston.” Both cities have seen recent surges in cases since reopening. He said there is strong evidence that bars in particular pose a very high risk for transmission. Others felt independent restaurants have been unfairly singled out among businesses.“People are all right going to Target, Walmart and grocery stores,” said Chris Amendola, chef and owner of Foraged, a “hyper-seasonal eatery” in Hampden. On a recent foraging expedition, he witnessed a group of 200 or so people splashing in the Patapsco, none wearing masks. “Restaurants are not the problem,” he said. Like many business owners, Amendola faces an uncertain future, having already spent loans received through the federally funded Paycheck Protection Program. “I do not even know what to do anymore.”Foraged had been offering indoor dining at half capacity since the city began allowing it last month, a move he said had been allowing the business to stay afloat. Without it, he is limited to three outdoor tables — and few of his guests are eager to eat outside in the heat. Mother is Grille owner Dave Rather supported Young is decision to shut down indoor dining. “It is something we need to do in this city even though it hurts,” he said. “We all gotta do our part.”The restaurant in Federal Hill had already stopped offering indoor dining last weekend given the rise in COVID-19 cases among industry workers in the area. Several Canton bars and restaurants shut down amid a spike in cases there. Rather declined to say whether members of his staff had tested positive. Restaurants are not legally required to shut down when an employee tests positive, a fact some have said contributes to the spread of the virus. In Baltimore, the average daily case count nearly doubled in the week between July 4 and July 12, after the city transitioned into a second phase of its reopening plan, Dzirasa said. The city is conducting an average of over 2,000 COVID-19 tests daily, the health commissioner said. The jump in cases is greater than what officials expected to see simply from increases in testing capacity. The 21224 ZIP code alone, which includes neighborhoods such as Canton, Highlandtown, and Patterson Park, has seen cumulative positivity rates as high as 22% among city residents, she said. People between ages 20 and 39 have had the highest rates of new cases and the highest test positivity rates. Fatalities have remained somewhat steady. The city is actions regarding masks are similar to those taken Tuesday byBaltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. But while Olszewski called on Hogan, a Republican, to limit indoor dining statewide, the Democratic county executive said he would not issue a local restriction for restaurants because of concerns about how it would impact businesses. Dzirasa said in an interview that the city is demographics are different from the county is, and a local suspension on indoor dining makes sense in Baltimore.“We need to be extremely mindful of how the city is set up, and the density of bars and restaurants, compared to other jurisdictions,” she said. Olszewski, meanwhile, “continues to believe that a unified, statewide approach is the best way to ensure public health efforts are most effective,” said Sean Naron, a spokesman for Olszewski. The county executive also believes a statewide approach will minimize confusion for residents and will avoid putting small businesses at a competitive disadvantage.“If the governor does not act, we will continue conversations with neighboring jurisdictions and do what is best for our residents,” Naron said. Dzirasa said the city would be looking for its case counts to go down “significantly” before considering lifting new restrictions. She is hopeful that Hogan will heed the advice of local health officials and institute statewide restrictions on dining. Some business owners, like Rather, who operates branches of Mother is in Baltimore and Anne Arundel counties, think it is just a matter of time. But Hogan said Wednesday he does not plan to tighten restrictions.“We do not intend to suddenly close all of our small businesses,” he said in a press conference. “We do not want to crush our economy.”The total number of coronavirus cases in Marylandsurpassed the 80,000 mark Wednesday, with state health officials reporting 627 new cases of the illness. The rise brings Maryland is infection total to 80,172 confirmed cases. While Hogan acknowledged “concerning trends” of high positivity rates among people under 35 as well as an up tick in recent COVID hospitalizations, he said the solution was stricter enforcement by local governments of social distancing guidelines. And he encouraged individuals to continue wearing masks when supporting local businesses: “No shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service. It is really not that hard.”Baltimore Sun reporter Wilborn P Nobles III contributed to this article.",2,2,Baltimore Sun

Calling the legislation an effort to impose “unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote”—particularly for Black voters—the plaintiffs accused Georgia Republicans of acting in direct response to former President Donald Trump is stunning campaign to undo Joe Biden is 2020 victory in the state. The voting law has attracted national attention, as well as fierce condemnation from Democrats. Georgia Republicans—much like Republicans in other states where brazen voting restrictions have been introduced—have characterized the law as an attempt to prevent illegal voting, despite longstanding evidence that voter fraud is a largely nonexistent problem.“None of the bill is burdensome and discriminatory changes to Georgia is election code will increase the public is confidence in the state is election administration or ensure election integrity,” the lawsuit, announced byMarc Elias, the prominent election lawyer, argues. “Rather, the grab bag of voting restrictions that populate SB 202 make clear that the Bill was animated by an impermissible goal of restricting voting.”The three groups—the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Stacey Abrams, the Black Voters Matter Fund, and Rise—objected to a wide range of provisions in the bill, including a ban on non-poll workers distributing water to voters waiting in line and restrictions on the use of absentee drop boxes. And as my colleagueAri Berman writes, the “major power grab” would give the state board of elections sweeping powers “to take over county election boards it views as underperforming, raising the possibility that elections officials appointed by and beholden to the heavily gerrymandered Republican legislature could take over election operations in Democratic strongholds like Atlanta is Fulton County, where Trump and his allies spread conspiracy the ories about ‘suitcases’ of ballots being counted by election officials in November after GOP poll monitors had left.”Biden, in his first White House news conference on Thursday, slammed Republican voter suppression efforts as “sick.”",2,1,Mother Jones
197,More infectious UK  isuper-covid' variant could be dominant in the US by MARCH,0.0,51.33,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9152539/More-transmissible-UK-coronavirus-variant-10-U-S-states-CDC-says.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"The more infectious UK  isuper-covid' variant could become dominant in the US by March, triggering massive surges in coronavirus cases, the CDC warns. Already, at least 95 people in 15 states have detected cases of the highly contagious B117 variant, according to DailyMail.com tracking (the CDC has only documented 76 in 12 states). The variant quickly became dominant in the UK, where it was first detected, and triggered the nation is strictest lock downs yet. CDC experts declined to predict just how many more cases and deaths the variant will lead to in the US But it is thought to be up to twice as infectious, and 'a higher rate of transmission will lead to more cases, increasing the number of persons overall who need clinical care, exacerbating the burden on an already strained health care system, and resulting in more deaths,' they wrote in a Friday report. If it continues to infect 1.1 people for every one person who catches the new UK  isuper-covid' variant, the more infectious form of coronavirus (light purple) will be dominant by March and increase daily cases of the new variant to nearly 50 per 100,000, the CDC estimatesThe UK variant is not itself thought to be more deadly and early lab studies suggest vaccines will provide protection against it. Meanwhile, similar new threats are emerging across the globe. Scientists are concerned that variants from Brazil and South Africa may evade vaccines. They have not yet been reported in the US, but with only spotty testing for variants they may already been. And the US now has three homegrown variants of its own. All three are suspected to be more infectious than currently more common variants, and one is virtually identical to the UK variant. Utah and Illinois each reported their first cases of the UK variant on Friday. It has also been reported by health departments in:It quickly spread to a cluster in California - which has a cluster of 32, plus two other cases there - and there are now at least 22 cases in Florida. In the absence of vaccines, the UK variant could push daily case rates past 80 per capitaThe variant is rapid spread will increase the burden on health resources at a time when infections are surging, further sapping strained healthcare resources and increasing the need for better adherence to mitigation strategies, such as social-distancing and mask-wearing, the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease. It also increases the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve protective herd immunity to control the pandemic, the CDC said. Dr Anthony Fauci has said that herd immunity could be reached if between 70 and 85 percent of the population is vaccinated against or has had COVID-19. Vaccine rollout has been painstakingly slow in the US Just 11.9 million Americans have had their first doses. The threat of new variants should add to the urgency of vaccination - but the US has already burned through its stockpile of jabs. In the span of less than 24 hours this week, US scientists reported three homegrown  isuper-covid' variants - and experts say the world should brace for many more, emerging in countries all over the world. And the more people get coronavirus, the more of these highly infectious variants will emerge, scientists believe. Scientists the orize that  isuper-covid' variants are only going to become more common as case numbers surge across the globe, because the more cases there are, the greater the number of people with rare, chronic infections will be - and these cases offer a unique opportunity for new, stronger COVID-19 variants to evolve.'My (highly speculative!) hypothesis is that the emergence of these variant viruses arises in cases of chronic infection during which the immune system places great pressure on the virus to escape immunity and the virus does so by getting really good at getting into cells,' wrote Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center scientist Dr Trever Bradford wrote in a Thursday Twitterthread. Weaker immune systems allow the virus to stay in the body for a longer time, during which the immune system keeps fighting it. Duking it out with the immune system teaches the virus how to stick around better. Dr Bedford is not the only one who thinks so.'The up tick in mutations [we are seeing] is expected because there is more circulation of the virus, and more chances for a mutation to occur,' Dr Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist with the University of Washington is Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation told DailyMail.com. And when people are infected for a long time, 'it is giving the virus an opportunity to mutate within the same host,' Dr Mokdad explained. Researchers say the variant first began spreading rapidly in late June and early July, coinciding with the second wave of the virus in the US He says scientists suspect that that is how the UK variant, B117, arose: 'A person who was infected for 12 days was the one who started this whole thing,' though that theory is yet to be confirmed. The more infectious B117 variant has become dominant in the UK Similar variants have cropped up in South Africa, Brazil and the US Now, the US has two other variants. So far, they all appear to likely be more infectious, but not more deadly. Scientists think vaccines will work against the m, but that is the key question still looming over them.'That is why this debate of cutting the dose [of vaccines] or only giving the first dose is very, very dangerous' Dr Mokdad says.'You want [a vaccine] to knock down the virus very, very low. We do not want to get this virus used to something in small doses so the virus can develop immunity, we want to make sure that when the virus comes into contact with these immune antibodies, it loses every time, and fast.'As cases have surged in countries including Brazil (pictured), there have been more chances for the virus to mutate because more infections means a greater number of chronic cases that give the virus ample time to learn how to better infect humans, experts speculate. One of several more infectious  isuper-covid' variants emerged in BrazilBetween November 1 and December 31, the variant made up nearly 50% of all US genomes sequenced (right)Chronic COVID-19 infections - not to be confused with 'long-covid,' symptoms that may linger months after someone clears the virus - may last weeks or even months, and most commonly affect people with weak immune systems. A team from SouthernIllinoisUniversity Carbondale traced the earliest appearance of new variant, called 20C-US, toTexasin May 2020. The variant carries several mutations, including to the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter and infect human cells. Scientists say the variant has not spread significantly beyond the country is borders, and that is most highly prevalent in the Upper Midwest. What is more, it could be responsible for at least 50 percent of all American cases, meaning it is very widespread. The researchers predict that 20C-US may be the most dominant variant of the coronavirus in the US at this moment.20C-US is now one of the growing list of mutations discovered in countries such as the UK, South Africa and Brazil. The news comes just one day after Ohio researchers announced the first discovery of two homegrown variants - one virtually identical to a variant that emerged in the UK and the other completely unique to the US and dominant in the capital of Columbus. The results were published in a pre-print article onbioRxiv.orgon Wednesday. Led by Dr Keith Gagnon, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at SIU, the team first noticed the possibility of the new variant while looking at genome sequencing data from Illinois.'We were just looking at our local, like state-specific Illinois data...and we were asked [by the Illinois Department of Public Health] to specifically look for the spike protein mutations of the UK variant for example,' he told DailyMail.com.'As we are going through the data, we are not seeing a UK variant but I keep seeing this large outbranching off the final genetic tree that we reconstructed.'Of the viral genome samples taken from March to the present that were sequenced, one variant was more pronounced than the rest. The variant has not spread significantly beyond US borders and is most highly prevalent in the Upper Midwest (above)Despite being more widespread, the virus does not appear to more deadly, just more transmissibleThe US now has three of its own homegrown  isuper-covid' variants that are more infectious than the most common coronavirus types in the US - and the new variants are spreading like wildfire in at least one state. Two variants were identified by Ohio scientists on Wednesday and the third by Illinois researchers on Thursday. One of the new, more infectious variants has already become dominant in Columbus, Ohio, where it was discovered. So far, this homegrown variant has been seen in about 20 samples since Ohio State University (OSU) scientists first detected it in December. It is now present in most of the samples they are sequencing. A second variant has mutations virtually identical to the UK variant is, but arose completely independently on American soil, according to Ohio State University scientists. Just one person with this variant has been found. The third new variant was discovered by a team from Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The earliest appearance of new variant, called 20C-US, was traced back to Texas in May 2020. It began picking up prevalence in late June and early July 2020 and could be responsible for up to 50% of all current cases. To see if it was present at the the national level, researchers randomly subsampled 3.3 percent of US genomes available on the global genomic database GISAID The earliest appearance was found from a sample taken in the greater Houston area of Texas on May 20, 2020.'The crazy thing is it is been around for months, I would say largely unnoticed, uncharacterized,' Gagnon said.'It was not that it was not undetected...but nobody I think really picked up on it.'Following the variant over time, there was a notable expansion in the variant is presence in late June and early July 2020, which coincides with America is second wave of the pandemic, in states such as Wisconsin and Illinois. However, between November 1 and December 31, almost 50 percent of all sequenced genomes from the US are the new variant.'It is coincidental that the rise to dominance of this variant really started at the end of the summer and especially during the third pandemic wave,' Gagnon said.'It is tempting to speculate that possibly this variant is playing a role. The circumstantial evidence suggests that.'Researchers suggest this means 20C-US has  isurpassed 50 percent penetrance to become the most dominant variant in the US'However, it has a high prevalent in the eastern and Midwestern regions and has not spread widely to the western half of the US20C-US has been reported in other countries including Australia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, but at low levels. The first mutations the virus showed were in genes related to virus particle maturation - a process by which a virus breaks from a host cell and activates to infect more cells - and the processing of viral proteins. Gagnon says these are all important for virus production. Since the n, the new variant has formed two new mutations in the spike protein, which demonstrates that it is evolving. However, the variant does not appear to be more deadly.'Even more speculative, but interesting, is we notice that the death rates are a lot lower even though cases are very high,' Gagnon said. This may suggest 20C-USis highly transmissible but only causes a mild illness. Dr Daniel Jones, of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, who discovered the Columbus variant told DailyMail.com the Illinois variant 'looks closely related but not exactly identical.'Jones said this means the two sets of researchers - in Ohio and Illinois - are likely tracking variants from the same outgrowth. With the first doses of newly approved vaccines being administered across the national, Gagnon said it is unknown whether the variant will impact its effectiveness.'Based on the mutations so far, I do not think it will significantly impact the vaccine is effectiveness,' he said.'The catch is that the virus continues to evolve, and since May, it has acquired three mutations, and two of them are in the spike protein, one of which might affect antibody binding. There are a lot of unknowns.'Both Pfizer and Moderna have been testing their vaccines against the international variants and say they expect the jabs to provide protection.",2,1,Daily Mail
198,Consumers get online tool to check nursing home vaccine data,-0.33,43.0,https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-medicaid-nursing-homes-94a2d81e805f18990e75cbb14345f530,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-21,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Families and patients have a new online tool to compare COVID-19 vaccination rates among nursing homes, Medicare announced Tuesday, addressing complaints from consumer groups and lawmakers that the critical data had been too difficult to find. The information is now being made available through the “Care Compare” feature at Medicare.gov, the online tool for basic research on quality and safety issues at nursing homes. Consumers will be able to compare up to three nursing homes at the same time, and the web page shows vaccination rates for residents and staff, as well as national and state averages.“We want to give people a new tool to visualize this data to help them make informed decisions,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement. Nursing home residents are a tiny proportion of the US population, but they have borne a crushing burden from the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for more than 150,000 deaths, or roughly 1 in 5. Nationally, about 84% of residents are now vaccinated, which has slowed —but not totally prevented— the spread of the delta variant among frail patients. Nursing home staffers are the bigger concern, since only about 64% are vaccinated, roughly the same share as the adult population. The virus commonly gets into facilities via staffers who have been exposed in nearby communities and unwittingly pass the infection on to residents. Medicare has been posting vaccination information online for months, but it was on a site designed for researchers and industry. One way to navigate it involved accessing a huge spreadsheet. Another approach called for hunting around on a map for little red dots that represented nursing homes. The statistics reveal big disparities in vaccination rates among states, and sometimes wide differences within states and communities. Among the organizations complaining were Consumer Voice, which advocates for quality improvement in long-term care, and the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a watchdog group. Their concerns were echoed by two senior Democratic lawmakers, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Citing anAssociated Press report on breakthrough infections among nursing home residents, the two lawmakers urged Medicare to move quickly. Wyden chairs the Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, and Casey heads the Aging Committee. The new online tool reminds consumers comparing facilities that higher percentages of vaccinated residents and staff “are better.” Information on COVID-19 vaccination rates is available just below each nursing home is ratings. The data reflect the latest reported by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Medicare officials say they are encouraged that even as the delta variant has swept across the country, outbreaks in nursing homes have not raced out of control as happened last year. They attribute that to the high rate of residents who have gotten their shots. Nursing home residents are expected to be top on the priority for booster shots as they become available. The nursing home industry says it fully supports vaccination of staffers and residents, but that Medicare should also publish vaccine levels for hospitals and other medical care settings.",1,2,AP

Democrats calling the mselves progressives are more inclined to defend Assange – sort of – on the ground that his imminent prosecution represents an attack on journalistic freedom that may make it difficult for the media to publish classified documents like those contained in the Pentagon Papers. More legalistic progressives are not so sure about this, since they consider classified info OK so long as it has been “sanitized” to avoid exposing intelligence agents, but obtaining the info by hacking into a government computer not ok: i.e., a crime. What neither camp wants totalk about, however, is whether it is ok to break securities laws in order to expose the American Empire is war plans, errors, and misdeeds. Thus, my earlier question: why is lawbreaker Martin Luther King, Jr. a hero and lawbreaker Julian Assange a villain? Intelligent people whom I have asked about this give the most convoluted and irrelevant answers! “Dr. King never threatened American security the way Assange did.” “Dr. King submitted to arrest, but Assange fled to the security of an embassy.” “King loved his enemies, but Assange hates America.”The assumption disguised by these rather scholastic distinctions is that Martin attacked an obviously evil system – American institutional racism – while Julian only attacked . . . the American Empire. So if you do not want to admit that the empire is evil (or even that it exists), you talk about national security or journalistic freedom or something. Anything but imperialist warmaking. Dr. King himself did not make that mistake. What he finally came to understand was that racism, the oppression of the poor, and empire-building are co-dependent, interrelated diseases that can only be cured by strenuous efforts to heal all three conditions simultaneously. He called this a “revolution of values.” On April 4, 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, he delivered an address called “Beyond Vietnam” that contained these lines:A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war, “This way of settling differences is not just.” This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation is homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. Anation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. []I think there is not the slightest question that, were he alive, Dr. King would applaud the sort of civil disobedience that exposes the empire is secrets to the world and makes people aware of the crimes and errors committed in places like the Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons, the battlefields of Iraq, and the drone-infested provinces of Afghanistan. Julian Assange is no saint, and neither was Martin Luther King. They were very different personalities, to be sure. But both put their “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor” on the line in order to expose the inhumanity, violence, and lies of the powerful elites that rule the globe. On the scale of human values, both ranked Truth and Justice well ahead of Obedience to Authority. Listen, Schumer and the rest of you! If you honor Martin, you must also honor Julian. And if you do not understand why this is true, what is the difference between you and Trump? If the US government succeeds in extraditing Assange, let is get ready to celebrate his arrival with a protest recalling the 1963 March on Washington. It is what King would have done.

According to theBritanica website, critical race theory is an ""intellectual movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinct subgroups of human beings but a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color.""Although it has been a staple of law schools since the 1970s, the theory has come to the education mainstream due to changes in the way some view gender and items like The New York Times ""1619 Project,"" which claims the country is founding was based more in the slave trade and ""white supremacy"" more than an effort to create an egalitarian society. Educators and the unions that represent them argue these ""darker"" moments of American history have been whitewashed in the past and need to be taught to present the most accurate picture of the country. Opponents, including conservatives and newly formed parent organizations, say the material is too divisive and ends up indoctrinating children to a more far left-wing view of America. Suburban districts, like Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, have gained national prominence following contentious board of education meetings with advocates on both sides speaking out. Parents and others are seeking the recall of board members for absorbing the controversial theory into the district is policies and curriculum, while the board denies it is teaching the theory to students. Several state sare currently considering legislation to ban teaching the theory or its application in classrooms throughout the country. Recently, American Federation of Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten compared the battle to the1925 ""Scopes Trial""where a teacher was tried for teaching evolution to students in Tennessee.""We are looking at court actions because these laws conflict with standards and our licensure requirements and our professional obligations,"" Weingarten, leader of the country is second largest teacher is union, said. She denied members of her union are teaching the theory.""Let is be clear: critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools,"" she said. ""It is a method of examination taught in law school and college that helps analyze whether systemic racism exists — and whether it has an effect on law and public policy. But culture warriors are labeling any discussion of race, racism or discrimination as CRT to try to make it toxic. They are bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching students accurate history.""Delegates from the largest union, the National Education Association, said they would expand teaching ""anti-racism and diversity"" in classrooms, and said it has set aside several million dollars to defend members in court for teaching ""accurate"" history. It is also asking members to ""fight back"" against the anti-critical race theory movement, saying in a statement that ""it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed"" by critical race theory.",1,0,Newsmax
201,The First Rule of Gun Safety is That You Do not Point a Gun Directly at Someone Unless You Intend to Shoot Them,8.33,35.0,https://townhall.com/columnists/johnrlottjr/2021/10/25/the-first-rule-of-gun-safety-is-that-you-dont-point-a-gun-directly-at-someone-unless-you-intend-to-shoot-them-n2597959,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-10-25,25,"The first rule of gun safety is you do not point a gun a something unless you intend to shoot it. Even if you believe the gun is unloaded, you do not point it directly at others. Alec Baldwin did not follow basic gun safety when he accidentally shot his cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, 42. Anyone who has been to a shooting range would have that drilled into them. And Baldwin, an actor who has been in many movies using guns, must surely have had this explained to him many times. Since the killing, numerous news stories have come out blaming others on the set for unsafe practices. Headlines read: “Armorer on Alec Baldwin is ‘Rust’ set once admitted to being ‘nervous’ about abilities,” “Alec Baldwin assistant director had history of unsafe practices, prop maker says,” “‘Rust’ crew describes on-set gun safety issues and misfires days before fatal shooting,” or “Assistant Director Declared Gun Safe Before Alec Baldwin Fatally Fired It, Affidavit Says.”But these are lame attempts to protect Baldwin from criminal charges. And that is true despite there being no doubt that Baldwin is genuinely sorry about this tragedy. Indeed, as news reports indicate, he was undoubtedly “inconsolable.” but that does not help him either. Reports in the New York Postindicatethat union representatives say the gun Baldwin fired contained a live round. But even if a staffer told Baldwin that the gun was unloaded, the first rule of gun safety ultimately makes the accident Baldwin is responsibility. Baldwin was the one who pointed the gun at Hutchins and pulled the trigger. Baldwin obviously never had the intent to kill Hutchins, but if you drive a car recklessly and kill someone, you are still liable for negligent manslaughter. The fact that you deeply regret the accident is completely irrelevant. If they had only observed the proper caution to begin with, the death would have been avoided. For involuntary manslaughter, the prosecution has to show that Baldwin engaged in a lawful but dangerous act and did not act with due caution. A classic example of involuntary manslaughter would be someone shooting a gun into the air while in a crowded place, and a stray bullet accidentally kills a person. The person was not even aiming the gun at someone, but they are still responsible. These actions are reckless, negligent, and criminal, but they lack intent. In New Mexico, involuntary manslaughter is still a felony, and it is punishable by up to 18 months in prison and up to $5,000 in fines. On top of that, Baldwin was the film is executive producer, and he had additional control of the situation and responsibility. Saying that you killed someone because you hired an incompetent staffer, especially if the above headlines of previous problems occurring prove accurate, is not going to offer you much protection. Imagine what liberal Democrat Alec Baldwin would say if a CEO of a major company that resulted in people is deaths tried to defend himself by saying he was just relying on statements from those underneath him?People on social media are zeroing in on Baldwin is past unsympathetic statements about others. One that has gotten a lot of attention is a Tweet where Baldwin attacked a Huntington Beach police officer for “wrongfully kill[ing] someone.” The officer was in a struggle with a suspect, and the suspect had just grabbed from the officer is belt. Even the Los Angeles Times is more sympathetic to the officer, with the headline: “Video showing Huntington Beach officer fatally shooting suspect outside 7-Eleven does not tell whole story, police say.”Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen different standards of justice for Republicans and Democrats. It is still too early to judge this case, but I suspect most people would already be under arrest if they did what Baldwin did.",1,0,Townhall
202,"Hotel owners facing ‘unprecedented wave’ of foreclosures, group says",6.17,39.67,https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/hotel-owners-facing-unprecedented-wave-of-foreclosures-group-says-2098392/?itm_source=parsely-api,https://adfontesmedia.com/las-vegas-review-journal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,24,"Hotel owners are facing an “unprecedented wave” of foreclosures without federal help with commercial debt relief, according to a Tuesday letter from the industry to Congress. Nearly 1 in 4 hotels were at least a month late on their mortgage loan payments as of July, the highest figure on record, according to a recent report released by analysis firm Trepp. Just 1.34 percent of hotels were in the same boat at the end of 2019, the report said. Industry watchers said that figure is alarming, if expected. Sahara Las Vegas Vice President of Sales Christopher Bond, Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association President Diane Gandy and Henderson-based Argento Hospitality Group Managing Director Paula Argento are among the 20 people from Nevada who signed the letter to Congress with nearly 4,000 others from across the country. A statement on behalf of Bond said he signed the letter as an individual member of the American Hospitality and Lodging Association, not as a representative of Sahara Las Vegas. Requests for comment from the Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association and others were not returned. The letter to Congress called for passage of the Helping Open Properties Endeavor Act, or HOPE Act, which is billed as helping to prevent commercial real estate foreclosures, specifically to borrowers of commercial mortgages. More jobs at riskA UNLV hospitality professor was surprised there were not more Nevada names on the letter given the state is economic reliance on tourism and the industry is unknown future.“This is a time where you need big brother helping you to keep the economy going,” said Mehmet Erdem, associate professor of hotel operations and technology. Low demand for travel means “thousands of hotels” will not be able to pay their mortgages and could be forced to close their doors for good, stated Chip Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association.“Tens of thousands of hotel employees will lose their jobs and small business industries that depend on these hotels to drive local tourism and economic activity will likely face a similar fate,” Rogers said. UNLV finance and gaming professor Toni Repetti is somewhat skeptical banks are itching to foreclose on hotels at a time when the re is unlikely to be much demand to buy it off their books.“If you do not know when your customer is going to come back, the n why would you buy a hotel?” she said. However, she said, hotel managers are asking Congress for help to protect the mselves from the possibility of foreclosure and keep on the thousands of people they employ.‘Writing on the wall’The HOPE Act would represent the first federal pandemic legislation with a real-estate focus and could provide a much-needed boost to the hotel industry, said Brendan Bussmann, partner at Global Market Advisors. Hotels in Nevada were forced to close for two months and many, upon reopening, are unable to operate as they did before the pandemic hit.“That is where I think the HOPE Act is goal is to try to fill that gap for those that (are) trying to recover and have been limited in their ability to recover because of current health and safety conditions,” Bussmann said. Few smaller or independent hotels, if any, have the savings to withstand zero income over the course of months, Bussmann said. Corporate-owned hotels may be better positioned to ride out “the tsunami that the industry has faced because of the pandemic,” but even they may not all be spared the possibility of shuttering, he said. Erdem said a large hotel on the Strip brings in most of its revenue from gaming, with assists from dining and drinking; smaller hotels do not have that luxury. They rely almost entirely on room revenue, and when there are no festivals, conventions or any of the other mass gatherings that draw people to Southern Nevada, they are not making any money. Foreclosures are an unfortunate reality on the horizon for some smaller hotels, he said. And it is more difficult to close and reopen than it is to stay open.“If this trend continues, I mean, the writing is on the wall,” he said. Erdem said he was unclear on specific details within the proposed HOPE Act. Passing the legislation through Congress and the president signing it into law poses its own challenges. Still, he said, “Anything they can do to keep people afloat, they should do it.”Contact Mike Shoro atmshoro@reviewjournal.comor 702-387-5290.

203,Scaled-back GOP aid package would write off $10 billion postal loan,3.0,45.67,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/08/18/senate-gop-to-counter-houses-postal-bill-with-broader-virus-aid-package/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,23,"A “skinny” version of coronavirus relief legislation that Senate Republicans are planning to roll out this week would turn a prior $10 billion loan to the US Postal Service into a grant if the agency is financial condition deteriorates. The provision is part of a broader 169-page draft bill that GOP leaders could introduce as early as Tuesday. It is intended as a counter to House Democrats’ bill to give the Postal Service $25 billion more to cover revenue losses, which they expect to vote on this Saturday. The draft Republican bill would also provide $300 in weekly unemployment insurance benefits through December 27 and pump an estimated $158 billion more into the popular small-business loan program that lapsed August 8. It would also:The measure obtained by CQ Roll Call was subject to change, but as written it would cancel the postal debt as provided in the March relief package if the agency dips below $8 billion in cash on hand. The Postal Service currently has around $15 billion in cash on hand, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Tuesday morning. House Democrats say the money they are set to add to separate postal legislation was recommended by the Postal Service is board of governors. Republicans argue that despite financial problems, the agency has enough money to operate normally through August 2021. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, under fire from Democrats and some Republicans, on Tuesday said he’d reverse several planned operational changes intended to save money, such as overtime pay restrictions, limits on post office hours and closure of mail processing facilities. Speaking to The Courier-Journal in his home state on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would not pass a postal-only bill. But he suggested that House passage of that measure could open up a discussion about broadening the scope to other virus-related relief provisions. The revised Senate GOP legislation will focus on the “most urgent” needs identified by the Republican conference, according to a source close to the leadership, including unemployment insurance and small-business loans. The draft bill leaves out numerous other measures introduced last month, including another round of $1,200 payments to individuals, employer tax credits and roughly half of a $306 billion emergency appropriations package. Money to build a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington is not included, nor is $8 billion for the Pentagon to procure various weaponry. The small-business funding package will enable a “second draw” on the Paycheck Protection Program for eligible firms that have suffered a 35 percent revenue loss over the same period a year ago. That is more generous than the measure unveiled last month by Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship ChairmanMarco Rubio, R-Fla., which required a 50 percent revenue decline. In addition, the revised package would drop plans to set aside nearly $58 billion in loan funds for a new program set up to aid seasonal businesses and firms in low-income areas, as well as $10 billion in assistance to firms that invest in small businesses. Instead, the entire $257.7 billion amount, offset by a $100 billion rescission of unused funds from the first round, would be for the existing PPP program. Republicans will argue that they are trying to provide more COVID-19 and postal aid while Democrats remain intransigent in the broader coronavirus relief negotiations. Democrats have previously said they objected to a “skinny” plan that does not deal comprehensively with pandemic-related economic and health care needs.“The Democrats had been saying, ‘We are not going to do anything piecemeal,’ and the n they are going to come back and do something piecemeal,” one GOP Senate aide said, referring to the House is stand-alone Postal Service bill. “In a way, it undercuts their argument.”The GOP aide said the Republican bill will not have “everything that House Democrats passed in their messaging bill, but it is a lot of what people need and it could actually get done and signed by the president if the Democrats are willing to cooperate on it.”The bill will not be formally introduced because the Senate is not in session. But it is being advanced as preparation for trying to reach a deal with House and Senate Democrats to pass a COVID-19 aid bill attached to a stopgap funding resolution in September. Unemployment insurance and state and local government aid are two of the thorniest sticking points dividing the parties on a broader relief bill. Democrats are pushing to renew the $600 weekly federal unemployment insurance add-on that expired last month. Senate Republicans initially offered $200 a week for the first couple of months, while the White House expressed openness to go as high as $400. President Donald Trump on August 8 moved to establish a system by which states could apply for up to $44 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to provide laid-off workers with a $300 weekly supplement. FEMA guidance this week said that the earliest most states would be able to distribute benefits is August 29 and that the money will cover only three weeks of initial benefits to ensure other states can get funding for which they are approved. And the money will last only as long as FEMA has enough to contend with potential natural disasters. The Senate GOP bill would enable state unemployment agencies to keep paying $300 a week through the end of the year. The Senate GOP offering would not provide any additional direct state and local government aid. A House relief package that passed in May would provide almost $1 trillion in state and local aid, several times the $150 billion figure that the White House has said it would support. Republicans also argue that direct education funds for states and localities would help address one of their biggest budgetary holes. Talks broke off last week, with Democrats demanding that Republicans agree to at least $2 trillion in a broader aid bill, or roughly twice the size of the initial Senate GOP package offered last month. Democrats said that was a major concession given the nearly $3.4 trillion size of their bill that passed the House in May Mnuchin and other administration officials have said the White House could not agree to a $2 trillion price tag in advance of restarting formal talks, arguing the various provisions should be negotiated on their own merits. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters on August 13 that Speaker Nancy Pelosi “wants a $2 trillion commitment from us” and “we are not going to give it.”",2,2,Roll Call

Football spared in Marion County — for now. It is up to you if we see it this fall. Marion County 'not yet ready to make decision' on fall contact sportsIt appeared contact sports in Marion County could be in peril. But after a video conference with Marion County superintendents, the plans changed, at least for now. Caine agreed to allow all sports to continue ""under current IHSAA guidelines"" for two or three weeks before deciding whether further action will be needed. If the October 1 plan is brought back and finalized, it would — at the very least — have a serious impact on scheduling and call into question whether those programs could compete in the Indiana High School Association postseason tournaments. The IHSAA football regular season is scheduled to kick off August 21, with sectional play set for October 23. Marion County has recorded more positive COVID-19 tests than any other county in the state. Marion County is 14,094 cases make up roughly 22% of all the state is cases. Lake County is second with 6,829 positives. On Wednesday, Illinois announced it was moving football, girls volleyball and boys soccer to the spring. As of Wednesday, there are 22 states that have delayed or moved fall sports seasons. Seven have announced no football for the fall. Athletic activity had already been suspended at North Central in Washington Township. The Washington Township school board voted 3-2 on July 13 to start school on July 30 with virtual learning instead of in-person classes and to suspend extracurricular activities, including sports, immediately due to concerns over an up tick in coronavirus cases in the state.

Under the new measures announced on Friday, about 28,000 sports facilities will also be closed, 63,000 academies known as cram schools will be shut down, 380,000 eateries will be unable to operate after 9pm after coffee shops will be limited to takeaway service. Seoul will be subject to a partial lock down for eight days from Sunday, although the latest measures stop short of the most stringent level three restrictions, which would ban meetings of 10 or more people. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun described level three restrictions as “the choice of last resort given the economic and social ripple effect”. Although Friday is 371 new cases represented a significant drop from Thursday is six-month high of 441, South Korea has now had 15 days in a row of at least 100 new infections daily.“More than 10 days have passed since we upgraded quarantine measures to level two, but it remains uncertain when we may see the positive results,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said. “This is the last chance for us to prevent the virus from spreading across the country [without moving to level three restrictions].“Level three restrictions will affect a much broader range of businesses and facilities than the measures we just announced and leave deep scars on the economy, livelihoods and daily life,” Park said.“I once again plead to the people of our country – for yourself and for us, please remain in the safe space that is your home. Avoid contacting other people.”Health workers have found it more difficult to contain the recent transmissions centred around the more densely populated capital, where clusters have been tied to churches, restaurants and schools. The country has added more than 4,300 infections to its caseload over the past 15 days, prompting concerns about overwhelming hospitals. Korea Centres for Disease Control director Jeong Eun-kyeong said predictions based on models suggest the country could possibly record daily increases of 800 or even 2,000 as early as next week if the viral spread cannot be contained.“If we fail to stop this trend, medical systems would collapse under exponential increases in infections,” Jeong said. Like other rich countries, Japan is signing multiple deals because some of the vaccines could fail in clinical trials or require more than one dose. Japan is on track to have 521 million doses of five different vaccines in 2021, compared with a population of 126 million. Recent deals include global arrangements with such drugmakers as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, as well as local deals with the likes of Shionogi & Co. Some critics contend that Japan is rush to secure supplies is driven largely by a political desire to show the world it is fully committed to the Games.“The plan is, hope for a miracle and the n capitalise on that miracle,” said Michael Cucek, a political science professor at Temple University Japan. “But the time frame for that is getting narrower and narrower.”Elsewhere, hundreds of masked protesters demonstrated in major Indian cities on Friday against a government plan to hold exams for millions of students during the pandemic, as the daily tally of infections hit a record.“Stop the exam during the pandemic,” read one placard carried by protesters in the eastern city of Kolkata, while others scuffled briefly with police in the western industrial city of Ahmedabad. More than 2.4 million students are set to take tests next week for admission to medical and engineering schools, which the federal government has declined to defer, despite growing pressure from students and opposition parties.“It is important that the government listens to students,” Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the opposition Congress party, said in a video on social media, as he urged no compromises on the safety of students. Usually held in April and May, the exams have already been postponed twice this year. But some students want another delay, for fear of rising infections as well as difficulty travelling to exam centres because of virus-linked curbs on transport and lock downs in some places. However, further delays risk costing students the academic year, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal told the newspaper. The latest daily tallies are the lowest in more than eight weeks, with a peak of 725 in early August. The latest death toll dropped to 12 from 23 on Thursday. Authorities want daily infections to fall at least to low double-digits before they would consider relaxing restrictions. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said: “We are clearly still trending in the right direction. ... It is not gotten below 100 yet, I do expect that to happen, if not over the weekend, the n by next week, if trends continue.”Tests confirmed infections among 3,003 people in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 165,887, the National Disaster Management Agency said on Friday. The death toll rose by 105 to 7,169, it said. Jakarta saw 869 people testing positive, while neighbouring West Java, where the industrial clusters are located, reported 526 new Covid-19 cases. On Thursday, Jakarta extended some social distancing measure to September 10 following the spurt in new infections. The capital remains one of the hot spots for Covid-19 with 36,213 in total infections.

On Friday, several more key advisers left the group in the wake of the previous day is scandalous reports. The organization fanned the flames by tweeting out what appeared to be private messages between a co-founder who left in a rancorous split and a journalist who was hoping to interview her. The Lincoln Project later deleted the tweet—which was cited by the ex-staffers as an example of retaliation. The controversy boiled over hours after reports that leaders of the Lincoln Project knew about sexual harassment allegations against co-founder John Weaver last summer, before they became public in January.

Weaver, who is married with two children, admitted his behavior was “inappropriate” but said he thought all the interactions were consensual. Weaver resigned, but the accusations did not end there. Last weekend, co-founder Jennifer Horn stepped down, citing what she said were Weaver is “grotesque and inappropriate behavior” and “longstanding deceptions.” The group responded by claiming she left after making financial demands including a $250,000 signing bonus. On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that leaders of the Lincoln Project learned about allegations against Weaver in the summer after a payroll employee emailed co-founder Ron Steslow—who the n reportedly shared it with corporate counsel Matthew Sanderson and other key figures and advocated for Weaver to be removed from the organization. Hours later, the group announced that it had hired a “best-in-class outside professional” to review claims of Weaver is abuse and what Lincoln Project leaders knew and when they knew it. The group said in a statement that stories about it were “filled with inaccuracies and incorrect information” but conceded in the same breath: “There is a central truth in all of them that must be reckoned with and that is John Weaver is appalling conduct and the abuse he inflicted on people.”It ended the statement saying that any employee bound by a non-disclosure agreement to withhold information about Weaver could request a release from such a contract. Subsequently, according to, several former employees went public to demand that the group is leadership free them from non-disclosure agreements so they could speak out about “harassment perpetrated by John Weaver that we experienced or witnessed” or to provide any other information “specific to the John Weaver harassment situation that would aid the press, public, and our donors…. ”The anonymous former employees called it “absurd, unreasonable and insensitive” for the group to suggest those seeking release from their NDAs simply contact “the organization accused of protecting the very predator at issue” to request it.“Additionally, given the Associated Press and reports on February 11, we lack any confidence in the organization is remaining leadership to properly handle our allegations of (or knowledge of) sexual harassment and sexual assault by John Weaver,” the letter said. Perhaps most damning, the former staffers said it was the “recent public behavior” of co-founder Steve Schmidt that had forced them to go public because they “do not feel safe” engaging with the group is leadership privately. They were referring to the tweet from the Lincoln Project that contained screen shots of a purported Twitter direct-message conversation between Horn, one of the organization is founding members, and Amanda Becker, a reporter for the political news site The 19th. After accusing Becker of “preparing to publish a smear job” with Horn is help, the group deleted the tweets (although they remain available via theInternet Archive.)The 19th is co-founder and CEO Emily Radshaw said the outlet had sent the Lincoln Project a list of questions for Becker is story just before the group tweeted the screenshots. Radshaw wrote, “We are not going to be bullied or intimidated out of pursuing critical journalism.”On Friday afternoon, Lincoln Project senior adviser Kurt Bardellaleft the group following the prior day is reporting by the AP,magazine, andThe New York Times. Conservative commentator Tom Nichols, who served as an unpaid adviser to the group, also announced his departure“as [Lincoln Project leaders] sort this out and decide their future direction and organization.”Former Reporter/EditorNews EditorGot a tip?

208,Dems renew questions about FBI background check of Kavanaugh,-0.33,45.67,https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-acd4945bda57be8c1d1c9ac43398b5f7,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Democrats are raising new concerns about the thoroughness of the FBI is background investigation ofSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaughafter the FBI revealed that it had received thousands of tips and had provided “all relevant” ones to the White House counsel is office. The FBI, responding to longstanding questions from Democrats, disclosed in a letter late last month that it had received more than 4,500 tips as it investigated the nominee is past following his 2018 nomination by President Donald Trump. The process was the first time that the FBI had set up a tip line for a nominee undergoing Senate confirmation, said an assistant FBI director, Jill Tyson, writing on behalf of Director Christopher Wray. A group of Democratic senators said in a letter to Wray dated Wednesday that his response “raises significant additional questions.” They called on him to explain, among other things, how many tips the FBI decided were relevant and what criteria agents used to make that determination and what policies and procedures were used to vet the tips. The senators also asked for more information about the tip line, including how it was staffed and how the tips were recorded or preserved.“Your letter confirms that the FBI is tip line was a departure from past practice and that the FBI was politically constrained by the Trump White House,” the senators wrote. Kavanaughwas confirmed to the Supreme Court in October 2018after a rancorous process in which claims emerged that he had sexually assaulted women three decades ago. He emphatically denied the allegations. The FBI conducted a original background investigation into Kavanaugh that consisted of interviews with 49 people over the course of five days, Wray said. The bureau the n did a supplemental background check after new information arose about a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when they were teens. As part of that process, Wray said, the FBI interviewed 10 people over six days. But, he stressed, the inquiry was limited in nature, without the “authorities, policies and procedures” that would be used for an FBI criminal investigation. Lawyers for Ford said in a statement that the FBI is letter established that the investigation was a “sham and a major institutional failure” and chastised the bureau for not interviewing Ford or acting on the thousands of tips it received about Kavanaugh.“Instead, it handed the information over to the White House, allowing those who supported Kavanaugh to falsely claim that the FBI found no wrongdoing,” said the lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks.

Sima primarily made clothes for retail clothing for Kohl is before she was terminated on June 23 with every other worker at her factory, who were there for less than a year. She is one of the thousands of factory garment workers in Bangladesh laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as clothing retailer corporations in the USs and Europe have canceled orders.“I ca not pay my house rent. I am having issues getting food for my family. This job was my only source of income,” Sima shared. “Because of COVID-19, work orders decreased, so the factory does not need that many workers. Some buyers did not pay bills on time. Others are asking for discounts while thousands of workers like myself are going to bed without food.”More than $3 billion worth of clothing orders in Bangladesh we recanceled due to the pandemic. The cancellations have impacted 2.28 million workers. Kohl is alonecanceled$150 million in orders, around $50 million from Bangladesh factories, weeks before paying out $109 million in dividends to shareholders.“The temporary closure of all 1,159 Kohl is stores caused us to significantly reduce our inventory to align with anticipated sales. As a result, we made the difficult decision to cancel orders with some of our suppliers where we had the contractual right to do so,” a Kohl is spokesperson told Shadowproof. The canceled orders mean Bangladeshi workers are faced with wage decreases and unpaid wages. Rintu Barua has worked for twenty years at a garment factory in Chattogram, Bangladesh that also produces clothing primarily for Kohl is. Barua has only received 65 percent of his salary from the factory in recent months and received only 50 percent of his bonus for Eid Mubarak in May 2020.“I have not been able to pay rent on my house for the past two months, and the owner is pressuring me to come up with the rent,” Barua said. According to Barua, garment factory workers in Bangladesh typically work 8 to 10 hours per week, six days a week. Many continued working during the pandemic to try to keep up with previous delivery dates and orders.“Every day there are a few factories getting closed. Thousands of workers have lost their jobs and thousands will lose their job within the next couple of months,” Barua added. “Workers are facing a really hard time and some are leaving the city because they are now unable to afford the cost of living in the cities.”Some workers requested they remain anonymous for fear of retaliation as they struggle with unpaid wages and unsafe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Salaries have been reduced and bonuses have been halved,” said a garment factory worker in the Gaizpur division of Dhaka, Bangladesh. “Factory management often stock their products in advance from our overtime. They always have an option to profit. But during COVID-19, they said that they have no money as orders are canceled.”For four years, the worker has been at the garment factory in Gaizpur making clothes for several companies, primarily Puma. The worker is factory closed down for a month on March 26, and despite reopening, they only received 60 percent of their salary for March, April, and May, and have not received payment for the month of June. They explained workers with less than one year of seniority have not been called back, along with several pregnant women. During the pandemic, the worker said social distancing is not practiced and overtime has been eliminated, but workers still suffer verbal abuse from supervisors if they show any tiredness or make any small mistakes.“In Bangladesh, we canceled less than 1.5 percent of our orders and as said, we paid these suppliers for the costs of canceled orders,” a Puma spokesperson stated. “We are working with the Better Work Program of the ILO in Bangladesh to make sure that our suppliers follow all legal requirements, including layoff regulations.”Another worker, in the Asulia, Baipail area of Dhaka, Bangladesh, makes clothing for several European clothing retail companies. Their factory has been closed since March, and they have only received a portion of wages.“I do not have a husband and am facing a serious financial crisis along with my three sons and daughter. This is very difficult for me to carry the expenses of the family, we are passing days almost half-starving,” the worker shared.",2,1,Shadowproof

Mayoral candidate Andrew Yang dropped an “s-bomb” Saturday while making a campaign speech atSt. Ann & the Holy Trinity Churchin Brooklyn Heights.“I moved here as a 21-year-old law student at Columbia (and) I did not know shit,” Yang said. Yang let out a slight giggle after flinging the expletive and there was little discernible reaction from the generally supportive crowd of a couple dozen people inside the stately Episcopal church on Montague St. The frontrunner in most mayoral polls quickly moved to say that he owes a tremendous debt to the city for making him the person he is today.“Everything single good thing that has happened to me personally and professionally was made possible by New York City,” Yank NYC is the most fundamental activator and transformer of human potential in the history of the world.”The former Democratic presidential candidate used his own life experience to argue that New York needs tourgently get back its mojo after the COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered offices and restaurants for more than a year.“Our way of life is at stake,” Yang said. A spokesman for Yang stressed that the event was a campaign town hall, not a religious service, and the audience took the profanity in stride.“Andrew was having a good time with the audience at to day is town hall, laughing and sharing stories,” said Jake Sporn, the spokesman. “As everyone there knew, he has incredible respect for the church and this was not a service.”Yang has led in most polls of the crowded mayoral race, although Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams led one recent survey.

The US government has been aware of the approach of “Planet X” for over forty years, warns John Moore “The Liberty Man,” in a jaw-dropping new interview on. (See below.)While Planet X will not strike the Earth, it is nearby approach will unleash cataclysmic consequences across our planet that may bring an end to human civilization as we know it, Moore explains in the interview. Those effects may include a global “pole shift,” which means the Earth is crust slips to a new orientation, unleashing extreme winds, volcanoes, earthquakes, flooding, tidal waves and more.“Every structure on the surface of the Earth would be destroyed,” explains Moore, who reveals the governments of the world are frantically constructing more underground bunkers in anticipation of catastrophic events. John Moore is a former US Army intelligence analyst and took part in 57 air combat missions over Vietnam and Cambodia. He later become a homicide detective for the state of Missouri. As a long-time radio host, Moore has developed a long list of sources inside government and the US military. He hosts a radio show each weekday from 8 – 10 am central time, via Republic Broadcasting. Learn all the details atTheLibertyMan.comAs Moore explains in the video below, the pole shift would place North America closer to the equator than its current position, and the “bulge” of ocean water at the equator (due to centrifugal forces of the rotating planet) would raise the level of the ocean by hundreds of feet compared to the continental USs. John Moore is web site — TheLibertyMan.com — hosts this map of anticipated changes. Note that Florida and much of the Eastern seaboard are under water in this depiction:In the video below, John Moore explains how people living in other areas of the world can easily determine whether their current locations will be inundated with higher relative ocean levels. The Planet X fly-by would likely also bring asteroid impacts to planet Earth, causing global chaos and mass destruction as large space rocks impact the planet at extreme relative velocities. A recent study found that just one such impact in any ocean would unleash 400-foot ocean waves that would devastate coastal cities around the world (and flood coastlines for potentially a hundred miles inland). Asteroids that impact the land could unleash large volumes of particulate matter into the stratosphere that would block sunlight from reaching food crops, leading to mass famine and the collapse of human civilization. If large volcanoes also erupt due to the destabilization of the Earth is crust, the amount of participate matter circling the globe could block out the sun and absolutely devastate nearly all plant life on Earth for several years. (Plants depend on photosynthesis via sunlight and carbon dioxide for energy, a fact that 99% of to day is climate scientists still refuse to acknowledge because they are scientifically illiterate brainwashed zombies.)The USs government is fully aware of the approach of Planet X but has chosen to withhold this information from the American people for the simple fact that. Moore recommends people move inland and get above 500 feet in altitude in order to survive the ocean inundation of North America. See the full interview here:Direct Brighteon.com link:Brighteon.com/c0fdc799-ac8c-42a9-9447-69f3735e1147Censorship-resistant link (for sharing on social media):Brlghteon.com/c0fdc799-ac8c-42a9-9447-69f3735e1147As far as the timing of the return of Planet X, Moore explains that people who keep asking about the timing are those who refuse to prepare. Since the public is not being told about the timing,. Any who hope to survive the return of Planet X, whenever it occurs, must move away from coastal areas and construct Earth-bermed or underground structures, the n stock them with survival supplies and prepare for a global food wipeout lasting 1-2 years. You will not even be able to grow food, since the sunlight will be blocked by particulate dust in the atmosphere. Needless to say, in this scenario, as will all fiat currencies. The only things that have value from that day forward are gold, silver, firearms, ammunition, food, fuel, first aid, land and other “real” items. The Book of Revelation openly warns humanity about a fiery mountain falling out of the sky and impacting the ocean, devastating the planet and destroying a third of the world is ships. To follow this rabbit hole, research the terms “Wormwood” or “Nibiru.”Note that the areas of America which will be flooded first tend to cover the anti-God Leftists who mass murder babies, sexually assault children and worship Satan. Many people have speculated that God will judge America is sins by unleashing catastrophic events against this nation, similar to the fiery events described in relation to but on a much larger scale. Other guests we have interviewed say that America must, beg God for forgiveness and unleash a national revival in order to avoid God is wrath.

I saw it happen as a correspondent in Israel when Menachem Begin captured the vote in June 1977 to become prime minister of the state is first right-wing government.

And the n came a surge of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, what Begin defined as “liberated Israeli territory.” And the n Egyptian President Anwar Sadat went to Jerusalem in November 1977. And the n the Camp David Accords in September 1978 hosted by President Jimmy Carter. And the n the signing in Washington of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979. We know elections have unexpected consequences, even in the USs. The biggest surprise in most of our lifetimes came four years ago with the ascendance to the White House of Donald Trump, a flamboyant billionaire real estate developer with no experience in politics or governing. His arrogance flaunted itself during his campaign in January 2016 when he proclaimed in signature Trump fashion, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and would not lose any voters.”As a born and bred New Yorker, I have been to Fifth Avenue many times. It is a lovely street, gliding along the east side of leafy Central Park. St. Patrick is Cathedral is the re, near Rockefeller Center, its ice skating rink a winter lure. The avenue is home to the Easter Parade, which was canceled this year because of the coronavirus. It takes a particular mindset to project a scene of shooting someone on one of New York City is glorious thoroughfares as a means of attracting voters. His statement served as a preview of what was to come, a mini trailer to a 4-year-old horror film that would furrow the brows of world leaders. Trump frightened tens of millions of us with his racism, far right authoritarianism and ultranationalism bordering on fascism, division, chaos, lying and a narcissistic personality disorder behind it all that disrupted, disturbed and disheart end governments and people around the globe. But for the other dictators, that is. That President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump in an historic election is a blessing.“When the Devil is ambassador from Hell is soundly defeated, we should all be crying tears of joy and salvation,” said Robert Morgart, 76, an adjunct professor of strategic management at Highlands University in Las Vegas, NM More poignantly, CNN commentator Van Jones, who is Black, broke down crying on live TV shortly after the network broke the news that Biden had won. His startling reaction echoed the relief felt about Trump is defeat by the nearly 75 million people who voted for Biden, the most ever for president.“This is vindication for a lot of people who have really suffered,” he said. “You know, ‘I ca not breathe?’ that was not just George Floyd. That was how a lot of people felt. They could not breathe.”“Every day you are waking up,” Jones said, wiping away tears. “And you are getting these tweets, and you do not know, and you go into the store, and people who have been afraid to show their racism are getting nastier and nastier to you. And you are worried about your kids. And you are worried about your sister. Can she go to Walmart and get back into her car without somebody saying something to her. And you spent so much of your life energy just trying to hold it together.”It is understandable that he cried, for himself, his family, his country because “the character of the country matters. Being a good man matters. I want my sons to look at this.”Tears came as I typed those words. It has not been easy for any of us who despised Trump for what he was doing to our beloved country, at home and abroad. And it is not over. It will not be over until noon January 20. There is a lot of space between now and the n for Trump to cause a great deal of mischief. We do not know how he will react to his defeat. He already refused to concede, mounting spurious court challenges. Dr. Brandy X Lee, a psychiatrist who taught Yale students and is the author of “Profile of a Nation: Trump is Mind, America is Soul,” emailed Salon diagnosing the president is narcissism in reacting to loss:“. . . When there is an all-encompassing loss, such as the loss of an election, it can trigger a rampage of destruction and reign of terror in revenge against an entire nation that has failed him.“It is far easier for the pathological narcissist to consider destroying oneself and the world, especially its ‘laughing eyes,’ the n to retreat into becoming a ’loser’ and a ‘sucker’ —which to someone suffering from this condition will feel like psychic death.”It is an understatement to warn that we could be in danger. And the Republican Party increased its numbers. The problem is in the Senate where its leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, may wield a great deal of power to thwart Biden is agenda. He did that to President Barack Obama. And behind them all will be Trump, somewhere out there with the support of the more than 70 million people who voted for him. He needs to be controlled before history suddenly is changed to a direction none of us want to go.

Browse our archive of posts by to picBrowse our archive of posts on key right-wing groupsBrowse our archive of posts on key right-wing figuresRead in-depth reports on key people, organizations and issues on the RightIt was not a good weekend for anyone hoping that President Donald Trump and his allies might soon concede that Joe Biden won the presidential election. In addition to Saturday is far-right“Stop the Steal” rally and a much smaller “Walk Away”gatheringon Sunday, Trump is lawyers made the rounds on right-wing media claiming that they had irrefutable proof that the presidential election was stolen by nefarious computer software designed for that purpose. On Sunday night, thousands of Trump supporters heard from a succession of “prophets”—joined by Senator James Lankford and pundit Eric Metaxas—who decreed that the exposure of this demonic corruption would be so explosive that it would be a sign of divine intervention like God parting the Red Sea for Israelites fleeing Egypt is armies, and that it would ensure that the US Supreme Court would abide by the ruling of the Courts of Heaven and keep Trump in the White House for a second term. Members of Trump is legal team, includingRudy Giuliani,Sidney Powell, andJenna Ellisfanned out to push Trump is unfounded claims that he won the election and it was stolen from him. They pushed a conspiracy theory involving Dominion software, which has already been debunked by the New York TimesandFox News. As Mediaitenoted, Powell even insinuated that the CIA was involved. As Right Wing Watch has reported, Trump is religious-right supporters have been actively promoting his claims about the election being stolen from him, and many have continued to insist that God will yet intervene to keep Trump in the presidency for four more years. On Sunday night, anti-LGBTQ activist Jim Garlow hosted a prayer call ostensibly to pray on behalf of “election integrity”—his sixth since the election and one of dozens being held by a variety of leaders and ministries, including White House aide Paula White. During the call, Garlow showed a four-minute clip from Saturday is march compiled by LifeSite news that included participants talking about putting Biden in jail and telling Trump not to concede “under any circumstances” and to “fight this to the death if you have to.”Garlow opened the call and turned it over to religious right activist Mario Bramnick, who noted that December 14, the day that electors will vote to certify the results of the election, comes during Hannukah. “We decree and declare that the hammer of God would come to expose what Satan is dominion is trying to take over,” Bramnick said. “Satan is hammer is no match for the Maccabee of God, for the hammer of God. And I decree by December 14, we will be victorious exposing the fraud and that President Trump will be declared our president for another four more years.”Lankford said, “ultimately, at the end of the day, God is the one who raises up and he is the one who puts down.” He prayed:Over and over again in scripture, your people called out and said, ‘God, may the unjust be shown to be unjust.’ You called out through the Old Testament over and over again for equal weights and that you hated unequal weights and measures where some people were measured one way, and other people were measured another. So God, I pray that you would bring in this election equal weights and measures and that anywhere where it is unequal it would be exposed in the light, and that we’d call it out and to be able to see it for what it is. Garlow said he’d hoped to have Ellis on the call, but since that did not work out he turned to Metaxas, who interviewed Ellis twice over the weekend. Metaxas said that the “evidence” that Powell and Ellis have is “so explosive that I believe that we all need to be praising God that the election went this way.”Metaxas continued:In other words, what is going to be exposed is so extraordinary, that it is far more powerful than if Trump had simply won. I ca not really overstate that, Jim. In other words, God has arranged this. And when you talk to people who are in on this, like Jenna Ellis, and to some extent, Sidney Powell, you realize that they have seen the evidence. And I think that God is using them to encourage us and to say that anytime anybody thinks, “Well, we do not know how it is going to go,” I think you need to say “Number” There is a level of injustice that has been done here. To steal votes to try to undermine our democracy is something so foul, so offensive, that is going to harm human beings around the world, that we need to be angry. And we need to say that we do not care what it takes, we will pray till our knees bleed, we will pray and pray and pray because the Lord is calling us to pray, because he wants to do something. Jenna is right in with the president. She spoke to him five times today. They know, they know that there was fraud, and they have the evidence, and the church needs to not just have patience and wait, but while we are waiting to really pray. This is a spiritual battle—you all know this—unlike anything we have ever faced. Sidney Powell said, this is going to be like a new American Revolution. The stuff that is going to come out, it is going to be staggering. This is something that God is doing—that God has done. He has set things up to do this. And I feel like we are against the Red Sea. And we need to praise God. He is going to part the Red Sea. He is going to destroy Pharaoh is army. We need to praise him and know that now. And the people that I have talked to, even just in the natural, they know they have the goods. There is nobody more sober minded than Sidney Powell. She is the lawyer for General Flynn—utterly brilliant, sober minded. She said some things on the Lou Dobbs program, and in other places that—she is not just a talker, this is a woman who know. She has seen the evidence. The nutshell version is that the Dominion stuff was designed for voter fraud. It is not that it was used to defraud us in this election. It was specifically designed originally, so that it could be used for voter fraud in Venezuela, and I believe she said in Cuba. And the point is that this is something that when it is exposed, we are going to be looking at a different landscape. It is not just going to be that Trump will be president. It is going to be a different landscape. So, I want to say that to encourage people. We have got to praise God for what he is doing. We have got to praise God and do not let anyone say, “Well, who knows?” We cannot let this stand. The prayers of God will be answered. We have got to storm heaven because this cannot stand. Bramnick introduced Robert Henderson, who claimed earlier this year that God had made him Trump is “spiritual running mate” and whop rayed on election night that God would dispatch an army of angels to prevent Democrats from stealing the election in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Hesaidin October that Trump was chosen by God and the refore “should never be criticized” by Christians. Henderson said that Christians need to plead Trump is case in “the court of Heaven” to get a ruling that will sway the US Supreme Court to reseat Trump as president, which “we all know is the intention of God.”Next up was Becca Greenwood, who talked about a vision she had in 2019 that covered the five-year period through 2024, which she said would bring “historic exposures” of corruption. It will look like “complete chaos,” she said, but it will be a sign that God is cleansing the nation and that “the demonic grip of the enemy, of corruption, antichrist elite structure, would let go of this nation.”The call continued for about two hours, with additional speakers from around the world making similar assertions and decrees for God to ensure Trump is reelection. Abby Abildness talked about “Jericho marches” taking place in Pennsylvania. She prayed that God would “bind everything that is in opposition to the holy governance of the Lord God Almighty, and you would loose this new era of a nation and nations founded on righteousness and justice.” She added a prayer the God would “establish justice at the gates of the Supreme Court of the USs.”Garlow is wife Rosemary prayed that God is coming action in the election would be so “mighty” that it will spark a spiritual revival:He says, “I am coming out of Heaven, and I am stepping on the on the land of your nation.” And even though the demoniacs come and react to my appearance, there is going to be such a mighty deliverance in the USs of America and in the government, that when the Lord appears the fear of the Lord is going to strike the nation in such a way that the eyes of multitudes will be open. And though they were raging—we have seen these people in person in DC, in a total demonic rage out of their mind—there is going to be a massive deliverance of multitudes of people, and their nakedness will be covered, the re will be clothed in salvation, and they will come and be the greatest evangelists in our country and for the next revival, as God is now birthing this great End Time move of God. The Lord says, “Just watch me. I am stepping into your nation. I am coming with deliverance. Do not be afraid. Do not be timid. Have faith. I calm the storm, and I am coming to deliver you from evil.”…And now, Father, we as your body, we submit ourselves to fulfill your word to see and have faith that what you did will come to our nation. We will have this deliverance. We will have this breakthrough. You will take hold of these demonic spirits and cast them out of the premises of our country. And we will rejoice not only to receive our rightful president and have the evil exposed, but we rejoice even more for the precious people made in your image, who are going to come to know you, because of this time and because of these prayers and because of this experience. Among the prayer leaders from outside the US was Jack Van der Tang from the Netherlands, who described an experience he had in 2017 in which God told him that he had chosen Trump. Van der Tang asked God for forgiveness for his country for having recognized Biden as president-elect.

Thereviewed a series of postings to a Facebook group for current and formerTimesstaffers, where a tense debate is unfolding over McNeil is exit. One camp argues that his dismissal was justified and another asserts it set a troubling precedent, which the New York Timesunion should have done more to prevent.""What ever happened to the notion of worker solidarity ... to giving a fellow worker the benefit of the doubt,"" asked Steven Greenhouse, who spent three decades covering labor issues for theTimes. ""And why did not the NewsGuild do far more to defend and protect the job of a long-time Times employee, one who at times did tireless, heroic work on behalf of the Guild to help improve pay and conditions for all NYT employees?""

Reached for comment, Amlen told the this is a ""private group"" and that she would ""appreciate it if you do not use anything I said or wrote.""The back-and-forth provides a window into the latest racial controversy roiling the paper, which saw a revolt among minority staffers over the summer after publishing an op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton (R., Ark.). Opinion editor James Bennet ultimately lost his job. McNeil is ouster came nearly two years after the incident that precipitated it. While chaperoning high school students on a pricey trip to Peru, the science reporter responded to a question from a student about whether one of her classmates should have been suspended for using the n-word. In the process, he uttered the offending syllables himself. An internalTimesinvestigation found his judgment wanting but stopped short of firing him. Only after theDaily Beastpublished an account of the incident, thrusting it into the public realm for the first time, was McNeil pushed out. ""We do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent,"" Dean Baquet, the paper is executive editor, told staff in an email. McNeil is resignation on Friday—and Baquet is post hoc explanation that intent does not matter—renewed the bitter debate among staff, with reporters warring with each other in public and private.

She declined to say if that policy extends to social media, where otherNew York Timeswriters, including Nikole Hannah-Jones and Astead Herndon, have quoted the slur. Baquet is statement in particular came in for scathing criticism in the Facebook discussion. ""‘We do not tolerate racist language regardless of intent’ might be the most racist statement I have ever read,"" said Lawrence De Maria, an award-winning crime and finance reporter.

She responded by posting this reporter is inquiry, including his cell phone number, on Twitter, in direct violation of the website isterms of service. Greenhouse argued that the staffers who went after McNeil,including Hannah-Jones and race reporter John Eligon, had their priorities backwards. Many of the m, he wrote in the Facebook group, were ""far more willing to sympathize with these privileged 15- and 16-year-olds than with a long time colleague who has done much great work for the Times over the years.""The debate also spilled over onto Twitter.

216,George Floyd is addiction could change how we talk about drug use and Black Americans,-5.0,46.33,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/04/03/derek-chauvin-trial-highlights-george-floyds-opioid-drug-addiction/4842554001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-03,22,"Like millions of Americans,George Floydlived with the torment of drug addiction. He and his girlfriend,Courteney Ross,became addicted to op io ids four years ago after both were prescribed the drugs for chronic pain. When the prescriptions ran out, they turned to illegal drug use, she said. They tried to go clean but failed. They tried again but could not stop for long. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the USs, Floyd, the father of two daughters, started using again during a dark time: he lost his job as a nightclub security guard because of quarantine shutdowns, he was hospitalized for several days after an overdose, and he found out he had the coronavirus. On the day he died, his neck trapped under the knee of former Minnesota police officerDerek Chauvinfor more than nine minutes, he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, toxicology reports later showed.“We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,” Ross said tearfully Thursday during testimony in the Chauvin trial over Floyd is death. Floyd is death helped launch a global civil rights movement over racial injustice and police violence. The trial over his death could similarly shape how Americans view drug addiction at a time when Black people continue to overwhelmingly be denied medical treatment compared with white Americans even as they suffer from disproportionately high rates of fatal op io id overdoses. Chauvin is defense attorney,Eric Nelson, has sought to persuade jurors that drugs – not Chauvin is knee pressing on Floyd is neck as he cried""I ca not breathe""while handcuffed on the ground – contributed to Floyd is death. Prosecutors, family members and medical experts have said Floyd is history of addiction does not explain how he died. Chauvin, who is white, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.""George was walking, talking, laughing, and breathing just fine before Derek Chauvin held his knee to George is neck,” Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, lawyers for Floyd is family, said in a statement Thursday morning. “Tens of thousands of Americans struggle with self-medication and op io id abuse and are treated with dignity, respect and support, not brutality.”Drug use has been used to explain the deaths of other Black people who have died at the hands of police, including Michael Brown in Missouri, said Scott Nolen, director of the addiction and health equity program at the Open Society Institute-Baltimore, which works to reduce drug addiction. Structural racism leads people of color who use drugs to be wrongly seen as ""throwaways,"" he said. Andre Johnson, CEO of the Detroit Recovery Program, a drug addiction support program, said people relapse because of inadequate resources. The Chauvin defense ""really sheds light on how people of color, Black people, are treated when they have an addiction. What they are failing to do is treat George Floyd as a whole person,"" Johnson said. ""The fact that he used drugs is not why he died. He died because he was a big Black man and a white man did not value his life.""Lawyers in Derek Chauvin is murder trial focus on training, drug use and viral videoThe notion of treating drug addiction as a medical condition and not a moral failing became more widespread in the 2000s based on emerging research and as prescription op io id pain relievers became popular and thousands of white people began to die from overdoses. Unlike previous drug crises that primarily hurt low-income Americans and people of color, victims of op io id drug addiction were often portrayed by lawmakers and the media as ordinary white Americans who had fallen prey to a highly addictive substance.""One of the first things you notice is that when drug addiction, in particularly op io id addiction, became seen as a white drug problem, suddenly people were deeply interested in the origin of your drug addiction – they were interested in origin stories that made you not responsible,"" saidEkow N Yankah, a criminal law professor at Cardozo School of Law in New York City. ""Those origin stories were never available to Black people, in particular Black urban dwellers. No one cared why you got hooked on drugs.""In subsequent years, many Republican and Democratic lawmakers began to embrace legal marijuana, reducing sentences for low-level drug offenders and drug addiction treatment instead of criminal charges. The political movement has represented a significant departure from federal drug policy of the past that often resulted in Black men serving long sentences for nonviolent crack cocaine crimes while white offenders who used cocaine got comparatively light jail time.""There is no question if crack had been a white kid is disease it would have ended up in treatment, but it ended up in everyone going to jail,"" said Robert Stutman, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration is New York office during the 1980s war against crack cocaine. Of the more than 840,000 people who have died since 1999 from a drug overdose, more than 70% in 2019 involved an opioid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the op io id crisis has largely claimed white lives, opioid-involved overdose death rates in the Black community have skyrocketed in recent years, federal data show. The addiction journey of Ross, who is white, and Floyd could help Americans see Black drug users in a sympathetic light, medical and legal experts said.""They are ordinary drug users – they are ordinary people struggling with drug use. Black people end up hooked on drugs for the exact same reasons white people do,"" said Yankah, the law professor. Many Americans now better understand that people grappling with drug addiction cannot easily stop abusing substances.""People use drugs for a variety of reasons, including managing physical and emotional pain. It is because of those many reasons that oftentimes it is hard to stop using,"" said Sheila P Vakharia, deputy director of the research and academic engagement for the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit based in New York. And yet Black people are often denied the same lifesaving medical treatment as white Americans to address op io id addiction, research shows. One study foundBlack patients were 77% less likely to receive buprenorphine, a drug that limits the desire for opioids. Instead, Black Americans are often prescribed methadone, which requires most patients to show up at a medical office every day to get the drug, a significant barrier for low-income Americans, including many people of color, who do not work flexible hours or have access to transportation.""The way we give it to people is really terrible. Imagine if we made someone do that for their blood pressure medicine or their diabetes medicine,"" Vakharia said. For Americans without health insurance, both forms of treatment are often out of reach. And Hispanic, Asian and Black Americansare more likely to be uninsured than white Americans.""The impact of incarceration, arrests and marginalization, which stem from racially motivated and punitive drug laws, adds to the physical suffering and makes it more difficult to get treatment and be treated humanely. It is these attitudes that give license to the Floyd defense team to try to paint him as worthless and  isick' because he suffered from addiction,"" said Deborah Agus, executive director of the Behavioral Health Leadership Institute in Baltimore, which focuses on ensuring vulnerable populations have access to better addiction treatment. Data shows Americans are using heroin and fentanyl at the same rate regardless of race or ethnicity, but the increase in opioid-related death rates among people of color is likely the result of disproportionate access to treatment for these groups compared with white Americans, said Dr. Pooja Lagisetty, a health services researcher at the University of Michigan whose research showed the disparity in buprenorphine treatment. Both the prosecution and defense took care while discussing Floyd is addiction. Such an approach would have been unimaginable two decades ago, medical and legal experts said. Nelson began his cross-examination Thursday of Ross with a display of sympathy: “I am sorry to hear about your struggles with op io id addiction,” he began. “Thank you for sharing that with the jury.”Meanwhile, the prosecution is prompting of Ross to discuss how she and Floyd struggled with drugs as opposed to downplaying the drug use was also atypical. In the past, drug use has been cited to villainize witnesses, suspects and those killed by police, especially when they were Black, said several medical and legal experts.""I do not think a defense attorney in the '80s or '90s would have said, 'I am sorry you are struggling with heroin or cocaine or crack' in those times when it was considered an inner-city drug,"" said Yankah, of Cardozo Law. Floyd died on Memorial Day 2020 after police responded to a 911 call alleging he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. Three other former police officers who responded to the call face charges in Floyd is death. Chauvin defended his actions to a witness after Floyd is unresponsive body was taken away in an ambulance.""We had to control this guy because he is a sizable guy. It looks like he is probably on something,"" Chauvin is heard saying in a video. In contrast,Chauvin is own troubledpast, including 18 complaints filed against him in 19 years as a Minneapolis police officer, will not be the focus of the criminal trial because it could influence the jury against him. In her testimony, Ross, 45, described Floyd as a fun, kind man who offered to pray with her the first time they met, when she was visiting her son is father at a homeless shelter where Floyd was a security guard. She said he was active and never had trouble breathing before his run-in with Chauvin. Keith Humphreys, a behavioral sciences professor at Stanford University in California and a former member of the George W Bush White House Advisory Commission on Drug Free Communities, said that if Chauvin and other officers suspected Floyd was high, they should have taken it more seriously when he said he could not breathe because op io id use can slow respiration.""Even if he was addicted, he did not deserve to be killed. It shows the devaluation of the lives of people with drug problems,"" Humphreys said. ""Police take into custody millions of intoxicated people every year without this happening.""",2,2,USA Today
217,Do not Let the Riots Legitimize Facial Recognition Tech,8.0,36.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/dont-let-the-riots-legitimize-facial-recognition-tech/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Earlier this month, a pro-Trump mob unlawfully breached the USs Capitol, hoping to “stop the steal” by interfering with the Electoral College vote count. In a positive deviation from the norm, Americans are coming together to denounce political violence, calling for the swift arrests of the perpetrators. What is troubling, however, is law enforcement is use of the same invasive technologies that, just a few months ago, caused a wave of backlash and prompted big tech to terminate government contracts. While Americans rally around this national manhunt, they should keep a watchful eye on their Fourth Amendment rights. Sure, the rioters assaulted police officers in the name of a president who championed “law and order,” — their hypocrisy is astounding. But greater dangers lie ahead if we all follow suit and pursue accountability with an “ends justifies the means” mindset. Americans are eager to see the rioters apprehended, not just because of what they did, but because of how they got away with it. There were thousands of rioters at the Capitol on January 6, yet the police only apprehended13 peoplet hat day. Since the incident, theFBI has arrested over 100 people and identified over 200 suspects using a swath of data from social media, surveillance cameras, and cellphones. More than140,000 photos and videos have been collected by the FBI and, according to Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director of the FBI is Washington Field Office, they are “scouring every one for investigative and intelligence leads.”These investigations are shrouded in secrecy—the FBI is not often forthcoming about its tactics—but there is evidence that local police departments, working collaboratively with the federal agency, are being aided by facial recognition tools. AnAlabama police department identified several suspects from the siege using technology provided by Clearview AI On January 7, use of the company is facial recognition technology increased by 26 percent. Clearview AI does not have any contracts with private businesses. After public fallout and a flurry of lawsuits over the company is collection of billions of online photos without consent, Clearview AI voluntarily terminated its commercial contracts. In ale gal filing from last year, the company committed to “cancelling the accounts of every customer who was not either associated with law enforcement or some other federal, state, or local government department, office, or agency.” This means that police must be fueling the recent spike in searches. We have seen this before. Police used facial recognition software to find and arrest protesters during the demonstrations for Michael Brown in 2014, Freddie Gray in 2015, and, most recently,George Floydin 2020. There is a growing, alarming pattern of facial recognition being used after protests. And until recently, this development had been hotly contested. But to day, this technology is application is being applauded. Talk about hypocrisy. Facial recognition tech is the cornerstone of modern, government mass surveillance and should be met by the same scrutiny upon each instance of police use. The Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from engaging in “unreasonable searches and seizures.” According to the Supreme Court in the landmark case: “What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. …But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.” Social media and surveillance cameras, analyzed by facial recognition software, test the boundaries of law enforcement is jurisdiction. The FBI has admitted to following the data trail, even though it blurs the distinction between private and public spaces. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed facial recognition, though it has acknowledged that new technology challenges the Fourth Amendment and, in recent cases, has constrained the ability of police to engage in such searches. Facial recognition systems can also beinaccurate, resulting in false-positive scans for Asian, African-American, and female subjects. In several instances, this technology has led police to arrest and jail innocent people. The events of January 6 were certainly atrocious, but celebrating mass arrests enabled by facial recognition, GPS tracking, and data collection yields no benefit for our country and heaps on hypocrisy after hypocrisy. If the rioters besmirched our constitutional government, let is not make matters worse by torching our civil liberties.",1,1,The American Conservative

The crowd cheered in favor of the idea.

219,Who Is to Blame for the Death of Breonna Taylor?,9.0,29.4,https://spectator.org/who-is-to-blame-for-the-death-of-breonna-taylor/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,23,"Racism did not kill Breonna Taylor. She did not die from prejudice or discrimination. Her death was not caused by Confederate monuments or statues of Christopher Columbus, nor could her death have been prevented by social-media hashtags. If you do not know who Breonna Taylor was, the short version of the story is that the 26-year-old was shot to death March 13 by police in Louisville, Kentucky, during a drug raid. The long version of the story is rather more complicated, but Taylor is death has been reduced to a slogan (“Justice for Breonna”) by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest movement. If you are dating a drug dealer is ex-girlfriend and somebody busts through your door at 12:30 in the morning, what do you do?Like so many other police shootings seized upon by this movement, BLM activists are interested in promoting a political narrative that ignores specific details of Taylor is death. Most of the movement is supporters have probably never looked past the slogan-sized condensed version of the story — an unarmed black woman killed in her own home by white cops — to ask whether racism had anything to do with her death. Certainly the national media have not sought to determine whether the facts of this support the BLM movement is mythology of “systemic racism” as the one-size-fits-all explanation for police shootings. Fear of being targeted by “cancel culture” plays a role in silencing all criticism of the movement, and the refore no one (no, not even Tucker Carlson) has questioned the BLM narrative of Breonna Taylor is death.“Say Her Name” is one of the slogans that activists have connected to this Louisville shooting, but if we want to understand why police shot Breonna Taylor, there is another name that needs to be said — Jamarcus Glover. Glover is a 30-year-old narcotics trafficker who police say was dealing crack cocaine and marijuana out of a “trap house” on Elliott Avenue in Louisville is west side. According to a police affidavit, detectives had Glover and his accomplice Adrian Walker under surveillance, and had seen their car — a red Dodge Charger with Mississippi plates — “make frequent trips” from the Elliott Avenue “trap house” to an apartment 10 miles away on Springfield Drive. Detective Joshua Jaynes wrote in the affidavit that Glover was using the Springfield Drive apartment as his mailing address; Jaynes said he had witnessed Glover pick up a postal package at the apartment; and, citing his “training and experience,” Jaynes stated his belief that Glover “may be keeping narcotics and/or proceeds from the sale of narcotics” at the Springfield Drive apartment. All of this was stated in an application for a search warrant of the Springfield Drive apartment where Breonna Taylor lived. You see, Jamarcus Glover was Breonna Taylor is ex-boyfriend. They broke up a couple years ago, according to a lawyer for Taylor is family who said she maintained a “passive friendship” with Glover. This “friendship” apparently included allowing Glover to receive his mail at her apartment, and, although there is no evidence that Taylor was ever involved in Glover is drug operation, the “training and experience” of Detective Jaynes led him to believe there must be some connection. This was convincing enough for Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Mary Shaw, who approved the so-called “no-knock” warrant for Taylor is apartment, and also approved nearly identical warrants for the four other addresses linked to Glover is drug operation, including the Elliott Avenue “trap house.”Louisville police served all five warrants almost simultaneously, shortly after midnight on March 13. Glover was arrested at the Elliott Avenue address, but the raid on Taylor is apartment went horribly wrong. Police Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who was part of the five-man squad assigned to serve the warrant on the Springfield Drive address, said the squad was told in a preliminary briefing that this was a “soft target” because Taylor was believed to be alone in the apartment. Therefore, Sgt. Mattingly said, the decision was made for officers to knock on the door and announce the mselves as police, despite the authorization for a “no-knock” entry. Sgt. Mattingly knocked for about a minute, he said, before the supervising lieutenant ordered them to “hit it,” using a battering ram to breach the door. Inside the apartment, however, Breonna Taylor was not alone. She had a new boyfriend visiting her, and they were watching a movie in her bedroom. The boyfriend, Kenneth Walker (no relation to Glover is accomplice Adrian Walker) had a legally owned pistol, and when he heard somebody pounding on the front door, he grabbed his weapon. Why? Because he was “scared to death,” believing that the person pounding on the door might be Taylor is drug-dealer ex-boyfriend. Walker and Taylor emerged from the bedroom into the hallway of the apartment and, Walker said, Taylor called out, “Who is it?”The next thing that happened, in Walker is description of the incident, is the door “comes off its hinges” — the police are busting in, but. If you are dating a drug dealer is ex-girlfriend and somebody busts through your door at 12:30 in the morning, what do you do?Walker fired a shot, hitting Sgt. Mattingly in the thigh, and Sgt. Mattingly immediately returned fire, getting off six shots. Two other officers also opened fire. In total, police fired at least 22 shots, none of which hit Walker, but Taylor was struck eight times and died on the scene. Although a grand jury indicted Walker on a charge of attempted murder of a police officer,that charge was dismissed in Mayat the request of Commonwealth is Attorney Tom Wine. Last month, Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroederannounced the firing of Officer Brett Hankison, who he said “blindly” shot 10 rounds into Taylor is apartment through “a patio door and window which were covered with material that completely prevented you from verifying any person as an immediate threat or more importantly any innocent persons present.” The department has placed Detective Jaynes, Sgt. Mattingly, and Officer Myles Cosgrove, who also fired shots during the incident, on “administrative reassignment.” The case is being investigated by the Justice Department and the FBI, as well as Kentucky state officials, and Taylor is family has filed a lawsuit against the city of Louisville. The city, meanwhile, has passed a law banning “no-knock” warrants. None of the facts of the Breonna Taylor case can be altered by protest marches or by Instagram memes. And the facts of the case, which may argue for changes in police training and procedures, offer no evidence of “systemic racism” as the explanation for Taylor is death. Angry mobs blocking traffic or toppling statues are not doing anything to bring about “Justice for Breonna.”So what are the protesters actually doing? What is accomplished, for example, byWNBA players walking off the courtin protest of the national anthem and dedicating their season to Breonna Taylor? She was not shot because of Francis Scott Key is lyrics about “bombs bursting in air” over Fort McHenry. She was shot because of her “friendship” with her ex-boyfriend, the dope dealer. Her death was the result of a “key miscalculation” by police,CNN concluded after it assigned a team of investigative reporters to the Breonna Taylor story. Racism had nothing to do with it, because if Louisville cops just wanted to shoot black people, why did not they shoot Jamarcus Glover? The “trap house” suspect did not resist arrest and is still alive. Why are not the mobs protesting against him? That might make sense, but it is 2020, and nothing makes sense this year.",1,0,The American Spectator
220,Tom Cotton Went on Fox News to Make the Case for a Quick Supreme Court Nomination. It Went Poorly.,-17.17,38.83,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/09/tom-cotton-fox-news-chris-wallace-definition-of-the-word-mandate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-20,25,"Win McNamee/GettyFour years ago, after the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Republican senator after Republican senator made floor speeches, issued press releases, and went live on air to argue that in an election year, the American people deserved a chance to weigh in on the next Supreme Court nominee by first choosing their next president. Now those chickens are coming home to roost. On,host Chris Wallace grilled Senator Tom Cotton after the Arkansas Republican said the Senate “will move forward without delay” to confirm President Donald Trump is nominee, who may be announced as soon as next week. Mid-interview, Wallace played back a 2016 clip of Cotton defending the Senate for refusing to consider President Barack Obama is nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland. “Why would we cut off the national debate about this next justice?” Cotton asked in the clip. “Why would we squelch the voice of the people? Why would we deny the voters a chance to weigh in on the makeup of the Supreme Court?”“If it was wrong the n, nine months before the election, why is it okay now, six weeks before the election?” Wallace asked. In response, Cotton argued that election results in 2018 gave Senate Republicans a “mandate” to do, well, whatever the hell they want: “In 2014, the American people elected a Republican majority of the Senate to put the brakes on President Obama is judicial nominations,” he said. “In 2018, we had a referendum on this question—just a month before the 2018 midterms, we had the vote on Justice Kavanaugh. There could not have been a clearer mandate, because the American people did not just elect Republicans, they expanded our majority. They defeated four Democratic senators who voted against Justice Kavanaugh. They reelected the one Democratic senator who did vote for Justice Kavanaugh.”Then Cotton went a step further, claiming that it was a matter of “constitutional duty” to both block Garland in 2016 and confirm a Trump nominee now: “We have a clear mandate to perform our constitutional duty.

Welcome back to is Latin America Brief. The highlights this week: a look at adjustments to the that could relieve Latin America is crippling COVID-19 debt, aChinese economic blow to Venezuela, and new heights forNicaragua is crackdown on political opposition. As some Latin American countries continue to battleCOVID-19 surges, many are also weighing how they will repay debt burdens that significantly increased during the pandemic. Latin America and the Caribbean is regional debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 68.9 percent in 2019 to an estimated 79.3 percent in 2020, making it the most indebted region in the developing world. This week, Argentinaactivateda 60-day grace period to try to reach an agreement on debt it owes to countries in the Paris Club group of creditor nations. Argentina as well as other Latin American countries have faced public resistance to pre-pandemic International Monetary Fund programs to cut their spending; the tax hike that sparked Colombia is ongoing protests was related to such a program as was the announcement of planned spending cuts in Costa Rica that prompted protests in October 2020. But spending cuts may exacerbate problems that pushed22 millionLatin Americans into poverty in 2020. Meanwhile, the green transitions required to meet countries’ Paris Agreement commitments require more, not less, public spending. And delayed recoveries in low- and middle-income countries could act as a drag on the entire global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is especially influential over the region is more vulnerable indebted nations. It loaned upwards of$66 billion to Latin American countries during the pandemic and also holds sway with bilateral lenders and private bondholders. Despite the fund isrhetoric, after the 2008 crisis, it did notsignificantlyeaseausterity programs that were required for IMF loans, and stricter austerity was associated with greater income inequality and poverty in borrower countries, according to research by Boston University is Global Development Policy Center. The IMF said it is based its COVID-19 loans on expectations that countries will prioritize spending on issues like health, supporting the vulnerable, and climate change. To track that, Boston University is research center created an index of the extent to which ongoing loan documentation continues to emphasize those policy steps; in Latin America, loans to 16 countries scored an average of 2.14 out of 3 on health, 2.31 on protecting the vulnerable, and 0.67 on climate. Meanwhile, as the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reported in March, most countries in the region have committed the mselves to fiscal consolidation in the near future. The IMFprojectsmost Latin American countries will begin cutting their overall public spending beginning this year and continue to do so until at least 2026. Institutions like the IMF are only part of Latin America is debt picture. On bilateral debt, China has agreed to cooperate with Paris Club creditors as part of aG-20 agreement to suspend debt for 73 low-income countries and build a common framework for debt restructuring—a departure from China is usual style of negotiating debt relief apart from other creditors and with little transparency. This could be an important step toward more transparency on Chinese loans. The issue was discussed on a recent episode of the podcast, featured on FP is ownForeign Policy Playlist, in which researcher Bradley Parks said his team was able to examine rarely seen Chinese loan contracts because some countries, such as Ecuador, had laws on the books requiring transparency. Parks praised such laws, noting other lenders beyond China also fall short on this topic. On the eve of the pandemic, more than half of Latin America is external public debt was to private bondholders, according to the World Bank. The bondholders were not bound in any way to suspend or restructure debts along the lines of the G-20 is common framework, although the IMF has called on them to do so. Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, and Suriname have restructured private bondholder debt since the pandemic began. The details of all of the debt relief described above remain in flux, and together, they still fail to fully address sovereign debt pressures in Latin America. One more important measure on the horizon is the likely approval of $650 billion in IMF Special Drawing Rights, reserves that can be converted to currency. Additionally, World Bank chief economist Carmen Reinhartsaidon Tuesday she expects the G-20 framework for restructuring to be extended to middle-income countries. Could this moment lead to even more ambitious reforms of the global financial safety net? Proposals abound, especially after policymakers saw how effectively the US Federal Reserve used swap lines to prop up some central banks and economies at the pandemic is start. (In Latin America,Mexico and Brazil benefited. In many countries that did not benefit, capital rushed out.)Former Federal Reserve international finance director Edwin Truman proposed a central bank swap network to temporarily increase IMF lending capacity. Costa Rica proposed an emergency fund financed by developed countries, offering 50-year loans free of fiscal and monetary conditionalities. Several Caribbean nations have proposed debt relief in exchange for steps toward climate adaptation and “hurricane clauses” that would adjust debt repayments after extreme weather events. For now, given existing responses to Latin America is pandemic shock, ECLAC wrote in March that the region is economic and social development is likely to be set back for at least a decade. Mexico holds legislative and local elections. Peru holds its presidential runoff election. US Vice President Kamala Harris begins visit to Guatemala and Mexico. Venezuela was recently blind sided by an announcement that China, the final buyer of most of Venezuela is oil so Venezuela can skirt US sanctions, will impose a $30 to $40 per barrel tax beginning June 12. Although China said the measure was based on environmental concerns, it could also be a sign of deteriorating relations between the two countries. The final polls before Peru is presidential runoff election this Sunday showed a very slight lead for left-wing candidate Pedro Castillo, though the gap between Castillo and his opponent Keiko Fujimori has narrowed over the course of the campaign. Fujimori was widely thought to have performed better in presidential debates. Argentina is government made an 11th-hour decision to reject the hosting of the Copa América soccer tournament over COVID-19 concerns.

The arrest came around two weeks after police raided Chamorro is brother is independent media outlet and is in the wake of new anti-democraticrestrictionssurrounding the November election.

Nicaragua has mostly ignored calls from the Organization of American States (OAS) to implement meaningful electoral reform after its brutal repression of the 2018 protests that kicked off the current political crisis. Most Latin American leaders did not say anything about the dramatic turn of events, symptomatic of the region is fragmentation and lack of international engagement.

Brooks, who is running for US Senatewith the backing of former President Donald Trump, said during his speech Friday, ""Our choice is simple: We can surrender and submit, or we can fight back"" against ""dictatorial socialists"" and Democratic control. The Alabama lawmaker referenced soldiers in the American Revolution who ""fought at Valley Forge,"" adding, ""that is the kind of sacrifice we have to think about.""Those soldiers ""did not fight the British—they fought for survival,"" Brooks said at the political conference. ""Twelve thousand Continental soldiers arrived. Five, six months later, 2,000 died. Think about what they went through. Burying your brothers, your fathers, your sons, 10 to 15 a day, every day for six months.""He went on to ask attendees whether America is ""worth fighting for"" and declared that the audience should ""Do it! Do it! Do it!""Brooks' statements came months after he gave a speech on January 6in which he told Trump supporters that ""today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.""Shortly after that speech, a mob of those supporters violently stormed the US Capitol building in an attempt to stop the election certification of PresidentJoe Biden. Five people died as a result of the violence, including a Capitol Hill police officer. Following the attack, Representative Eric Swalwell (D-NY)filed a lawsuit against Brooks, Trump, Donald Trump Jr., andRudy Giulianifor allegedly inciting the riot using incendiary language.

223,Health Care Lobbyists Are Trying to Block the Public Option at the State Level,-15.0,39.33,https://jacobinmag.com/2021/05/health-care-insurance-lobbying-ad-campaign-state-public-option-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/jacobin-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,24,"Joe Biden said on the campaign trail he would fight for a public option for health care. He has not — leaving health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies to work overtime to block states from passing their own public options. Aetna is among the multiple insurance companies opposing new legislation for a public option for health care. (Montgomery County Planning Commission / Flickr)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When PresidentJoe Bidenoutlined his legislative priorities during his first address toCongresslast month, notably absent was a major campaign promise: a public health insurance option. Instead, his current health reform proposal will funnel $200 billion more to private insurance companies to subsidize premiums, without any requirement that they cap out-of-pocket costs or eliminate them altogether. As a result of Biden is approach, states have been left to introduce public option legislation the mselves, in the process taking on some of the nation is largest and most politically organized businesses. From coast to coast, health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies are using every tactic at their disposal to block states from passing public option legislation. Such efforts show how determined the industry is to block any sort of reform that threatens its massive profits. In particular, the Partnership for America is Health Care Future Action (PAHCF Action), the state arm of the dark money group that has opposed Medicare for All and a public option at the federal level, has spent millions of dollars on TV ads and mailers in Colorado, Connecticut, and other states where public option bills are being considered. The group has spent more on lobbying in Colorado in 2021 than any other organization since 2011, and possibly ever. As a result, the actual public option component of the Colorado legislation was removed in an agreement made with the hospital industry. What is left of the bill is a requirement that private insurers offer so-called “standardized” health insurance plans and cut premiums on those plans by 18 percent over three years. Despite the overhaul, the industry has continued to oppose the plan.“It is a little intriguing to me that this is becoming such a big deal, because the bill is actually very narrow,” Representative Dylan Roberts, the lead sponsor of the Colorado legislation, told the before the bill was watered down. He added, “It is not a total overhaul of the health care system in Colorado or in the USs by any means. So the opposition to me is a little intriguing on that front.”In Colorado, PAHCF Action is smashing state lobbying records by spending millions of dollars to kill its public option proposal. The organization is running a full-scale advocacy campaign, blanketing the television airwaves and filling people is mailboxes with propaganda. While PAHCF Action is donors are not public, its board includes top executives from lobbying groups for investor-owned hospital chains and health insurers. The organization is president is Chip Kahn, who leads the Federation of American Hospitals. His group lobbies for hospital chains like HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare. HCA reported $3.5 billion in profit last year, and its CEO made $83.6 million, according toAxios. The hospital chain owns seven hospitals in Colorado, including one that drew national headlines in 2019 for billing an emergency room patient more than $12,000 to treat a hangover after his bachelor party. While HCA does not disclose its political contributions, Tenet has reported donating nearly $2.9 million to PAHCF between 2018 and 2020, according to company political spending disclosures. Tenet has a dozen surgery centers in Colorado, according to its website. PAHCF Action is secretary is David Merritt, a senior executive at America is Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which lobbies for big health insurers like Aetna. CVS Health, which owns Aetna, donated $5 million last year to the national Partnership for America is Health Care Future (PAHCF), according to reporting by the. The dark money group is not alone: 149 individual lobbyists in the state are registered as opposing the legislation. These lobbyists represent AHIP, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group, and Kaiser Permanente, among other corporate interests. Americans for Prosperity, the Koch network is political advocacy arm, has sixteen lobbyists alone registered in opposition of the bill. These influence peddlers have already had significant success. Last year, lobbyists helped kill a public option proposal in the state. This year, legislators proposed a scaled-down version of the public option plan, one that would allow the state to set up a public option in two years if private insurers failed to set up standardized plans that meet certain cost criteria. But even this legislation was derailed by special interest groups. In late April, lawmakers removed the public option component from the bill following negotiations with insurance industry lobbying groups and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) of Colorado, which opposed the bill. The SEIU Local 105 argued that the premium-cutting measures in the legislation would lead to layoffs of health care workers at hospitals.“Even as the bill has changed, they have had the same generic talking points about a government takeover of health care that does not reflect what is actually in the bill,” Roberts said. The health care industry still opposes the bill, even in its weakened state. On May 12, two days after the modified bill passed the Colorado House, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA), a Koch-affiliated political advocacy group, announced an “ad blitz” to oppose the legislation as it moves forward. Their so-called “No Big Handouts for Big Insurance” campaign will involve a statewide ad campaign targeting the rate-setting element of the legislation, according to a TPA press release. The idea that big insurers would benefit from the legislation is more than a little dubious, given that health insurance lobbyists are helping lead the campaign to kill it. Connecticut has long been a flash point in the battle over a public option. Hartford, the state capital, is known as the “Insurance Capital of the World,” because a number of the world is largest insurance companies — Cigna, The Hartford, Chubb, and until recently Aetna — are headquartered the re, and are also major employers. The industry has used its presence in the state as leverage to kill public option efforts. In 2019, Cigna reportedly threatened to leave if the state passed public option legislation. Between that threat and a massive lobbying effort by the insurance industry against the legislation, the bill never passed. Now the industry is doing it again. Last month, the CEOs of Anthem, Cigna, CVSHealth, Tufts Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and UnitedHealth Group wrote a letter to Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, thanking him for opposing the legislature is public option legislation and implicitly threatening to leave the state if it passes.“The pandemic has demonstrated that employees can work virtually, making it easier for companies to choose where they are domiciled and grow,” the letter said. “As a result, it has never been more critical for the State to create a climate that retains and attracts businesses that will help stabilize the economy. All of us will have to decide where it will be best to deploy our resources long term. Private employers and taxpayers should not fund unsustainable public policy pursuits.” (When CVS acquired Aetna in 2018, it promised to keep Aetna headquartered in Hartford for at least a decade, and retain its staffing levels at least until 2022.)UnitedHealth Group, whose CEO signed the letter to Lamont, held a we bin ar in February to train its employees to lobby against the legislation, the previously reported. According to the PAHCF Action is first quarter lobbying report in Connecticut, the group has spent roughly $126,000 on lobbying so far this year, including about $95,000 on compensation and $31,000 on solicitations. Beyond PAHCF Action, health insurance companies and businesses are also engaged in lobbying through other front groups or direct lobbying on the public option legislation. The Connecticut Hospital Association, whose members include dozens of hospitals as well as insurance companies such as Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, has spent $296,000 on lobbying during the first quarter of this year, according to state filings. Meanwhile, the Connecticut Association of Health Plans has spent $133,000 on lobbying and $1,200 on paid media during the first quarter of this year, according to state filings. The group is president is Tim Meyers of Aetna, the insurance giant owned by CVS, and its treasurer and secretary work in government relations for ConnectiCare and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, respectively. The opposition is talking points do not reflect what the bill would actually do, says Tom Swan, the executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, a group advocating for the public option legislation. “A lot of their campaign is just railing against a bill that does not exist,” Swan said.“They are saying, ‘do not let them do a one-size-fits-all health insurance option,'” said Swan, who added that in truth, the bill includes multiple different public option plans and does not interfere with the private insurance industry is capacity to operate. Without action on health care at the federal level, more states may try to take on the health care industry and its national advocacy groups the mselves. Nevada, a state with one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation, recently introduced its own public option bill — and PAHCF Action immediately launched an operation to kill it.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the Kentucky lawmaker said, “I think de funding the police has gotta be one of the dumbest ideas ever surfaced by anyone in our country.”Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:“I think de funding the police has gotta be one of the dumbest ideas ever surfaced by anyone in our country.”pic.twitter.com/JxvoXLvtEw— The Recount (@therecount)June 1, 2021The phrase ‘defund the police’ gained fresh attention last year as protests against police brutality and racism erupted around the country following the death ofGeorge Floydin Minneapolis. While the phrase was widely adopted by protesters, the idea remains unpopular among wide swaths of the population. Just weeks after Floyd is death, aReuters/Ipsos poll found that 39% of respondents said they support the push to de fund the police, while 57% said they oppose it. And roughly a year later, aUSA Today/Ipsos poll found that just 18% of respondents said they support de funding the police, while 58% said they oppose the push. A majority of white Americans, 67%, said they oppose de funding the police, and 84% of Republicans said the same. Meanwhile, just 28% of Black Americans and 34% of Democrats said they support de funding the police. Some Congressional Democrats have championed the push to de fund the police and are going so far as to call for the abolition of the police. After the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota in April, Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.)tweeted, “It was not an accident. Policing in our country is inherently and intentionally racist. Daunte Wright was met with aggression [and] violence. I am done with those who condone government funded murder.”“No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It ca not be reformed,” she added. But, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.)pushed back on the idea during an interview with CNN He said, “We know, the bottom line here, we do need law enforcement in this country for safety and security in our homes and our neighborhoods and our cities.”“But we must demand of law enforcement with all the par that is given to an individual officer that this type of racial conduct be purged from law enforcement,” he added.

I am shaking you know, it is like a rollercoaster. It is ups and downs. I am so traumatised, I think I can say,"" he says. The 22-year old university student was utterly unprepared for the moment at the end of July when he was. The experience has changed his life, challenged his thinking, and placed him on a new path, dominated by the search for accountability. Mr Muchehiwa was waiting for his nephews in the car park of a shop called Tile and Carpet in the Zimbabwean city of Bulawayo, when a group of men, thought to be members of the security services, pulled up and took him away. He was stuffed in the back of a vehicle and driven round the corner, the n transferred into the back of a Ford Ranger pick-up by his abductors. Three days of physical and mental torture, and sexual humiliation, would follow. Zimbabwe: At least 100 elephants die in national park amid droughtHundreds of unaccompanied children on buses intercepted in South African anti-trafficking operationMystery sudden deaths of endangered African elephants now solved, scientists sayA local lawyer, called Nqobani Sithole, may have saved his life. He got a court order, instructing is police force (ZRP) and the criminal investigation department (CID) to find and return him. Mr Muchehiwa was dumped on the side of the road, sporting horrific flesh wounds, damaged kidneys, and a very different understanding of the world. He says he is not exactly sure why he was taken. His political sympathies lie with the opposition MDC-Alliance, but he is not a party member. His interrogators repeatedly asked about his uncle, Mduduzi Mathuthu, who runs a web site which publishes articles and investigations which are critical of the government. However, he could not provide the information - for example on Mathuthu is sources - that they were seeking. Seeking sanctuary and treatment for the damage he has suffered, he found safety in neighbouring. He got himself a place to stay in a scruffy, unlit corner, but has had to leave this hiding spot on occasion. Nightmares and suicidal thoughts have robbed him of his sleep and a team at a psychiatric clinic are trying to help him. In recent weeks, Mr Muchehiwa has started thinking about his future and the prospects for young Zimbabweans like him.""You know, my abduction is just one in a thousand and something must be done to stop the Zimbabwe government,"" he says.""They know exactly who abducted me, they know the perpetrators, they know the people involved, they have all the details in black and white.""Civil rights organisations and human rights lawyers say dozens of government critics, union officials, and political activists have been abducted in Zimbabwe over the last few years. Yet the incident involving Tawanda Muchehiwa is different in one crucial respect - it is the first abduction to be caught on CCTV. A series of street-side cameras captured the operation outside Tile and Carpet, with one camera even capturing the licence plate number on the Ford Ranger pick-up used by a member of the abduction team. The vehicle registration, AES 2433, was traced to a car rental company called Impala, and activists have called on the firm to release the name of the person who rented it. But Impala has repeatedly declined. When the head of Zimbabwe is national student union, Takudzwa Ngadziore, called on Impala to release the information in a press conference held outside one of their branches, he was attacked and beaten by unknown assailants. Later, the ZRP charged Mr Ngadziore with ""promoting public violence"" and held him in custody for five weeks. Mr Muchehiwa, along with his lawyer, have also tried to get the name, obtaining an order from Zimbabwe is High Court which instructed Impala to provide it. But Impala is lawyers said they could not hand it over because police had already ""seized"" the relevant file. Mr Muchehiwa says this explanation borders on the absurd.""The sheriff went there to collect the documents and Impala said they no longer have the documents - you know it is just so ridiculous,"" he says.""How can a company like Impala fail to have maybe some back-up copies of that information? You know that your car was used to commit a crime against humanity... how can (they) say, we are going to give the information to the police, and the same ZRP who are implicated in my abduction?""Sky News has discovered that the man who runs Impala, Thompson Kanganwirai Dondo, is a fugitive from British justice. He ran a nursing agency in the UK, but left the country after he was charged with immigration offences in 2007. In a statement, Cleveland Police told Sky News: ""Our records confirm that this individual is wanted on warrant for failure to appear at court in 2007 for alleged immigration offences.""If he attempted to re-enter the UK from abroad, he would be placed before the courts.""Sky News sought a response from Mr Dondo and a company spokesperson said: ""The CEO has indicated that he legally left the UK as the court case dragged on for more than 13 months.""He legally left the UK as he had no means to sustain his livelihood following the closure of his company.""In respect of the name of the person who hired the Ford Ranger pick-up, Impala said: ""The vehicle with the number plate AES 2433 had been hired from our company by an individual whose name, together with all required documents, we forwarded to police to facilitate investigations on the matter.""As Tawanda Muchehiwa tries to pick up the pieces of his life in a battered-looking dwelling in South Africa, he says he is re-evaluating what to do with his life. He says he no longer wants to finish his media studies degree. It would better to study the law he argues, if he wants to learn how to protect it.""Three days of being tortured, three days not knowing what is going to happen to you, people discussing about how they are going to kill you, in a way it really changes your mind, and I think in my case, it made me to see that there is nothing to live for if you do not have freedom,"" he says.

229,New York Cannabis Legalization Deal Imminent,-9.33,40.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/26/new-york-cannabis-legalization-deal-imminent/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,17,"On Thursday, March 25, New York lawmakers reached a deal to legalize marijuana in the state. But despite early reports, advocates claim the ink is not dry. From bits and pieces making it out of the back room discussions, the deal sounds promising. David C Holland of the New York City Cannabis Industry Association jumped on the phone with us to clarify where the effort stood, as the rumor mill reached its peak Thursday. The NYCCIA is currently described as a think tank waiting to transition into an industry trade group. But it hopes to retain its ethos as it moves forward as the metro cannabis industry expands.“I am not reading tea leaves anymore. It is definitely a lot of hearsay that sounds all very good,” Holland said. “It looks like the governor has sort of conceded a lot to the Legislature and its MRTA (Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act) proposal.”Governor Cuomo is original legalization plan, the Cannabis Regulation Taxation Act, was attached to the budget in January. As lawmakers worked to hammer out a budget deal by April 1, legalization was always in play. But eventually, things progressed to where we could be talking about a vote next week after the bill has had a few days to season. Holland explained that in recent years, while the Cuomo administration worked on the legalization issue, in the end it did not want to leave other budget goals hostage to cannabis legalization. “He pulled it out knowing that the votes were not there for that. It was too big a sticking point,” he said. Once Albany lawmakers enter the legislative session on April 1, they are expected to file their counter-proposal to the governor, the Marijuana Revenue and Taxation Act, as they have in years past. “The fundamental difference between them is basically the board that governs the program for the governor is proposal is five hand-picked people that the Legislature has no say,” Holland said, expecting whatever the final compromise looks like will see the governor is administration give some room there. “In this new hybrid we are hearing about, the governor has three, but at least the re is mixed power. The second big difference under those proposals is not only who controls the program but how are those revenues are divided up and for what projects.”We asked Holland if the deal that is reached includes the effective mechanisms for community reinvestment like equity programs and homegrown, two things that felt absent in a tangible way in the budget plan. “I think it looks much better than what had been proposed by the governor, yeah,” Holland replied. “I mean, this is definitely a ‘do not let the perfect be the enemy the good’ situation, but it is a long way from being optimal, you know? There is still lots of room for improvement.”Holland said every time he gets another little tidbit of detail it all sounds very positive. “You see it all in the hearsay that you are getting there. Each time I hear something, it is something dramatically new.”Holland explained that whatever deal is reached, it is not legalization that comes out of the conference room. The resulting bill from the deal the n has to season for three legislative days that they are in session on the floor before it can be voted on. “I think what they are doing is rushing to get it out and get it voted on early next week before the budget session ends and the legislative session begins,” Holland said. Holland spoke to whether he thought an appropriate level of stakeholder input from the grassroots level was coming in. He spoke from the activist side as director at Empire State NORML and an advocate trying to help businesses lay their foundations for what is to come. “I definitely feel things like homegrown, things like expungement, particularly tax rates to some degree, the community investment, the opportunities, the prioritization of equity applicants, I think that is all very much a product of the advocacy communities,” Holland replied. The Drug Policy Alliance is state director Melissa Moore expects to see the deal done by the end of the month. “It sounds like it is extremely close. It is down to just some real technicalities,” Moore told theVillage Voice. “From what I understand, the conceptual agreement is the re, and we are looking forward to seeing the bill language.”We asked Moore if she’d heard how much flexibility advocates were able to get from the governor is office on the deal. She told us that it sounded like much of the discussion was born from the legislature is efforts. “We have long supported [the Legislature is version], which has much better provisions in terms of community reinvestment and social equity, dealing with all of the consequences, and ongoing lifelong impacts that people have had to deal with because of prior cannabis criminalization,” Moore said. “And truly, you know, ushering in a new era of marijuana justice for New York. Assuming the bill matches up with that, once it is printed, we are really excited about it.”More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

230,Texas Guv Sued For Move To Severely Limit Mail Ballot Drop-Off Locations,-3.0,48.33,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/abbott-sued-ballot-drop-off-locations,https://adfontesmedia.com/talking-points-memo-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,25,"The League of United Latin American Citizens, as well as several individual voters, sued Texas Governor Greg Abbott for his Thursday order that allowed local election officials to set up just one mail ballot drop-off location per county. The lawsuit, filed Thursday evening, alleges that the new policy — which was announced the day before several drop-off locations were scheduled to open — is a violation of the Constitution is 14th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act.“The impact of this eleventh-hour decisions is momentous, targets Texas’ most vulnerable voters—older voters, and voters with disabilities—and results in wild variations in access to absentee voting drop-off locations depending on the county a voter resides in,” the lawsuit said. “It also results in predictable disproportionate impacts on minority communities that already hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis.”County election officials from Harris County, Travis County, Fort Bend County and El Paso County are also named as defendants in the suit, as is Texas Secretary of State Ruth Hughs. The lawsuit notes that counties like Travis and Harris — which have populations larger than some US states and also sprawling geographies — had planned to offer several locations for absentee voters to drop off their ballots. Before Thursday is proclamation, the county election officials “were given no notice that they would be required to change their election operations in under 24 hours,” the lawsuit said. Texas has been extremely resistant to making voting easier in the pandemic — it is one of a very few number of states not letting fear of COVID alone count as an excuse to vote absentee — but Abbott did issue orders earlier this year extending the period for in-person early voting as well as the period voters would have to submit their mail ballots in person. The latest proclamation undermines that initiative, and came after Abbott faced a backlash from members of his own party who sued him in court over the moderate voter access measures had taken in light of the pandemic. The new lawsuit alleges that “Abbott has provided no meaningful justification for the one-per-county limit on drop-off locations” and that the proclamation is invocation of security was “unexplained.”“Defendants’ insistence that every county in Texas provide only a single absentee ballot drop box—regardless of geographical size or population—requires that counties provide voters with disparate access to the franchise. Texas is 254 counties vary dramatically in both physical size and population,” the lawsuit said.”The use of county lines as the delineation for the number of voting resources that may be provided is the refore arbitrary.”The counties that stand to take brunt of the negative impact of Abbott is order are those that have disproportionately high minority populations. The lawsuit alleges that the limits violate the Voting Rights Act because “because they deny and abridge the right to vote on account of race and language minority status.”Read the lawsuit below:",2,1,Talking Points Memo

The Senate unanimously passed a decision on Tuesday establishing June 19 asJuneteenth National Independence Day, a federal holiday celebrating the end of slavery in the USs. The day has long been celebrated within the Black community, but legislation gained traction during theBlack Lives Matteruprising following the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin. Couple that with the Democrat majority in Congress, and the bill was passed with little pushback. Wisconsin Republican senator Ron Johnson did express opposition to the bill in 2020, but said in a statement that he will support it since “there is no appetite in Congress to further discuss the matter.”Vice President Kamala Harris introduced the bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2020 when she was still a senator. “Juneteenthis a day to remember the millions who died from enslavement in America, and those who survived and fought to end it,” Harris tweeted on June 18 of last year. “And it needs to be a national holiday. We are introducing a bill to do just that.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Juneteenth will become a federal holiday once passed by the House of Representatives. However, the announcement has been met with some criticism, with many pointing out that this is a distraction from important racial issues.

Governor Phil Murphyannounced Monday that New Jersey is lowering the number of people allowed at both indoor gatherings from 25 to 10 and outdoor gatherings from 500 to 150 in order to combat the surging second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The latest executive order details different restrictions for pro and college sports than from youth and high school sports. TheGiants, Jets, and Rutgers football have all been playing to nof ans despite the previous caps. And Rutgers announced i twill have nof ans this winter for basketball or wrestling, either. But in case the re is a chance other colleges or the Devils having fans if the NHL resumesJanuary 1 as planned, here are the guidelines under the new executive order:The limits are a bit more strict for youth and high school sports in New Jersey:The order has already sparked confusion over what the limits mean for Thanksgiving football games — heavily attended events on on the high school schedule. The order explains college and pro athletic programs are “readily able to establish comprehensive protocols for the athletes participating within their programs, including by placing limitations on outside activities, subjecting participants to regular testing, and requiring athletes to reside in a specified location.”Murphy said Monday that it does not give him “any pleasure to institute these restrictions.”“I, for one, have a son whose sports events I may now not be able to attend,"" the governor said during his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton. ""As a parent, I understand the importance of watching our kids play and the thrill of cheering them on. But, right now, with the numbers we are seeing, we have to take these steps to preserve and protect — as best we can — public health and to try to slow the spread of this virus.”Murphy added that “indoor sports is an area of concern” and sports “generally is an area of concern.”The state had recently banned all indoor interstate organized sports up to the high school level to fight the virus. Still, the governor said it is “very hard to distinguish” whether it is from the actual sporting event or pre- or post-game activities — “whether it is the locker room or a pizza party.”Murphy also said specifically that “hockey is in our crosshairs.”“I am not sure why, but we are hearing more than anecdotal, more than here or the re, a lot of noncompliance, including by parents,” he said. “I have got nothing against hockey, but watch yourselves. We have that high on the list right now. And unless we see better compliance and lower levels of infection, we will take action.”CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES:Live map tracker|Newsletter|HomepageIndoor religious services and celebrations, political activities, weddings, funerals and memorial services, and performances in New Jersey will continue to be limited to 25% of capacity but with a maximum of 150 people. Indoor dining will also remain limited to 25% capacity, Murphy said. The governor stressed that even in outdoor gatherings, people are still subject to social-distancing restrictions and required to wear masks when it is not possible to keep your distance from others. New Jersey reported 3,399 new cases Friday, 4,395 on Saturday, 4540 on Sunday, and2,232on Monday. Both Saturday and Sunday is cases broke records — but with a caveat. The state is testing capacity in the spring was about 4,000 tests a daily, while current daily testing ranges from between 15,000 to 55,000 a day, according to the state Department of Health is COVID-19 dashboard. That means there were likely many more cases in the spring that went undetected. Hospitalizations are still far below the more than 8,000 patients New Jersey had in April and deaths have so far not risen at the rate they did in the spring. Still, hospitalizations are at their highest level since June, daily percent positivity is steadily climbing and officials warn deaths are likely to increase. There were 2,320 patients hospitalized in New Jersey with confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases as of Monday night — the most since May 30. The state reported 14 more deaths Monday. The executive order says that about 13% of all outbreaks in New Jersey between March 20 through November 1 came from private gatherings. Murphy has instituted a number of other restrictions to help fight the spread. New Jersey bars and restaurants are now required to close indoor dining between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. each day. Plus, the governor has given local governments the choice to institute 8 p.m. business closings if they want. The governor also said Mondaythe state reserves the right to order another near-lockdown like it did to combat the first wave in the spring.“Sadly, we have to with these numbers,” Murphy said.

Courtesy of Anat Sultan-DadonAs a group of Orthodox Jews walked home following Shabbat services last week in suburban Atlanta, two days after a cease fire ended 11 days of conflict between Israel and Hamas, a man walking in another direction made the Nazi salute and yelled, “Hamas should have killed you all.”That same day, Rabbi Chaim Neiditch was walking home from synagogue with his wife and four young children when a motorist slowed down and yelled at the m, “Free Palestine!”“I did not see him and I did not think anything of it, but my wife is vice president of the synagogue and she informed the security team the re,” he said. Leslie Silverman, who also lives in the community, said her family has not been targeted but that she has told her 10 and 12-year-old daughters that from now on when they go out they must “walk with a friend — they cannot walk by the mselves. I said they must be aware of their surroundings. If someone drives by, rolls down the window and says something, they should turn and run to the nearest house and tell a grownup right away. Most of my friends are having the same conversation with their children.”The number of antisemitic incidents in the USs has spiked since Hamas fired a barrage of long-range rockets at Jerusalem earlier this month, prompting Israel to respond with targeted attacks on the Gaza Strip. The Secure Community Network, which advises Jewish communities on security matters, recorded an 80 percent jump in incidents this month stemming from the Mideast conflict. Gavin Ellman, who heads the security committee at Congregation Beth Jacob in Atlanta, observed that when these incidents first started in this heavily Jewish community of Toco Hills, “people were surprised because it is not something we normally see. If you see a fire or someone being attacked, you call 911. But when you get yelled out, people is first instinct is not to call 911.”The importance of parents speaking with their children about what is happening cannot be understated, according to Norman Blumenthal, a psychologist and the Zachter Family Chair in Trauma and Crisis Counseling at Ohel Children is Home and Family Services in New York.“The first thing you have to do as a parent is to have a position yourself so you are clear where you stand,” he said. “It is like when you are on an airplane and they tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you do your child. So talk it over with your spouse first.… The kids are watching you, not just listening to your words. They are listening to the quiver in your voice. If you tell them there is no danger and you are shaking, they will think there is danger; you are not going to fool your children. They read us like books.”The challenge today is that although there is an increase in antisemitic assaults — both physical and verbal — most Jews are safe.“You have to have a nuanced message,” Blumenthal said. “You ca not say this is another Kristallnacht. On the other hand it is not as safe as it was a few weeks ago. We have to take precautions we have not in the past. On the other hand we do not have to crawl into our basement with a gun.”Blumenthal, who on June 1 will speak at a free Zoom we bin ar at 8:30 p.m. about helping children cope in increasingly scary times (register at: Ohel Webinar), said parents should have different messages based on their child is temperament. A child who has a tendency towards anxiety would be asked to calm down first before telling him what is going on. And a child who is a daredevil and who says he will fight back must be scared more. In addition, parents should have different messages depending on the age of the child. Rabbi Adam Starr, center, at a pro-Israel rally in Atlanta. Blumenthal said he found that the “venom against Israel and Jews is way disproportionate” on social media, which is “scary to young people who are reading it. It needs to be processed with their parents. Even if they are not physically threatened, they are threatened by the messages on the site.”Rabbi Neiditch, who is executive director of the Orthodox Union is Jewish Student Union for Atlanta, said he works with about 4,000 teens in 128 public and private schools. He also said he is aware of the online antisemitic statements. Most memorable involved the Instagram feed of a Jewish teen who died last year and whose feed was hit with “thousands of antisemitic posts. It was horrific. I ca not imagine how sick these people are. They posted terrible messages.”Neiditch said that although he is only seeing antisemitic words, he is concerned it will lead to people who will feel justified in attacking Jewish people. I tell [the teens], ‘If you see something, say something. If something happens in school, report it.’ The schools I work with do a great job of dealing with it and have zero tolerance with this type of behavior.”Several Atlanta rabbis told the Forward that although they have increased security precautions, nothing has changed about their way of life.“I spoke about it from the pulpit at a rally we had for Israel last Sunday,” said Rabbi Adam Starr of Congregation Ohr HaTorah. “I told the men to continue to wear their kip pah publicly and told the women that if they have a Jewish star, they should wear it with pride.”Stewart Ain, an award-winning veteran journalist, covers the Jewish community.

According to a cached version ofParler is privacy policy updated in December,Parlersaid it collected a wide swath of personal information that included Social Security numbers, driver is license numbers, passport numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and much more.“Parler is collection of highly sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver is licenses to enable certain features is pretty far outside the norm for social media platforms and not something you see on Twitter or Facebook,” said Zach Graves, policy chief at Lincoln Network, a nonprofit group focused on bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington.“This is something you might [see] where the re is a good regulatory compliance reason, such as showing your driver is license to get an account on ZipCar, or similarly on platforms like DraftKings or PredictIt to verify your identity for payments. But the re is no good reason forParlerto collect this information to, say, enable direct messages.”Parlerdid not respond to The Washington Times’ questions about data mining. ForParler is fans, the freedom from censorship often trumps privacy concerns. Big Tech is battle withParlerhas won it many conservative allies, including Internet Accountability Project founder Mike Davis, who wants government intervention to dismantle the tech companies’ dominance in the marketplace.“Big Tech monopolists collude to cancel conservatives, tell us to ‘build your own’ social media platforms, and they collude to kill those like they are doing toParler,” Mr. Davis said. “Big Tech is a clear and present danger to the free market and free speech.”Much aboutParler— the name is the French verb “to speak” — is untraditional. The company was born outside the Silicon Valley pipelines that created the major social media players. TheParlerapp went live in 2018 as the brainchild of software engineer John Matze,Parler is CEO, and conservative donor Rebekah Mercer. The hard launch to attract users coincided with the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington. AParlerrepresentative was scheduled to speak at CPAC, but the company instead opted to work the corridors of power in Washington to attract big-name allies. On the Tuesday after CPAC weekend,Parlerinvited Trump administration officials, lawmakers, activists, journalists and others to a private briefing featuring Senator Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, in the Russell Senate Office Building. The Las Vegas-based company is outreach to Washington heavyweights put it on conservatives’ radars, but its foothold on the right solidified in the summer. The site had an influx of 100,000 users in one day in June, including high-profile conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, after pro-Trump voice @CarpeDonktum was banned by Twitter and surfaced onParler. Parlersimultaneously sought to attract liberals but failed miserably. Parleroffered a $20,000 bounty for a blue-check-marked Twitter figure with 50,000 or more followers who identified as a liberal to joinParler. While several users applied, no one metParler is terms and the company ended the offer, saidParlerChief Operating Officer Jeffrey Wernick. Unable to make inroads on the left,Parlerbecame the digital refuge for supporters of President Trump who were angry with Facebook and Twitter is crackdowns on the president and his supporters and news stories that portrayed Joseph R Biden in a negative light. Twitter took action against 40 of Mr. Trump is posts in a seven-day span after the election. Facebook and Twitter restricted the distribution of news stories about foreign business deals by Mr. Biden is son. The fallout from Facebook and Twitter is crackdown drove millions of people toParler, pushing the app atop Apple is App Store and the Google Play Store in the days after the election. Approximately 4.5 million users flocked toParlerduring the weekend after the November election alone, according to the company. Parler is networks were strained, and Mr. Matze, whose growing team numbered approximately 20 staffers last summer, was happy with the headache. Parlerhad long spoiled for a fight with Big Tech, and it was beginning to make waves. Mr. Matze is October prediction that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is social media model “will lose within three years” toParlerhad barely registered in the tech community. Facebook said it had 196 million daily active users in the US and Canada during 2020 is third quarter, and Twitter said it had 152 million users in the US during the same time frame. Still,Parler is sharp user growth drew attention. It also drew criticism. Liberal opponents of Mr. Trump accusedParler is users of participating in the riot at the Capitol. The Southern Poverty Law Center labeledParlera “haven for far-right extremism” and a “haven for recruitment and promotion for the January 6 pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol building.”Many users in theParlercommunity were nowhere near the Capitol. Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming were the states that had the most users relative to their populations, according to a study by Global Wireless Solutions. GWS relied on an opt-in panel of 75,000 to 100,000 consumers that measured Android smart phone users’ mobile app usage and content, network performance and consumer perceptions. GWS foundParlerusers are more likely to be White, 45 or older and upper-middle-class (based on college education and a six-figure income) than the national average. The dominant personality trait among theParlerusers was their decision to turn off Fox News. According to GWS data,Parlerusers spent more time on the NewsMax App than the FoxNews App after Election Day. Before the election, they rarely, if ever, used NewsMax is app. Parleris now locking horns with Amazon in federal court and working to get its web site fully back online. Parler is users are still searching for a digital home, but Signal, a secure messaging application, and Telegram, a cloud-based messaging platform, have both reported influxes of users in recent days.

New York-based Blackstone is purchasing roughly 5,800 apartment units from the Conrad Prebys Foundation. It said it intends to spend $100 million to improve the new assets. The deal makes Blackstone one of the biggest real estate holders in San Diego County. It already owns $4.5 billion in assets here — including Legoland and the Hotel del Coronado. The transaction, which also includes Los Angeles-based investment firm TruAmerica as a partner, is expected to close in the next few weeks. The sale of the apartments was praised by Dan Yates, the president of the Conrad Prebys Foundation, who said the portfolio was assembled by Conrad Prebys — a San Diego developer — himself. Yates said the money from the deal will be used for grants primarily in San Diego.“Conrad Prebys was a sharp businessman who found true joy in the act of giving, and I believe he would be honored to see the result of his life is work dedicated to continuing his philanthropic legacy,” Yates wrote in an email. The deal will bring Blackstone is apartment total in San Diego County to 6,700 units, making it among the top three biggest landlords. San Diego R&V Management holds about 8,000 apartments and is the largest landlord.“Blackstone has long been a big believer in San Diego, with multiple investments across our real estate business,” wrote Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate, in an email. “We look forward to ensuring that these properties continue to provide the community with a high-quality rental option at a good value.”San Diego real estate analyst Gary London said the$230 millions ale of the downtown Manchester Pacific Gateway in September to a biotech office developer was the biggest recent deal he could recall.“To my knowledge, this is the largest real estate transaction in San Diego County history,” he said. Even when adjusted for inflation, past deals seem to pale in comparison. For instance, the 25,000-acre Otay Ranch — now the center of homebuilding in San Diego County and nearly the size of San Francisco — sold for $150 million in 1988. All the apartments are market-rate but Blackstone says it plans to partner with nonprofit Pacific Housing to provide services for residents, including after-school tutoring, financial literacy classes, and health and wellness initiatives at no cost. It did not address it directly, but the move seems to counteract earlier concern with the foundation is sale of these holdings. KPBS was first to report that the foundation was looking to sell its portfolio in February. A letter was sent to the foundation in early February from San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, San Diego County Supervisors chair Nathan Fletcher and California Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins tourge them to take into account future afford ability of the apartments when considering a sale.“A substantial number of these units are home to working individuals and families,” they wrote, “and are some of the limited inventory in the region of non-deed restricted, naturally occurring affordable housing options for San Diegans.”Blackstone said it plans to keep the majority of units affordable for residents who make 80 percent or less of the area median income during its ownership. “Blackstone is eager to engage with the State of California and San Diego municipal government to explore opportunities to support and/or add affordable housing in San Diego,” it said. Blackstone is purchase comes as California is set to end its statewide eviction ban on June 30, which has prevented landlords from evicting tenants who could not pay rent due to loss of income related to COVID-19. Blackstone said it has not evicted anyone for non-payment since the start of the pandemic across its national portfolio. Blackstone already employs about 5,500 people in San Diego County. It estimates the new multifamily purchase from Conrad Prebys will create 500 jobs. It said some of its refurbishment of apartments will include addressing deferred maintenance and adding gyms, greens pace and playgrounds. Rent growth was slow during much of the pandemic but San Diego County has seen a resurgence in recent months. Average rent had increased5 percent in a yea ras of this week, said real estate tracker CoStar, to $1,940 a month. Analysts have pointed to an improving economy and low vacancy rates for continued growth. Real estate web site Zumper said in itsApril rent price report that San Diego was one of the few major markets in the nation with rent increases. It said annual rent growth was down in San Francisco, New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Jose, Boston, Oakland and many other formerly hot rental markets. The Conrad Prebys Foundation gave more than $71 million to 112 organizations across San Diego County in March to bolster the arts, health care, medical research, animal conservation, education, and the welfare of young people. The biggest grant — $15 million — went to the San Diego Symphony.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune

The two leaders, whose countries are pillars of the transatlantic alliance, discussed a range of issues where they have common ground: climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and security challenges in Afghanistan, Iran, Libya and eastern Europe. But they also tried to bridge two gaps between the m, involving Russia is nearly complete Nord Stream II gas pipeline to Germany, which the USs opposed, and the administration is desire for Germany to take a tougher stance toward China, its largest trading partner. Biden called Merkel “a great friend, a personal friend and a friend of the USs” in comments to reporters as the two leaders began their meeting. He heaped more praise on her at a news conference later, thanking her for “strong, principled leadership” and being “a stalwart champion of the transatlantic alliance.”Merkel, whose relations with former President Trump were notably tense, said at the outset, “I am very much looking forward to deepening the relationship again.” Later she twice described the meetings with Biden as “very friendly” and told reporters the two nations “share the same values” and are equally determined to tackle international problems “at a crucial moment.”The chancellor began her day at awork ing breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris, and near its end joined Biden in signing a formal declaration for future cooperation on the array of global challenges. They capped the visit with a ceremonial dinner that included officials from both countries. Among the Americans was a bipartisan group of invitees including two former secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell, Congress’ two top Republicans — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield — and Stephen Hadley, former President George W Bush is national security advisor. Biden, responding to several questions at the news conference that were unrelated to US-German relations, said he was not considering sending military troops to Haiti amid the unrest following the assassination of its president; called Cuba, which has been engulfed by protests over food and medicine shortages, “a failed state”; and expressed guarded confidence that he would achieve his agenda in Congress for infrastructure and social spending. The looming departure of Merkel, Europe is longest-serving and most important leader, could complicate Biden is efforts to renew multilateral relations with allies after their tensions withTrump, and to solidify the alliance as a bulwark against Russian and Chinese aggression. Merkel is expected to leave the chancellorship after German elections in September.“She is always infuriated her peers with her ambiguities, but in truth she was actually very predictable,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller, a Germany expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Merkel is departure and replacement by a less experienced successor, she continued, “introduces an element of uncertainty at a time when allies would like to have more certainty in the capital of Europe is anchor economy.”On the issues that divided Biden and Merkel, he could be helped by the fact that German public opinion has turned against China and the Nord Stream II pipeline. The pipeline, which bypasses the key gas route through Ukraine to connect Russia and Germany directly, could be completed by August but has become less popular given Germans’ concerns about the risk from Russia to Ukraine is security. Also,German intelligence officials have issued dire warnings about Russian and Chinese meddling in the country is upcoming elections “at levels not seen since the Cold War.”Merkel is reluctance to confront China “has alarmed policymakers in Germany,” Stelzenmüller said. “Managing China is rise will require using our considerable trade, technological and regulatory leverage to delineate clearer red lines. That is where Merkel has been overtaken by shifts in expert and also public opinion.”At the news conference, Merkel affirmed Biden is positions on China related to fair trade, human rights and the territorial sovereignty of Hong Kong, stating that there is “a common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor.” She added, “How we deal with China ought to rest — and does rest — on our shared values.”Merkel reaffirmed her support fo ran infrastructure bank, a Biden proposal to have the world is largest democracies offer financing to developing countries as a more transparent and energy-efficient alternative to Beijing is Belt and Road Initiative. On Nord Stream II, the State Department last spring eased off the threat of sanctions over the project, partly because the pipeline is imminent completion rendered it a moot point. But Texas Senator Ted Cruz and other Republicans have held up Senate confirmation of Biden is nominee to head the CIA until the administration imposes sanctions against companies helping Russia is state energy company on the pipeline. Biden said imposing sanctions on a nearly completed project “did not make a lot of sense.” He did secure a pledge from Merkel to counter Russia should it use the pipeline to threaten Ukraine.“Our idea is and remains that Ukraine remains a transit country for natural gas, and that Ukraine has a right to territorial sovereignty,” Merkel said. “We will be actively acting should Russia not respect this right.”She did not elaborate on what that action might be. Biden said both countries would look for “practical measures” they could take in such a scenario. Despite pressure from Republicans in Congress, Biden had appeared eager to find a middle ground on the pipeline dispute, said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm in New York. “He does not want to have problems with the Russians while he is focusing on China, and he also wants to be seen as more aligned with the Europeans.”Biden, who has met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin as well as Merkel, has invited Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for a meeting this summer, though no date has been set.",2,2,LA Times
242,"For Our Leftist Elites, the Double Standard is Meant to Be Blatant. That is the Point",23.67,26.0,https://stream.org/for-our-leftist-elites-the-double-standards-meant-to-be-blatant-thats-the-point/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-13,24,"ByJohn ZmirakPublished onJanuary 13, 2021•I came to understand our political situation today by watching gorilla documentaries. Let me explain. At day is end, when I am exhausted, I wind down by finally turning on the television. The last things I usually watch are nature films, on the diverse, fascinating, and mostly apolitical channelCuriosityStream. For a grand total of $12 per year (as of now), you get access to thousands of polished, beautifully produced documentaries on every subject from ancient history to contemporary science. It is the best entertainment money I have ever spent. Invariably, I look for animal films. First of all, I am a sucker for God is innocent creatures, especially the furry ones. But I take delight in all the evidence of direct, Divine design all through the animal kingdom — from speeding sharks to circling condors. I do wish CuriosityStream would air some programming from theDiscovery Institute. Its scientists do much better explaining nature via design than Darwinists do with their “just so” stories and smuggled-inteleology. (“Evolution developed the eagle is eye to make it a better hunter… .”)One thing I notice among most higher mammals, especially primates: the almost universal preoccupation with hierarchy. In some species, only the highest status female gets to breed. Once she claims that position, usually by bullying other females, it goes mostly unchallenged. But much more prevalent are species where the status that matters is male. The dominant male collects a harem of she-gorillas or sea lionesses, and fathers all the group is children. Lesser males steer well clear of females, and accept the scraps from hunts, lest they summon the alpha male is wrath. Often the dominant males will go out of their way to. And that is how to understand what is happening politically right now in America. The default, fallen condition of man — absent Grace — can mirror that of the beasts. Despite our Redemption, we still struggle with the side-effects and lasting scars of the Fall. When our cultures reject the Gospel, that primate dynamic comes roaring back with a vengeance. (And even Christian societies are not immune to this perennial temptation.)The most obvious instance of this arose with Islam. When Islamic warriors conquered their Jewish and Christian neighbors, they developed a system for ruling over vast, non-Muslimmajorities. Polytheists they slaughtered outright, but to monotheists like us they offered the promise of safe, second-class citizenship (dhimmitude). We’d have to pay a special, heavy tax. We could not display the emblems of our religion: No crosses or bells on churches, no public processions or festivals. Christians could not carry swords, ride horses, or work in many professions. If a Christian and a Muslim met on the street, the Christian would have to step aside and show him respect. Worst of all? In such Muslim-run countries evangelization is banned. We are forbidden on pain of imprisonment from obeying the Great Commission. And in many lands, those who leave Islam, including those who get baptized, face the penalty of death. The result? Churches in lands like Egypt, Iraq, and North Africa remain little ethnic enclaves, perpetually on the defensive. The system was designed to gradually grind them down till most of them became Muslims, and in most countries it worked. Not many people, it turns out, can hold onto a faith that renders them virtually Untouchables, and guarantees that status for their children, grand-children, and so on. Whites in America after the Civil War replicated something like dhimmitude for black citizens, offering them second-class citizenship and enduring poverty, as the price of relative peace. Those who refused the unequalJim Crowbargain could expect visits from lynch mobs or the Klan. This basic axiom of fallen human nature explains what is happening right now. Honest politicians likeTed CruzandMarco Rubioare pointing to the staggering double standards applied to right and left. Leftist politicians likeKamala Harriscould praise and encourage the riots last spring. Their own side nodded and smiled. Donald Trump used a few poorly chosen words, and theCapitol Hillfracas gets pinned on him. Now some Republicans are signing on to remove him from office. You can barely drive down a highway without seeing some Trump supporter getting thrown under the bus, by his one-time allies in politics, or “brethren” in church. The same liberals who insist that we ca not pass anti-porn laws, for fear of censorship, applaud when social media monopolies silence conservatives and Christians. They snickered when Trump was to ssed off Twitter, allegedly for encouraging “violence.” They laughed out loud when alternative platformParlerwas shut down entirely Sunday night night byAmazon, whose servers it used. You and I ca not help it. We are driven to point out the gaping double standard, the manifest unfairness. But we should be careful to manage our expectations. If we think it accomplishes anything to point up this injustice, we are probably wrong. Because … stay with me here …. However liberals cling, as part of their weaponizedWokeness, to rhetoric that reflects our old Christian culture and its ideals of equal treatment and justice, they do not believe in such things. Do not fool yourself that they do. Those on the Left may still mouth some old-timey Christian slogans they picked up from theCivil Rights Movement. But in fact they are acting on the brutalDarwinismwhich they believe. Over the past several decades via its long march through institutions, the Left has gained most of the power in the West. From corporate boardrooms to schoolrooms, from press rooms to pulpits. When we electedDonald Trump, they were absolutely outraged, like the alpha male gorilla sensing a challenge from a younger, weaker male. So the Left spent the past four years beating back that rebellion, showing us that even the US presidency could be rendered empty, if they wished. Now that they have fully established who is in charge, do not expect magnanimity, or even basic fairness. Instead expect leftist Sharia, the systematic humiliation and relentless degradation of anyone who dissents. At this point, exposing the double standards becomes almost counterproductive. The message the Left wants to send could not be clearer: “Yes, of course there are double standards. That is what you get for being an infidel, for rejecting our creed. However, if you wanted to sign on this dotted line … all your troubles would be over.” Asreported, Antifa mobilized on January 11 in New York City to meet a rumored pro-Trump demonstration. Like a troop of alpha apes, Antifa claimed the public square for its own. Footagefrom the march showed a large group of demonstrators marching and chanting: “Whose streets? Our streets!” Othervideo posted on social media showed a protester dressed in a police uniform wearing a pig mask walking alongside New York Police Department officers. Beyond the wish to browbeat and gaslight the masses into surrender, the re is a certain dark, fallen primate glee entailed in exercising raw power. Never underestimate that. Orwell did not, when he gave as the goal of the regime in[A]lways there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever. Expect some among us to give up the “hopeless” crusade against the new, implacable power of the anti-Christian Left. They see the deal that is offered the m: safe but degrading dhimmitude. And they accept it. “I, for one, welcome our new Woke overlords!” you can see them saying on social media and in columns. That is the real message they are sending when they wring other people is hands and demand that they “atone” for backing Trump. Someservile types are auditioning to work as Christian scribes at the Sultan is court, where deference is rewarded with Turkish Delight, such as Narnia is Queen offered Edmund, inWe must pray for the strength to say “No” over and over, to persevere regardless. The great persecutor of Christians Diocletian was mortal, and so was his regime. No one saw Constantine coming.",0,0,The Stream
243,"Republicans Have Organized a Backlash Convention, and It is Tearing This Country Apart",-17.0,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kenosha-republican-convention/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"The political strategy of the Republican National Convention has been evident from the moment it opened. The organizers are determined to stir a backlash vote against every Democrat who has displayed even modest regard for the need to address police violence and systemic racism. There is a reason for this. President Trump and his partisans are well aware that he cannot win an election based on his record of mismanaging the response to a pandemic and mass unemployment, and of dividing the country against itself with racism and xenophobia. So they are amplifying those divisions in hopes of identifying a narrow, ugly, and exceptionally dangerous path to victory. The Republican convention is apocalyptic tone is drawing sharp criticism, especially in the battleground state of Wisconsin, where a gunman killed two demonstrators who were protesting in Kenosha following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man. The deaths shocked the state and had people complaining that the raw rhetoric long employed by the president and now being amplified by his surrogates is kindling chaos. Trump opened this week is convention with an ominous warning that the party is Democratic rivals “will take your guns away as sure as you are standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic, they let them riot every night. We are saying, let us come in and solve your problem.” It was on Monday that Trump was in Charlotte, NC, spinning his dark tale of Democratic cities overrun by riotous mobs. On Tuesday night, in the historically Democratic city of Kenosha, a heavily armed 17-year-old white man was seen firing multiple rounds at demonstrators who had joined the third night of protests. Those protests began Sunday evening after videos circulated showing a police officer grabbing Blake by his T-shirt and repeatedly shooting him in the back. When the shooting stopped on Tuesday night, two demonstrators were dead and one more was severely wounded. The alleged shooter identified with the so-called “militias” that appeared on the streets of Kenosha as the demonstrations grew in intensity. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that these armed men were “like a vigilante group.” Only now are many Americans learning about the character of these militias, and about the Illinois youth who has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide. According to a BuzzFeed report published Wednesday: The law enforcement–obsessed 17-year-old who was charged with shooting and killing two people and injuring another in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during protests for Jacob Blake appeared in the front row at a Donald Trump rally in January. Kyle Howard Rittenhouse is social media presence is filled with him posing with weapons, posting “Blue Lives Matter,” and supporting Trump for president. Footage from the Des Moines, Iowa, rally on January 30 shows Rittenhouse feet away from the president, in the front row, to the left of the podium. He posted a TikTok video from the event. The news of Tuesday night is shootings led Democrats to speak in stark terms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi complained on Wednesday about “the encouragement that the president…gives to vigilantes coming in to make matters worse.” Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes called out Trump is rhetoric and “the message coming from the top about how to handle people who are…standing up against racial injustice in this country.” And they were not alone in noticing. Philip Bump of The Washington Post observed, as the convention is third night concluded: If Rittenhouse shot those two people dead, there was some spur for him to do so that simply does not exist for most other people. It is facile to assume that we can identify that spur as the rhetoric offered by President Trump and his reelection campaign. But it is impossible not to notice how that rhetoric echoes in what appears to have happened in Kenosha. The sharpest criticism came from Democratic Party of Wisconsin chair Ben Wikler, who said, “Trump and his allies have fearmongered and stoked hate against those standing in opposition to racism and injustice, and conflated peaceful protests with rioters. Trump egged on armed right-wing militias through calls to ‘liberate’ states during stay-at-home orders; Trump is Republican National Convention has speakers spreading conspiracy the ories about the destruction of the suburbs.” Wikler was referring to a convention appearance Monday by Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who in June pointed a semiautomatic rifle and a semiautomatic handgun at participants in a Black Lives Matter march that was passing their mansion in a wealthy neighborhood. “America is such a great country that you not only have the right to own a gun and use it to defend yourself, but thousands of Americans will offer you free advice on how to use it. At least that is what we experienced,” Mrs. McCloskey chirped. Mr. McCloskey jumped in to say, “It seems as if Democrats no longer view the government is job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens.” Then Mrs. McCloskey was back to complain that Democrats “are not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities. They want to abolish the suburbs altogether.” The McCloskeys have not been outliers on the convention stage. They have joined a chorus of voices that stoked fears for political purposes. “Look at what is happening in American cities, cities all run by Democrats,” Representative Jim Jordan announced in a wide-eyed virtual speech on the convention is opening night. “Crime, violence, and mob rule. Democrats refuse to denounce the mob, and the response to the chaos, defund the police, defund border patrol, and defund our military,” ranted the Ohioan. “And while they are doing all this, they are also trying to take away your guns. Look at the positions they have taken in the past few months. Democrats will not let you go to church, but they will let you protest. Democrats will not let you go to work, but they will let you riot. And Democrats will not let you go to school, but they will let you go loot.” Jordan is always over the to p, as is Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who griped on Monday that the opposition would “disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your house and invite MS-13 to live next door.” But the president was also stoking the fire, as were the members of his family whose names filled the speaking schedule. And Wednesday night is session closed with Vice President Mike Pence warning, “The hard truth is, you will not be safe in Joe Biden is America.” Republicans will say that all this talk about “pathetic” governors and mayors who “let them riot every night” is standard convention fare. Like all practitioners of backlash politics, they will refuse to admit that campaign strategies grounded in fear and loathing have in the past to rn countries apart—and could do so again. But after a harrowing few days in Wisconsin, Wikler was warning the president and his minions, “This is irresponsible rhetoric that has consequences.”",1,1,The Nation
244,Joe Biden Proved a Press Conference Does not Have to Be a Spectacle,-17.0,33.67,https://time.com/5950386/joe-biden-first-press-conference-president/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-26,25,"This article is part of the The DC Brief, TIME is politics newsletter. Sign up hereto get stories like this sent to your in box every weekday. There were no stunts or name calling. “Fake News” was never hurled around, nor were personal insults the flavor of the day. The closest thing we got to acliff-hangerat President Joe Biden is first full press conference on Thursday was that he would have more details about his infrastructure plans when he visits Pittsburgh. The most glaring error of fact was on that last point: Biden said he’d be traveling to Pittsburgh on Friday when the White House had it on the schedule for Wednesday. It was, to be plain, a complete 180 from what we collectively weathered for the four years when President Donald Trump would turn the East Room of the White House into a studio set for a fact-challenged reality show. Gone were the pettiness andself-victimhood, the attempts to divide Americans and nurse grievances. Even in criticizing his Republican opposition for blocking popular pieces of his agenda, Biden seemed like an apologist for the jam Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell finds himself in with the GOP. “I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said,” Biden said. Where Trump glossed over details and promised plans that never materialized, Biden had a command of the facts and, at times, excused himself for going into too much detail. Trump would hold forth for hours, jousting with reporters and ordering aides to take away their microphones. “How much longer should we stay here folks?” Trump asked at the end of his first press conference, which lasted an hour and 18 minutes. Biden took follow-up questions, asked if reporters were getting what they needed. He checked his watch so as not to keep his audience too long. He was at the podium for an hour and two minutes. Trump would sneer at female correspondents in a way he seldom would dare with their male colleagues; Biden took the majority of his questions from women on the White House beat. Trumptoldan ABC News correspondent that “I know you are not thinking, you never do” and admonished her for not talking about the headlines he wanted to discuss. To the same reporter, Biden answered two follow-up questions. Trump famously asked a veteran Black reporter to set up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus. Hetoldanother she should “be nice” and “do not be threatening.” Biden was having trouble hearing a reporter from Univision, so he stepped out from behind the podium to get closer to hear her. It was, in short, a return to what has become expected of Presidents. I did not feel the need to watch it a second time — although I did, just to make sure I was not missing something under the surface — because it was a linear proceeding with clear rules and norms that were respected. No one would accuse that hour of being entertaining, but it was informative. Biden has never been an improvising showman and he never will be. A speech impediment from childhood forces him to speak with intentionality; when he starts every sentence, he knows where he wants it to end. In prepared remarks, he notates where he wants to catch his breath and reset for the next phrase. His raw notes look like someone is analyzing a poem is meter. Although he does not match President Barack Obama in his uncanny and sometimes unsettling ability to answer questions and even make small-talk in paragraph formatting as though filing a legal brief, Biden does apply the same logical argument that he has argued his proof. Unlike Trump, Biden does not make it up as he goes. “I will get back to you” is a sincere show of respect. Veterans of all White House — save Trump, of course — and from both parties share the common complaint that reporters judge their bosses by qualities that have nothing to do with the job the American people hired them to do. Communication is a key tool of the presidency, one that those like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton used to great effect. But you cannot argue that George W Bush and his often imprecise communication skills did not change the course of history. Candidates are judged by how well they can convince donors to give them money to run campaigns while actual Presidents are judged by how they spend the tax dollars that Congress approves. And if a President does the job right, he or she spends no more than three evenings of the four-year term locked in a back-and-forth public debate spectacle with an opponent. And if they win a second term — and most do — they metaphorically burn the debate-prep books. Trump stood to change all that. For a while, he did. He turned the East Room intoThe Apprentice is new Board Room. He sent assignment editors spiraling when he took questions on the South Lawn before boarding Marine One. His rallies required teams of fact-checkers. And late-night tweets reset morning shows’ line-ups. Biden made a pitch to America to give him the keys to the family station wagon during his campaign against Trump. Trump did his best to bulldoze Biden and his family while Biden simply appealed to the idealism of America is soul. As this newsletter argued earlier this week, both candidates used their superpowers: Trump bullied while Biden comforted. Voters sided with Biden on an expectation that there would be fewer push-alerts to our phones about insane assertions and irresponsible rhetoric. Biden is Trump is opposite, although he still has to exist in an ecosystem Trump understood if not mutated. A byproduct of television news is that on the biggest topic of the day — immigration, as was the case on Thursday — the networks each wanted to have the President on-camera answeringtheircorrespondent is question. That led to some repetition that Biden rolled with. Critics noted Biden did not get a single question on the pandemic, but it is worth also noting Biden spoke about the successes so far at the top of the event and most questions to him on it would have been a set for his spike, to employ a volleyball reference. To be sure, Biden is press conference performance was not one for the history books. But few of them should be to a typical President is mind. Make sense of what matters in Washington.

The ramp is 8 feet wide so people using wheelchairs can easily pass each other. It is made of smooth concrete instead of other materials, like wood, that can be uncomfortable for people who use wheelchairs, particularly those who do not have head and neck control. A portable nonslip mat makes up the rest of the distance to the water. The ramp was designed to be used by people in walkers, wheelchairs and anyone else who struggles to move on sand. It goes beyond a minimal effort just ""to get people on the beach,"" Buchman said.""We wanted to do something everyone feels comfortable using. They can feel like they are wanted here and belong here,"" Buchman said. He said he visited beaches around the country to see what Milwaukee could do better.""When I was in Clearwater (Florida) you had to pay to rent beach wheelchairs,"" he said. ""That is like saying, 'Sorry you will have to pay $30 per hour to use a public beach.’ ”Bradford Beach has four beach-accessible wheelchairs that can be checked out for free from The Dock. Buchman is group raised $100,000 to make Bradford Beach accessible through its RampUp MKE project, which works to make community gathering spaces around Milwaukee accessible.

246,Britney Spears Gets a Wave of Support After a New Documentary Digs into Her Conservatorship Battle,-2.33,41.67,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a35447508/framing-britney-documentary-reactions/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-08,16,"Britney Spears fans are speaking out in support of the pop star after a new documentary,,analyzed details of her conservatorship battle. The singer has been under a conservatorship controlled by her father, Jamie Spears, for at least 12 years, dating back to her psychiatric hospitalization in 2008, granting him the legal right to make decisions about her person and finances. After the film premiered Friday on Hulu, as part ofThe New York TimesPresentsseries, viewers, celebrities, and supporters of the #FreeBritney movement called for an end to the singer is legal bind. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kacey Musgraves, and Miley Cyrus (whoshouted-out Spearsat a Super Bowl preshow) were among those who shared love for the singer after the documentary dropped. In addition to focusing on the conservatorship, the documentary traces Spears is rise from small-town talent to bona fide superstar and, ultimately, a target for insidious, misogynistic tabloid culture. Archival footage shows cringe-worthy early interviews during which she was asked about her virginity and body. After her breakup with Justin Timberlake, she was slut-shamed in the media over cheating rumors, and he went on a radio interview boasting about how they slept together. Before mental health issues were more widely and sensitively discussed in public, Spears was mocked for concerning public incidents like shaving her head, striking a paparazzo is car with an umbrella, and her multiple hospitalizations.

Spears was contacted for the documentary, but the film states that it is unclear whether she received the requests, given the conservatorship. Her parents, sister, and lawyers involved in her conservatorship also either did not respond or declined requests to give interviews for the documentary. Although Spears has not addressed her conservatorship outright on social media, in legal documents, she has expressed gratitude for her fans' overwhelming support.

Co-host Griff Jenkins asked, “In about three weeks, July 31, we are going to have the first opportunity for conservatives to try and hold the line on the debt ceiling. Yet, Republicans are negotiating for a $6 trillion possible deal, which certainly would increase debt. Do you anticipate conservatives, Republicans trying to mount a stand in three weeks with regards to a debt ceiling?”Hagerty responded, “I think it is going to be a very strong stand that you will see from conservatives. You will see us standing up for what we believe is the long-term future of America. We have got to navigate through this coronavirus pandemic. We have done that. I think the Congress took on debt in order to get us through a once-in-a-lifetime crisis, at least I hope that is the case. But we need to begin to bend the curve back at this point. And again, the policies that are coming out of the Biden administration, a $6 trillion infrastructure package, that is moving in entirely the wrong direction.”Ian Hanchett on Twitter@IanHanchett",0,1,Breitbart

The Biden administration is planning to take a harder line against vaccine-related misinformation propagated by GOP officials and on social media platforms alike, CNNreports, a stance some administration officials have already started to take. “Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health,” US Surgeon Generalsaidin an advisory Thursday, calling it “a moral and civic imperative” for tech companies and others to fight such falsehoods. Administration officials “said a decision had been made” to “call out Republican elected officials and specific social media platforms” in the coming days and “are planning a call to attention more than a call to action,” according to CNN Just this week, the administration took on vaccine skepticism through a variety of strategies, from Vice Presidentencouraging health workers in Detroit to “get the facts out” about the vaccine to teaming up with pop starOlivia Rodrigoto promote the vaccine among young people. The White House is trying to affirm the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to young Americans—currently the eligible age group with the lowest vaccination rates thus far—by capitalizing on Rodrigo is massive social media reach. Presidenthimself may reportedly get involved in the push back against health misinformation perpetuated by Republican officials and right-wing media, though doing so risks fanning the flames of conservatives who have cast resistance to the vaccine as a way of sticking it to their opponent—andpotentially endangered their audience in the process. Fox is anti-vaccine scare campaign has involved inaccurately conflating Biden is door-to-door initiative to get people protected from COVID-19 as an “Orwellian” violation of personal privacy and freedom, among the misleading claims with stakes that administration officials have become increasingly willing to call out. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. With outlets such as Fox News only ramping up panic about government overreach in recent days, as Media Mattersfinds, officials reportedly see that anti-vaccine messaging as helping drive the geographic disparity in vaccination rates, with counties that voted for Biden having higher vaccination rates., director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,recentlywarned of “two Americas” developing, and as theTimesreportedWednesday, “the West and Northeast have relatively high rates of vaccination, while the South has the least.”“In a country that should be able to end its pandemic in short order with widespread vaccination, the Delta variant is well designed to take advantage of the cultural divide,” the noted.

249,Help wanted: Minnesota State Patrol wants to hire more troopers,0.0,48.33,https://www.startribune.com/help-wanted-minnesota-state-patrol-wants-to-hire-more-troopers/572970992/,https://adfontesmedia.com/minnesota-star-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"As fatal crashes surge and reports about dangerous and risky driving behavior are rising, the State Patrol has launched an aggressive hiring campaign to put more troopers on the roads. Troopers retiring or leaving the job for other reasons in the past few years have resulted in a force of 584 statewide, and that is not enough, said Col. Matt Langer, head of the State Patrol. The ranks normally number well over 600, he said. So the patrol is trying to hire 50 or 60 more troopers with funding recently approved by the Legislature. Starting pay is $62,400 annually.""We need our troopers on the road more than ever,"" Langer said. ""Our mission is traffic safety. We are looking for people who want to make a difference.""As of Wednesday, 329 people had died on Minnesota roads compared with 304 at the same time last year. There were 364 fatalities for all of 2019. There also has been a huge spike in the number of drivers caught going 100 mph or faster. Both statistics are concerning, Langer said, especially since traffic levels are down since the coronavirus forced more commuters to stay at home. More troopers would help, he said.""Visibility is key,"" Langer said ""Nearly everybody changes behavior when seeing a squad car. It has a deterrent.""Langer hopes the patrol is social media blitz will attract recruits like Gina deCesare, who three years ago was managing two metro ice cream shops but decided in her early 40s that it was time for a career change. So she joined the State Patrol.""I was already used to wearing a uniform,"" deCesare said. ""I always had interest in being in law enforcement.""DeCesare, who patrols highways in southwestern Minnesota, said being a trooper is all about delivering roadside customer service.""Every stop, I get to make an impression and I get to leave a positive impression on the road,"" she said. ""It is not about issuing citations, but educating the public on traffic safety. I am passionate about distracted driving. When I explain to them what the outcome could be, and I see the wheels turn, that brings satisfaction.""Langer said that recruiting troopers has become tougher in recent years, though that is not unique to the State Patrol. While the number of full-time sworn officers in law enforcement nationwide rose by 8% from 1997 to 2016, that growth has not kept pace with the growing US population. The rate of officers per 1,000 citizens fell by 11% during that time frame, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics, and openings for police and detectives are projected to grow 5% over the next 10 years. About 10 years ago, the State Patrol started its Law Enforcement Training Opportunity (LETO) program to diversify its force and recruit people who might not otherwise become troopers. The program opens the door to anyone with a two- or four-year degree in any discipline to go through training and take the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) exam, which is required to become a licensed peace officer in Minnesota. Candidates who pass the test the n go through a 15- to 17-week training academy. LETO has attracted bankers, teachers, military officers, musicians, unemployed college graduates and women such as deCesare, who was joined in the program by her husband, Joel, who also became a trooper. DeCesare, who is one of 65 women troopers, said she was happy with her choice and knows she makes a difference on the roads.""Everybody can help somebody else on the roadway,"" she said. ""There is a need for excellent troopers. If you are looking for an opportunity to change behavior and change a life, if your values align with the values of the patrol — respect, integrity, honor, excellence — apply.""Tim Harlow • 612-673-7768",2,2,Star Tribune-Minneapolis
250,"Swalwell on Impeachment, Capitol Riot, and That Chinese Spy",-5.0,43.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/swalwell-on-impeachment-capitol-riot-and-that-chinese-spy.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-02-04,25,"There is no better place to build your brand than in the opposition. In that narrow sense, Donald Trump is presidency was good for Eric Swalwell. A two term congressman from California when Trump was elected in 2016, Swalwell is tenor broke through the chorus of criticism directed at the White House to make him, by the end of that strange era in our politics, one of the Democratic Party is most visible stars. He helped manage the first Trump impeachment (which, naturally, he penned a book about) and now he is returned for the sequel. On a recent sunny afternoon in Washington, we sat down (outdoors) to discuss his experience during theJanuary 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the impeachments, his time as a prosecutor, his brief and unpleasant experience as a candidate for president, and the matter of the Chinese spy. Our conversation has been condensed for clarity. I think we are going into this seeing an opportunity to convict. I recognize that it is going to be a challenge, but we think that the facts are so compelling and you have jurors who were also victims. They ran for their lives. They sent the same text messages to their loved ones that I sent to mine. There is got to be a sense among them that this ca not ever happen again. One of the ways to make sure it does not happen again is to hold accountable the guy that incited it. There are my one-on-one friendships, where they will confide that they do not like the guy,There are the ones who say that they are afraid of primaries. I have got a friend on the Judiciary Committee, he will come over to me after a heated exchange between both sides, and he will just kind of eye roll what he just said. It is a matter of trying to determine who is really afraid and making decisions out of fear, who ca not stand him and wants to show the resolve to do the right thing, who thinks it is just a joke — and they are in on the joke and they just have to do this because of the pro-wrestling effect — and the n who actually believes in him? Those are the four categories that I have found among my colleagues. But in the Senate, I think you are going to see a serious case. We are encouraged that McConnell seems open-minded and he wants a fair process. I think the fact that he is not in office, the dynamics are going to be a little bit different in that no one can say this is politically motivated –– not that the last one was, but you ca not say this is an effort to undermine his presidency. His presidency is over. This is truly about trying to hold him accountable, to deter someone from doing this again, and to disqualify him from ever being able to do this again. I was on the floor. I was just so angry, and in disbelief that they were able to breach the Capitol. It was very much the same feeling the night Donald Trump was elected, likeIt was kind of the same feeling of like,Okay, they are on the grounds, but the re is no way to get in. Okay, they are inside, but of course, a couple of police are going to be able to stop them. Okay, they are climbing up, they are going up the stairs, but they are never getting in this chamber. This chamber is secure. This is Congress, we are counting electoral votes. And the n pretty soon when the police officer goes up to the podium and says, “They are right outside,” and at this point you can hear the pounding and smashing glass in the speaker is lobby. He said, Take out your gas mask and be prepared to duck under your chair. It is bulletproof.”And it is like,. But I still thought,No, they are just preparing us. This is one of most secure places in the world. And it was finally when the House chaplain, unannounced, walked up to the podium — and she has served in the aters of war — starts offering a prayer, she just starts praying. I am like,Okay, the Capitol has fallen. She was praying for peace. She was just talking about peace. But to me, I mean, it was also like,Like her version, the House chaplain is version, of our last rites?I was not briefed on that either. Number And they were also, like a gas mask, it is like a newspaper and I would open it up and I know what to do with it. I was like,. So I looked at Ruben Gallego who had served in Iraq. I am like, “Ruben, what do I do with this?” And so he is opening it and telling me how to put it on. And he realizes that others are just like me, we did not serve in a war. So he is helping a bunch of people learn how to put their gas masks on. At two o’clock, my wife text ed me and said, “Are you on the floor?” because she is watching the coverage. And I said, “Yes, they apparently have bombs,” because one of the cops said that, at the podium, that they may have explosive devices. And the n at that point, this is right as the last rights are also being read. I said, “I love you very much, and our babies,” and the n she lost it. She is like, “Do not say that.” And I do not know — what do you say? We just did not know what was on the other side of the doors. You could just hear it and you could see like thousands of people had poured into the Capitol. I regret that I did not even pick up the phone and call her, but it was just so — she would have heard the announcements and people scrambling to put gas masks on. And she is like, “You do not have to tell me you love me, I know, you do not have to do that.” But other members were doing that. One member called her husband and told him where the will is. I think the jurors as victims is the most unique thing you will ever see in a trial. Right? I mean, a Senate juror is obviously different from a regular juror in that you do not get to pick who you have on your jury. They self-selected by being in the Senate. But you have never seen a trial, would never see a trial, where the jurors are truly victims. That is such a unique part of this. Yes. And I think also, it touched on their personal safety and maybe it just gives us a better shot at, yeah, people doing something. You do not want to make him more significant than he is. He is now an ex-president and he will be regarded as probably the worst ex-president. But we also ca not just sweep this under the rug. This was an attack on the Capitol, someone died, 50 officers were hospitalized. My colleagues and staff members and cafeteria workers are traumatized. I just do not think this one is a,Let bygones be bygones for the sake of unity.”I think the re is a sense that unity means justice and accountability. I remember we were going through these narrow hallways that day [January 6]. Madison Cawthornstruck up a conversation with me and we were approaching a ramp and he asked me to push him up the ramp. I was so angry at him, the president, people that were a part of this. We did not know what was going to happen. But there was terror that was brought. But he is in a wheelchair, he asked someone to push him up the ramp. []I think right now it is just trying to think about the next two years, there are 139 of them that did this. How do you work with them? Do you separate those who truly were, in the days leading up to this, a part of the radicalization and the big lie and went and spoke at the rally? Is there a difference between that group and the people that just voted for it, because maybe they thought it heads off a primary challenger? I do not know. I am still, in my own mind, I am trying to reconcile that, because Congress has to function. A lot of people I have worked with on their side voted for it, people that I have gone out and had beers with. It is like,They walk by me now and someone is like, “Hey Swalwell, what is up?”It is just like, I do not know if we are there yet. I do not know if I want to say“What is up?” right now. Axios report that revealed your campaign and office was infiltrated by a Chinese spy circa 2014. Can you talk about what that experience has been like?For my family, the death threats have flooded in. Not just my wife and I, but it is also been for my father, my brothers, their friends. And all for a story where — do not take my word for it when I say the re is no wrongdoing. I ca not talk about the case, but there was no wrongdoing. The FBI multiple times issued statements saying that the re is no wrongdoing. All I can do is just do my job and not let it affect me. There is a colleague of mine who sent a tweet out just attacking me, and I text ed him and I said, “Really?” He called me, and he was like, “Hey bro! How you doing, man?” I am like, “How am I doing? You just sent out a tweet attacking me. Why are you doing this?” He goes, “I did not know I sent a tweet.” I am like, “What do you mean you do not know you sent a tweet?” He said, “Oh, let me check on that.” He called me back, “Oh, my staff sent it.”I said, “Well, take it down. Why do not you call me if you have questions?” He goes, “Well, I do not think you did anything wrong. You did exactly what you are supposed to do.” I said, “Well, the n take down the tweet, do not be a part of this feeding frenzy.” He is like, “It is coming down, I swear.” He texts me, “Just talked to the m, it is coming down.” But he did not take it down, so I called him again, and he goes, “Hey man, so my staff said that this is the best performing tweet we have had. And I am not going to say anything else. If I am asked about this publicly, I am going to say you did the right thing. But if we take it down, it will be so obvious.” I am like,I did nothing wrong. Number There is no wrongdoing. I have only talked about this case in a secure location with the FBI, I told them I would not talk about it unless it was declassified. So I ca not say anything other than I did nothing wrong. There was nothing improper. They have backed that up over and over. If there was anything that was compromising, I would not be on the [intelligence] committee. And [ex-committee chairman Devin] Nunes and McConnell and company were all briefed on this well over five years ago. So to me, it is maddening that it would be perverted to suggest I did anything wrong. I was a young member of Congress at the time and I’d just got on the intel committee when I was approached [by the FBI] for defensive briefing. So I’d never never had been really given any briefings before I went to Congress or during orientation about what foreign governments were trying to do. So yeah, it was jolting. And that is why I did all I could to help. But it also hardened my resolve, when I saw what the president was doing in 2016, to be like, “No, when you are told that foreign governments are trying to infiltrate a campaign, you do not say, ‘Russia, are you listening?’ You help your government.” That was something that I carried with me, which was just kind of anger that they failed the test. I felt like I passed the test, which is why I stayed on the committee. Why the FBI has multiple times said, “You did not do anything wrong.” And I feel like they failed the test. It offended me knowing that they did not handle it the way you are supposed to handle it. Well, I certainly agree that anyone could be vulnerable and I do not think we do a good enough job of like telling people who go into government what the threats are. But once I read like the Mueller report and the early reporting that we found, right after 2016, it was like again, okay, you guys were told and you are still leaning in on this. You are still saying, again, “Russia, are you listening?” Trump was given a defensive briefing and still, they all leaned in and they lied. Again, which I never lied. Like if I had lied, I would have been charged with something. And I did what every person should do, just cooperate, help. And obviously disconnect the volunteer from the candidate. Like that is what you should do. And to the last day of his presidency, I just felt like he always sided with Russia. Like if he had to choose between our country or Russia, he would choose Russia.second impeachment is we do not have to learn about a whole confusing cast of Ukrainian characters. This one is a pretty simple story to follow, it is a single article. How do you think of this within the broader context of the Trump impeachments?This was clear. This is not just about January 6, right? It is not a heat-of-passion crime. Like he did not just go to that rally and spontaneously say that “you ca not show weakness” and that you are a cavalry and that “you have to fight.” It did not just come out of his words spontaneously in the moment. For months, he’d been telling this big lie to radicalize his supporters to believe that the election was stolen. And he knew that his words and his tweets in earlier context had motivated people to go to state cabinets, right? Like “liberate Michigan, liberate Wisconsin.” He saw what they would do when he said that. They would show up and body armor and camo gear and assault rifles. So he had knowledge of what he could do with his words. The name of the [January 6] rally was “Stop the Steal.” And if you are not an elected representative, the only way you can stop the steal is to physically try and disrupt the proceedings. And so the speakers who went before him invoked violence, like [Mo] Brooks and Giuliani. So I think that the case is that yes, the day of the attack was on the sixth, but the attack was completely foreseeable considering everything he had been doing leading up to it. And the n once it happened, he did nothing. Like if he did not intend for them to do that, they would not have taken more than two hours to pass for him to intervene and stop it.battling, it is always asiege. It is all very dramatic. I saw your piece on that. Did you donate?I expect that will be one of the arguments. And of course we value free speech, but it has its limitations. Right? And I think that is why this is not just about the sixth. It is about what he did leading up to it, and the incidents at the other state capitols. That I think shows that he had knowledge that violence could follow his words or tweets. The last case I tried right before I got elected was a criminal threats case. The defendant was a college student and he was in a pissing match with his professor over grades, so he sends a letter to the leader of the Nation of Islam, signed by the college professor, threatening to kill the Nation of Islam leader, thinking that he would retaliate against this professor or something. Part of the argument and in the case was that words ca not be a crime. He was being tried for felony criminal threats. It is his crime. I convinced the jury that the terror that he caused by conveying this threat to the Nation of Islam leader, and the n later to the professor, that there are limitations [to free speech]. And he was convicted. What I think about the most in this case, if you take the president out of the equation, say after he lost 30 court cases, he conceded the election and stopped using the “stop the steal” rhetoric. Say he just did that. Would this violent rally and attacks still have happened? I do not think it would have. I think if you take him out, it does not happen. He is the central figure of all this. And to me, that is the best proof that he is responsible. The challenge here, with the former president, is to tie his words to the actions of the terrorists that stormed the Capitol. As I said, this case is the most unique in the composition of the jury and what the jury experienced. I think that is a challenge but also an opportunity for connecting with them. No, no. Yeah, that feels sleazy or at least dirty. I know, I know. I think it is out of my system. I have got the vaccine. []I hope you believe me. No, I think the lesson I learned was that it was really hard to do that with two kids in diapers and my wife working full time. Yeah, it was not a positive experience for her. She does not look at it like, “Oh, this great experience where we ran for president.” It just was not. I was trying to harness the energy that I put into running for Congress when I was 31 and beating a 40-year incumbent when I was single, no kids, no real obligations. Having two kids in diapers, a wife who worked, being on Judiciary and Intel, it just, I never felt like I could run the way I wanted to run. I do not even think that would have changed the outcome. I was not even happy with what I could put into it. Numberstatement to the press clearingSwalwell of wrongdoing. ",1,1,New York Magazine
251,How a farmers’ protest in India evolved into a mass movement that refuses to fade,-6.33,43.67,https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2021/02/how-farmers-protest-india-evolved-mass-movement-refuses-fade,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,16,"The Indian stock markets“sky-rocketed”in early February. The surge was a“standing ovation”, according to media reports, to the market-friendly budget the government had tabled in parliament on 1 February. The “deep reform” proposals that investors were cheering included the proposed sale of key public-sector enterprises, raising limits on foreign capital investments, and spending big on infrastructure. Delivered duringIndia is worst recession in decades, the budget was proof that Narendra Modi is government had not wasted the opportunity the pandemic had provided to accelerate its deregulation of the economy. Framed by the government as“One Nation, One Market”, the budget sought to position India – a federal system of states – as a single economic unit governed by a strong centralised government, ready to dislodge China from its position as the world is factory. The official optimism and elated stock markets came amid a sharp escalation of what has been described as“India is largest farmers’ protest”, the months-long struggle that has brought tens of thousands of farmers to the borders of Delhi. The contrast between the euphoria of the financial markets and the anxieties of the striking farmers was as jarring as it was revealing of the battle lines fast reshaping Indian politics. Just as the government was proposing more market liberalisation to boost the neo liberal reforms introduced in the 1990s, it was also erecting ab order fence to cordon off protest sites – barriers made of concertina wires and heavy concrete blocks, with thick nails in the ground – designed to halt the protesters’ progress into the city. The state was not just impeding the protesters’ physical movement but also disrupting digital connectivity. There have been regularInternet shutdowns in the protest sites and demands that social media platforms suspend social media accounts that are critical of the government. In some camps, water and electricity we recut off and basic amenities removed to force the protesters to leave. Theheavy presence of armed police in riot gear at this internal border reinforced the menacing atmosphere. A strange scenario was unfolding: the state was gearing up to battle its own citizens to enforce the rule of the market.***Theprotests began last summer in the northern state of Punjab, in response to the rushing through of three new farm laws to open India is agricultural sector to the market. Subsidised and once partly shielded by the state, the sector, according to the World Bank, employs more than 40 per cent of India is workforce. The protests only became visible in national media in late November – international coverage of the mobilisation, still remarkably thin, has been even more belated – when the farmers’ unions gave the call to march to the national capital:“Chalo Delhi”(“let is go to Delhi”). What made the images of seemingly endless caravans of people travelling to Delhi in tractors, trolleys, cars or sometimes on foot so spectacular was not just the march itself but the government is attempt to stop it from reaching the city. Tens of thousands of protesters faced barricades, water cannon and even tear gas shells. Soon, tent cities began appearing along Delhi is outer perimeter as the government refused to allow the farmers entry. The tent cities of Singhu, Tikri, Shahjahanpur Kheda, Ghazipur – once just the names of villages at the doorstep of the capital, have become part of a popular vocabulary of democratic dissent and solidarity. Thethree laws at the heart of this dispute – on pricing, sale of produce and storage – remove safeguards that had partly insulated farming from the vagaries oft he market. While the government claims deregulating agriculture willdoublefarmers’ incomes and improve productivity, the small and marginal farmers who make up85 per cent of the sector fear they will lose out to private investors. The new laws strip away the protective cover of amini mum price guarantee and the system(regulated wholesale markets), leaving farmers exposed to abarrier-freemarket in which they have little bargaining power against the major corporate players. The farmers’ anxiety also stems from previous measures to deregulate agriculture, which increased agrarian distress. The often-cited cautionary tale is of Bihar state, in eastern India, where the liberalising reforms of the farm sector in 2005 eventually crashed prices, forcing small-scale farmers to sell their produce for paltry sums. Faced with debt and dispossession, many farmers became farm labourers in other states where regulated agricultural markets were still intact. Fear of dispossession is fuelling the protests, though their expansion to other sections of society, including journalists, activists and other workers, reflects a wider, growing disenchantment with Modi is “New India”: an illiberal state locked in an embrace with “liberal”, free-market capitalism.***The erection of a heavily policed border on the outskirts of the capital exposes the fractious logic of the great transformation of India into an enclosure of capital. The very idea of enclosure plays out here in a double sense: the real-life enclosure – the physical confinement and digital suppression of the protesters – is designed to quell any opposition to the economic enclosure – the retreat of the regulatory state from ever-more sectors of the economy. The logic of this transformation involves framing the Indian nation as an“investment destination”in the global economy, a vast pool of “untapped” resources, a zone of unlimited exchange and growth. This is where the current iteration of economic liberalisation in India departs from the past three decades. The war-like fortification outside Delhi reveals how crucial the interests of capital, together with unabashed Hindu nationalism, are to the scaffolding upon which the Modi government is erected. Its power base requires the country is capitalist growth engine to be continuously fuelled by a supply of previously cordoned off sectors of the economy. In policy terms, this means an unending cycle of structural adjustments, priv ati sation and disinvestment from the public sector, a complex process facilitated by a strong state that “means business” in more ways than one. This is why the capital-owning classes often root for ast rong leader who can “get things done” – if not through the political art of persuasion, the n through coercive measures to forcibly “liberalise” resources. This authoritarian streak has shaped the pandemic policies of the Indian government, which not only rushed through the farm laws but also promptly acceded to industrialists’ demand for labour reforms that weaken the rights of workers in both the formalandinformalsectors. The changes include looser hire and fire policies,longer working hours,reduced social protection and restrictions on the right to strike.***This powerful alliance between the state and capital explains why the Modi government neither brooks dissent nor hesitates to take harsh measures against critics, including cracking down on activists and journalists. The severity of the government is response despite its political strength – it has full control of the state apparatus and faces almost no meaningful political competition – is evidence that the anti-farm law mobilisation poses the most sustained and direct challenge to this alliance yet. That the movement emerged and continues to expand during a relentless pandemic indicates the desperation of the protesters. To the drumbeats of hyper-nationalism, the ruling party and its supporters have tried to de legitimise the protests in various ways, including smearing Sikh protesters as Khalistani separatists, posing as“locals”to demand the removal of the protest camps, and consistently casting the protesters as“rich farmers”, even though this is unsupported byfacts. Yet these attacks have failed to dent the movement. Far from petering out, it continues to grow, building new solidarities across caste, class, religion and region. One probable reason for the continued popular support is widespread disillusionment with the free-market formula; instead of spreading prosperity, liberalising reforms have produced high unemployment and increased income inequality. Equally alarming for many is the majoritarian impulse of Hindu nationalism and the aggressive marginal i sation of minority groups. Thus, it is hardly a surprise that the language of love and solidarity has been key to the vocabulary of the protesters, the very opposite of the hyper-nationalist rhetoric that thrives on social division and exclusion. Everyday life in the tent cities at Delhi is periphery offers a vision of a shared community built on voluntary labour that strives to be inclusive. These protest cities did not emerge from a pre-existing solidarity but have, through the protest itself, created the opportunity to forge new solidarities. Half a year on, the original farmers’ protest has evolved into perhaps the largest mass mobilisation in post-colonial India is history, one that spans rural and urban populations, and conjoins the revolt against deregulated capitalism to the struggle for civil liberties. The widespread sense of vulnerability, the fear of exploitation at the hands of an overweening state and large corporations are the common experiences continuing to drive the protest. As one farmer said of the new reforms, “It will not be a market for farmers, it will be a stock market.”Related",1,1,New Statesman

McEnany — who has defended Donald Trump is conspiracy the orizing in the past — wrongly accused the media of trafficking in conspiracy the ories. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday told a reporter that questions over the ever-changing story surrounding Donald Trump isunannounced visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Centerin November 2019 amount to a conspiracy theory. Trump is visit to Walter Reed has once again made news after a book from New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt reported that Mike Pence was put on standby while Trump went to the hospital. Trump the n fanned the flames, denying that he had been hospitalized for “mini strokes” — which no one had accused him of. NBC News’ Peter Alexander asked McEnany about Trump is visit to the hospital: “The president said he went there to begin his physical. This week, he said he was there to complete his physical. Which one was it?”That is when McEnany accused “the media” of “engaging in conspiracy the ories about the president is health.”“I am not engaging in conspiracy the ories,” McEnany said. McEnany is comment came roughly 60 seconds after she herself engaged in conspiracy the ories. She said the Department of Justice will be “pursuing domestic terrorism charges against antifa” — something experts have said is impossible because anti fa is not an organized group with a single ideology, making it unenforceable as a terrorist organization,according to the Washington Post. In addition, Trump had recently endorsed a GOP candidate who traffics in dangerous conspiracy the ories and has pushed debunked conspiracy the ories several times over the course of this term in office. Back in August, after Trump endorsedMarjorie Taylor Greene— a Republican House candidate who believes in the bizarre and dangerous QAnon conspiracy theory — McEnany defended Trump by claiming that he “has not done a deep dive into the statements.”McEnany also defended Trump back in June, when he lobbed a false accusation that a 75-year-old man brutalized by police was a member of anti fa and faked his injuries.“The president was raising questions based on a report that he saw. They are questions that need to be asked,” McEnanysaidof Trump is attack on the man. The first day was a breeze.

253,Read new Michael Cohen court documents that may offer clues on Mueller probe,-2.67,48.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-michael-cohen-court-documents-that-offer-clues-on-mueller-probe,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"A federal judge in New York dropped a few more bread crumbs Tuesday around special counsel Robert Mueller is investigation, unsealing nearly 900 pages of court documents surrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney and fixer to President Donald Trump. These are the affidavits and search warrants which gave officers the legal authority to search Cohen is homes and offices in 2018. In the m, officials in the Southern District of New York laid out their suspicions about Cohen, how they planned to investigate and why those warrants were needed. Released months after they were first requested by news organizations, the documents are an early outline of the cases against Cohen, which played out in two separate investigations, one by Mueller is team and another by federal prosecutors in New York. They also point to the cache of evidence the special counsel is office has from Cohen and raise questions about who else may be tainted by it. The filings reveal that in July 2017, when Cohen was still referring to himself as the “personal attorney to President Donald J Trump,” the FBI obtained search warrants for Cohen is email. Investigators specifically gained permission to search em ails dating back to January 2016. That period included the first few months of Trump is presidency, as well as much of the 2016 campaign. Those are also key, disputed months in terms of Trump is personal interest in Russia. Michael Cohen recently testified before Congress that Trump continued discussing a possible hotel deal in Russia through the first half of 2016. Cohen had previously testified that the discussions had stopped in early 2016, but later said that was a lie. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Cohen is now an unreliable witness who is inventing stories about Trump in order to gain sympathy in court and reduce his prison time. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and to several counts of campaign and finance violations. Also of interest in the documents: nearly 20 pages devoted to Cohen is “illegal campaign contribution scheme,” which were entirely redacted by the judge. That is likely a reference to the case in which Cohen pleaded guilty to paying off two women to keep their alleged affairs with Trump silent during Trump is presidential campaign. Cohen has said Trump personally approved of and repaid him as part of that scheme, including making some payments as president in 2017. The White House has repeatedly said Cohen is account is untrue. According to the court papers, authorities were eyeing Cohen for multiple crimes, including bank fraud and making illegal campaign contributions in the 2016 cycle. A judge approved searches of Cohen is Park Avenue apartment, downtown Manhattan office, a safe deposit box, hotel room and two Apple iPhones — leading to FBI raids that received significant media coverage last year. But the documents include some interesting details about the searches, such as a note that specifically gave investigators permission to “depress the fingerprints and/or thumbprints of Michael Cohen onto [his iPhone] or hold [the iPhone] in front of Cohen is face … in order to gain access”. While these are high-profile court papers, they do not substantially add to what we already know about the actions of Cohen or anyone else in the Trump campaign or Trump Organization. But the court filings underline one key aspect of Mueller is investigation: The special counsel appears to have far more documents than the public knows about — and his team has had those documents for a significant amount of time.",2,2,PBS

US District Judge Ann Donnelly, who said at a recent hearing that she likes her courtroom to be “no drama,” had previously ruled that the media and members of the public wishing to attend the hot-button trial must watch via a video feed from two overflow courtrooms. The court clerk said in a news release last month that the judge was following COVID-19 health and safety protocols still in place at the courthouse. But in a four-page letter, outlets such as ABC, CBS, Buzzfeed, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and others asked Donnelly to consider allowing a pool of six reporters each day into the trial courtroom itself, where the reactions of Kelly, jurors and witnesses can be picked up and nuances of testimony better assessed. The letter said access to the trial was particularly important in this case since reporters have been “critiqued for ignoring or making light of the stories of R Kelly is alleged victims” because of his stature and that the alleged victims are Black women and girls. “Simply put, this is a trial of unique public importance, one at the nexus of critical issues of race, gender, and sexual violence, where media coverage is imperative,” the letter stated. Forcing all reporters to watch from an overflow room would also put them at the mercy of technological difficulties that invariably arise, according to the letter. In the recent trial of drug lord El Chapo, for example, which took place in the same courthouse, “reporters in the overflow room missed the prosecutor is opening statement because either the prosecutor is microphone was turned off or because the technology was simply not functioning,” the letter stated. According to the letter, health concerns over the ongoing pandemic have been alleviated as more people are vaccinated, and having a small pool of reporters would mean measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing could still be enforced. “Indeed, currently, courtroom after courtroom is becoming available to the public,” the letter stated. “There is no reason that such an important and high profile case should not follow this trend.” The trial is expected to last a month or more. Kelly, who is being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, also faces charges in US District Court in Chicago related to alleged sex abuse of minors, as well as separate indictments brought in Cook County.",1,2,Chicago Tribune

An internal memo was sent Thursday notifying all troopers that the head of the agency is NYC Troop, Major Douglas Larkin, will take over the governor is Protective Services Unit from Dave Dively effective next week. The change was first reported by the Albany Times Union on Friday.“Superintendent [Kevin] Bruen directed a thorough internal review of all aspects of the PSU, which resulted in recommendations to professionalize the unit, including changes to leadership and procedures,” trooper spokesman Beau Duffy told The Post in a statement. Staff Inspector Jennifer Gottstine will oversee the change and “include the appointment of permanent rank commissioned officers to the unit is command staff,” the agency said. Dively is a ‘technical’ lieutenant who has served on the detail for 11 years but did not take the necessary exams according to agency requirements that would permit him to lead and instead will be transferred to the NYS Intelligence Center, the paper reported. AG Letitia James’ bombshell sexual harassment report released August 3 concluded Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women — one of them identified as “Trooper #1.”In the report, the trooper told investigators that the former governor ran his hand or fingers across her stomach and back, kissed her on the cheek and openly ran his hand over her abdomen as she held a door open for him, making her feel “completely violated.”The ex-pol also asked her for help in finding a girlfriend and asked her why she did not wear a dress, according to the report. Cuomo is personal attorney Rita Glavinhas admittedCuomo “may have touched” the trooper is back, but in recent weeks wrote a letter to the state Assembly Judiciary Committee — which is in the process of finalizing a report on Cuomo is harassment allegations as well as other topics — where she denied the ex-pol sexually harassed all 11 women in the AG is report. When asked during a Wednesdaypress conference how many women Cuomo allegedly harassed, Glavin said defiantly “none.”She has since asked James’ office to amend parts of the report in a 150-page submission and appoint an independent investigator to oversee her request.“I think in any organization recovering from a scandal or a shakeup like that I think it is normal they do a shakeup in internal personnel — whether it is a big fortune 500 corporation or any large state police organization,” PBA of New York State Police President Tom Mungeer told The Post.“The members of the detail took a first and foremost seat in that investigation. There were definitely some problems with members of the detail that led to the [former] governor is demise, by no fault at all with the troopers and that female trooper was a victim in all this.”He said Hochul is within her right to make changes within the unit.“If she sees there is a necessity for change, she has the authority to do so,” he said, adding Larkin has “been a friend for over 20 years” and is “a very capable leader.”",1,1,New York Post

There are several potential saving graces for the president here. First, many of the people who are known to have testified in the investigation — Hope Hicks, John Kelly, Reince Priebus, Don McGahn — no longer work for him. It would thus be harder, and perhaps less tempting, for him to retaliate against them. Second, impulsive as he may be, Trump may be wary enough from the problems caused by firing former FBI Director James Comey that he would hesitate before lashing out in response to the Mueller report. And even if Trump did commit the crime of retaliating against a witness, it is not clear who would or could bring charges. He is already committed so many outrageous and obstructive acts during the course of the investigation — acts the report itself will presumably detail — that Republicans in Congress have shown little interest in holding him accountable for.

The robot has been deployed, under Arevalo is supervision, at several construction sites in recent months, including the new Harvey Milk Terminal at San Francisco International Airport and an office building connected to the Chase Center arena in San Francisco. About the size of a kitchen stove, the four-wheeled robot navigates an unfinished building carrying laser scanners and a robotic arm fitted to a vertical platform. When placed in a room, the robot scans the unfinished walls usinglidar, the n gets to work smoothing the surface before applying a near perfect layer of drywall compound; sensors help it steer clear of human workers. The Canvas robot can help companies do more dry walling in less time. It requires human oversight, but its operator does not need to be an expert dry waller or roboticist. It has long been impractical to deploy robots at construction sites, because the environment is so varied, complex, and changing. In the past few years however, advances including low-costlasersensors, cheaper robotic arms and grippers, and open source software for navigation and computer vision have made it possible to automate and analyze more construction. The more advanced machines marching onto construction sites will help make construction less wasteful. According toMcKinsey, productivity in construction has improved less than in any other industry over the past couple of decades. The arrival of more automation may also alter demand for labor in a number of building trades.“They love the fact that it is so consistent, that the wall is gorgeous. But the n the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”Kevin Albert, cofounder and CEO of Canvas, previously worked atBoston Dynamics, a company famous for its lifelike walking robots, and in the manufacturing industry. He says the re is great opportunity in construction, which generates about $1.4 trillion annually and accounts for around 7 percent of US GDP but has seen relatively little use of computerization and automation. “We really see construction as mobile manufacturing,” he says. “There is this natural extension of what machines are now capable of out in the real world.”Canvas is part of a boom in construction technology, saysAlex Schreyer, director of theBuilding and Construction Technology Programat the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He says some of the biggest progress is being made in prefabrication of buildings, using robotic processes to construct large parts of buildings that are the n assembled on-site. But increasingly, he says, robots and AI are also finding their way onto conventional work sites. Autonomous vehicles made by Volvoferry materials and tools around some large sites. Technology from San Francisco startupBuilt Roboticslets construction machinery such as diggers and dozers operate autonomously. A growing array of robotic equipment can take over specialized construction tasks includingwelding,drilling, andbrick-laying. “There are some really interesting things happening,” Schreyer says. An IDCreportpublished in January 2020 forecasts that demand for construction robots will grow about 25 percent annually through 2023. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoOne big opportunity in construction, Schreyer says, is using computer vision and other sensing technologies to track the movement of materials and workers around a work site. Software can automatically flag if a job is falling behind, or if something has been installed in the wrong place. “There is so much potential to do something with that using AI,” Schreyer says. “More companies are going to move into that AI space.”Doxel, based in Redwood City, California, makes a mobile robot that scans work sites in 3- so that software can calculate how the project is progressing. A four-leggedBoston Dynamicsrobot called Spot is being tested for the same purpose at a number of sites. Several companies sell drones for automated construction site inspection, includingPropeller,vHive,ABJ Drones, andDJI Buildots, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, sells software that uses cameras fitted to the helmets of site managers, which automatically capture a site and process the images to identify discrepancies between plans and ongoing work. The technology is being used on several large European construction projects.“It is critical for skilled workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology.”Roy Danon, Buildots’ cofounder and CEO, says the goal is to use the data collected from work sites to help companies design buildings and plan construction schedules better. “We believe we can have a huge impact on planning,” he says, “if we have enough projects that show how you plan and how things actually turn out.”“The adoption of technology in construction has lagged behind almost everything except hunting and fishing for the past decades,” says Josh Johnson, a consultant at McKinsey who follows the building industry. A McKinseyreportlast month predicts a big shakeout across the construction industry over the next decade, with companies adopting technologies and methodologies from the manufacturing world. Things have already begun to change, thanks to technological progress and an increasingly tech-savvy workforce, Johnson says. The pandemic is accelerating the shift too, by making it more difficult to bring workers to a site and forcing companies to reevaluate supply lines and processes. “It is forcing many of these legacy [construction contractors] and large companies to begin investing,” Johnson says. Arevalo, who oversees deployments of Canvas’ robot, says the dry walling robot cannot tackle corners or angles like a human; she says many apprentices see working with the robot as an opportunity to learn how to use more advanced robotic machinery. The company also has the backing of the local union. “It is critical for skilled workers to have great resources in their tool kit, and we are excited to be on the leading edge of technology in our industries by partnering with Canvas,” Robert Williams III, business manager at District Council 16, International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, said in a statement. But this apparently has not quelled concerns among construction workers who have seen the robot in action. “They love the fact that it is so consistent, that the wall is gorgeous,” Arevalo says. “But the n the next question is, ‘When is it going to take my job?’”",2,2,WIRED

Her conspiracy the ories are so dangerous that a viral video featuring Mikovits, Plandemic, has been banned from Youtube, Facebook, and other social media platforms. Mikovits is also being promoted as an expert by a USs Congressman. On July 14, the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, part of the House Committee on Reform and Oversight, held a hearing on ""Guardrails to Ensure a Safe and Effective COVID-19 Vaccine."" The purpose of the hearing was to ""examine the processes that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will use to review and license or authorize any vaccine candidates for the novel coronavirus."" The subcommittee heard from five leading experts on vaccine development and approval. Aboutan hour and five minutes into the hearing, Congressman Glenn Grothman (R-WI) used his time to assert that ""experts disagree"" and suggested the subcommittee should really be hearing from Judy Mikovits:Right now somebody gave me a book Plague of Corruption by Judy Mikovits who is very — sometimes very pro-vaccine, sometimes jaded about vaccines and you know we got five people I think on the panel to day, and nobody is particularly jaded to the degree which she is. I wondered if people feel that somebody like her should be on a panel today or be in the room as we rush vaccines to--to market? Could somebody comment on her or do you think it would be good to have somebody on a panel like this who maybe thinks we are a little bit over-vaccinated in America and is not going to be so gung-ho vaccine, everybody?""A lot of, I think, intelligent people who read a lot are sometimes a little jaded on the vaccine thing,"" Grothman concluded.""Plague of Corruption,"" which was published by Mikovits in April, is ""co-authored by anti-vaccine blogger Kent Heckenlively."" In the book, she ""compares herself to, among others, Galileo, Martin Luther King Jr., and Thomas Jefferson."" She also implied that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ""ordered the murder of virologist Kuan-Teh Jeang, who died in 2013, as part of a cover-up burying Mikovits’ research.""Asked to defend some of the claims in her new book and video by Science Magazine, Mikovits sent a PowerPoint which called for an “immediate moratorium” on all vaccines. In another video, ""Mikovits is wearing a hat that says VAXXED II, which is a sequel to a film that links the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine to autism, a debunked theory.""Grothman has a history of peddling anti-vaccine conspiracy the ories. In 2017, Jeff Spitzer-Resinick visited with members of Congress ""to advocate for better health care and education for people with autism"" as part of Autism Society is Day on the Hill. During that trip, Grothman repeatedly asked Spitzer-Resinick if he believed that vaccines caused autism, another widely debunked theory. As a member of the Wisconsin state legislature, Grothman sponsored legislation that would have prohibited hospital sand other employers from requiring their employees to get flu shots. The bill was opposed by 20 state health organizations. Grothman is not alone in pushing Mikovits into the mainstream. Sinclair Media Group, a right-wing organization that operates nearly 200 television stations that reach 40% of Americans, recorded and published an interview with Mikovits in which she suggested that COVID-19 was by Fauci. Eric Bolling, the former Fox News anchor who was ousted from the network following allegations of sexual harassment, now hosts a weekly show produced by Sinclair. Although Sinclair does not have the profile of Fox News, it shares its ideology and also has a massive reach. It has previously forced local stations to run pro-Trump commentary from former Trump aide Boris Epshteyn. Bolling is show is syndicated on local television networks that reach millions of viewers across the country. This week, Bollinginterviewed Mikovits and her lawyer, Larry Klayman. Bolling made no mention of Mikovits' role in pushing discredited conspiracy the ories and introduced her as an ""expert in virology."" Mikovits used the platform to accuse Fauci of manufacturing COVID-19. BOLLING: Dr. Mikovits, tell me about the -- what you believe Dr. Fauci has done wrong?JUDY MIKOVITS: I believe Dr. Fauci has manufactured the coronavirus es in monkey cell lines and shipped them from and paid for and shipped the cell lines to Wuhan, China, now for at least since 2014. He published that fact and funded the studies that were published in 2015 in Nature Medicine that stated that the original cell line the Chinese used to grow the virus was shipped from Ft. Detrick, USAMRIID, the bio safety level 4 facility there. Bolling did not make any effort to contest this absurd claim, other than calling it ""hefty."" When Bolling followed up later, Mikovits claimed the same lab created ""the Ebola strain in 2014 that killed 21,000 Liberians.""After the segment, Bolling interviewed Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier to respond. Saphier said she found Mikovits' claims ""highly unlikely,"" and she did not believe Fauci ""has been involved in the manufacturing of this virus."" But even during this interview, the c hy ron below Saphier and Bolling asked: ""Did Dr. Fauci Create Coronoavirus?""The full segment was posted online Thursday and was first highlighted by Media Matters. It was immediately published to the web sites of dozens of local stations around the country. Initially, Sinclair defended the segment, saying the company was ""a supporter of free speech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints.""Bolling also defended the segment i nan interview with CNN.""I did challenge her,"" Bolling said, noting he called her claim ""hefty.""When pressed over whether calling a claim ""hefty"" constituted effectively challenging the conspiracy theory Mikovits pushed, Bolling said that he did believe he challenged her. Bolling the n told CNN Business that he was not aware of the viral ""Plandemic"" video Mikovits was featured in earlier this year…... But when asked whether, now that he was aware of the video, he had any second thoughts about airing the segment with Mikovits, Bolling replied, ""I do not second guess my producers and bookers.""But as outrage over the segment grew, Sinclair reversed course and announced it was delaying the airing of the episode. There are a few issues with Sinclair is response. First, it perpetuates the idea that Mikovits is making a useful contribution to the discourse and that her views just need additional context. Second, the decision was made too late. Although the segment was pulled from the web sites of Sinclair affiliates, no correction or notice was provided. The video was also removed from Bolling is Facebook page, but not before it was viewed thousands of times. Bolling is interview with Mikovits also aired on at least one television station,WCHS in Charleston, West Virginia. Support Accountability JournalismGive a gift subscription",1,1,Popular Information

People walk along South Wentworth Avenue on Monday, June 28, 2021 in Chinatown. Following a year where the pandemic reduced Chicago is tourist-dependent Chinatown to a ghost town, there are signs that life is slowly beginning to return to normal. At midday at Cermak and Wentworth, the beating heart of one of the nation is biggest Chinatowns, delivery trucks share the tight two-way street with double-parked cars and cruising sightseers as pedestrians snake between gaps in traffic. Elderly residents are walking the streets again, shopping at local groceries, stopping to chat with longtime friends. Souvenir shops have opened for the first time since a stay-at-home order cleared the streets, and foot traffic is steady in front of the stately Pui Tak Center, a vital social service network in the community.“Chinatown is coming back to the way it was,” Yu Xin Feng, 74, said through a translator at the Pui Tak Center, where he and his wife, He Yu Yong, 73, were receiving their second round of vaccinations. Feng said he felt less anxiety about getting sick or traveling this summer. Still, unlike in some parts of the city, face masks are an ever-present sight, despite a massive push by local Chinese leaders to get older residents vaccinated and the high vaccination rate among the city is Asian community. The neighborhood fell on lean times during the pandemic. While many are eager to get back to business in a neighborhood heavily reliant on tourism, there remains a sense of caution on several fronts. For one, the re is some anxiety over the new variant strains of the COVID-19 virus that some business owners fear could derail the reopening. There also remains hyper awareness following a year of rising violence against Asian Americans across the country. Community leaders believe comments by former President Donald Trump linking the pandemic to China have triggered increased incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes like those in New York and California, and have hurt local economies.“Even in late 2019, we were already hearing about the ‘China flu,'” said Paul Luu, head of the Chinese American Service League. “And it is damaging our businesses.”Some residents were also already on edge because of high-profile violent crimes in Chinatown, some fearing that immigrants in particular were targets.“It is especially heartbreaking when … a family that came here with a lot of hopes and dreams about having a good life in the country and the n something like that happens,” said state Representative Theresa Mah, D-Chicago. “It really affects a lot of people because it could be them.”Lingering fearsThe neighborhood remains a spiritual homeland for the city is Chinese community and immigrants, as well as Koreans, Vietnamese and other Asians and Pacific Islanders. It is a frequent destination for college students seeking bubble tea or residents who patronize groceries, bakeries and medicine shops that carry staples of a Chinese household. In the face of the pandemic and the alarm surrounding hate crimes and street crimes, Chinatown is vast network of businesses and social service agencies both big and small sprang into action last year, quickly organizing webinars, food drives, meal deliveries to elderly residents and a large vaccination drive. Mah is office has worked with Pui Tak Center, which is funded by the Chinese Christian Union Church,and other area social safety net organizations for coordination. Chicago is Asians are tied for highest rate of individuals who have been fully vaccinated and have the highest rate of people with at least one shot,according to city data. Most say workers are happy to get back to normal life.“I would say most people are excited (about reopening), but definitely a few people saying, ‘I am concerned,'” said Emma Yu, executive director of the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Yu said some shop owners were afraid that relaxing mask rules could trigger another wave of infections. “We have heard about the variants, from India and South Africa. People really do not know if the vaccine will really help them for this new (variant).”Mah, the first Asian elected to the General Assembly, said the neighborhood has had to contend with misinformation and “the fear that people had because of the association with the virus coming from Asia.”“Back in January last year, people were afraid to come to Chinatown because ‘Oh no, I may catch it here,'” she said. At some area businesses revenue was down 40% to 60% compared with the previous year, according to Luu, of the Chinese American Service League. “We are thankful it is opening up again. So business owners can recoup and bring back workers and support their local Chinatown businesses.”Spencer Ng, a second-generation owner of the Triple Crown restaurant on Wentworth Avenue, said he could not be happier to see business return to the neighborhood following a tough financial year that saw the25-year-old restaurant facing eviction.“Overall, we were down 60% last year. For a big restaurant like mine and other big restaurants, it is devastating,” said Ng, 36, of Bridgeport, who took over the family business in 2008. By 10 a.m. most weekdays, streets are packed with workers grabbing a breakfast b ao and coffee. In the evening hours, it is crowded with young people of all races ordering rolled ice cream and smoothies. But as customers return, a new problem has arisen:a severe shortage of food service workers across the industry, which creates a major hurdle for a food destination like Chinatown. “I am still operating at 60% seating right now because I do not have the staff to fully staff the restaurant,” Ng said.“Since reopening we have seen a boom in business. It is been incredible. But at the same time it is been hard because we have all the business, but we do not have the staff.”Targeted by criminalsIt is an old story in Chinatown, where generations of immigrants have been targeted by criminals most often because the victims, many of whom speak no English, do not report the crimes. Community residents and volunteers have banded together to perform security functions, monitoring area surveillance cameras after reported robberies and working to convince victims to come forward to police. Last year, a 20-year-old man was charged with murder after authorities said he fatally shot Weizhong Xiong, 38, and Huayi Bian, 37. The shocking double slaying brought about 100 community residents to the courthouse when the suspect was charged. Earlier this year, a16-year-old boy was charged with killing Shuai Guan, 33, a married father, during a botched car jacking in late 2020. In the close-knit Asian community, word of each violent attack or street robbery quickly spreads through the community, through social media, email alerts and neighborhood gossip. Those who work with the neighborhood is large immigrant population say many are subjected to other indignities in addition to being crime victims.“What is a true hate crime? Sometimes when people look at you, they spit at you or they curse at you; community members may not understand that it is a true hate crime,” Luu said. “You are targeted for who you are.”The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University and the group Stop AAPI Hate each released statistics showing a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, despite an overall decrease in hate crimes. The up tick led President Joe Biden to sign a bill directing the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes against Asian Americans. The new law gained momentum in March after a shooting rampage at Atlanta-area spa businesses left six women of Asian descent dead. The killings sent shock waves through the nation is Asian community already trying to cope with widespread reports of racial slurs and discrimination in addition to random street attacks. Feng and his wife, who emigrated from China,have lived near relatives in Chinatown for only five years. They said their early concerns about public safety in the neighborhood have lifted as the year has progressed, and they feel comfortable returning to their normal daily routines. Not just shops and restaurantsWhile Chinatowns inNew York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco have experienced drops in their Chinese populations due to relocation brought on by gentrifying real estate markets, Chicago is Chinatown has remained a vital urban hub, as well as a working-class neighborhood. Chicago is metro area is home to the fifth-largest Asian American population in the nation, according to the American Community Survey. Chicago is early Chinese arrivals in the 1870s, many native to southern China is Canton province and Hong Kong, settled on Clark Street between Van Buren and Harrison streets, quickly building a reputation for the food, laundries and cultural flair they brought to the city.“The Chicagoans found us a peculiar people to be sure. But they liked to mix with us,” a new Chicago arrival said, according to the 2005 book “Chinese in Chicago, 1870-1945.”The neighborhood hosted extravagant Lunar New Year celebrations as early as 1891, according to an archived Tribune article. A piece of Chicago lore reported in a 1927 article saidChinese immigrant Lee Lan walked in to a gambling joint with just 75 cents but left with more than $10,000 after a hot streak. Chinese businesses and old families moved to the current location near the South Branch of the Chicago River in 1912 as the city cleared away the old vice districts in what is now the South Loop. Chinatown remained a crowded center of activity for decades until a period of decline, the Chinese population sinking to just 2,000 by the mid-1960s, as upwardly mobile Chinese and their Americanized children headed to the suburbs. The neighborhood was revitalized following bold planning in the 1970s by local Chinese business owners like Ping Tom, who wanted it to be a center of Chinese culture. The famous Chinatown Gate was erected in 1975. Chicago is surging Asian population chose to return to Chinatown and adjacent neighborhoods like Canaryville, Bridgeport and north Bronzeville.“There are people who have lived here for generations. Their grandparents moved here, maybe 80 years ago, 30 years ago and their parents were raised here. Now a third generation,” Yu said.“Chinatown is not just the shops and the restaurants,” said Luu. “It is a community in Chicago. We have a true stake in the city.”wlee@chicagotribune.comTwitter@MidNoirCowboy",2,2,Chicago Tribune
262,We Did not Think Our American Friends Would Leave Us in the Dead of Night,-6.0,38.0,https://www.thebulwark.com/we-didnt-think-our-american-friends-would-leave-us-in-the-dead-of-night/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-15,17,"When President Joe Biden was elected, we were promised a return to “normalcy.” The grown-ups had come back into government and America would wash away the stain of President Donald Trump is legacy. As the Taliban took Kabul over the weekend, the return to normalcy was President Biden exhibiting the same reckless callousness we had come to expect from Trump. I am an Afghan-American. My father left Kabul as the Soviets began to disappear members of my family. Eventually my grandfather, who was a member of Parliament, forced my father to leave for America. Raised in Queens by a grandmother whose parents came from Eastern Europe through Ellis Island, and a half-Tajik, half-Pashtun grandmother from Afghanistan, I am a product of what made America a global beacon of hope, and a piece of my heart has always been in Kabul. In 2020, along with three young reformers in Afghanistan is parliament, I founded the Afghanistan-US Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council (DPPC) to build a bridge between the young leaders in Afghanistan and the USs. We serve as a voice for the majority youth population in Afghanistan who embrace democracy and freedom. Unfortunately, many Americans only hear about the failures of US involvement in Afghanistan and see our most broken and despicable representatives. If you are a millennial in the USs, the n you cannot think of Afghanistan without also thinking of the endless-war narrative and the rampant corruption and ineptitude of successive Afghan governments. The DPPC was founded so that Americans could learn what their sacrifice, their blood and treasure, had done for my people. When Western forces entered the country, it was a failed state, devoid of modernity and hope. But twenty years later there were so many bright spots. We were making progress for women and girls, in civil society, education, health care, culture, and in sports. We have tens of millions of young Afghans, raised in a democracy, building a future for the mselves and their country, embodying the same ideals and dreams that America is youth have. Afghanistan did not have the benefit of 250 years of a democratic political system to guide us—but we were on our way. We knew that American shoulders could not support Afghanistan forever—but we also did not think our friends would leave us in the dead of night. President Biden was more familiar with the Afghanistan question than any of his predecessors. His disdain for the conflict was well known and Washington should not have been surprised at his decision to leave. However, after twenty years, Joe Biden of all people should know how to make a graceful exit. It is not a secret that fighting is cyclical—come late fall the weather in Afghanistan switches from desert heat to frozen tundra—making movements for exposed ground forces, like the Taliban is, extremely difficult. But the Biden return to normalcy only normalized Trump. Just like Trump in Syria, Biden left Afghanistan without a plan. As an Afghan, I am quick to admit the weakness and venality of the former-President Ashraf Ghani and his government. History will judge him and his cronies very harshly for their nefarious actions, abandoning and selling out the military and country in its most desperate days. But this morning as we watched the Talibanmarch into the presidential palace, many on the American right and left were smugly congratulating the mselves on Twitter for predicting the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. These anti-war leftists and libertarians taking their online victory laps cannot fathom what Afghans are going through. They have never lived in fear, been denied basic human rights or been forced into sexual slavery. They will never understand America is successes. What happened in Kabul is not as simple as a failing of Afghans—like anything else it is more complicated. Afghanistan is military—trained and modeled after that of the USs—relies on air power to support combat missions. For months, more than a third of Afghanistan is air force has been grounded. When you use American weapons they require technicians from US contractors to be serviced. President Biden refused to leave contractors in Afghanistan and the ANSDF has been doing Zoom calls with their American counterparts to service military aircraft. Read that sentence again. The grounding of Afghanistan is air force is not a secret to anyone—in fact just a few weeks ago our members of Parliament with the DPPC pleaded with the USs to do something about it. But this is the great return to normalcy; like Donald Trump, Joe Biden has abdicated all American moral responsibility in the world. While all seems lost, there is still a fight to be had for the thousands of people who have supported the American military and diplomatic corps over the last two decades. Biden has an opportunity to grant blanket amnesty to Afghans wanting to come to the USs and to demand the international community not only fail to recognize the Taliban, but destroy the US-provided weapons it stole and sanction it out of existence. This is the least the USs can do to support the Afghan people: Help those who face violent retribution from the Taliban escape without harm, and give the lawmakers and political leaders who remain in service to the Afghan people a chance to either negotiate a system of government that does not set the country back twenty years, or fight for a future where they can be free. These measures will require overcoming jingoism and a lack of imagination, they will require strength and consensus building. A return to Trump is normalcy would mean neither are accomplished—but President Biden still has an opportunity to restore American normalcy while helping the Afghan people. Let is hope he does.",1,1,The Bulwark
263,Op-ed: Joe Biden is impeachment is biggest loser,7.33,35.0,https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-biden-impeachment-trump-republicans-20210116-qk2vyukj5rfzxfutm2nyxmkdnm-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-15,25,"To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, there they go again. Frantic to extinguish any chance Donald Trump will ever again run for office, Democrats have pushed through an express-train impeachment, concluding the president incited “violence against the government of the USs.”The hasty undertaking, unencumbered by deliberations, investigations or witnesses’ sworn testimony, cheapens the sober intent of the impeachment process. It smacks of partisan vindictiveness. When New York US Representative Hakeem Jeffries describes the president himself as a “living, breathing, impeachable offense,” he gives the game away. Democrats are certainly correct in labeling the assault on the US Capitol as horrific, especially as it led to several deaths. They are also correct that Trump is incendiary rhetoric these past several weeks raised temperatures past the boiling point and inspired some of those who unforgivably breached the halls of Congress.________The Chicago Tribune opinion section publishes op-eds from readers and experts about specific issues of the day. Op-eds reflect the views of the writer and not necessarily the Chicago Tribune.________But rushing to impeach a president who has only seven days remaining in his term is itself an affront to our democracy. Impeachment is meant to be a last resort means of expelling a president, not a political weapon. There has not been a serious probe of what happened that terrible day, how the rioting was organized and by whom. Timelines and social media accounts show that the breaching of the Capitol took place even as Trump was still speaking to the large crowd of followers, and that the organizers may have plotted out the event in advance, mainly on Twitter and Facebook. Democrats have no patience for a sober assessment of what went wrong; they want to humiliate a president who provoked and embarrassed them for four years, and who has accomplished much despite their incessant resistance. Had they voted to censure Trump, they might have brought Republicans on board. As it is, only 10 Republicans in the House voted to impeach; 197 sided with the president. Democrats risk creating a martyr who will continue to have significant influence and who will bedevil them for the foreseeable future. Polling confirms the attack on the Capitol has badly damaged Trump is approval ratings, with aPolitico/Morning Consult survey showing 75% of Republicans approving of the job the president is doing, down from 83% in December. Had Democrats followed a more measured course, confidence in the president would likely have drifted lower, especially as Trump is social media bullhorn has been virtually silenced. Instead, Democrats have wounded not only President Trump, but also their own president-elect. Joe Biden ran for president promising to bring the country together. His inaugural the me is America United. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues have made a mockery of Biden is appealing entreaty. Her vindictive push to impeach has shown that Biden is not really in charge of his political party. If he were, surely he would have talked Pelosi and her angry House Democrats down from the ledge and convinced her to seek some lesser resolution. The New York Timeswrites admiringly that Biden “stays above the fray” and “has maintained a studied cool” as he works toward “lowering the political temperature.” The president-elect, notes the Times, has deferred to Pelosi and other Democrats in Congress. That is one way of looking at it. Here is another: Turning this critical political moment over to Pelosi and her enraged colleagues seems more like submission than deferral. It reads as weakness. Thanks to the House, Biden is inauguration — despite Lady Gaga is best efforts — will now be overshadowed by ongoing impeachment drama. It is not clear when the articles of impeachment will be delivered to the Senate, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected requests from Democrats to call the chamber back early in order to immediately rush ahead with the necessary trial. McConnell issued a statement saying there was “simply no chance that could conclude” before Inauguration Day. So even as Biden takes office on Wednesday, headlines will focus on speculation about whether McConnell will vote to convict the president, how many NeverTrump Republicans such as Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski will join Democrats, and who will defend the president. Biden will see his big day subsumed into more bitter partisan politics. Moreover, the outgoing president will remain center stage, which no incoming president would ever like. The longer the impeachment drama drags out, the longer Trump gets to rail about a “rigged” election, convincing millions that Biden is not a legitimate president. Biden has big plans. He has promised on Day One of his administration to rejoin the World Health Organization, reach out to our NATO allies, roll out a giant stimulus program, reenter the Paris climate accords, reverse Trump is immigration practices, eliminate Trump is tax cuts and clamp down on US oil and gas production. He also vows to vanquish COVID-19. He wants to get his Cabinet nominees confirmed. All these ambitions will be delayed by a Senate impeachment trial. Even if he succeeds in somehow moving his agenda forward, the nation is attention will be diverted elsewhere in his administration is early days. On the other hand, given that Biden ran a successful campaign by staying largely out of sight in his basement for months on end and eschewing any free-for-all conversations with the media, maybe having the country focused elsewhere suits him just fine.

China has been added to major global bond indices (including the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Index and the JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets Global Diversified Index), so passive strategies tracking these indices also steer investment into the Chinese bond market. The 10-year government bond yields in many major markets are either close to zero, as in the case of US Treasuries, or negative, as in the case of German and Japanese government bonds. In contrast, China is 3 per cent yield on its 10-year government bonds looks like a veritable feast.

Sign up hereto get it nightly.down in the back corner of a dark restaurant in the Bronx — brow knitted, wearing an overcoat and scarf that would stay on for the whole lunch — he was not the same cheerful New York City mayoral candidate of our popular conception, the one who cheeses for photos and tweets things like “It is Friday!” when it is Friday or shouts “Yankee Stadium!” while standing in front of Yankee Stadium. Politicians are always a little different behind the scenes, their ambition harder to conceal in close quarters, but the man sitting across from me was particularly unfamiliar. Since entering the race in January, Yang has pitched himself as the happy warrior for the Everyman, an energetic presence promising to lead New York out of its grim recent past. While other candidates have emphasized the city is need for an experienced and empathic crisis manager, Yang has acted like a constant human joy machine. But to day, he was serious, even a little crabby. Gone was the man who wants to bring TikTok Hype Houses to New York; he was replaced by a bristly high achiever, albeit one who has a habit of punctuating somber statements with outbursts of giggles.

Yang — he of Phillips Exeter, Brown, Columbia, white-shoe law, start-up wealth, godfather dom to Teddy Roosevelt is direct descendant — could hang with the city is power brokers. He also appeared eager to reflect the value systems of those places of power: Yang, who calls himself the anti-poverty candidate based largely on his proposal for annual $2,000 direct payments to the poorest New Yorkers, said he envisioned himself spending his first six months in office luring back the city is elite by calling the many Masters of the Universe who have recently decamped to Florida.“ ‘Like, what are the issues that drove you out? What were the decisions?’ And the n be like, okay, here are, like, the things that drove people away. If we resolve the m, can we get them back?” he had told me previously. “It is a pretty tight community, so if the mayor is calling people asking these questions and trying to get them back, I think there are a lot of people who would be thrilled about it.”He slurped black spaghetti, continuing to sketch out his ambitions for the early days of his mayoralty. Aside from working the phones, his plans were vague. He was fuzzy about how exactly he would be able to wrest more control from Albany over the subways: “I have not had those conversations.” He said he thinks the MTA board should be altered to give the city more power, which sounds simple enough but, close up, is an incredibly complicated political proposition. One concrete move Yang knows he wants to make is to hire Kathryn Garcia, the former head of the Department of Sanitation and one of his rivals in the race. “What I appreciate about Kathryn is that she is an operator,” he told me. He is big on the idea that he would hire the right people to do the job, just like Michael Bloomberg did. Yang said he calls Garcia at least once a week to say, “Hey, Kathryn, we are gonna need you.” (It is true he calls a lot, according to her campaign. “Makes her crazy,” said Christine Quinn of the implications that Garcia should be Yang is Number 2. Quinn was the front-runner in the 2013 mayor is race until Bill de Blasio overtook her in the final weeks.)On June 22, New York City Democrats will nominate a mayoral candidate for what is widely expected to be an uncompetitive general election, and polling currently suggests a three-person race between Yang,Eric Adams, andScott StringerwithYang ahead in most polls. He has never worked in government, or voted in a New York City election, or started anything bigger than a hundred-person nonprofit, yet he is convincing a not-insignificant number of people that he can run a bureaucracy of 325,000 municipal workers in a city of more than 8 million at one of the most challenging eras in its history. Yang is surprising dominance has not just been luck. He has cannily deployed his fame, charisma, and hustle, bringing his very modern celebrity to a field otherwise low on name recognition and charm. But another part of his success, perhaps more central than most voters realize, must be credited to his team of advisers and close supporters. Many of the city is most well-connected, savviest strategists have bet on Yang, and in less than two months, eight years after rejecting the legacy of Bloomberg for someone defiantly to his left, New York may very well elect an heir to the billionaire ex-mayor is worldview. Yang is a couple of generations younger, with business ideas that are more tech inflected than Wall Street honed, but his vision for the city is fundamentally Bloombergian — not only appealing to the same privileged, progressive-to-a-point audience but shaped by some of its very same architects.started as a game of telephone. Although played out on Twitter and in the press, the dynamics were both personal and particular to a small group of former Bloomberg staffers. At 8:45 p.m. on February 11, 2020, Howard Wolfson, the n a senior adviser on Bloomberg is ill-fated presidential campaign,tweetedout a Politico piece about Yang dropping out of the Democratic primary: “@AndrewYang would make a very interesting candidate for NYC Mayor in 21.”“I did not really give it a lot of thought. It was one of those tweets that went from brain to fingers fairly quickly,” Wolfson told me. A few days earlier, the New Yorkhad run a story about Shaun Donovan, a former Obama-administration and Bloomberg appointee, running for mayor. Chris Coffey, another Bloomberg alum and now one of Yang is campaign managers, noted that, at the time, Donovan was playing down his Bloomberg connections. That rubbed some people in the ex-mayor is orbit the wrong way, and derisive quotes in the story made it clear that his set was still searching for a candidate. Yang is biography reflects Bloomberg is New York: constant onward-and-upward striverdom. He grew up in Schenectady and Westchester, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, and he has written about the regularity of the racist taunts he endured in school. Yang was a good student, scoring over a 1500 on the SAT and a 178 on the LSAT, but he also focused on fitness. He has said that he worked out too much, naming his pe cs Lex and Rex — “Probably my proudest achievement in college was that I could bench-press 225 pounds eight times in a row” — and always related to the underdog. He liked to find the awkward kids at parties and make them feel welcome. Yang came to New York for law school, graduating from Columbia in 1999 and briefly taking a job at Davis Polk. By 2002, the first year of the Bloomberg mayoralty, he had made and lost money in the tech bubble. In 2006, he joined and soon became CEO of the test-prep company Manhattan GMAT, where he had worked as a tutor. Yang and his partners sold the company to Kaplan in 2009 at a price in the low tens of millions, he has said. In 2011, he started Venture for America, a nonprofit that aims to reinvigorate flagging American cities by injecting them with young entrepreneurs — sort of a business version of Teach for America. Yang has acknowledged it did not achieve all he had wanted; a recent report found that, despite its setting out to employ 100,000 people in those cities, only 150 of the jobs remain. Still, it generated a significant sense of personal accomplishment and professional acclaim; Yang likes to mention how President Obama named him a “champion of change.” He stayed at Venture until he entered the Democratic primary in 2017. As the Wolfson tweet suggests, Yang quickly distinguished himself among the candidates as a bright, interesting young thing. He was never going to win, but, unlike Tulsi Gabbard, he seemed to know that: Yang was out to raise his profile and spread the good word about his ideas. Those ideas were easily digestible and not particularly new, but he managed to redirect the conversation toward them more than many Democratic insiders had expected. He called attention to the looming automation job crisis, and, in what became the centerpiece of his mayoral race, he introduced many Americans to the concept of a universal basic income. Yang first fell in love with the idea of paying Americans direct economic relief — a policy once championed by Martin Luther King Jr. — while running Venture, where he realized that bringing new jobs to cities could not offset the total wages lost to automation. On the presidential-campaign trail, Yang was open about the fact that his Freedom Dividend of $12,000 a year was just a rebranding of an old policy proposal, but it was still a pretty radical one. “An economy where big tech and Wall Street are held accountable,” one Yang presidential TV spot proclaimed. Little did he know the federal government would soon be making $2 trillion in direct payments to Americans during a pandemic. Despite polling toward the bottom of the pack, Yang became a celebrity politician in the span of a campaign cycle. (Yang is wife has since said she thought of his run as “just a phase.”) After dropping out of the race, he moved to Georgia to help the Democratic candidates for Senate there. He was leading the perma-campaign-trail life, sometimes appearing on CNN, always trying to figure out what to do next. Running for mayor was on his mind. “There was, like, a groundswell of people trying to get me to run as soon as I ended the presidential,” he told me in early March while we were waiting for the subway. “I do not know if you saw that.”In February 2020, outlets like were pushing the idea of a Yang mayoral run, speculation that the Yang campaign was allowing if not seeding. Zach Graumann, Yang is presidential-campaign manager, told me it was actually theTimeseditorial board that had joked that Yang should be running for mayor, not president, an implication that “always made us mad.” For his part, Yang told me that the first person who told him he should run for mayor was an old law-school friend. Many core members of Yang is mayoral-campaign team work for Tusk Strategies, a political consultancy founded by Bradley Tusk, a man once called “the Manchurian consultant.” Coffey says he and Tusk were connected to Graumann in the early spring of 2020 by Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg is the n–campaign manager. Tusk, who worked for both Chuck Schumer and Rod Blagojevich before running Bloomberg is 2009 mayoral campaign, is a native New Yorker who has gotten rich as a political strategist for companies like Uber and AT&T (Tusk Strategies) and as a venture capitalist (Tusk Ventures). Tusk, 47, is mostly a VC these days, representing companies like the keyless-entry app Latch and the urban-scooter start-up Bird, but business-friendly- politics remains a time-consuming- hobby. He so despises de Blasio that in 2016 he embarked on a campaign to recruit a candidate to replace him (Donovan turned him down) and funded ads that fixated on the mayor is perceived laziness. To Tusk, de Blasio is New York is hostile to business and tech and more invested in stoking class warfare than in bringing innovation to the city. (“How about we go to start-ups and say, ‘Okay, we will give you free rent for the next five years; you have to commit to being in New York for the next 20,’ ” he told me of one policy idea he would like to see.) Tusk is specialty lately is helping start-ups, some of which operate in gray areas of labor law and fight regulations related to wages and working conditions. Tusk is blitzkrieg on behalf of Uber against de Blasio is City Hall was both innovative — his team created an in-app way for customers to contact public officials and say they wanted to keep their Uber rides — and horrifying to progressive critics of the gig economy. “He is one of these people who combine both creative vision and the ability to execute against it,” Wolfson, his friend, said. Until September 2020, Tusk and Coffey had a preferred mayoral candidate: City Council SpeakerCorey Johnson, who has close ties with Governor Cuomo and espouses a more centrist strain of Democratic politics. But the n Johnson unexpectedly decided not to enter the race, citing the mental-health stresses of the pandemic. Tusk, who had been informally advising Johnson, found himself in the market for another candidate who might embrace a progressive yet business-friendly agenda. Yang was not the only such person out there (former Citigroup executive Ray McGuire, for example, could have fit the bill), but he had something else going for him: celebrity. Since the 1970s, a class of moneyed elites has posited that it is the “permanent government” in New York City. No matter who occupies the mayor is office, its members say with pride, corporate and civic leaders will guide the city out of crisis and toward economic growth. They argue that mayors need tax revenue to pay for their higher-minded policy goals, like expanding universal pre-K, and that the better life is for business (retaining wealthy individuals who are willing to pay high taxes in the city), the more the mayor can do to support those on the bottom. De Blasio, with his tale of two cities, promised a deliberate departure from that arrangement, and even those sympathetic to his politics may acknowledge that his efficacy as mayor suffered as a result: For much of the past eight years, it has felt as if he were at war with everyone, with no powerful interests on his side. Tusk and his cohort were looking for something of a return to permanent government and for a candidate disinterested in ideological crusading. In many ways, what they have found in Yang is not dissimilar to President Biden is appeal, with each promising optimism and consensus after years of rancor. Backing an inexperienced candidate to push an agenda that would require bringing together a diverse electoral coalition and navigating the prickly outposts of political power may seem odd, but it has its advantages. Yang has no governmental record, so no past votes or policy fights can be used against him. He is open to taking on unorthodox positions to satisfy the city is various voting blocs, as when he took the stance that Brooklyn yeshivas, which a recent DOEreportfound had failed to provide any semblance of a secular education, do not need additional government oversight. To me, Yang described his approach to politics as “apolitical,” and it is true that in some ways he eludes our strict notions of progressive and conservative. “While he has some very progressive ideas, he is a candidate who is also willing to defy progressive orthodoxy,” said the journalist and former State Senate candidate Ross Barkan, pointing out Yang is stance against de funding the police. When there was a spike in subway crime, Yang was quick to call for more cops. “That definitely makes him attractive to Bloomberg acolytes,” Barkan said. (There are staffers from the former mayor is administration and campaigns at the top levels of the Adams, Stringer, and McGuire camps as well.)“Andrew and I started spending time together and talking about what the job really means” in the early fall, Tusk told me. Yang wanted to ask about how New York City functions: “How do all the agencies work, what powers does the mayor have, what powers does not the mayor have, what is the interface with the City Council?” Tusk said. “Did he know as much as some of the other candidates? No, of course not.” Bloomberg had not either, Tusk reasoned, and he did just fine in the office. When it was finally time last fall to call people and feel them out on a Yang mayoralty, “no one really knew him that well — everyone had heard of him,” Tusk said. “There was a lot of ‘I did not know he was a New Yorker.’ ” A few told Tusk they did not love the field and could be tempted totalk to Yang. That was enough to make a go of it. On January 13, Yang declared his candidacy with aDarren Aronofsky–directed campaign video. “I came of age, fell in love, and became a father here,” Yang says over brooding background music. “Hang in there. Help is on the way.”have been scathing about his candidacy, mercilessly trolling him for being a tourist in the town he is running to govern. They dogged him for not voting in past mayoral races, for not knowing where the A train terminates, and for riding out the worst of the pandemic at his home in New Paltz. (He and his family rent an apartment in Hell is Kitchen; his children attend schools in the city, one public, the other a private school for kids with special needs.) “I’d be the first to admit that I am learning a to n about New York City,” Yang told me one day out on the trail. But while he has been easy to roast, Yang has been hard to catch in the polls. His celebrity was on full display on April 1, opening day at Yankee Stadium. I found him by Gate 4 only because of the roving mass of cameras that followed him as he bumped elbows and cheered the city is return to normalcy. Yang worked the snaking outdoor queue, taking pictures, at one point finding a guy who had gone to the same high school as he did. Even if they did not seem to know his name, people knew who he was. Yang is approachability is undeniable. “It is completely addictive,” progressive Queens assembly member Ron Kim said. “Many in the media kind of reduce that as something immature. But it is clear that when he is walking around, people are drawn to that energy.”Although he is a gifted glad-hander, Yang can be a stilted speaker, pausing for long stretches between big thoughts. At a joint event with Yang andMaya Wiley, it was notable how polished she was — how practiced at projecting, even above the din of the trains running over the Manhattan Bridge — and how tinny and strained he sounded. (The way Wiley stepped in at moments to answer a question directed at Yang made me wonder how the debates, not scheduled to start until May 13, may go for him.) She and others argue that he is all celebrity, no substance. “T-shirts do not win elections,” she has said, deriding him as someone who “does not understand how government works.” Adams has blamed the media for Yang is success: “We are creating a Donald Trump with Andrew Yang.” Stringer, who has spent his entire adult life building toward this run, can barely contain his contempt. He has called Yang pandering and mock-applauded him for passing the “smart test” on one policy idea. Yang spins all of this around, labeling his opponents defeatists. “They will immediately have five reasons why it is either difficult or ca not be done,” he said of the responses of government types. One progressive strategist, who said he thought Yang as mayor would be “pretty bad” because of his friendliness to big business, begrudgingly admired his approach. “Bradley Tusk outsmarted us. He saw something in the way that national politics was realigning that would allow for a candidacy of this sort to bust in with this name ID.”A number of influential politicians on the left, like Kim, also see something in Yang. Kim was up front in saying he had endorsed Yangprecisely because he thought he could bend him leftward. Initially, he had been turned off byYang is UBI plan, calling it a “campaign gimmick” during the presidential primary, and by an April 2020 op-ed Yangwrotesaying Asian Americans needed to be more overtly patriotic to fight against “China virus” slurs during the pandemic. But Kim is wife suggested he talk to Yang before putting him on blast. Kim and Yang met in January, and Kim introduced him to activists and massage-parlor workers in his district. After that meeting, Yang announced his change of heart on decriminalizing sex work. “There is a whole list of other policies that they put out that I do not actually agree with,” Kim said. “But because I have his ear and trust, if he does become elected, I can help move him toward confronting inequality.” The energy Yang generates ca not be replicated, Kim told me, so “how do we now use that for good?”A couple of times, Kim brought up both hope for and what I interpreted as lingering skepticism of a Mayor Yang. Although Yang had come around on decriminalizing sex work, his campaign has not taken “60 to 80 percent” of Kim is policy suggestions for Yang is “People is Bank,” for instance. Kim is still waiting for Yang to prove himself as the anti-poverty candidate and not just another mayor out to restore a playground-for-the-rich version of New York. “Are you going to sell us out?” he asked. “Or are you going to leverage that trust that you have earned?”“I feel like I can shape him on every issue,” Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronx said, summarizing the Yang appeal to insiders on all sides. They feel they can pour ideas into his ear since Yang is relatively new to politics and still finding his footing on issues. For Torres, viability is a top consideration, and Yang has proved he can cut across demographics — the campaign touts its popularity among immigrant New Yorkers, Hasidim, and brownstone-Brooklyn types. Carlos Menchaca, a progressive City Council member who dropped out of the mayor is race, has also endorsed Yang, a nice little coup given Menchaca is standing among New York is lefties. Meanwhile, the leading progressive candidate, Stringer, has lost a number of key endorsements after facing a sexual-assault allegation. He disputes the claim, and his campaign has noted that his accuser filed ballot petitions on behalf of Yang as a volunteer. Yang rankles at the suggestion that he is at all malleable. He was reticent on the question of Tusk is influence, tensing when I brought him up. “I am a very independent person. I have my own judgment,” he said. Tusk was more open. He told me that he and Yang have talked and text ed a lot about policy and strategy throughout the race. He finds a lot of his job is telling Yang, “Do not worry about all this noise. Ignore it,” or “Keep doing what you are doing.” The campaign they are running “is premised on the notion that the inside game” does not matter. Barkan believes Yang is relationship with Tusk and the Bloomberg set is symbiotic. “Yang gets ideas wrong and has no experience in the firmament of New York City politics. He is also not stupid and not untalented,” he said. In Yang, Tusk has “a vessel potentially for his own interests, whether it is Uber, cryptocurrency, or gambling.”Occasionally, Yang will tweet out or say whatever seems to have popped into his head (he recently caused a small firestorm by suggesting the city ramp up fines on street vendors who operate without a license). Tusk said that Yang is “this very creative thinker” and that often “all he was doing was brainstorming” and the media did not understand. Yang once mused about how it would be cool to build a casino on Governors Island, though the re is a federal deed restriction that specifically forbids that. (Tusk has gaming holdings, so it was pretty easy to guess where that idea came from.)Yang is awkward affability can also sometimes backfire spectacularly. “I genuinely do love you and your community,” he said to the Stonewall Democratic Club, an LGBTQ group, on April 21. “You are so human and beautiful.” (Some members found the comments tokenizing, and the club president told the that Yang is remarks felt “outdated.”) Another time, in a video of something that happens often — Yang chatting with people who recognize him on the street — a young man asks, “While he is fucking bitches, can a man keep his Timbs on?” Yang replies that it is up to your partner. Then, pleased that a politician has bitten on his jokey line of inquiry, the man asks, “You choke bitches, Andrew Yang?” Yang laughs and turns away while making a cutting motion at his throat, his adolescent attempt at playing along imploding.“You are in a posture where you are trying to be friendly to someone and the n you are shocked and surprised that all of a sudden it goes in that direction,” Yang said in his defense. Still, it seemed to touch on a more serious vulnerability in his campaign. Yang has been accused before of fostering a sexist work culture: A woman employed at his test-prep company said Yang had fired her because she got married and, she recalled him saying, she would not “want to continue working as hard.” (Yang has denied this.) And a report surfaced that a woman in Yang is presidential campaign alleged that she had been passed over for a promotion in favor of a less experienced man; in response to the piece, Yang said, “We did not account for how much our male-dominated culture alienated female and non binary employees. I wish we had.”So far, allegations of sexism seem to have slid off Yang. New York is mayoral race historically does not heat up until the final weeks, when ads flood the airwaves. (Lis Smith, the media mind behind Pete Buttigieg is presidential campaign, has launched a pro-Yang PAC with the goal of raising $6 million for TV ads.)Most voters will likely never hear about Yang is controversies, which is just fine with theYang Gangand the most irritating thing in the world to everyone else in the race.the problems the next mayor of New York will face is the city is economic recovery. Whoever is elected will have the power to shape budget priorities, including how to spend the billions of dollars in federal relief the city is receiving through the American Rescue Plan. And unlike billionaire Bloomberg, who could further his policy goals and drown out his opposition through massive donations to non profits and political campaigns, the next mayor will not be able to personally bankroll their ambitions. Some candidates have said they would support major reductions to the NYPD budget (a.k.a. de funding the police), which snowballs into the messy debate on how to best confront the issue of rising crime in a city where police violence has long been a hot-button issue. Yang has come out in favor of getting more officers patrolling the subways and staffing the hate-crime unit. The next mayor will hold a lot of sway over how to deal with police misconduct — like deciding whether firings should fall to the police commissioner (Yang is proposal), the mayor (Adams is) or the Civilian Complaint Review Board (Stringer is) — and how to change an entrenched departmental culture. Yang is critics have pointed out that Tusk Strategies used to represent the Police Benevolent Association, suggesting that police stances would be articulated to Yang via an inside track. Tusk dismissed the idea. “We are certainly not going to consult with them on who the police commissioner should be,” he said. “But yeah, if some crisis popped up, and I was the right person to call Pat Lynch and talk to him, I would certainly do that.”The mayor also has ultimate control over the city schools, and after a year of virtual learning, providing high-quality public education is a to p-of-mind issue for many voters. How to make up for pandemic learning losses, improve student access to technology — a new reality of education — and tackle the sticky issue of equity in schools will fall to the mayor and the mayor is schools chancellor. Yang said he wants to keep the city is controversial gifted-and-talented programs and the Specialized High School Admissions Test, which runs counter to liberal Democratic orthodoxy but is popular with many Asian and white parents. Tusk Strategies lobbied against a 2019 bill to get rid of the test. Yang has also struck out against his peers by criticizing the United Federation of Teachers, something that could play well with parents after a year of remote learning and school closures for which many blame the union. Yang told me his first 100 days would be big on hiring the right people — Garcia, for instance. “If Mr. Yang is strategy to be the mayor of New York City is to have Kathryn Garcia run the city, the n he has in fact made the case for Kathryn Garcia to be the mayor,” her campaign responded. Yang also plans to implement a wholesale culture change in city government. How exactly would he go about doing that? Yang gave me the example of putting a moratorium on small-business fines and appointing a small-business-recovery czar. But most important to him was the human touch. He said, “One of the basic things that we can do is just have someone from the city reach out, and we will instruct them that your only message will be, like, ‘Hey, I amperson, how can we help you?’ ”Yang told me it would probably be two years until the half-million poorest New Yorkers get their $2,000 a year, and that is assuming everything goes according to plan — he needs to secure money from private donors alongside cash from the city, which Yang wants to get by taking away the tax breaks of institutions like Columbia and Madison Square Garden. He will need state approval on that, as he will for many issues confronting the city, which will certainly complicate his ability to deliver. Yang is not well known in Albany, but he told me his friendship with Governor Cuomo is brother, Chris, a sometime CNN colleague, would help. Also: “My team has some connections with some people on his team.”Tusk will likely have some thoughts on whom Yang should hire for what — he knows more people in New York. (He recently released a Medium post dedicated to concerns about his undue influence on a Yang mayoralty, saying he would not lobby or talk to the mayor about anything that may be a business conflict of interest. Tusk is newest venture is a bit smaller in scale: He is opening a bookstore this fall on the Lower East Side. Tusk is an avid fiction reader.) But Yang chafes at the suggestion that Tusk will have outsize influence on his potential administration. “I think people know that the re is an enormous difference between appointing someone for the purpose of a mayoral campaign and the n running something,” he told me. I asked Wolfson what role he thought his friend would play. Tusk, Wolfson said, would occupy a space not unlike that of Felix G Rohatyn — “Felix the Fixer” — the wealthy financier and politico from the FORD TO CITY: “DROP DEAD” era. “I think he will be one of the wise men that help ensure New York is recovery from COVID, somebody who is doing it because they love the city.”Much of Bloomberg is power lay in the fact that he was his own Rohatyn. His independent wealth and business ties allowed him to bend the city to his own idea of what was best for it. After 9/11, even before taking office, Bloomberg had calmed the CEO class, which was frantic about the death of New York City. Yang does not have that clout to reassure or cajole. “Bloomberg was a known quantity,” said Kathy Wylde, president of the pro-business Partnership for New York City, when asked about the comparison of Bloomberg and Yang. “First among equals in the business community.” Yang needs Tusk — who, by the way, is just a lowly millionaire — to give him any semblance of that same status. And he will need to engage in a lot more political horse-trading than Bloomberg ever did. “There is a danger to figures that appear unencumbered when in fact they are ripe for old-fashioned transactional politics,” said a City Hall veteran who worked under two administrations. “It is clear the money and interests involved with this campaign will come with expectations and ties that will completely shape the administration.”ended abruptly — Yang needed to get to an appearance nearby. As we stood to leave, the serious Yang I had dined with morph ed back into the merry public Yang. He said hello to the guys at a nearby table and took a picture. His professions of sharki ness from the past hour rang in my ears; was I supposed to believe this guy was a secret Machiavelli with a moralistic streak? Was it hubristic — and naïve — wishful thinking on Yang is part that he could get New York City voters to come around to his “let someone else handle the details and I will be the cheerleader” mayoral plan?It was my first time eating inside a restaurant in a long while, which I had mentioned in passing to Yang. Meals with him were a lot of people is first time back inside, he said. And this gets to the emotional heart of Yang is campaign: the promise that New York can return to normal. He has practiced what he preaches, campaigning in person from the get-go while other candidates remained on the digital sidelines. He contracted COVID a couple of weeks into the campaign but did not dwell on it. For months now, it has felt as if he is always banging around the city, grabbing lunch and saying hi to people on the subway and documenting it on Twitter. It is a spectacularly well timed alignment with the city is mood. The vaccination campaign is well under way, and de Blasio and Cuomo have said that in a matter of weeks, New York will be once again open for business. The June 22 primary date feels like something of a spiritual advantage for Yang. He is a young, energetic nonwhite guy in a diverse, energetic city, after all. As Yang headed back into the light of day, he raised his hands over his head for an imaginary cheering crowd, a pose that would have looked preposterous if struck by any other politician. “Welcome back to the world,” he said to me, the charm turned on, the n he headed out the door.

268,AOC-backed liberal Maya Wiley surges into second place in some polls for NYC mayor is race,-2.33,40.67,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9704019/AOC-backed-liberal-Maya-Wiley-surges-second-place-polls-NYC-mayors-race.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-19,25,"One of the most liberal candidates inNew York City is upcoming mayoral race, Maya Wiley, is surging into second place according to some polls, with progressive groups coalescing behind her. Wiley is 'defund the police' platform is worrying some New Yorkers as the city faces a summer crime wave with random attacks on fearful residents both in the streets and on the city is subway. In what could have been her chance to put those fears to rest, during a final debate between the candidates earlier this week, Wiley decide dn otto raise her hand when the candidates were asked if they would put more cops on subway cars, despite a violent rise in stabbings and attacks. Meanwhile, Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, has maintained his Number 1 ranking in the most recent polls for the Democratic mayoral primary. He does not support de funding the police. New York Mayoral candidate Maya Wiley is gaining in the latest mayoral pollA new poll puts Adams out in front for next week is primary election but with Maya Wiley surging into second place from third. The mayoral election is set for NovemberEarlier in her campaign, Wiley was forced to deny that she intends to disarm NYPD cops after refusing to commit to a position during an earlier debate. Wiley - a former de Blasio administration official and member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board - presents herself as a reformer, and advocates cutting one billion dollars from the NYPD is budget and reform how the department operates. Wiley, who has been endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren, responded at the time: 'I am not prepared to make that decision in a debate.'I am going to have a civilian commissioner and a civilian commission that is going to hold the police accountable and ensure we are safe from crime but also from police violence,' she said. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks at a rally last week where she endorsed progressive candidates, including Maya Wiley, in upcoming election for city wide offices in City Hall ParkWiley is also supported by the Working Families Party who announced she was their favored candidate having pulled its support for two other progressives on the ballot, Comptroller Scott Stringer and Dianne Morale. A recent poll byPIX-11suggested 23% of voters would choose Adams, followed by 18% for Wiley. Former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia came third with 17%. Yang was just behind in fourth with 14%. During the last poll on May 25 Wiley drew in just 9% of respondents. She has spoken openly of her plans to overhaul the New York Police Department that she claims is filled with bureaucratic waste. Wiley has said she wants to move $1 billion from its budget to community resources. She also plans to appoint a civilian as the NYPD commissioner and reduce the department is 35,000 officers by roughly 2,500.'Black and brown New Yorkers both experience higher crime rates, lower resolution in solving crime and more bad experiences with police officers,' Wiley said to theWall Street Journalduring an interview. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea has said the department is including hiring more people of color as officers and has urged against spending cuts. Amid a deluge of criticism, Wiley has attempted to insist that she does not intend to strip cops of their service weapons. Elsewhere, Wiley has promised to create more affordable housing and improve education inequity in public schools. In her five-year, $10 billion spending plan called 'New Deal New York' she claims she would be able to help the city recover from the pandemic through development, infrastructure repairs and the creation of 100,000 jobs. Four of the other candidates, Eric Adams, Kathryn Garcia, Scott Stringer and Andrew Yang, have pledged to bolster the NYPD Violent crimes across NYC are spiking at a worrying rate and all of the candidates are campaigning on the issue. The Manhattan South police district, seen in the above charts, covers the key tourist area in and around Times SquareThe Democratic candidates in New York is Mayoral race clashed on policing, race and what kind of foods should be allowed in the city in their final debate ahead of the primary next week, with one candidate telling her black opponent that he 'does not speak for minorities' in his criticism of de funding cops - even though he is black. Front-runner Eric Adams, a former NYPD cop who has been endorsed byGeorge Floyd is brother, was slammed by his opponents for his promise to bring back stop-and-frisk and the controversial anti-crime unit that de Blasio disbanded last June in the heat of theBLMmovement. Maya Wiley, one of the most liberal candidates who is ranking third in the polls, did not raise her hand when all of the candidates were asked if they'd put more cops on subway cars amid a surge in violent public transitcrime. Neither did Dianne Morales, who wants to cut the NYPD is budget by $3billion, or Scott Stringer. The other candidates did raise their hands. When asked what she'd ban in the city, Wiley said 'every sugary drink' because her kids 'love the m'. Adams said he'd get rid of processed meat, whereas Yang said he'd crackdown on the 'those ATVs that are terrorizing our streets right now.'In one of the most memorable moments from the debate, long-shot contender Dianne Morales fumed at opponent Raymond McGuire - a black businessman - telling him he 'did not speak for minorities' when he said 'black and brown communities do not want to de fund the police.'Morales wants to cut another $3billion from the NYPD is budget. McGuire said he disagreed and so did others in the black and brown communities. He said de funding the police would 'end in disaster' for New Yorkers'. Irate, she fired back at him: 'How dare you assume to speak for black and brown communities as a monolith.'In one of the only moments of unanimity, none of the candidates said they'd hire outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio in any capacity in their administrations. Adams said he would not give de Blasio a formal role but that he would seek his advice before taking office. None of the others said they'd hire him in any capacity, including Wiley, who used to work for him. Yang and Adams, two of the candidates who have received the most attention, traded blows over the Captains' Endowment Association police union endorsing Yang over Adams, who used to be a cop. Yang said it showed Adams ca not be trusted, that his own union does not even want to stand behind him.'The people you should ask about this are his colleagues. They think I am a better choice than Eric for keeping us and our families safe,' Yang said. Adams shot back that he never wanted their endorsement in the first place because the association once referred to George Floyd is death as a 'game' in which they were being used as a pawn. Yang and other candidates also slammed Adams for saying he'd be taking his gun to church after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting which claimed 11 lives in 2018. At the time, he had not yet announced he was going to run. The day after the shooting, he said: 'From now on, I will bring my handgun every time I enter a church or synagogue.'The shooter was brought down by police. Adams wants to give the police more man-power by taking away their clerical duties to put them back on the street. He also wants to bring back stop-and-frisk - the controversial practice that many dubbed racist and a means of racial profiling - but says he will never let anyone be 'abused' by it. Kathryn Garcia does not want to de fund the police but she does want to raise the recruitment age of the NYPD from 21 to 25. She said on Wednesday night: 'To be quite honest with you, these are complicated times, and several of my opponents are using #DefundThePolice.'I just do not think that is the right approach.'She also wants to make the city entirely reliant on renewable energy. Yang, who wants to give out $1billion in COVID relief and establish a universal base income for New Yorkers, was accused of dreaming up generous schemes that he'd have to pay for with  amonopoly money'. The primary is on June 22 and will decide who is the Democratic candidate in November is election. New York City has not had a Republican mayor since 2001, when Rudy Giuliani was replaced by Michael Bloomberg. There are only two Republican candidates to consider; Fernando Mateo, who wants to add 20,000 to the NYPD, and Curtis Sliwa, the head of the Guardian Angels. Adams, a former police captain who also co-founded a leadership group for black officers, has risen to the top of most polls as issues of crime and policing have dominated recent mayoral debates. The race remains tight, though, with 2020 presidential candidate Yang, former city sanitation commissioner Garcia, city Comptroller Stringer and civil rights attorney Wiley the top contenders in a field of 13 candidates on the Democratic ballot. Stringer said he would cut at least $1billion over four years through measures such as transferring mental health response to non-police crisis teams and reducing police overtime. Garcia has not called for cutting the police budget, but says officers' minimum age should be increased from 21 to 25 and new recruits should be required to live in the city. Yang backs a police residency requirement as well as beefed up oversight of the department, but rejects calls to de fund the police. Yang is campaigning alongside Kathryn Garcia on Saturday in Queens. It marks the first time in the race that two candidates have gone out together. Many of the most common types of crime in the city, including robberies, burglaries and grand larcenies, remain near historic lows, but through the first five months of 2021, the total number of major crimes measured by the police department has been at its lowest level since comparable statistics became available in the 1990s. But since the spring of 2020 the number of shootings has soared. Through June 6, there were 181 homicides in New York City, up from 121 in the same period in 2019, an increase of 50 percent. That is the worst start to a year since 2011. At least 687 people were wounded or killed by gunfire through June 6. That is not historically bad. More than 2,400 people were shot during the same period in 1993. But it is the highest number for a winter and early spring since 2000. The mayoral primary is especially hard to predict because the city is debuting ranked choice voting, with voters ranking up to five candidates. Democrats dominate in New York City, and the winner of the party is primary is considered highly likely to win the general election in November and succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Republican primary features Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa and Fernando Mateo, a restaurant owner and advocate for taxi drivers.

269,“Lords of Chaos” Brings a White Nationalist is Book to the Big Screen,-19.5,34.5,https://truthout.org/articles/lords-of-chaos-brings-a-white-nationalists-book-to-the-big-screen/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"In ancient, pre-Christian Nordic myths, the Oskorei is a collection of souls that jets through the night sky above the living, often with the god Odin leading the horde. On certain occasions, the Oskorei may swoop down to grapple with the living, faces adorned in white with black rims. Over the course of the 20th century, a pagan revival took over, recharging these myths with new eyes, reinterpreting them through the lens of modernity and ascribing them metaphysical significance. While it happened throughout Europe and the US, it was particularly strong among the völkisch movements in Germany that were trying to wrestle with identity around a newly formed nation and a reaction from the countryside to the homogenizing influence of urban life and advancing industrial technology. Heathenry, the pagan religions of Germany and Nordic regions, was imbued with a new significance not possible before the modern concept of race took hold. Through this, the Germanic gods were seen as archetypes for the genetic kin of Northern Europe, and monstrosities like the rise of the Third Reich were a certain Odinic spirit taking over the psyche of its people. It is with this angle in mind that Michael Moynihan and co-author Didrik Søderlind revisited the Oskorei in their 1998 opus Lords of Chaos, which told of the scattered birth of Norwegian black metal and the murders and church arsons it left behind. The book set the tone for how the US imported black metal, the primary market for its albums, retelling its story as one of pure extremity — brutal and offensive, iconoclastic and dangerous. For two decades, Lords of Chaos has remained the go-to text for how the black metal movement began. The black metal scene often wins its scores by outdoing itself in terms of outrageousness, blending all things taboo into pure hyperbole. It is within this framework, where real-life horrors only add to its branding, that Moynihan took the most painful parts of black metal is history and made it a selling point. It was the book is pedigree that led to it finally being adapted into a fairly major Hollywood release from Arrow Films with critical support from Vice Films, capped with stars like Rory Culkin to prop up its focus on the violence of the Norwegian scene centered on the band Mayhem. Just like the book, the movie takes some of the most extreme characters, their murders and suicides, and turns it into horror fodder, acceptably scary because it is so extreme. The question that should be asked about the Lords of Chaos film adaptation is not whether the story should be told ; the story is, without a doubt, dramatic and poignant. Instead, we should ask why someone like Moynihan, whose history in white nationalism and fascist politics traces several decades, is at the center of it. In an era where white nationalist violence is at a record high, why did major studios decide to purchase the option to a book filled with fascist occultism from a man who never hid his own fascism? “The Strong Rule the Weak, and the Clever Rule the Strong” Moynihan is best known for Lords of Chaos, largely because it was the first book with insider access to the black metal scene, but his own history is even more checkered. Always on the edge of extreme music and occult philosophy, he was known for a “will to power” type of fascist politics that is explicit in much of his writing. He is the front man for the neo-folk band Blood Axis, known for combining völkisch paganism and the fascist traditionalism of philosophers like Julius Evola. The neo-folk scene has been mired in controversy for the last 15 years since there is a central the me of reimagining Europe is past in romantic terms, often focusing on occultism and the celebration of empire. This is a trend in far-right art that is often termed “metapolitics,” an effort to sneak in fascist ideas in ways that are not strictly political. Instead, the artists will try to echo fascist the mes through art and culture, changing the way the subculture thinks and the reby shifting the values of that culture to fit their vision. Moynihan was at the center of this project, both as a musician and journalist, propping up many of the bands that became influential at repackaging far-right the mes in their music. Lords of Chaos, both the book and the film adaptation, focuses heavily on Varg Vikernes, who fronts the industrial music project Burzum and served 15 years in prison for burning churches and the murder of Øystein Aarseth of Mayhem. While Vikernes would be a likely villain for a book like this, he is instead portrayed as a charming oddity, an eccentric whose own ideas lead huge portions of the book is philosophical musings. Vikernes himself is a white nationalist who sees a need to return to the ancestral religions of Norway, to remove the Judeo-Christian influences and reinvigorate a warrior culture. Together, Vikernes and Moynihan discuss the black metal scene as the Nordic people channeling their Oskorei nature, a part of the Nordic spiritual psyche waiting to be reawakened. Reacting to the spoils of Christian capitalist consumerism, the children of this generation embodied total nihilism, wanting for death and violence expressed in frenzy. This is in line with what evolved to be known as “folkish” paganism, the idea that the gods of a particular culture is past are psychically bound to the m, racially prescribed. It is through this lens that Vikernes attempted to justify his church burnings as acts against the “invaders,” both worshiping a foreign Jewish god and representing a degenerate “slave morality,” which celebrates the virtue of the commoner rather than the oppressor stamping out rebellion from a position of utter strength. He railed about the weaknesses of Christianity, and about cleansing the land to re-establish a Viking morality that would sanctify will, power, cruelty and hierarchy. This line resonates strongly with Moynihan, who referred to himself as a fascist in the 1990s. He worked closely with the enigmatic far-right artist Boyd Rice, a similar experimental industrial musician, on the Abraxas Project that was designed to propel “social Darwinist” ideas. The tag line of the organization was: “The strong rule the weak, and the clever rule the strong,” echoing their own Nietzschean brand of domination theology. Blood on His Hands Moynihan loved to raise up the voices of the absolute fringes, which led him to James Mason. Mason joined the American Nazi Party is youth division in 1966, and when he turned 18 in 1970, he became an adult member. By the n, it had been renamed the National Socialist White People is Party. He eventually saw the group is activism as stale and wanted to co-opt leftist strategies of guerrilla warfare he was seeing in liberation movements in the Global South. Thus, Mason argued for using shocking violence as a tactic to disrupt the order of society and create fractures that could be used to build the kind of national socialism Hitler imagined. He joined the National Socialist Liberation Front in 1976, whose publication was Siege, which he revived and became the editor of in 1980. Since his publication rarely hit more than 75 monthly subscribers, it would have disappeared from the white nationalist audience entirely, yet Moynihan saw something there. He collected the newsletters and edited them into a book, which grew a cult following among neo-Nazis because of its extreme calls for urban terrorism and its support for Charles Manson and the use of cultish murderers as praxis. Siege later became the inspiration for the US-based Atomwaffen Division, a series of neo-Nazi terror cells that have murdered at least five people in the last two years as the group found a new home at the corners of the “alt–right.” “Moynihan introduced pro-genocide, pro-serial killer neo-Nazism to tens of thousands of people,” said Spencer Sunshine, an associate fellow at Political Research Associates, who researches fascist subcultures. “He has blood on his hands.” What Moynihan did later in his career is a familiar pattern for white nationalists looking to embed their ideas more thoroughly with intellectual credibility. He started the heathen journal Runa to mix in folkish perspectives on folklore and literature with more mainstream ones, often republishing dead authors like Michael Cunningham or essays on JR R Tolkien to give the ideas broader appeal. Moynihan founded the journal Tyr, which helped to popularize “radical traditionalism” as a philosophical idea. Building on fascist metaphysical authors like Julius Evola, radical traditionalism argues that there are underlying hierarchies and spiritual pathways to all of society, and that we must return to pre-modern ways of living, which followers see as stratified along lines of class, race, gender and so on. Tyr worked hard to mix white nationalists like Collin Cleary, known for his books on white nationalist interpretations of Norse paganism, with legitimate scholars on ancient art, religion, politics and culture — mixing a cocktail of academic prose to make the racialist and totalitarian the mes seem more palatable. Moynihan has gone on to edit a reprint of a book by Evola, as well as edit books by a range of folkish authors, oftentimes getting them published in more mainstream occult presses without objection. Performance Art While Moynihan is ideas have always been pretty clearly stated, his work is often dismissed as an act. Instead of seeing him as entirely sincere, Moynihan is often discussed as an intentionally provocative antagonist rather than an evangelist. His relationship with Mason is reduced to his obsession with those on the edges, rather than a commitment to ideology. This is, to a degree, the mentality applied to black metal, where we may not agree with some ideas, but it is their extreme nature that makes them attractive, if only in a kitsch way. This requires certain rhetorical gymnastics, since Moynihan has been one of the centers of the pseudo-intellectualism inside the US far right, which desperately hopes to create an ideological center that looks like more than simple bigotry. “Moynihan is definitely proto-‘alt-right’ in that he was one of the first people to champion a more ‘intellectual’ version of white nationalism,” Sunshine told Truthout. Jonas Åkerlund, the director of the film adaptation of Lords of Chaos, knows better than anyone who Moynihan is since Åkerlund himself comes from the world of Norwegian black metal. Though he is best known for his film school takes on Madonna songs, he was also a member of the Swedish black metal band Bathory in the 1980s, which is likely why he was channeled into this project. Vice has covered the far-right areas of National Socialist black metal thoroughly as well, and so there is little question as to why this book was chosen as the source for a major film that Vice Films supported so heavily. Vikernes, for his part, has attacked the movie virulently, accusing Jews of spreading lies about him. The book itself has little narrative thrust to it, largely made up of philosophical diatribes and band interviews, and so the screenplay likely had to be drawn from a range of sources. This means that while the production company likely cut Moynihan a sizeable check for the rights to the book, they did not have to. Instead, they chose to only because of the name recognition for the title, and possibly, because of the edgy reputation it brought along. Instead of seeing the violent white nationalism openly professed in the book as a liability, they may have cynically hoped it would help them cash a check. There is undeniably something important in the way that the black metal scene formed, what it says about alienation, and the negotiation between consumer capitalism and identity, but there is no reason that history has to be defined by self-described fascists like Moynihan. The story of black metal has multiple centers, bands repudiating the right, defining the mselves on the left, and the families and communities to rn apart from white nationalists posing as nihilistic artists. Instead of telling the same old mythology about extreme music, the producers could have given the story three dimensions. And they could have saved the money they sent to a white nationalist.",1,1,Truthout

In a court filing Monday, prosecutors asked for a 40-day extension of the time limit to seek indictments of six men charged under criminal complaints with kidnapping conspiracy.""Firearms and explosive device components were recently recovered, and must be analyzed to determine whether charges under the National Firearms Act, explosives or anti-terrorism statutes are warranted,"" said Assistant US Attorney Nils Kessler. Kessler said in the court filing there is also a huge amount of other evidence to analyze. He said the FBI had to arrest the men before they finished processing the evidence because of evidence they were planning to abduct Whitmer ahead of the November 3 election.""The FBI has collected hundreds of hours of audio recordings from confidential human sources and undercover agents, and is still in the process of collating that material."" Kessler said. Man charged in Whitmer kidnap plot was  isoft,' kicked out of group, lawyer saysEvidence photos released from Gov kidnapping case""Because of the imminent nature of the threat, law enforcement was obliged to arrest the subjects before this evidence could be processed.""Evidence presented during preliminary hearings and detention hearings suggested the men had discussed blowing up a bridge near Whitmer is northern Michigan cottage to slow police response to the kidnapping, But the court was also told the alleged conspirators were looking at purchasing $4,000 worth of explosives to detonate the bridge from an undercover FBI agent posing as a sympathizer. The accused ringleader, Adam Fox of Wyoming, Michigan, and four other men are being held in custody in Michigan awaiting trial. A sixth man, also in custody, is being extradited to Michigan from Delaware to face charges. The men are charged in a criminal complaint but under federal law are entitled to an indictment by a grand jury of their peers, normally within 30 days of the original charge. That deadline could now be extended to December 16.

And 46 years separate the fall of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces from the threat Kabul faces today from the Taliban. But the perilous parallels between the two long, lost wars are unmistakable.""Are we losing the war? I would say we were never winning the war,"" saidDipali Mukhopadhyay, a University of Minnesota associate professor of global policy and senior expert at the US Institute of Peace. Indeed, ""the scene is dire,"" saidBill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Roggio, who edits the FDD is ""Long War Journal,"" added that ""the Afghan government is in danger of collapsing if the Taliban continues on this pace and the Afghan government does nothing to stop it.""TheTalibanis not only continuing, but quickening the pace. The extremist movement, which cruelly ruled Afghanistan for five years before the post-9/11 invasion by US and NATO nations, now holds half of the country is regional capitals and controls more than two-thirds of of the country. The Taliban is wins come amid America is withdrawal, tied to the symbolic deadline of Sept. 11, 2021 — 20 years after the attacks that triggered America is longest war.""The Taliban is offensive is directly tied to President [Joe] Biden is announcement of the withdrawal,"" said Roggio.""The way in which we are ending this war,"" Mukhopadhyay said, ""is producing a level of suffering and reversion back to the way things were before 9/11 at an accelerated pace, on terms that were not inevitable, and that were, I think, very much avoidable.""Mukhopadhyay added that she never believed the US would win militarily and agreed with Biden is assessment that ""ultimately a negotiated political settlement was necessary. But I think the way in which the withdrawal has been precipitous, unconditional, without planning for the contingencies that should have been anticipated — all of that very much undermines any possibility for a negotiated settlement anytime soon and sets up Afghanistan for two things: a protracted, even more complex civil war, and a greater likelihood that extremist networks will find safe haven again in the country.""The effects will reverberate regionally — and likely beyond.""If what happened in Afghanistan stayed in Afghanistan, the US could chalk this up as a loss in a brush war and move on,"" Roggio said. ""But that is not the case. The Taliban-al Qaida alliance remains strong."" And ""do not be surprised if we see in Afghanistan what we saw in Iraq circa 2013, 2014,"" he added, referring to the rise of ISIS. ""It is a massive propaganda win"" for jihadists. And the message will be received by adversary and ally alike, and not just by other governments, but by Afghans the mselves.""America is adversaries and enemies are watching,"" Roggio said. ""[They] watched America abandon an ally it is supported for 20 years. And make no mistake, it is an abandonment.""""For the people I am close to in Afghanistan,"" Mukhopadhyay said, ""there is a deep sense of connection to the American people and a sense of gratitude for the Americans having brought an end to the Taliban regime. And the administration is decision provoked a feeling of shock and betrayal amongst a lot of Afghans who had really invested everything in a conception of a relationship between our two democracies.""Tragically, there were not enough Afghans who believed strongly enough in that democracy to effectively fight for it. Twenty years of US and NATO blood and treasure spent in Afghanistan still did not yield an Afghan force that could repel the Taliban advance. But ultimately what most mattered was not arms, but minds.""We think that things like numbers and equipment and training and organization matter, when the only thing in this war that mattered was the will to fight,"" Roggio said. ""The Taliban may not have had the training, they may not have had the numbers, they may not have had all of the communications and aircraft, but they were ideologically committed to this fight. They are religiously motivated, and they are committed to their cause."" The US ""never understood our enemy,"" he added. ""And that is a major reason why we lost.""The US seemingly also did not completely comprehend our ally, either, especially the way corruption corroded the will of many everyday Afghans. There was also a loss of political will in the US, which resulted in (or reflected) dissipating support for the war.""You had three successive presidents whose primary objective in Afghanistan was to leave,"" Roggio said, speaking of former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, along with Biden. And both Roggio and Mukhopadhyay said that Biden was basically following through on Trump is withdrawal plan, a fact acknowledged by Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who said in a statement on Tuesday that ""our troops served America and our allies admirably, but the last administration and the present administration chose to give up the fight.""Americans in general expressed ambivalence, too. While there were not massive antiwar demonstrations, the Afghan-era apathy may have been as impactful as the anger during the Vietnam era. In a July Galluppollon ""the most important problem facing the country to day,"" the broad brush of ""foreign policy"" polled a scant 1% and ""wars/war/fear of war"" had an asterisk of less than 0.5%. When asked specifically in a 2019 Pew Research Centerpollif the war in Afghanistan was worth fighting, 59% of all adults said it was not worth it, compared with 36% who said it was — a ratio nearly mirrored by veterans of the conflict (58% to 38%). The public may take new notice of the war if scenes seen in Saigon in 1975 — like the iconic image of desperate evacuees climbing a ladder to try to get on one of the last US helicopters — are reprised in Kabul.""It may not be quite that scene,"" Roggio said. But ""we will see Kabul airport being flooded with the people who want to get out of that country, trying to get on the last plane, the last helicopter.""""I desperately hope not,"" Mukhopadhyay said when asked of the possibility. ""I have a sense that those who are responsible for managing the withdrawal are acutely aware of the risk of loss and are trying for it not to be that way."" But, she added, I think that for the first time this week that actually is a real possibility.""Evidently, so do the White House, Pentagon and State Department. An additional 3,000 troops will be deployed to Kabul, according to a Thursday announcement — not to shore up the shaky capital, but to help partly evacuate the US Embassy. In July, however, Biden waved away a Saigon flashback. ""There is going to be no circumstance where you are going to see people lifted off the roof on an embassy,"" he said. Perhaps the optics will not be the same as Saigon. But the overall outcome likely will.",2,2,Star Tribune-Minneapolis
272,Infrastructure Bill Would Direct Billions Toward Climate Change Mitigation,-2.5,46.5,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-09-28-infrastructure-bill-climate-change-biden-congress,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-01,25,"The trillion-dollar infrastructure bill before Congress contains several provisions that would direct billions of dollars toward rebuilding and shoring up the nation is infrastructure against climate change and mitigating the impacts of global warming. The bill would authorize nearly $550 billion in new funding for public works projects over the next five years, according to the White House, in addition to existing funding. Among the provisions are overhauling the power grid, boosting climate research and weather forecasting, money for low-emissions buses and other transit vehicles, and making roads and bridges more resilient. The bill also highlights assistance to communities of color and tribal communities, both of which the federal government says are more likely to suffer the effects of weather disasters and climate change. The bill was scheduled for a vote Thursday, but as of Friday afternoon no action had been taken. Why California Wildfires Are Particularly Destructive in Fall)Included in the funding would be $60 billion to upgrade power infrastructure with thousands of miles of new transmission lines, according to a White House fact sheet. The goal would be to make the grid more resilient and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. The bill would also create what the White House calls a ""Grid Deployment Authority"" to guide the overhaul. Hurricanes, heat waves and winter storms have all stressed the power grid in recent years, resulting in millions of power outages and, according to the Department of Energy, costing the US economy up to $70 billion a year. Meanwhile, flooding, wildfires, landslides and other disasters are taking a toll on the nation is highways, bridges and other infrastructure. The bill includes $110 billion of new funds for repairing and rebuilding roads and bridges and other major projects, with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity and safety. The funding would include $40 billion alone for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation. The White House projects the initiatives set forth in the bill would add an average of about 2 million jobs per year over the next decade, according to the Associated Press. It is considered a cornerstone of President Joe Biden is administration. The bill would be funded with $210 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief aid and $53 billion in unemployment insurance aid that remains unused by states that halted the program. The rest of the funds would come from several other smaller pots of money. Critics have expressed concerns over the bill is size, scope and financing. The Congressional Budget Office said it would add $256 billion to deficits in the next 10 years, the AP reported. The Senate approved the bill in August in what was considered a rare bipartisan move, after months of political wrangling. The House vote was on hold after more objections and delays to try and ensure enough votes to pass. Here is a look at some of the other major climate-related provisions, according to the bill text and White Housefact sheet:-$105 billion for modernizing and expanding transit and rail infrastructure, including replacing thousands of buses with zero-emissions vehicles.-$17 billion for port infrastructure and $25 billion for airports. The money would be earmarked for repair and maintenance backlogs, reducing congestion and lowering emissions.-$11.6 billion to the US Army Corps of Engineers for construction projects related to flood control, dredging and other infrastructure. Funding would also be provided for flood control and coastal emergencies.-$7.5 billion to build a national network of charging stations for electric vehicles.-$3.5 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for flood mitigation actions and assistance.-$3.5 billion to the Department of Energy is Weatherization Assistance Program, which aims to reduce energy costs for low-income households by improving energy efficiency at home.-$2.6 billion to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation is lead scientific and regulatory agency on climate and weather. The funds would include $492 million for coastal and inland flood and inundation mapping and forecasting along with ""next-generation water modeling activities;"" $50 million for wildfire prediction, detection and observation; and $80 million for super computing infrastructure used for weather and climate model development to improve forecasting and detection of droughts, floods and wildfires.-$216 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, more than half of which would be designated for ""community relocation.""

273,What should the media do with Donald Trump is refusal to concede?,-5.0,43.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-donald-trumps-refusal-to-concede/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-11,24,"Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. These are some of the words used to describe how most of us felt in the days leading up to the 2020 election. But the election has passed. Election Day was more than a week ago. A decisive winner was projected over the weekend. So what are the words we can now use to describe how many of us feel today?Scared. Unsettled. Stressed. Angry. Nerve-racked. Nauseous. Despite projections that Joe Biden won the presidential election and despite no proof of fraud or any other improprieties, President Donald Trump has yet to concede. Making matters tenser, Trump is getting support from many of his Republican allies, like Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And making it even worse, if that is possible, is that Trump is riling up his followers thanks to help from many in conservative media. That includes several on-air personalities at Fox News and Fox Business, as well as the usual suspects such as radio host Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart. On one hand, you want to tell responsible media to just ignore all this noise, to block out the shenanigans, to not give these baseless claims any oxygen, to trust that democracy is going to work and to show faith in our election process by not even acknowledging those whose intent is to stir up trouble. There is no evidence supporting any of Trump is claims. To act as if there might be — or to even report that Trump and others are saying this — needlessly creates doubt and frightens citizens. To report on such things might, inadvertently, give credence to these allegations, which is exactly what Trump and his team want. The goal seems to be more about creating doubt in the election than actually winning it. On the other hand, how can one ignore when high-ranking elected officials such as McConnell and Graham, and leading government officials such as Pompeo, are leading these conspiracy the ories? How can one just let some of those on a popular network such as Fox News say whatever they want and get away with it even though the suggestion of fraud undermines the country and our democracy? Part of the media is role in a strong democracy is to be a watchdog, so should not it be paying close attention to any attempts to weaken that democracy?It is a fine line, and I do not claim to know exactly what the answers are. There is no indication that Trump will concede at any point or that enough Republicans are going to stomp down Trump is claims to make it all go away sooner rather than later. There is also little hope that places such as Fox News and Fox Business will crack down on their prime time personalities to keep them from pumping life into all this garbage. The one person who could do this — Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch — so far and as far as we know has chosen to not get involved, perhaps because he is more interested in ratings than doing the right thing. Any advice to the media seems wishy-washy and vague, such as: Pay attention, but not too much attention. Do not ignore it, but also do not overdo it. Report on what is said, but overwhelm audiences with facts. Cover it enough to let people know what is happening, but not enough to make it seem like the election might be rigged. Like I said, I do not have the answers. I am not sure anyone does. But I do know this: The more this junk is reported, the more doubt and angst it creates. Media outlets and consumers need to ask: Who is creating this narrative? Who benefits from all this doubt and angst? Who is hurt by it?The answers are obvious. The ways for the media to fix it are less obvious. Our best hope is to remember that this democracy and the process to elect our leaders have worked for more than 200 years. Maybe it is naive, but we have to have faith that it will work here, too. On CNN Tuesday,Jake Tapper noted that many Republican officials are publicly backing the president and not acknowledging that Biden won the election. Tapper said, “This is not just cowardly, but dangerous.”However, Tapper added, “I have spent some time today talking to Republican officials on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and what they say is no one out there should worry that our democracy is in actual jeopardy. They say this is all part of walking President Trump through this process emotionally, and that they assume that while he may never concede, he will leave. There will be, they say, a peaceful transition in power to the Biden-Harris administration on January 20. They say that. But they say that on background because they do not want to upset President Trump and they do not want to get death threats from his supporters. Now you may or you may not find that reassuring.”Chris Wallace of Fox News. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Tuesday night was a special one for Poynter and journalism. Chris Wallace — whose five-decade career includes stops at ABC, NBC and Fox News, where he has been for the past 17 years — was honored with the 2020 Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism. Typically, the medal is awarded at a Bowtie Ball in St. Petersburg, Florida, but this year is event was held virtually because of COVID-19. In an interview with Poynter president Neil Brown, Wallace talked about the election, working at Fox News and even what it is like to vacation with George Clooney. As far as the election, Wallace said, so far, the re is no indication of any voter fraud. He said, barring something unforeseen, that he fully expects Joe Biden to be sworn as the next president in January. He called the current situation with Donald Trump refusing to concede “not normal.”When talking about Fox News, Wallace noted the difference between the news side of Fox News and the opinion side.“There is a firewall the re,” Wallace said. “And I would argue more so than the other cable news stations.”As far as the one person he never interviewed, but wants to? Queen Elizabeth, because she has seen most of the news of the past century. And, finally, that vacation with George Clooney. They hung out at Lake Como, drinking Italian wine and talking politics. Wallace called Clooney “the smartest person” he had ever met when it came totalking politics. Previously honored with the Poynter Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism were Katie Couric, Lester Holt, Judy Woodruff, Tom Brokaw and Bob Schieffer. Looking for an expert source?

This 30-minute episode of “The Debrief”starts with Election Day morning and runs all the way through to the moment when CBS News projected Biden as the winner. The pod is hosted by CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett and this episode includes reports from all over the country, from Arizona to Atlanta, as well as the White House to where Biden was in Wilmington, Delaware. Garrett said in the episode, “All of us gathered on the New York set. It was silent, electric, full of unspoken anticipation, anxiety, the sense that history was moving beneath you, about to propel you and the nation in a new direction. I felt exactly the same way on election night in 2016. It has nothing to do with partisanship. It has everything to do with the votes and voices of Americans and the clarity when it comes to their judgment, their decision.”A Mexican journalist was shot just as he was about to go on the air Monday, and later died at the hospital. CNN is Jack Guy, Tatiana Arias, Natalie Gallón and Kiarinna Parisi reported, “Israel Vázquez, who worked for digital news outlet El Salmantino, was covering a ‘discovery of human remains’ in the city of Salamanca, in the central state of Guanajuato, at the time of the attack.” Vázquez was 31. In a statement, El Salmantino said, “Today our colleague, Israel Vázquez, while working as a reporter, was the target of a vile and cowardly attack that took his life. All of us who work at El Salmantino condemn not just this one attack, but all of those that occur daily in the city of Salamanca.”Sadly, attacks on journalists in Mexico are not uncommon. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Mexico as the deadliest country in the world to be a journalist. Vázquez was the third journalist killed in Mexico in less than a month and is believed to be the ninth journalist killed in Mexico this year. Last year, 11 journalists were killed in Mexico, the most of any country. After a summer of reckoning over race, The Los Angeles Times and Tribune Publishing have agreed to pay $3 million to resolve a lawsuit brought on by a group of multiethnic journalists who argued they were paid less than white male staffers. The Los Angeles Times’ Meg James reported that payment could impact nearly 240 current and former reporters and editors who would be eligible for back pay. James wrote, “Under the settlement, all Black and Latino reporters, copy editors and line editors employed by The Times from February 14, 2015 to October 26, 2020, could receive a portion of the award. All women who worked as reporters and editors during that period could be covered.”Ken Dilanian, NBC News’ national security and intelligence reporter, had a hot mi c moment on MSNBC on Tuesday. Not realizing he was live on the air, he glanced at his phone and let out a couple of R-rated words. (You can see the cliphere, but again just to give you a heads up, the re is R-rated language.)He later tweeted, “So sorry for the profanity I used on air last hour. I was experiencing some technical difficulties and mistakenly hung up on the control room, though my mi c still was on. Perils of playing producer, cameraman and tech support all at the same time from home. #2020” He also included an upside-down smiley face emoji. Normally, this would be the kind of thing that could get a bunch of people up in arms, but with the way this year is going, a couple of muttered curse words is pretty low on the list of things to get fired up about. NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell interviews with Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday. (Courtesy: NBC News)NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell spoke on Tuesday with Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said “help is on the way” following the announcement that Pfizer has an experimental vaccine that shows 90% effectiveness against COVID-19.

Southwest said it is investigating the issue and does not have reason to believe it is connected to Monday is problem with a weather data supplier that delayed hundreds of flights. The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday had issued a brief, nationwide ground stop for Southwest, which prevents its flights from taking off to avoid overwhelming destinations.

These are not things that Trump can actually do; they are laughably ludicrous. But Trump was always going to test your gullibility, to see if he could get you to fall for these kinds of empty threats. Sure enough, this morning Trump tweeted “Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” If you are scared by this tweet, you just failed the gullibility test. The President of the USs ca not move the election; the Constitution gives that power solely to Congress, and we all know Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not going to postpone or cancel the election. Trump can no more postpone the election than I can flap my arms and turn into a bird. Nothing works that way. No matter how much Trump might wish he could postpone the election, no matter how loudly he might hint that he is going to postpone the election, and no matter how many or few pundits decide to try to milk such a narrative for ratings, it is still not a real thing. So why is he even talking about it?Donald Trump is the world is worst dealmaker, but he is still a dealmaker. If he can con enough of you into believing that he can magically postpone the election, the n you will give him something in return (a legislative victory, for instance) for him agreeing not to postpone the election. Similarly, if Trump can fool enough of you into believing that he can just magically stay in office after he loses, the n you will give him something in return (immunity from federal prosecution for his crimes, for instance) in exchange for leaving office peacefully. Trump is trying to play you for a sucker. He is hoping that after nearly four years of this nightmare, you are so worn down that you will not think things through clearly. He is done so many other horrible things, the thinking goes, that perhaps he will do this too. Except he literallyca notpostpone the election. It will take place on November 3rd, with or without his participation or approval. And he literally ca not refuse to leave office after January 20th; Joe Biden would be sworn in anyway, and Trump would be dragged out for trespassing. Some media pundits are already lining up to try to scare you into staying tuned in to their TV shows and Twitter feeds by pushing the notion perhaps Donald Trump really can magically postpone the election. They will insist that if you brush off this imaginary threat, it means you are not being vigilant enough. They are full of crap. Vigilance is when you still continue to work hard on things like voter registration and turnout, even when your candidate is ten points ahead. What these pundits are pushing is gullibility – and Trump is more than happy to take advantage of it by making these kinds of false threats and trying to con his way into getting something in return. Should you be outraged that Trump is threatening to postpone the election? Of course. Should you treat it like it is something he can actually do? Of course not. Do not fall for his con.

276,Are high lumber prices 'tied' to the Trump administration?,0.0,43.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/23/alma-adams/are-high-lumber-prices-tied-trump-administration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"A North Carolina congresswoman says former President Donald Trump is partly to blame for an increase in lumber prices. US Representative Alma Adams, a Charlotte area Democrat, raised the issue when questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about inflation during a committee meeting on July 14. Adams wanted to know why Powell believes the recent inflation trends are temporary. And while winding up for her question, she said a rise in lumber prices ""can be tied to the previous administration is actions.""""My local housing partnership had to pause construction of an affordable housing site because of a funding gap caused by the spike in lumber prices. And while lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration is actions, I know that many are still concerned about the rise in core prices.""""So I am hoping you can help us put some of these concerns to bed. So would you tell us why you believe the recent inflation trends are temporary as the economy reopens and what other factors are playing into the upward pressure on prices?""Later that day, a Twitter user challenged Adams’ explanation. She responded by elaborating on her comments in a tweet.""The Trump Administration is high tariffs on Canadian lumber drove prices higher. Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic compounded the problem and drove prices even higher,"" she tweeted on July 14. Is she right about that?Trump did place a tariff on Canadian lumber and it is fair for Adams to point out that it caused lumber prices to rise, experts told us. However, experts say lumber prices are more complicated than her statement suggests. There are a number of reasons why the recent rise in lumber prices is not entirely — or even primarily a result of — Trump is tariffs. By the time Trump imposed tariffs on lumber in 2017, prices were already on the rise because of uncertainty surrounding an expired trade agreement. The US and Canada had a 10-year trade pact that expired at the end of 2016. David Logan, director of tax and trade analysis for the National Association of Home Builders,wrote in March 2017that ""failure to reach a new (trade) agreement is the primary catalyst of market-wide price increases.""A month later, theTrump administration announced tariffs of 20% on Canadian lumber and up to 24% on specific lumber companies. Lumber prices have a history of being volatile, experts told PolitiFact. They can range from $300 to $600 per thousand board feet when in stable economic times. The price hovered just below $400 per thousand board feet i nearly 2017, and the n rose to $600 by summer 2018. It is fair to say Trump is tariffs contributed to that rise, experts told PolitiFact. Other factors played a role too. Lumber market expert Paul F Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, told the New York Timesthat a reduction in the supply of Canadian lumber also contributed to the rise in prices. Fast forward to 2020. When the pandemic takes hold, some saw mills shut down or cut production as they anticipate decreased demand. But their predictions were wrong. More Americans started to work from home and decided to undertake home renovation projects. Demand for lumber rises and prices reach $950 per thousand board feet in September,according to the NAHB In the meantime, theWorld Trade Organization ruled in August that the Trump administration is justification for the 2017 lumber tariff was off-base. And late last year, the US Commerce Department slashed the softwood lumber tariff to 9%. Last year is rise in prices was just the start. Lumber prices hit an all-time high of $1,670 per thousand board feet this May as demand rose for a limited supply,CNBC reported. The lumber industry is struggle to keep up with demand has been well-documented in American media, fromVoxandCNNtoFortuneandBloomberg. Experts told PolitiFact there are many factors that determine the price of lumber. Trump is tariff is one of those factors but is not the leading cause of the spike. The price increases ""can be traced back to mill closures and a massive reduction of output upon reopening based on the incorrect assumption that the housing market would indefinitely tank,"" Logan, the NAHB expert,told PolitiFact in April. Sam Spencer, a spokesperson for Adams, said the Congresswoman is tweet accurately summarized the effect of tariffs.""The price of lumber can be tied to the tariffs: if there is a supply crunch, the fact that we are artificially elevating the price of that specific commodity is importation by default contributes to the rise in prices,"" Spencer said in an email. While the tariffs certainly helped cause lumber prices to jump in 2018, ""that second round increase is not related to the Trump tariff,"" saidVincent Smith, an expert in agricultural policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""That was a demand side driven surge.""Adams is ""not wrong about the impact of the Trump tariffs in 2017,"" Smith said, adding: ""that does not explain the surge in prices subsequently.""The softwood lumber tariff ""does not help,"" said Thomas A Firey, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and managing editor of itsRegulation Magazine.""However, the tariff is set and adjusted by statute, and it is unfair for the congresswoman to blame Trump for initiating it (or Biden, whose administration is obligated to raise it),"" Firey told PolitiFact in an email. Fact-checkers atUSA Todayreached a similar conclusion. Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Cato Institute, says the fluctuating cost of lumber in the US is a result of a trade system that isoverdue for reform. The regulations affecting how much lumber is made available, who is allowed to produce it, and how it is taxed -- are designed to benefit the American lumber industry, sometimes at the expense of the consumer. The system is drawbacks are exacerbated during seasons of high demand.""It is factually true that the Trump administration is Commerce Department applied the tariffs, but beyond that casting the blame is pretty nonsensical,"" Lincicome said. Experts pointed out too that Biden was in office as lumber prices peaked, and has not acted to reduce the tariffs. The Commerce Department is now proposing to double the lumber tariff to 18%. CNNandFortune Magazinereport that Biden, for his part, has yet to take a stance on the proposal. Adams, referencing Trump is time as president, said ""lumber prices can be tied to the previous administration is actions."" She later tweeted an assertion that Trump is tariffs were a cause. Trump increased the tariff on Canadian lumber in 2017 and prices rose in the following year. However, prices skyrocketed even higher in the last year as a result of pandemic-era market changes. Economists say that is largely the result of unforeseen issues of supply and demand. While Trump is tariffs contributed to the record-high lumber prices, economists say it is misleading to blame them entirely.

282,Catholic bishops to consider communion guidance over abortion views,4.67,44.0,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/06/15/Catholic-bishops-to-consider-communion-guidance-over-abortion-views/7151623699708/,https://adfontesmedia.com/upi-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-15,25,"June 15 (UPI) --Catholic bishops are scheduled to vote this week on drafting a statement that would include guidance on whether elected officials who support abortion rights, such as PresidentJoe Biden, should receive communion. The vote is among the items on the agenda of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is meeting in a virtual general assembly on Zoom that begins Wednesday. The question before the bishops is whether work on the statement can begin. AdvertisementIf that request is approved, the earliest the document could be presented to the bishops would be at their November general assembly. Bruce Morrill, a theological studies professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said the proposal is clearly directed toward Biden, the nation is second Catholic president. While campaigning for the presidency, Bidenproposed a healthcare plant hat would expand access to contraception and abortion and restore funding toPlanned Parenthood. In addition, the plan sought to prevent states from passing laws to outlaw abortion. AdvertisementOn January 20, the day Biden was inaugurated, USCBB is president, Archbishop José H Gomez of Los Angeles, issued a statement saying ""the continued injustice of abortion"" remains the preeminent priority of the bishops.""We have deep concerns about many threats to human life and dignity in our society,"" Gomez said in the document, titled Statement on the Inauguration of Joseph R Biden Jr. as 46th President of the USs of America. ""But as Pope Francis teaches, we cannot stay silent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.""The archbishop also said in the statement that ""our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage and gender.""Gomez added that Catholic bishops are not partisan players in the nation is politics, and when they speak on issues, they try to guide consciences. In a2004 letter to American bishops, the Vatican said that a politician consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws constitutes ""personal formal cooperation"" in grave sin. In those situations, ""the pastor should meet him, instructing him about the church is teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of the sin and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the holy eucharist,"" according to that letter. The decision to refuse to give someone communion is not a sanction or penalty, the letter said.""Nor is the minister of holy communion passing judgment on the person is subjective guilt, but rather (he) is reacting to the person is public unworthiness to receive holy communion due to an objective situation of sin,"" the letter said. The letter -- written by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI -- was a response to a controversy over Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry is support of abortion rights. Some US bishops had said Kerry, a practicing Roman Catholic, should be barred from receiving communion. Other Catholic politicians recently have been the targets of assertions that they should not receive communion,including House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2016. In 2019, when Biden attended Mass at a church in Florence, SC, where he had been campaigning, the priest refused to give him communion because of his support for legalized abortion. Under current procedures, the bishop or archbishop of the diocese where a Catholic lives makes the determination about whether communion should be withheld, Morrill said. Targeting public officeholders and candidates in a statement politicizes the eucharist, he said. Advertisement""The controversy in this is that the bishops conference has no authority to start declaring unilaterally who can or cannot receive communion,"" said Morrill, who is Vanderbilt is chair of Roman Catholic studies. He said controversies inevitably will keep happening because bishops ""have failed to persuade their own American Catholics that abortion should not be an elective procedure legally available to women in the USs.""A compilation of findings in surveys conducted over the years by the Pew Research Center, including one in 2019 that addressed the US Supreme Court is Roe vs Wade decision that established a right to abortion, show that 56% of American Catholics say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Jayd Henricks, former USCCB executive director of government relations, disagrees that communion is being politicized.""Of course, the re is a political dimension relative to the public witness of politicians, including President Biden, who professes to be a devout Catholic and yet opposes the church is very fundamental teachings,"" Henricks said. ""But the concern of the bishops here, it seems to me, is not about the political situation so much as it is about the pastoral situation. The church teaches that the eucharist is our food that helps us save our souls.""AdvertisementHenricks -- who has not been involved in conversations with bishops about the issue and stressed that he is speaking only for himself -- also said there is nothing new in what the USCCB will be considering.""It is going to be re-presenting in a pastoral way, teachings that existed for years now,"" he said.",2,2,UPI

285,Barrett Will Be Confirmed Because GOP Shut Down Democrat Dirty Tricks,17.0,34.0,https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/22/amy-coney-barrett-will-be-confirmed-because-kavanaugh-battle-taught-gop-to-stop-getting-played-by-democrat-dirty-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,25,"Amy Coney Barrett has not yet been confirmed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court by the US Senate, but there is no question that her confirmation battle has gone much better than the one endured by Brett Kavanaugh and his supporters. The undervalued reason why is that Republicans and their voters are not wasting any time on dirty tricks from their opponents in the Senate and in the media. This confirmation was supposed to be apocalyptic. That is what I predicted. One of the closing paragraphs of “Justice On Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” the book I wrote with Carrie Severino:As ugly as Kavanaugh is confirmation battle became, he is unlikely to shift the Court dramatically. Except on abortion and homosexuality, Justice Kennedy usually voted with the conservatives. If Justice Ginsburg were to retire while Trump was in the White House, the resulting appointment would probably be like the Thomas-for-Marshall trade. Compared with what might follow, the Kavanaugh confirmation might look like the good old days of civility. Clearly, we were wrong. There are many reasons for that, and it is worth looking at them. For one thing, the Democrats’ campaign messages regarding the global Coronavirus pandemic make it impossible to repeat their action tactics from the Kavanaugh hearings. While riots and mass protests are encouraged in the streets, there was no way to import paid activists to the committee hearings or to roam Senate hallways in costume. When the Kavanaugh hearings began, they were fueled by outbursts from Senators and their invited guests who disrupted the hearings. Hundreds of activists were arrested and bailed out of jail by a coordinated campaign focused on a the me of disruption. The Coronavirus made similar tactics impossible. Contra the early media narrative, the timing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is death did not help Democrats as much as they thought it would. If you remember, the main Democrat the me of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle was “delay, delay, delay.” They worked very hard to delay the opening of hearings by fighting to read the millions of papers that passed through Kavanaugh is desk while he was staff secretary for President George W Bush. Battles over paperwork dominated July and August, with hundreds of articles written about the process fights. Chuck Schumer and his allies did a photo op in front of a few empty boxes that were described as “missing records.” Schumer imposed a Democrat boycott of meetings with Kavanaugh, only relenting after weeks of trying to delay the opening of the confirmation hearings. If Democrats tried to delay the Kavanaugh hearings until past the mid-term elections, and came very close to succeeding, how much easier should it have been to delay Barrett is confirmation vote until after the presidential election?One of the reasons the delay strategy failed for Democrats last time is because American voters started getting sick to death of what they were doing to the man. Whereas in 2018 Democrats had a huge wave election that turned over the House of Representatives to Democrat control, they actually lost Senate seats. They had to stop their anti-Kavanaugh efforts lest they lose more. Democrats were nervous about attacking Barrett in the way they’d tried to destroy Kavanaugh. Their energy and focus were on their own elections, too. Also, Barrett is a nominee of incredible quality. Like Kavanaugh, she has a to n of very loyal friends who love to sing her praises. Considered the brightest of her peers, she was a popular law professor and has had a good three years as a federal judge. But let is not pretend that the left did not try to destroy Barrett. They did! They put the very same reporters who ran their anti-Kavanaugh hit pieces on the anti-Barrett beat. And they wrote many negative stories about her, her religion, and her family. Before she was nominated, Newsweekerroneously accused her religious group of being the inspiration for “The Handmaid is Tale.” A few days later, Politico ran an article arguing that her “religious beliefs are not off-limits” and saying they are problematic. Reuters also ran its own hit piece on the group People of Praise, headlined “Handmaid is Tale? US Supreme Court candidate is religious community under scrutiny.”The Washington Post had the reporter who ran the Christine Blasey Ford portion of their massive anti-Kavanaugh operation write up a hit piece on Barrett is People of Praise group, headlined “Amy Coney Barrett served as a ‘handmaid’ in Christian group People of Praise.”A few days later, a couple of reporters ran an utterly bizarre article about how a couple of kids at a school the Barrett children attend had gotten COVID There was no evidence that the children gave the other children COVID and the Barrettchildren had tested negative. Beth Reinhard, one of the reporters on the story, defiantly tweeted that the White House had shamed her for writing about the children, as if it did notmake her look bad. The Post has been areservoirofanti-Barretthitarticles. So has The New York Times. In addition to its hit on Barrett is religious ties, the Times ran adeep and critical look at the adoptions of two Barrett children. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of condemning the article. “The nominee introducing her family in a few sentences of prepared remarks does not give the New York Times license to start treating minor children like objects of public curiosity,”he wrote. Adoption advocates were troubled by the attack on the family. Just yesterday, the Associated Pressran a hit on a private religious school Barrett had been affiliated with. Rod Dreher wrote in response that the “Left Is Coming For Christian Schools.” And the left is favorite academic and racist, Ibram X Kendi, called Barrett and her husband “white colonizers” for having a multi-racial family. So again, let is not pretend that the left did not work through its most prominent media outlets and academics to try to destroy Barrett. They did. The biggest difference is that Republicans simply were not playing with these attacks. Each and every one of these stories — and dozens of similar ones — was met with swift condemnation or yawns. Every single one. It took a few decades of the left playing the exact same games with most confirmation battles, but finally, the right figured out how to render those attacks worthless. It is not just conservative Americans, but the senators the mselves who are playing this differently. Rather than the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately responding to the Washington Post is anti-Kavanaugh attack by bending to the will of the Democrats, this time they just did not care. As Democrats openly said on national television that they would do anything to stop Barrett is confirmation, rather than act scared, the Republicans were not moved. They have not responded with outrage or drama, but just a steely resolve to get the nomination done. When Democrats said they would boycott the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting at which Barrett is to be voted on, the Republicans responded by saying it was fine. This way, she will be the unanimous vote of the committee. The legacy of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle is that Republicans finally figured out to stop playing along with the left is games, in which nominees see their lives, family, and reputation on the chopping block. It took them a while, but better late than never.",1,0,The Federalist
286,Is This Meandering Quote From Biden Real?,0.0,47.0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/meandering-quote-joe-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"On July 22, 2021, a meandering and seemingly nonsensical quote supposedly spoken by US President Joe Biden started circulating on social media. The alleged quote reads: ""And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where are why ca not the experts say we know that this virus is in fact its going to be our excuse we know why the all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved and but permanently approved, that is underway too.""This is, generally speaking, an accurate quote from Biden is appearance during a CNN town hall on July 22, 2021. The text in the above-displayed does not contain much punctuation, however, which may make Biden is message seem extra incoherent. Here is how this quote was presented inCNN is rush transcript of the event:And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are -- why ca not the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact -- is going to be -- or, excuse me -- we know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved. That is underway, too. I expect that to occur quickly. Biden made this statement in response to a question from CNN reporter Don Lemon about when children under the age of 12 will be able to get vaccinated. Biden said ""soon, I believe,"" and when Lemon pushed him to elaborate, Biden said that scientists were evaluating the data to make sure that the vaccines were safe for children. Here is the full exchange. The viral quote has been placed in bold text:MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask — let me follow up on her question, asking: When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?THE PRESIDENT: Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected — I said —MR. LEMON: How soon is “soon,” Mr. President? Not to —THE PRESIDENT: Well, I — and let me he- — let me finish the question — the answer. “Soon” in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere. (Applause.)And so they are doing — they are doing the examinations now — the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they have done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, the y, in fact, are — all have different makeups. They are developing. They are trying to figure out whether or not the re is a vaccination that would affect one child that is at such and such an age and not another child. That is underway. Just like the other question, the re is a logical — and I have heard you speak about it because you always — I am not being solicitous, but you — you are always straight up about what you are doing. MR. LEMON: Well, that means — you mean for the FDA?THE PRESIDENT: For the FDA. MR. LEMON: Yeah. So, what do you —THE PRESIDENT: The Federal Drug Administration. MR. LEMON: You said that you are talking to scientists, though, but what — what are they telling you, Mr. President?THE PRESIDENT: What they are telling me is, “Let us decide, based on scientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it.”Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came — this — this — the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along so quickly. They have been working on it for two decades. There is nothing quick about this. It is been over two decades. So people said, “I am not taking a drug that was approved so quickly.” It is been two decades. The truth is we have not said it enough to people to allay their feals [sic]. There is nothing — their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday and they said, “Well, let is take a shot on this.” And the re is a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided. But the expectation — they are not promising me any specific date — but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together — over 20 of the m, plus others in the field — is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year — at the end of August, beginning of September, October — they will get a final approval saying the FDA said, “No, this is it. It is good.”But again, one last thing. I — we do not talk enough to you about this, I do not think. One last thing that is really important is: We are not in a position where we think that any virus — including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non — unvaccinated people — the vi- — the various shots that people are getting now cover that. They are — you are okay. You are not going to — you are not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. You can view this exchange on CNN.com. It is viewable during ""Part 1"" of the CNN town hall. Lemon asks this question around the 6:15 mark.",2,2,Snopes
287,"After Voting for 16, ‘They will None of Them Be Missed’",12.0,32.0,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/after-voting-for-16-theyll-none-of-them-be-missed/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"On March 3 of this year, 125 Democrats voted to give 16-year-olds the vote in federal elections. No Republicans joined them. Much has been made of the Democrats’ list of 121 Republican members of the House who two months earlier refused to confirm President Joe Biden is election. Now both parties, like Gilbert and Sullivan is, “Have got a little list / And they will none of them be missed.”The Republican dissenters in January, who included some usually sensible people like Representative Tom Cole (R-OK), frequently expressed doubt about their votes but explained that they were honoring the presumed wishes of their Trump-supporting constituents. This vision of their duty hardly coincides with that expressed in Edmund Burke is address to the electors of Bristol, but it has an element of truthfulness about it. Trump is loyalists have undiminished gratitude to him for sparing the nation President Hillary Clinton—though almost any Republican presidential candidate in 2016 would have done so, and by a greater margin. Their fanaticism also rests on the fact that he clearly sought to keep his four main promises: on immigration, trade, the Supreme Court, and regime-change wars. They also wanted to put down a marker against the possibility of fraud in mail-in voting, if not in the 2020 election, at least in the next one. The Democratic supporters of infantile voting have no such excuses. Their constituents, even in the most liberal or progressive districts, did not demand or expect it. Even in Nancy Pelosi is San Francisco, a proposal for lowering the voting age was voted down in 2016, and the California electorate emphatically rejected a well-financed proposal for 17-year-old voting in 2020. Fear of retaliation by Pelosi, who is in command of committee assignments and large amounts of campaign money, may have prompted some votes, such as those of the occasionally independent Abigail Spanberger, Ro Khanna, James Clyburn, and CA “Dutch” Ruppersberger. But the dominant reason for them and others was the hope of partisan advantage, even though the examples of Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua, where 16-year-old voting is allowed, suggests that no advantage can outweigh the loss of political stability it produces. One refreshingly independent vote was that of the former chairman of the NAACP, my Congressman Kweisi Mfume, who unlike many members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted against the proposal. The advent of 18-year-old voting almost certainly helped politicize higher education. Speaker Pelosi has avowed that she wants “to capture kids when they are in high school, when they are interested in all of this, when they are learning about government to be able to vote.”An organization known as “Vote 16 USA” is a subsidiary of another called “Generation Citizen,” supported by major foundations,including the Ford and Bezos Family Foundations, fostering a program of “civic education” or indoctrination reminiscent of that of, and associated with, the is 1619 Project. This is not a pretty spectacle. There is much science suggesting that the brain is not fully developed until age 25. Moreover, American youth is more sheltered and less experienced than ever before. The day is gone of the young citizens celebrated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who preach, teach, farm, engage in manual labor, and try their hand as merchants—who “do not postpone life, but live already.” For every Napoleon or William Pitt, there are millions of trust fund babies, drones, and perpetual students. There are some who remember that Chancellors Bruning of Germany and Schuschnigg of Austria saw no cure for their countries’ political disturbances in the 1930s save for an increase in the voting age to 25. Thevote on March 3should be seen as a political gift to Republicans, ensuring them restoration of a House majority and more than negating the effects of their own members’ mistake two months earlier.

Manfred “Manny” Lindenbaum, 88, is one of them. The past four years had been tough ones for the New Jersey resident.“I was actually going into a deep depression,” he said. “I was functioning, but I could not sleep at night, my mind was going back and hearing rhetoric that was not much different than what was going on in the beginning of the Nazi era.”Lindenbaum was five when he was “literally chased out” of his childhood home in Unna, Germany in October, 1938, along with 17,000 German Jews of “Eastern” origin in an event known as PolenAktion. Stripped of their citizenship, his family became homeless and stateless overnight. A year later, when the Nazi invasion was imminent, his parents made the bold decision to put their three children on a train bound for the port town of Gdansk, where the last Kindertransport boat to England was departing. Only Lindenbaum and his brother were allowed to board. His sister, 14 at the time, was deemed too old. He would never see her or his parents again.

HIAS, which had once help Lindenbaum immigrate to the USs, arranged the visit to the border. There, Lindenbaum saw refugees forced to remain in limbo in a no-man is land similar to the one he experienced in Zbąszyń. For Lindenbaum, voting for Joe Biden was more than supporting a particular candidate. It was a moral imperative. “It is beyond comprehension that we did that,” he said, speaking of what he saw at the US-Mexico border. “I still get nightmares.”On Saturday morning, November 7, with Biden still undeclared, Lindenbaum went on a 10-mile bike ride instead of spinning his wheels indoors, waiting for the votes to be counted.“By the time I returned, Biden was the declared winner,” he said. “It felt like a giant weight had been lifted off my back.”He was not the only survivor to finally exhale. a video of Holocaust survivor grandparents tearing up at the news went viral. Survivors in Zoom support groups, who had reported feeling tense and fearful under Trump, and increasingly isolated under the pandemic, expressed relief.“After months of suffering from insomnia and anxiety, many Holocaust survivors were elated that Trump, whom they associated with Hitler, did not win a second term,” said New York clinical psychologist Dr. Eva Fogelman, an expert on Holocaust PTSD Cordula Hahn getting her first hug from her daughters Johanna (R) and Serena (L)Image by David MüllerIn Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Cordula Hahn, who had been a hidden child in Holland during World War II, rejoiced at the news, banging a pot, getting showered with glitter outside the Barclay Center with her two daughters and son-in-law, enjoying their first hug since March.“The outburst of emotions was huge,” she said. “I had a flashback from Liberation Day in May 1945 in the Netherlands, where my parents, older brother and I were in a parade.”Cordula with her parents and brother at the Victory Day parade in The Netherlands“It felt like the end of the war,” said Natalie Scharf, who felt the stress of the last four years dissipating as she delighted in the news that her adopted city of Philadelphia played such a pivotal role in flipping the country blue. “I felt a real obligation to vote for Biden. I do not have to imagine how much worse it can get under Trump. I lived through it.”Born in the Polish town of Jaworzno, Scharf was 15 when the Gestapo raided her home one night, arrested her along with scores of other Jewish teenage girls in her town and loaded them on a train bound for Sudetenland, where she was imprisoned at Gabersdorf women is forced labor camp, only to emerge as one of the sole survivors of her family.“When I saw them marching with the torches in Charlottesville, I had terrible heart palpitations,” she said. “They looked just like the Nazis of my childhood, and hearing them scream, ‘Jews will not replace us,’ ‘blood and soil,’ it was exactly as I remembered it. And this president said they were fine people? Good riddance. It feels like liberation. We made it!”For Aviva Slesin, an Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and adjunct professor at NYU-Tisch, who was smuggled out of the Jewish ghetto in Siaulia, Lithuania in 1943 when she was nine months old and spent the war in hiding, Biden is victory took her back to the moment she first laid eyes on her new country.

Here we were refugees from Europe, coming to the shore of a place of hope,” she said. “And the n I thought, had this man [Trump] been president at the time, he would not have welcomed us.

But it was his cruelty to children that triggered her earliest traumatic memories.“I was playing in the garden across the street from our house, when suddenly the police began to chase us out because we were Jews. I guess I was a good runner, but behind me was a two-year-old girl who was not,” she said. “I saw this very elegant Nazi pick her up by her legs, throw her against the tree and kill her. I ran home and told my mother. She said, ‘That is it. It is time to leave.’”The family fled at night, crossing the Bug River to the east, staying with an uncle in Bialystok until the Russians packed all the Jews on a train bound further east. She was just 13 years old when she arrived at a gulag, a Soviet work camp. Her younger brother died of disease shortly after arrival. Over the next four years, they moved from Siberia to Kazakhstan, where she spent her days gathering tinder wood and struggling to find food.“You are hungry all the time. You are not clean and the most horrible people are taking care of you,” Ores said. “When I saw how Trump took breastfeeding mothers away from their babies, that children died at the border, I saw Americans behaving like Nazis. Who can put children in cages? I was a pediatrician for 50 years at Columbia University Medical Center. Whoever heard of such a thing happening here?”When she heard that Joe Biden was the declared president-elect on Saturday morning, Ores called her grandson to come over and help her pop the bubbly. “It felt like Victory Day!” she said. But her bubble began to burst with news of Trump challenging the election results.“A predator is most dangerous when wounded,” said Björn Krondorfer, director of the Martin Springer Institute at Northern Arizona University, and one of five German-born Holocaust scholars who co-wrote anOp Edtitled, “It is Not Too Late for American Democracy-Yet,” that ran in the Forward ahead of the election, warning of the threat of totalitarianism should Trump win a second term. “And that is the situation we find ourselves in. It is scary (again) to see his political maneuvering to get into a position in which he can call on the Insurrection Act.”Last week Yale history professor Timothy Snyder, author of “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From the 20th Century,” declared Trump is tactics of rejecting the election results no joke, writing in The Boston Globe, “a claim that an election was illegitimate is a claim to remaining in power. A coup is under way, and the number of participants is not shrinking but growing.”And that is what is so frightening to the people who lived through the rise of European fascism and the Holocaust.“More than 70 million Americans voted for Trump,” said Fogel-Weiss. “After four years of challenging the rule of law, peddling lies and propaganda, anti-Semitism, scapegoating immigrants, and denying science -all of it has been such a tremendous blow to democracy — they all follow their leader.”Fogel-Weiss said she is cautiously optimistic that democracy will prevail if there is a peaceful transition to a new president. Others say they will not sleep soundly until President-Elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20. Dr. Fogelman reports similar fears reemerging among survivors in her practice. “They wonder what havoc will Trump wreak before the inauguration and will Biden, with his good negotiating skills, be able to work across the aisle to bring the nation together?”",1,1,Forward
289,European Union awards grant to forge unmanned ground vehicle standard,1.33,47.33,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/12/16/european-union-awards-grant-to-forge-unmanned-ground-vehicle-standard/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-16,24,"COLOGNE, Germany — The European Commission has awarded Estonia and the country is robotics company Milrem a grant to lead the way on a standard architecture for military unmanned ground vehicles, the company announced. The deal, worth close to $40 million and signed December 11, formally kicks off a pan-European development for a new generation of battlefield ground robots. Named Integrated Modular Unmanned Ground System, or iMUGS, the project uses Milrem isTHeMISvehicle as a reference platform for creating a “standardized European-wide ecosystem for aerial and ground platforms,” according to the company. Also covered by the project is relevant technology in the fields of command and control, communications, sensors, payloads, and algorithms. The connection to the European Union is coffers comes through the bloc is European Defence Industrial Development Programme. Besides Estonia as the lead, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia and Spain also are part of the iMUGS group, adding a combined €2 million (US $2.4 million) to the effort. The countries each bring their relevant national companies to the table, including Safran Electronics & Defense, Nexter Systems, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Diehl Defence, and Bittium Wireless.“Estonia has the honor and a great responsibility taking the lead in this project as nothing on a similar scale has been conducted before,” said Martin Jõesaar, chief of the project office in the Estonian Centre for Defence Investment. “Our goal is not only making iMUGS a one-time effort, but to build it into a base project for future developments. Our long-term goal is that each of the modular systems built will pave a way for further innovation in its field.”While the sums involved in iMUGS are relatively small in the world of defense programs, the effort has the potential to shape the European market for military robotic vehicles. The initiative is a prime example of defense companies like Milrem, some of them years ago, sensing a chance to position their own offerings firmly in the thicket of European defense priorities. But the THeMIS robot is not the only game in town. Rheinmetall is equally trying to position its unmanned portfolio in the European market, even without EU backing. In the case of itsMission Mastervehicle, the intellectual property belongs to the company is Canadian division, which makes support through EU channels tricky. Still, the vehicle is being tried by the land forces of several countries on the European continent. According to Milrem, European countries are expected to need thousands of ground robots during the next 10-15 years, creating a market valued in the billions of euros. “With seven participating nations and key industrial players, the unmanned ground system developed during iMUGS is expected to become the preferred European solution for integrating into armed units,” the company claims.

290,On His Heels: Gavin Newsom Admits Larry Elder Could Be Next California Governor As Recall Election Looms,13.33,38.33,https://www.dailywire.com/news/on-his-heels-gavin-newsom-admits-larry-elder-could-be-next-california-governor-as-recall-election-looms,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-17,25,"Over the weekend, embattled California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) admitted that he could indeed be recalled from his position and replaced by Republican candidate Larry Elder. Newsom, battling to remain CA governor past the September 14 recall election, made the comments about Mr. Elder during a campaign stop at a Mexican restaurant this weekend. The Democrat tied Elder to former President Donald Trump, seemingly to frighten West Coast leftists into stronger support.“Though we defeated Trump, we did not defeat Trumpism. Trumpism is still alive and well, even here in the state of California,” Newsom said. “If you do not believe me, just consider … the likely person to enter an oath of office, to enter in the governor is office in just a matter of weeks if we do not reject this recall.”“Do not think for a second that this recall is not about all of you,” the governor added. “It is about each and every one of us and the values we hold dear.”Newsom was referring to Elder, who is leading in the latest recall election polls.“The latest Emerson College and Nexstar Media is ‘Inside California Politics’ poll shows support for the effort to oust Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom has grown in recent weeks as the state has experienced an increase in COVID-19 transmission,”The Daily Wirereported earlier this month. The poll “found support for the recall at 46%, up from 43% in the previous poll from July 20, two weeks ago. However, 48% said they opposed the recall, and 6% of likely voters are undecided, pollsters found, adding that the number of undecided voters had fallen 3%.”“Newsom is approval rating fell from 49% last month to 48% in the current poll. In addition, 42% said they disapproved of Newsom is job performance, while 10% were unsure or had no opinion,” The Daily Wire added. Some of Californians’ top issues were homelessness, Covid-19, and crime — which jumped 7% from July. A nervous Newsom reiterated the same this weekend on CNN. “We turn out our base, we are going to win, unquestionably. It is not a persuasion campaign. People are locked in,” Newsomsaid. “But the profound consequences — particularly the leading candidate on the other side, Larry Elder — people just need to take a close look.”The Democrat the n accused Elder, a black man, of “promoting” “bigotry and hate” as he alleged former President Trump does.“Democrats need to wake up (to) what is at stake, and we made it easy,” Newsom added. “It is all mail-in ballot. Simple question: ‘Should he be recalled?’ ‘Number’ Send it back. Do not even consider the second question with those 46 candidates.”Elder, a 69-year-old conservative host, commentator, and author, has promoted choice and freedom over state mandates when it comes to Covid-19 precautions, a stark contrast to Newsom. The candidate is leading other Republicans in the recall contest.",1,1,Daily Wire
291,How NOT to Resist Trump: Kayleigh McEnany is Anti-Science Comments,-11.67,36.0,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/07/22/how-not-resist-trump-kayleigh-mcenanys-anti-science-comments,https://adfontesmedia.com/common-dreams-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"Media, particularly those who have made a habit of rhetorically opposing Donald Trump for the past four years, were awash last week with White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is controversial statements on reopening public schools in the middle of a pandemic. For example:The myriad of viral headlines suggested that this was another Orwellian outburst from the administration, along the lines of when George HW Bushsaid: ""I will never apologize for the USs of America. Ever! I do not care what the facts are."" But reading her full answer, or watching the video embedded in many of the reports, it becomes clear that the headlines are misrepresenting McEnany is words. What she actually said was:The president has said unmistakably that he wants schools to open. And I was just in the Oval [Office] talking to him about that. And when he says open, he means open in full -- kids being able to attend each and every day at their school. The science should not stand in the way of this. And as Dr. Scott Atlas said -- I thought this was a good quote -- Of course, we can [do it]. Everyone else in the... Western world, our peer nations are doing it. We are the outlier here. The science is very clear on this, that -- you know, for instance, you look at theJAMA Pediatrics study of 46 pediatric hospitals in North America that said the risk of critical illness from COVID is far less for children than that of seasonal flu. The science is on our side here, and we encourage for localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools. It is very damaging to our children: There is a lack of reporting of abuse, the re is mental depressions that are not addressed, suicidal ideations that are not addressed when students are not in school. Our schools are extremely important, they are essential, and they must reopen. In other words, the White House is arguing that the science should not be a problem because it does not stand in their way. But this is certainly not how it was presented to the public by many journalistic outlets. Some outlets did give a fuller explanation of McEnany is comments. MSNBC (7/17/20), for example, noted that, ""To many, that made it sound as if the White House press secretary was arguing that science was an impediment to Donald Trump is preference,"" before explaining that the true context ""casts McEnany is controversial quote in a less embarrassing light."" Yet the headline for the article explaining the confusion was ""White House: 'Science Should Not Stand in the Way' of School Openings,'"" which only served to double the muddle. Around 59% of people do not read past the headline before sharing an article, making it especially important that they convey accurate information. A majority of people seeing these headlines will have been given a misleading picture of events. The media mishandling of McEnany is remarks led to a field day for the right-wing press, portraying the Trump administration as unfairly under attack from the leftist establishment (e.g., Daily Caller,7/17/20; Daily Wire, 7/17/20; National Review, 7/17/20). ""The shameless charlatans in the liberal media were at it again on Thursday, engaging in fake news,"" wrote Newsbusters (7/16/20). ""The entire corporate media complex have conspired to deliberately lie and mislead the public,"" Breitbart (7/17/20) told its readers. McEnany herself (Twitter,7/16/20) described it as a ""case study in media bias"":I said: ""The science is very clear on this...the science is on our side here. We encourage our localities & states to just simply follow the science. Open our schools."" But leave it to the media to deceptively suggest I was making the opposite point!The problem with this narrative, of course, is that her comments were anti-science. Ahuge new study from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) itself, released the same day as McEnany is comments, found that children aged 10-19 (i.e., kids in elementary, middle and high school) spread the disease at least as well as adults do, meaning any reopening will certainly worsen the situation, leading to deaths, not necessarily of students, but of teachers, grandparents, other public transport users, or anyone else coming into contact with them. Pretending that opening schools has no consequences for adults is itself deeply misleading. While some other Western nations have reopened schools, they have done so in a context of drastically reduced new cases; in many instances, virtually zero. On July 16, the day of McEnany is comments, the USs set a worldwide all-time high for new daily cases,73,388. Comparing the US to the likes of Germany or New Zealand (July 16cases: 560 and one, respectively) is scientific malpractice. Not only did other Western countries wait until their infection rates were much lower before reopening schools, they also took great care to reduce the chances that schoolchildren would transmit the virus to the mselves or others. Time (7/20/20) described how Denmark reopened schools on April 15, when the country wasaveraging30 new cases per million people per day (compared to the US is current 202 cases per million per day):When children ages 2-12 returned to school, they were sectioned off into ""micro groups"" of 12. These groups--also known as ""protective bubbles""--arrive to school at staggered times, eat lunch separately and have their own zones in the playground. All students are required to wash their hands every two hours but do not have to wear face masks. Desks are divided two meters apart, all education material must be cleaned twice a day and when possible, classes are held outside. Parents are not allowed on school property. Some countries that reopened schools with less stringent protocols have come to regret it. ""Israelis Fear Schools Reopened Too Soon as Covid-19 Cases Climb"" was aJuly 14 headline in the Wall Street Journal, with the subhead, ""Outbreaks in Schools Had Infected at Least 1,335 Students and 691 Staff by Monday Since the Reopening in Early May""Just as the pandemic began, the Trump administration attempted to slash the CDC is budget, the president in Februarybrushing off the idea that Covid-19 would be worse than the flu as a liberal ""hoax"" intended to unseat him. After accepting its validity, he touted ineffective drugs as miracle cures and even suggested that injecting bleach into the body could cure the sick. This is in keeping with the administration is general contempt for sciences, such as its grossly downplaying the threat of climate change, with Trump himself labeling ita Chinese invention, while claiming the noise from wind farms causes cancer. Unfortunately, this latest scandal perfectly encapsulates much of corporate media is apparent resistance to Trump, in that it avoids a substantive critique in favor of catching the administration out on technical grounds. Resisting the reopening of schools on the basis that the White House press secretary misspoke represents a lost opportunity to actually oppose the administration is scandalously poor handling of the coronavirus, and the dangerous, genuinely anti-science decision to force through reopening in the height of a pandemic. Most US adults, including more than nine in ten Republicans, say they have lost trust in the media in recent years. This sort of sloppy faux-adversarial journalism in the pursuit of clicks will do nothing to reverse this trend. Is further eroding your industry is credibility worth a few more eyeballs? Apparently, the answer is yes.",1,1,Common Dreams
292,"Thousands of troops are coming home from Germany, but some of them could be going right back",0.0,49.0,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/07/29/thousands-of-troops-are-coming-home-from-germany-but-some-of-them-could-be-going-right-back/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,18,"Nearly 12,000US troops will pull out of Germanyas soon as is feasible, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday, but the ones who will be stationed back in the USmay be called up for rotational deployments back to Europe. Under the plan, troop levels in Germany would drop from 36,000 to just over 24,000, Defense Secretary Esper told reporters, with 5,600 of those re-positioned to other European countries and the remainder shifting to US bases to be determined.“I want to note that this plan is subject to, and likely will, change to some degree as it evolves over time,” he said in his opening remarks. The plan would move at least two headquarters elements out of Stuttgart, Germany, and over to Mons, Belgium, according to US European Command boss Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, specifically EUCOM and Special Operations Command, Europe. Africa Command, also based at Stuttgart, could also move out of Germany, officials said, though that decision will come with the completion of AFRICOM is review. Elsewhere, an Air Force fighter squadron and support elements would move from Germany to Italy, while a group of 2,500 airmen who had been scheduled to shift from Royal Air Force Base Mildenhall, United Kingdom, to Germany will stay put, Esper said.“Once Warsaw assigns a defense cooperation agreement and burden sharing deal as previously pledged, there are may be other opportunities as well to move additional forces into Poland and the Baltics,” Esper added. In that way, he explained, troop presence in Europe will more closely mirror the new Eastern front. When the US first began basing troops in Germany to deter the Soviet Union, it was one of the farthest east allies to work with. Now, with much of the former Soviet Union having joined NATO ― while still contending with Russian advances ― the US has been spending more time working with troops in countries like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and more.“These changes will achieve the core principles of enhancing US and NATO deterrence of Russia, strengthening NATO, reassuring allies and improving us strategic flexibility and EUCOM operational flexibility,” he said. That partner training has been done by a mix of Germany-based units moving east for weeks at a time, as well as a US-based Army brigade combat team rotating through. Rotations allow the Army, for example, to save the logistics of moving entire families to Germany and the n sending soldiers to the field for short stints.“And I will say this much: the deployment rotational forces from the USs we have observed, whether it is the [armored brigade combat teams] going from the USs to Korea with ABCT to Poland, or the bomber task force, we are finding that they are deploying at a much higher level of readiness,” Esper said, citing other examples of rotational forces. “And while they are deployed, they are ... able to sustain a much more fixed focus on their mission and their capabilities. And they can, third, they can provide a more enduring presence.”The plan is part of a review of several combatant commands, which also includes US Africa Command and the recently reactivated Space Command. Effects on the forceAssuming the administration is plan is completed, the uprooting of EUCOM is headquarters from Stuttgart to Belgium carries the symbolism that the days of Germany as the decades-old nerve center for American military might in Europe may be numbered. The Army, Air Force and Marine Corps also have European command headquarters in Germany. Pentagon officials are doing their best to blunt a more profound and potentially destructive re-ordering of the US military footprint in Europe, according to retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who last commanded US Army Europe in 2018.“It could have been worse,” he said, noting that any hasty moves from Germany in and out of Poland appear to be off the table.“Germany is still our most important ally in Europe,” he added, describing the White House reasoning driving the reshuffling as “wrong from the beginning.”As Pentagon leadership briefed reporters, President Donald Trump answered questions about Germany and NATO on the White House lawn.“Germany is not paying their bills,” he said. “They are delinquent. It is simple.”A non-mandatory target has NATO members paying 2 percent of their gross domestic product toward shared security costs by 2024, but few of those countries are meeting that benchmark. That includes Germany, at an estimated 1.38 percent in 2019, but also Italy and Belgium ― who paid an estimated 1.22 percent and 0.93, respectively, last year. Poland has reached that goal.“Let is be clear: I think Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe. Germany can and should pay more to its defense,” Esper said. “It should certainly meet the 2 percent standard, and I would argue, go above and beyond that.”The Pentagon is plan was focused on maximizing readiness and reassuring allies, Esper said, while at the same time under pressure from the president, who has repeatedly targeted Germany. While Esper had hinted at rejiggering Europe force structure last year, he said that Trump is rhetoric “accelerated” the plan.“If they start paying their bills, I would think about it,” Trump said Wednesday of Germany. Esper did not provide details on how many troops would be part of a new Europe rotation. By the math, 5,300 would be returning stateside. The Army in 2016, following a drawdown of several units based around Germany, began rotating an ABCT for nine-month stints, at about 4,700 soldiers each. On balance, the presence of US troops in Europe might only be reducing by several hundred, when all is said and done. For the roughly 6,300 on tap to return home, some could be returning “in a matter of weeks,” Esper said, though the Pentagon will coordinate with both Congress and the services to decide which US bases will absorb them. The planned return of the Army is 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Vilseck, Germany, to the USs is expected to leave a mark, according to Hodges.“That is a tough one to swallow, because that is their assigned combat unit,” he said. On Capitol Hill, the decision has been met with bipartisan criticism that it was hasty and will damage America is alliances. Both the House defense appropriations and policy bills have provisions to bar the Germany drawdown. US force levels have been lowered gradually over the years, in consultation with Germany and NATO, Senator Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee said in atweetWednesday.“Trump is doing this on a lark. Likely just to embarrass Germany,” said Murphy, D-Conn. “No plan. No consultation. Making it a really bad idea.”Senator Mitt Romney, R-Utah., called the plan “a grave error,” a “slap in the face at a friend and ally,” and “a gift to Russia coming at a time when we just have learned of its support for the Taliban and reports of bounties on killing American troops.” Romney has introduced an amendment to the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to block the removal of troops from Germany. What will it cost?The movement of both manpower and equipment comes with costs, which Esper described as “several billion dollars, I’d say single digits, but that will be spread out over time.”However, Hyten later indicated that a significant amount of detail has yet to be worked out, and stressed that any cost estimate is still in the early stages – a sign that costs could potentially grow.“The secretary said single digit billions, but those are rough estimates. What we have right now is really a concept ― a concept that we have shared with our allies, shared with the Congress, and we shared inside the department fairly widely,” Hyten said. “We now have to turn it into plans. As you turn into plans, we have a very structured process involving the Joint Staff, the office of the secretary, and the combatant commands and the services, to make sure we understand what those are, the n we will lay in the costs.”The costs of the plan would come not just from military construction, but from the added expense of moving from based forces to rotational ones. In a2017 study for the Army War College titled “Rotational Deployments vs Forward Stationing,” author John R Deniconcluded that it costs$135 million more each year to have a rotational brigade combat team in Europe, as opposed to having the force be permanently based in Germany.“We need to actually reach out to the potential locations where these forces are going to move, make sure we understand what is the re, what can be the re, and the n turn those into real cost estimates, and the n work with the Congress to get the resources,” Hyten continued. A2019 analysis by Rick Berger of the American Enterprise Institute found that the US has invested $5.9 billion in construction for its German bases over the last two decades; while it is unclear is similar investments would be needed to build up new headquarters buildings and other infrastructure in Belgium and Italy, leaving behind empty facilities in Stuttgart and elsewhere may be seen by Congress as a waste of taxpayer dollars.“Some of those resources can be handled in-year execution,” he added. “Some will be handled out years, especially military construction.”Defense News reporter Joe Gould contributed to this report.

293,New research links soda to heart disease and cancers — Quartz,-2.25,48.0,https://qz.com/1575440/new-research-links-soda-to-heart-disease-and-cancers/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"New science out of Harvard University found that the more soda people drink, the higher their risk of dying from heart disease, breast cancer, and colon cancer. The research was published today (March 18) in the American Heart Association is journal, Circulation, and is just the latest(pdf) in a mounting pile of evidence showing that soda has had—and continues to have—a negative impact on public health in America.“The big picture is really starting to emerge,” said Vasanti Malik, one of the co-authors of the study, in a conversation with CNBC. “This is not random. There is a whole lot of consistency across these findings.”Like much of nutrition science, the most recent research is not definitive, in part because it is difficult to draw hard conclusions from work that relies on people self-reporting their diets. There is no way to be totally sure someone did not omit or overstate what they were eating or how much they exercised, or miscalculate their body-mass index. Still, the Harvard study drew from a fairly large sample of people—37,716 men and 80,647 women who reported data between 1986 and 2014. Likeanother recent study that sought insight into the ill effects of junk food, an observational study that draws from tens of thousands of participants ca not be ignored. The researchers followed study participants’ health for several decades. Among other things, the people being surveyed reported how many sugar-sweetened, carbonated beverages they drank per week and month. The researchers found that people who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages, including soda, were associated with risk of death from heart disease. Compared to people who infrequently drank soda, the people who drank more than two servings a day had a 31% higher risk of death from bad heart health. Each serving-per-day increase in soda consumption was associated with a 10% higher risk of heart disease-related death, the study states. To a lesser degree, more soda consumption was also linked to an increased risk of developing breast and colon cancers. The research did differentiate between sodas sweetened with real sugar versus artificial sugars. Based on their conclusions, the scientists estimate that replacing one serving per day of soda sweetened by real sugar with one serving sweetened by artificial sugar was associated with a 4% lower risk of total mortality, and 5% lower risk of heart disease-related death.“Strengths of our study include the large sample size, long-term and high rates of follow-up, detailed and repeated measurements of diet and lifestyle, and numerous sensitivity analyses that support the robustness of the results,” the researchers wrote in the study. The research will likely add more fuel to the efforts of health advocates to get people to drink less soda. That is already taken shape in pitched fights between advocates and the soda industry over the emergence ofsoda-tax initiatives around the country. The American Beverage Association, which represents the interests of the soda industry, has said it disagrees with the findings of the study. In a statement, the group said: “Soft drinks, like all the beverages made by our industry, are safe to consume as part of a balanced diet. The sugar used in our beverages is the same as sugar used in other food products.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton spearheaded the first suit, which nine other states also signed onto. The second suit is led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, and an additional 36 states and territories signed on. Antitrust law is not just about a company being an illegal monopoly or even about being the dominant firm in its market sector. Although being a literal monopoly, with no available competition of any kind, can put you on the fast track to investigation, the law has broader concerns. Primarily, antitrust investigations are about—in short, how a company uses its power. If you are a big company because everyone likes your stuff best, well, you are a big company, congratulations. But if you got to be the dominant company by cheating somehow—strong-arming other firms in the supply chain; targeting anticompetitive acquisitions; colluding with other firms to manipulate market conditions, and so on—that is a problem. With that in mind, let is delve into what is going on. You have indeed heard this song before, and recently, too. Both new suits come in the wake of a suit the Justice Department and a group of 11 states—Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas—jointly filed against Googlein October. Three additional states also filed with the court today to join on to the federal case, so a total of 52 attorneys general—representing 49 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia—and the DOJ have now signed on to one or more of the three legal challenges. (Alabama appears to be the remaining state not yet participating in any of the cases at this time.)For the time being, these two new lawsuits are separate and distinct both from the federal case and from each other. However, according to the DOJ, the coalition that filed its suit today also petitioned the court to consolidate the proceedings, so in all likelihood, this will eventually be one antitrust case. The October suit is surprisingly narrow, considering how many segments of the digital marketplace Google is parent company Alphabet either participates in or dominates. That case focuses almost entirely on Google is search business, which the DOJ alleged the company monopolized illegally for more than a decade through ""exclusionary agreements and anticompetitive conduct."" These both focus on other elements of Google is business. The Texas-led suit (PDF) is focused on the online advertising market. According to that suit, Google uses its control of the advertising ecosystem to block potential competitors from competing in online advertising exchanges and unfairly uses its vertical integration to win real time advertising auctions.""Google is essentially trading on 'insider information' by acting as the pitcher, catcher, batter, and umpire, all at the same time"" in the online advertising market, Paxtonsaidwhen announcing the suit. ""This is not the 'free market' at work here. This is anti-market and illegal under state and federal law.""Google entered a series of agreements, code named Project Jedi, with other advertising firms to allow it to maintain its market share, the suit alleges. The most eye-popping of those deals is an agreement Google allegedly signed with Facebook in 2018, which ""fixes prices and allocates markets between Google and Facebook as competing bidders in the auctions for publishers' Web display and in-app advertising inventory.""Basically, according to the suit, Facebook in 2017 figured out a way to make money from a new online-advertising bidding system. Google thought that new tactic posed an ""existential threat"" to its own massive slice of the advertising pie and made an agreement with Facebook: Facebook would cut back on the new tech, and Google would give Facebook a big edge in its own advertising auctions. Tactics such as bid rigging and market division areexplicitly, flatly illegal under antitrust law. ""The Supreme Court has warned that there are such things as antitrust evils,"" the suit begins, alleging that Google is guilty of such, and it ""seeks to ensure that Google will not be evil anymore.""The Colorado-led suit (PDF) focuses on Google is search and search-advertising business, accusing the company of behaving anti competitively in three key ways. Firstly, the suit argues, Google ""uses its massive financial resources to limit the number of consumers who use a Google competitor."" This holds particularly true in mobile, the suit alleges, which Google dominates entirely. Not only is Google the default search engine on Android, which is a Google product, but the company also pays Applebillions of dollars every year to be the default search engine on iOS devices as well. Secondly, Google leverages its search-advertising business, SA360, in such a way as to prevent competition from arising, the suit alleges, by prohibiting inter operability with competitors and locking advertisers in. And thirdly, according to the suit, Google ""throttles"" those who try to go around Google to reach sites, products, and services directly. This harms ""specialized vertical providers"" by keeping them from reaching potential customers, especially on mobile. In response to the lawsuits, Google today published alength y corporate blog post explaining why Google search is Great, Actually, and should be left alone.""Rigorous testing"" has shown Google that consumers vastly prefer their search results to be chock-full of Google is own modules, wrote Adam Cohen, Google is director of economic policy. ""We know that if you do not like the results we are giving you, you have numerous alternatives—including Amazon, Expedia, Tripadvisor and many others just a click away.""Amazon, to consumers, is an e-retailer, streaming video company, and digital goods purveyor, not a search engine, and both Expedia and Tripadvisor are specifically for searches related to travel and hospitality, but it is indeed true that they exist. The antitrust lawsuit ""suggests we should not have worked to make Search better and that we should, in fact, be less useful to you,"" Cohen added. ""The claims being made have been closely examined and rejected by regulators and courts around the world, including the US Federal Trade Commission, competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, and Taiwan, and courts in the United Kingdom and Germany, who all agreed that our changes are designed to improve your search results. It is also well established that the most important driver for our search results is the specific query—not your personal data.""Google is claims are accurate but misleading: while the FTC did back away from pursuing major action against Google in 2013, European regulators fined Google a total of more than $9 billion across three years for violating antitrust law: 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2017, related to search; 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) in 2018, related toAndroid; and 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in 2019, related toAdSense. Regulators in several other nations such asAustralia,Japan, India, and South Korea, are also reviewing Google is competition practices. The potential outcomes of these cases are unclear. We could be looking at the biggest antitrust action in a generation, a giant nothingburger, or anything in between. None of the three cases specifically calls for Google to be broken up, unlike theFacebook antitrust lawsuits the feds and states filed last week. That said, they do not exactly seek breakups either. Instead, the suits are all calling for whatever ""structural relief"" might be deemed necessary alongside all the various fines, penalties, and injunctions against bad behavior they seek. It is going to be a very long, very ugly legal fight, no matter what happens. Even if the cases are consolidated into a single docket, as seems likely, do not be surprised if it takes until 2025 or beyond for the case to wrap once and for all. For comparison, the DOJ filed its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft in May 1998; the court accepted what became the final settlement in November 2002, 4.5 years later.",2,2,ARS Technica
296,Democrats just subpoenaed Trump is favorite bank,-16.75,37.0,https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/8xz9p4/democrats-just-subpoenaed-trumps-favorite-bank,https://adfontesmedia.com/vice-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,4,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats may be waiting to see Special Counsel Robert Mueller is final report like the rest of us, but that has not stopped them from pursuing other investigations into President Trump is finances. Two House committees sent a subpoena for records on Monday to Trump is longtime lender of choice, the German financial giant Deutsche Bank, along with multiple other financial institutions as part of an investigation into foreign influence on US politics, Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intel committee, told VICE News Tuesday morning. Investigators are seeking documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe,The New York Times reported, citing three unidentified people with knowledge of the requests. The subpoenas mark a new front in the investigations into Trump is money, which are being led by multiple House committees and investigative bodies based in New York State. Collectively, investigators are now seeking a wide range of documents related to Trump is finances, including banking records, personal and business tax returns and corporate insurance records. The German lender has already been subpoenaed by New York is Attorney General is office. Schiff said Deutsche has been “cooperative” with the probe being run by the House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee.“Deutsche Bank is engaged in a productive dialogue with the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees,” Deutsche spokesperson Kerrie McHugh told VICE News in an emailed statement Tuesday morning. “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations.”That could pose problems for the president. The firm is believed to hold a vast and detailed trove of information about Trump is business empire, thanks to its longstanding lending relationship with his family business. The bank has reportedly lentTrump a total of more than $2 billion over the years, even after other big Wall Street firms labeled him too risky to touch after a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s. Congressional investigators are also seeking records from JP Morgan and Citigroup,CNN reported Tuesday morning, citing unidentified people familiar with the requests. President Trump is son Eric slammed the bank subpoenas as an “unprecedented abuse of power,” motivated by politics.“Instead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father is administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments,” Eric Trump said in a statement to VICE News. “This incompetence is the exact reason why the American people have such disdain for politicians and why my father was elected president.”But House Democrats say they are worried about the national security implications of Trump is potential ties to foreign money.“We want to know if the president or anyone in his family is financially compromised,” Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California on the House Intelligence Committee, said onCNN late Monday. “Not just to the Russians, because we should not assume he is faithful to them. He has worked with the Saudis, with other countries, in ways that are certainly, I think, below the standard of conduct that we would accept.”Deutsche has had its own controversial history with helping to move Russian money around the world. In January 2017, the bank was fined $630 million by regulators in New York and London for allowing clients of its Moscow office to launder $10 billion out of Russia through questionable stock trades. Deutsche is not the only aspect of Trump is finances facing scrutiny. The New York State Department of Financial Services, has sought records from Trump is longtime insurance broker, Aon. The House Oversight Committee is seeking years worth of records from Trump is longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA,according to Politico. And the House Ways & Means Committee submitted a formal request to the IRS for Trump is tax returns, with a deadline of April 23.

297,"Whistleblowers Demand VOA Director Resign Over Pompeo Speech, Staff Moves",-2.67,45.33,https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/whistleblowers-demand-voa-director-resign-over-pompeo-speech-staff-moves,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,24,"Twenty-six journalists have demanded that Voice of America is director resign after a series of alleged retaliatory measures and firewall violations culminated in the reassignment of one of VOA is most high-profile reporters. A statement shared publicly Thursday accuses director Robert Reilly and his deputy director, Elizabeth Robbins, of violating VOA is journalistic code by giving a senior government official “a free platform to speak live on our channels” by arranging a live broadcast of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the n removing VOA is White House correspondent after she tried to question the outgoing secretary. The Government Accountability Project (GAP), a nonprofit that protects whistleblowers, informed USAGM and VOA leadership, along with the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of the Inspector General, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other lawmakers, that those signing the petition are deemed protected whistleblowers. Patsy Widakuswara, who joined VOA in 2003, was told late Monday she was being reassigned, hours after the veteran reporter attempted to question Pompeo and the n Reilly as the secretary left VOA is headquarters. In his speech, the outgoing secretary of state praised Michael Pack, USAGM is chief executive, for changes implemented at USAGM under his leadership. He also commended a group of VOA journalists for their bravery in covering Hong Kong is pro-democracy protests. Widakuswara was among the team honored with the Burke Award for that coverage. Following his speech, which also addressed “American exceptionalism” and what he views as VOA is role, Pompeo had a brief question-and-answer session with Reilly, who did not pose questions submitted by the agency is main newsroom about recent news events. As the secretary of state left the network is headquarters, Widakuswara tried unsuccessfully to question Pompeo and the n Reilly, who admonished Widakuswara, saying she was not authorized to ask questions. The statement signed by the more than two dozen VOA journalists calls for Reilly is and Robbins’ immediate resignations.“As journalists, our job is to pursue the truth — to ask questions even when it is uncomfortable or difficult. While Mr. Reilly abdicated this duty, one VOA journalist — Senior White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara — tried to uphold it by questioning Secretary Pompeo after the event,” the statement says. The statement also criticizes the “sudden and unexplained” reassignment of VOA Central News Director Yolanda Lopez, who was moved into a new role Wednesday evening. She was replaced by Luis Ramirez, an editor in the news division who has worked as a correspondent and editor in overseas and domestic bureaus during a 21-year career with the agency. VOA directors have the authority to reassign staff as they see fit. A spokesperson said Wednesday that it does not comment on personnel matters. Representatives Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, and Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, condemned the decision to remove Widakuswara in a joint statement from the Foreign Affairs Committee. In a separate statement shared with VOA, Meeks, the new committee chairman, said, “It is ironic that Secretary Pompeo would praise VOA for fighting foreign propaganda while using it to spread his own. Pompeo improperly held VOA reporters as a captive audience for a speech where the only questions allowed were from the administration is own appointees.”Noting that Pack is already under scrutiny by the committee for “efforts to dismantle editorial independence at VOA,” Meeks added that the decision to remove a senior reporter “only gives ammunition to those same authoritarian leaders and undermines our ability to promote free speech around the world.”Pack has previously denied allegations that he is interfering with editorial independence, saying he is trying to address long-standing issues, including alleged security lapses within the agency. USAGM referred comments to VOA is public relations. In aDecember 6 interview with'“American Thought Leaders” podcast, Pack said his vision was to address areas where the networks are failing to fulfil their mission adequately, including reporting objectively, explaining American values and presenting the US administration is viewpoint. Media rights lawyer Theodore Boutrous accused Pack, Reilly and Pompeo of “making the First Amendment and the American tradition of freedom of the press a laughingstock around the world.”Boutrous, whose firm, Gibson Dunn, represents Widakuswara as well as senior USAGM officials and a VOA journalist in a separate lawsuit,warned in a letter Wednesdaythat the reassignment was “unlawful and unconstitutional” and called on Reilly to immediately reinstate her. Widakuswara is the second White House correspondent to face apparent retaliation since Pack is tenure began. A separate lawsuit from Gibson Dunn alleged that Pack is aides created a dossier on Steve Herman in an effort to have him reassigned. In that case, a federal district court banned Pack from directly interfering inVOA is editorial decisions, including investigating staff. The GAP also wrote to Pack, Reilly and Robbins on Wednesday, informing them that the decision to remove Widakuswara was gross mismanagement. The letter noted that Widakuswara has since been assigned to the Indonesian service. Neither the reporter nor her union representative was informed of the move, and Widakuswara only learned of it after being copied on an internal email, David Seide, senior counsel at GAP, said in the letter. Indonesian news outlets including have reported on the bipartisan condemnation of VOA over its decision to reassign Widakuswara. The White House correspondent started her career as an international journalist in VOA is Indonesian service, working on a J-1 visa. Journalists at VOA is sister network RFE/RL have also raised concerns over Pack is decisions. A December 30 letter from the RFE/RL editorial board and language service directors protested attempts by Pack to change their grantee contracts. The amendments, signed Monday by Ted Lipien, the newly appointed president of RFE/RL, say members, officers and directors appointed by the CEO cannot be removed for two years after their appointment, unless convicted of a criminal charge, and after that period they can be removed only for cause. The revised contract also states that as a condition of receiving grant funds, RFE/RL agrees to amend its articles of incorporation, bylaws and other documents as necessary.“[This] is precisely the kind of political power maneuver that RFE/RL regularly witnesses in places like Russia, Hungary, Belarus and Tajikistan. We never thought we’d see it from our own oversight agency,”the letter read. USAGM has also sought to debar the Open Technology Fund from federal funding, citing conflicts of interest and alleged irregularities at the independent nonprofit. Pack first notified the OTF of plans to block it from funding on December 15, but he rescinded the notice and reissued it without explanation at the end of the month. The new notice means that a 90-day extension for OTF to contest the bill, included in a spending bill signed by Congress in late December, no longer applies.",2,2,Voice of America
298,President Biden should follow Lincoln is lead,10.0,33.33,https://www.christianpost.com/voices/president-biden-should-follow-lincolns-lead.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-christian-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,17,"On January 20th, President-elect Joe Biden will become President Joe Biden when he takes the oath of office. If he follows the lead of most of his predecessors (going back to George Washington), he will do so on an open Bible. The seriousness of the moment, the public trust invested in the executive branch, seems to demand an appeal to the divine. Then, he will have an opportunity to address the nation to set a tone for his administration. The best inaugural addresses connect to the broader American tradition, and in our moment, the new President could do much worse than following Abraham Lincoln is lead. Inaugural addresses over the past two centuries have sought to speak to specific moments while connecting to long-standing American principles. Addresses aim to set a clear to ne, like Franklin Roosevelt is declaration, taking office during the Great Depression, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Presidents may attempt to communicate an approach to the problems faced, as when Ronald Reagan asserted, “In the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” The best call for active response, along the lines of John F Kennedy is “Ask not what your country can do for you —ask what you can do for your country.”These strategies will be in Mr. Biden is mind as he prepares his address. He begins his presidency confronting both the on-going challenges of COVID-19 and the deep political polarization which has not only strained national unity but broken out into political violence at the Capitol. In light of these problems, Mr. Biden would do well to turn back to President Lincoln is 1861 First Inaugural. Lincoln had just come through a hotly contested and divisive election not unlike last November is. Lincoln carried the standard for the upstart Republican party. The Democratic party, formerly a national party, had itself fractured, nominating two candidates, Stephen Douglas and John C Breckinridge. John Bell ran on the Constitutional Union ticket. When the votes were counted, Lincoln had a majority of electoral votes and so achieved the presidency according to constitutional guidelines. This stunned many southerners. They could legitimately claim that they did not know anyone who had voted for Lincoln, since the Republican ticket had been denied ballot access across the South. The question of legitimacy swirled. Lincoln faced more than just hard feelings; he confronted the very real danger of political violence. Southern fire-eaters, once the election returns came in, began laying the groundwork to leave the Union. Their endeavors bore fruit when South Carolina voted to secede. Six other Deep South states would follow them. Lincoln had largely remained silent. His inaugural address was thus his opportunity to speak to a nation on the brink of dissolution. How did he speak to a nation tearing itself apart?Lincoln addressed his hearers with honesty. He acknowledged differences between the sections, rooted in the legal standing of slavery. He did not ignore or paper over those differences, yet he believed the issues could be negotiated carefully. However, Lincoln also was honest in the consequences awaiting the secessionists. Pushing further down their course would elicit a strong response. “I shall have the most solemn [oath] to ‘preserve, protect, and defend’” the government and the Constitution, Lincoln told the m, signaling the steps he would take in the days after the ceremony. Next, Lincoln called for patient reflection. “Think calmly and,” he cautioned. “Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.” Rather than “hot haste,” the wiser course facing a divided people was to pause and reflect on consequences. The optimistic predictions among the secessionists represented mere braggadocio. A more realistic, sober assessment would bring the parties back to the table. Third, Lincoln sought to recreate national unity through reminding his listeners of historical ties, to recover a common identity in a shared history. Although alluded to several times, this the me was front and center in his conclusion: “Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Lincoln intended these lines — now famous — to evoke a loyalty that could go beyond transient differences to produce long-term concord. Finally, Lincoln placed the divides within a transcendent framework. The “Almighty Ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice” was overseeing the conflict and would render a judgment, according to Lincoln. Disunionists would have to reckon, not only with the consequences of their actions, but with the evaluation of a just God. The great irony is that Lincoln is inaugural did revive America is better angels. When Lincoln decided to resupply Ft. Sumter in Charleston Harbor, the Confederate batteries opened fire, launching the Civil War. Over the next four years, Americans would slaughter one another, leaving over 600,000 dead and thousands more permanently maimed. President Lincoln lived long enough to see the War end and to issue a call “to bind up the nation is wounds,” but his efforts would be cut short by an assassin is bullet. Yet, Lincoln is appeal to his countrymen echoes today. Mr. Biden is Inaugural Address would do well to draw his listeners to the four elements of Lincoln is. Americans need to look at their differences with honesty, resisting the habit of finding and the n magnifying the worst examples of those with whom we disagree. Further, we need to face facts honestly, even if we do not like them or they do not confirm our prior assumptions. Second, it might be good to slow down and practice some patient reflection, rather than jumping from one hot take to another. Third, the address could call the country back to a shared purpose, recognizing our connections to an American past. That past is not perfect. It is marred in significant ways — as Lincoln knew well — but it also has resources in both principles and the many examples of those who called for the country to be better. Finally, this endeavor works best when it is understood that our civic actions are not just for ourselves. Following Lincoln, an appeal to “Him, who has never yet forsaken this favored land” would not be out of order.

299,Twitter may let users choose how to crop image previews after bias scrutiny – TechCrunch,-0.67,49.67,https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-may-let-users-choose-how-to-crop-image-previews-after-bias-scrutiny,https://adfontesmedia.com/techcrunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,19,"In an interesting development in the wake of a bias controversy over its cropping algorithm, Twitter has said it is considering giving users decision-making power over how tweet previews look, saying it wants to decrease its reliance on machine learning-based image cropping. Yes, you read that right. A tech company is affirming that auto mating certain decisions may not, in fact, be the smart thing to do — tacitly acknowledging that removing human agency can generate harm. As we reported last month, the micro blogging platform found its image-cropping algorithm garnering critical attention afterPhD. student Colin Madlandnoticed the algorithm only showed his own (white male) image in preview — repeatedly cropping out the image of a black faculty member. Ironically enough he’d been discussing a similar bias issue with Zoom is virtual backgrounds. Geez…any guesses why@Twitterdefaulted to show only the right side of the picture on mobile?pic.twitter.com/UYL7N3XG9k— Colin Madland (@colinmadland)September 19, 2020Twitter responded to the criticism at the time by saying it had tested for bias before shipping the machine learning model and had “not found evidence of racial or gender bias”. But it added: “It is clear from these examples that we have got more analysis to do. We will continue to share what we learn, what actions we take, and will open source our analysis so others can review and replicate.”Twitter and Zoom is algorithmic bias issuesIt has now followed up with additional details about its testing processes in abl og post where it suggests it could move away from using an algorithm for preview crops in the future. Twitter also concedes it should have published details of its bias testing process launching the algorithmic cropping tool — in order that its processes could have been externally interrogated. “This was an oversight,” it admits. We saw your Tweets about the harm caused by how images are cropped on Twitter. Today we are sharing how we test for bias in our systems, and how we plan to rely less on auto-cropping and give you more choice in how images appear in Tweets:— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport)October 1, 2020Explaining how the model works, Twitter writes: “The image cropping system relies on saliency, which predicts where people might look first. For our initial bias analysis, we tested pairwise preference between two demographic groups (White-Black, White-Indian, White-Asian and male-female). In each trial, we combined two faces into the same image, with their order randomized, the n computed the saliency map over the combined image. Then, we located the maximum of the saliency map, and recorded which demographic category it landed on. We repeated this 200 times for each pair of demographic categories and evaluated the frequency of preferring one over the other.”“While our analyses to date have not shown racial or gender bias, we recognize that the way we automatically crop photos means there is a potential for harm. We should have done a better job of anticipating this possibility when we were first designing and building this product. We are currently conducting additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing, are committed to sharing our findings, and are exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable,” it adds. On the possibility of moving away from algorithmic image cropping in favor of letting humans have a say, Twitter says it has “started exploring different options to see what will work best across the wide range of images people tweet every day”.“We hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what they will look like in the tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm,” it adds, suggesting tweet previews could in future include visual controls for users. Such a move, rather than injecting “friction” into the platform (which would presumably be the typical techie concern about adding another step to the tweeting process), could open up new creative/tonal possibilities for Twitter users by providing another layer of nuance that wraps around tweets. Say by enabling users to create “Easter egg” previews that deliberately conceal a key visual detail until someone clicks through; or which zero-in on a particular element to emphasize a point in the tweet. Given the popularity of joke “half and half” images that play with messaging app WhatsApp is preview crop format — which requires a click to predictably expand the view — it is easy to see similar visual jokes and mem es being fired up on Twitter, should it provide users with the right tools. The bottom line is that giving humans more agency means you are inviting creativity —letting diversity override bias. Which should be a win-win. So it is great to see Twitter entertaining the idea of furloughing one of its algorithms. (Dare we suggest the platform also takes a close and critical look at the algorithmic workings around“top tweets”, “trending tweets”, and the “popular/relevant” content its al gos sometimes choose to inject, unasked, into users’ timelines, all of which can generate a smorgasbord of harms.)Returning to image cropping, Twitter says that as a general rule it will be committed to “the ‘what you see is what you get’ principles of design” — aka, “the photo you see in the tweet composer is what it will look like in the tweet” — while warning there will likely still be some exceptions, such as for images that are not a standard size. In those cases it says it will experiment with how such images are presented, aiming to do so in a way that “does not lose the creator is intended focal point or take away from the integrity of the photo”. Again, it will do well to show any algorithmic workings in public. We need a new field of AI to combat racial bias",2,2,TechCrunch
300,"Biden is plan to tackle far-right terrorism is sane and thorough, so expect a Tucker meltdown",-15.0,37.33,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2021/6/15/2035449/-Biden-s-plan-to-tackle-far-right-terrorism-is-sane-and-thorough-so-expect-a-Tucker-meltdown,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-kos-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-15,24,"With Attorney GeneralMerrick Garland handling press duties, the Biden administration has announced its thoughtful, carefully prepared plan for attacking the problem of domestic terrorism, particularly the far-right variety that has posed the most serious threat to the American public for many years now. That will mean one thing for certain: Tucker Carlson is going to have a complete meltdown about it.""Such attacks are not only unspeakable tragedies for the victim is loved ones, they are also a tragedy for our country, an attack on our core ideals as a society,"" Garland told reporters in announcing the strategy. ""We must not only bring our federal resources to bear, we must adopt a broader societal response to tackle the problem is deeper roots.""There were concerns about what shape such a strategy might take when the president announced it in January immediately upon taking office, fueled in no small part by the eruption of far-right violence at the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol—particularly suggestions to pass new anti-terrorism laws and erect a to p-heavy “war on terror”-style response. However, the plan released Tuesday by the administration has none of these characteristics, is sensibly focused on enforcing the abundant laws already on the books, and similarly on rooting out extremists from within the ranks of the law enforcement officers charged with enforcing those laws. No doubt it will drive Carlson over the edge.“We have to take both short-term steps to counter the very real threats of today and longer-term measures to diminish the drivers that will contribute to this ongoing challenge to our democracy,”Biden sai din an official statement.“This is a project that should unite all Americans. Together we must affirm that domestic terrorism has no place in our society. We must work to root out the hatreds that can too often drive violence. And we must recommit to defending and protecting our basic freedoms, which belong to all Americans in equal measure, and which are not only the foundation of our democracy—they are our enduring advantage in the world.”The plan outlines four main components, or “pillars”:Notably, while the plan does not advocate for new legislation to bolster prosecutors’ ability to charge terrorist actors, it does not specifically eschew the idea, either. Rather,the FAQnotes: “DOJ is closely examining whether new legislative authorities that balance safety and the protection of civil liberties are necessary and appropriate.”“The recognition that civil society is the first and best line of defense against the radical right; empowering this through learning, support and training is urgently needed,” Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right,told BuzzFeed News. “Finding ways of doing this that smacks neither of propaganda or superficiality will be a major headache, though we really have no choice if we are really committed to pushing back the tide of hatred, disinformation and political violence.”Experts were also impressed by the funding dedicated to preventing radicalization. “If that is allocated effectively, it could have a real impact,”tweeted Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. “Better recognition of the signs leading up to an attack, sure. But also resources to help stop radicalization before it starts.”The plan also deals clearly with the problem of infiltration of the ranks of law enforcement and the military by far-right extremists, particularly since the former will be primarily responsible for enforcing the laws against terrorist violence:The US Government is improving employee screening to enhance methods for identifying domestic terrorists who might pose insider threats. The Office of Personnel Management will consider updates to the forms used to apply for sensitive roles in the Federal Government that could assist investigators in identifying potential domestic terrorism threats. DOD, DOJ, and DHS are similarly pursuing efforts to ensure domestic terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement ranks and improve screening and vetting processes. As the Brennan Center for Justice is Michael Germanexplored in a study, law enforcement has increasingly been polluted by the rising numbers of far-right extremists within their ranks—some of them recruited from within police forces, while others have surreptitiously infiltrated them. “While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal, state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactive ly identify the m, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they are sworn to serve,” he writes.“Efforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.”It is not credible to expect our national law enforcement apparatus to respond effectively to far-right domestic terrorism when its ranks are full of people sympathetic to their cause. So any effective solution to dealing with the spread of domestic terrorism will necessarily be wrapped up in the similarly major issue of larger police reform, which should probably begin with a focused effort on weeding out extremists within their ranks.“The USs is well served by a diverse workforce, including in the military and Federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement,” the plan states. “Those who protect and defend this nation should reflect the nation, including its vast spectrum of experiences and viewpoints. Consistent with that, no one should be allowed to abuse or exploit the trust and responsibility or the often sensitive accesses and resources that are a part of such professions.”Experts generally voiced approval for the plan. “This first US strategy breaks new ground in moving beyond an exclusively law-enforcement and security frame in thinking about combatting domestic violent extremism, including serious attention to prevention,”tweeted Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss,director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University. Mary McCord of Georgetown University Law Centertoldthat prevention also involves tactics such as undercover stings, which some civil liberties groups have deemed entrapment. “You do not want to be prosecuting the El Paso terrorist after he kills 23 people. You want to have prevented it,” McCord said. “That is the challenge. Because anytime you are engaging in preventive law enforcement, that comes with criticisms.”“This brings us in line with what other countries are doing overseas: Understanding you ca not tackle domestic extremism by only paying attention to the fringe,” Miller-Idriss told The Washington Post. “You also have to pay attention to what is happening in the mainstream.”“The devil is in the execution, but this is an intelligent step forward, and an important departure from the past,”tweeted Hughes. “Kudos to the authors and the admin. I am looking forward to see what happens next.”Biden is strategy codifies what experts such as Carly Gordenstein and Seamus Hughes, researchers at George Washington University is Program on Extremism, consider to be “a sea change in counterterrorism.”“It is clear that structural changes are under way that aim to root out extremism in and out of government, attempt to concentrate efforts more efficiently, and invest in the issue of domestic extremism at a rate that is unprecedented in the USs,” Gordenstein and Hughes wrote. All of which is certain to send Tucker Carlson completely over the edge on his show. Carlson, who has been leading Fox News’ final descent into the abyss of far-right extremism, has had a particular fetish about the looming prosecutions of a number of far-right extremists, including the January 6 insurrectionists—because the target, according to Carlson, is actually ordinary Republicans. Carlson has tried to claim both that the Capitol was “not an armed insurrection” and that terrorism by white nationalists—who he defines as “people who do not agree with Joe Biden”—isnot a significant threat: “So, what is white supremacy? Well, the weird thing is Joe Biden did not define it,” he falsely claimed on a recent show. Tuesday is announced strategy, in fact, quite clearly defines it:[One] key aspect of to day is domestic terrorism threat emerges from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and networks whose racial, ethnic, or religious hatred leads them toward violence, as well as those whom they encourage to take violent action. These actors have different motivations, but many focus their violence towards the same segment or segments of the American community, whether persons of color, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, other religious minorities, women and girls, LGBTQI+ individuals, or others. Their insistence on violence can, at times, be explicit. It also can, at times, be less explicit, lurking in ideologies rooted in a perception of the superiority of the white race that call for violence in furtherance of perverse and abhorrent notions of racial “purity” or “cleansing.”Count on Carlson to pretend otherwise while claiming that the above description somehow targets Republicans. After all, we are now down to seeing Fox News openly identify with violent far-right extremists to own the libs.",1,1,Daily Kos

Deque, a company that helps develop accessible web applications and processes, checked each state is process for applying to receive a mail-in or absentee ballot (they are basically the same thing). Disappointingly, 43 of the states’ applications “had some level of digital inaccessibility.”This could be a variety of things, but take for example an application that is a PDF In order to be accessible the document should be real text that can be read by a screen reader app, and the user should be able to fill in the fields necessary without printing it and grabbing a pen. Making a single form readable and writable can probably be done in an hour or two, which is why Deque did so and offered the updated forms to each state. Georgia, Rhode Island, Ohio, Montana, Missouri, Maryland, and Kentucky all quickly accepted the offered help. Michigan and Massachusetts have accessible online processes as alternatives to the PDFs, and several states do not require applications. Anything less than nationwide vote by mail is electoral sabotageThe remainder have some sort of issue. That does not mean that a blind person or someone who ca not write will be totally unable to request a mail-in ballot, but it will not be as easy as it is for many others and they may need help from another person, which is not always easy to get on short notice. Deque has most of the states’ forms available with accessibility updates here.“Voting is a right. It was an easy decision for us to offer these remediated PDFs as a free public service, hopefully making it easier for all to take advantage of mail-in voting options,” said Deque CEO Preety Kumar in a press release announcing the audit. The effort to make and keep the web — and things like ordinary government functions — accessible is a full-time one.

Instead, American children have been forced to endure substandard electronic remote instruction, while teachers and schools struggle to troubleshoot, and political activist unions do their best to keep children out of the classrooms. But in Biden is America, illegal immigrants get special privileges that taxpaying American citizens do not, perhaps because the Biden Admin has high hopes for their voting future. Unaccompanied illegal migrant minors are now being instructed in-person by teachers from the San Diego Unified School District, while the 130,000 American citizen children from taxpaying families are only allowed online learning. Wait a minute… So you are saying it is ok for San Diego teachers to teach in person… just not to San Diego children?— Reopen California Schools (@ReopenCASchools)March 29, 2021The San Diego County Board of Education decided to send volunteer San Diego public school teachers to a local convention center that is currently housing unaccompanied illegal migrant children, for in-person education. But San Diego is own American citizens, who pay their taxes to fund their local public schools and teachers, have to watch as their own children are forced to struggle through online school instead. Apparently, it is too dangerous for teachers to return to full-time in-person work to teach San Diego is legal taxpaying citizens, but it is not too dangerous for them to provide in-person education to unaccompanied illegal migrant children who they hope are future Democrat voters. One parent said,“The system is broken when San Diego teachers are teaching migrant children in person, but the 100k students of taxpaying families at San Diego Unified School District are stuck learning in Zoom school. We agree that every child deserves an in-person education, but why are taxpaying students put last?

So how exactly did more than half a billion dollars get spent if it was not on getting those schools reopened for in-person learning?Representative Darrell Issa told Fox News,“For more than a year, parents and students in San Diego County have waited for educators to answer one question: When will our schools reopen with in-person instruction only?

304,Georgia Was A Disaster For Republicans. It is Not Clear Where They Can Go Next.,-9.4,43.8,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-was-a-disaster-for-republicans-and-its-not-clear-where-they-can-go-next/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-11,25,"Theterrifying mob attack on the Capitol on Wednesday, among its many effects, quickly shifted focus from the other big news of the week: the runoffs for US Senate in Georgia. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively, givingDemocrats control of Congress. Like a lot of recent political events, the Georgia runoffs are more significant the further you zoom out the lens. In one sense, the results were not thatunpredictable. Thefinal polling averages showed both Democrats ever-so-slightly ahead, and it was clear that the races we reshaping up in such a way as to make the Democrats extremely competitive. But the Georgia runoffs were full of practical and symbolic significance. They exposed the limitations of the Republican coalition, with or without President Trump, leaving the party further in the electoral wilderness — it is not clear where the Republican Party goes from here, especially in the wake of the violent insurrection by Trump supporters at the Capitol. First, the significance of Georgia specifically. I will spare you some of the boilerplate about the more obvious implications, but having a Senate majority is a big deal. It means that Democrats should be able to confirm Supreme Court justices and President-elect Joe Biden is Cabinet. They will likely be able to pass additional COVID-19 stimulus legislation at the very least, along with other budgetary policies through reconciliation. Other policy changes would require eliminating the filibuster —unlikely— or getting cooperation from enough Republicans. But at least Democrats will have the chance to bring to the floorelection-reform bills like HR 1andpolicies like Puerto Rico statehood, giving them a fighting chance instead of having Majority Leader Mitch McConnell squash them from the start. And symbolically? Well,it isGeorgia. With the possible exception of Texas, no other state has been as much of a symbol of an emerging Democratic coalition of college-educated white voters and high turnout among Black voters and other minority groups. Both Warnock and Ossoff are breakthrough candidates, not the moderate, whiteBlue Dogsthat Democrats have traditionally nominated in Georgia. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, will become the first Black senator from Georgia and the first Black Democrat ever to serve in the US Senate from the South. Ossoff will become the youngest senator elected since Biden, in 1973, and the first Jewish senator elected to the US Senate from the South since the 1880s. Then the re is the fact that the runoffs came during a lame-duck period in which — in a predicate to Wednesday is violence — Trump and other Republicanstried to overturn and subvert the results of the election and undermine faith in the democratic process. If Republicans get the message that anti-democratic actions have negative electoral consequences, they may be less inclined to push democracy to the brink in the future. Republicans may not take away that lesson, though. One school of thought is that because Warnock is and Ossoff is wins were narrow — once all votes are counted, Warnock should win by around 2 percentage points and Ossoff by about 1 point — we should not make too much of them. I do not find this convincing. The way political actors react to elections is usually based on who wins and loses, not on their margins of victory. For example, nobody thought that Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were brilliant politicians because they only narrowly lost in key Electoral College states. But it is also not clear that these races really had any business being close to begin with. Consider the following:Indeed, after Georgia, Republicans’ track record in the three general elections (2016, 2018, 2020) plus the various runoffs and special elections that took place under Trump now starts to look mediocre:So, it has not been a terrible time to be a Republican running for office, but it has not been a good one, either. Typically, a party would be looking to move beyond a one-term president who had cost his party control of both houses of Congress. Actually, that is being kind: Typically, a party wants nothing to do with a losing presidential candidate. When it comes to Trump, though, that calculation is not necessarily so simple because of his tendency to punish his intraparty adversaries: Republicans who tried to cross him, such as former Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, were sometimes forced to retire rather than face the president is wrath in a primary. Yet the GOP has done especially poorly in Trump-era electionswithoutTrump on the ballot, too. Republicanslost the popular vote for the US House by 8.6 points in 2018without the president on the ticket. And while some Republicans are blaming Trump for their losses in Georgia, the fact is that Perdue won the plurality of votes in November with Trump on the ballot but lost to Ossoff without him. Tuesday is loss came primarily because of lower turnout, especially in red, rural counties where Trump can bring voters to the polls. To step back a bit, the success of an electoral strategy basically comes down to four dimensions:In Trump-era elections, Republicans have tended to do well along two of these dimensions and poorly along the other two. Namely, Trump gets very high turnout from his base. What is just as important, rural white voters who are the core of that base have far more power in the Electoral College and US Senatethan their raw numbers would imply, making their coalition electorally efficient. Hence, their strategy has performed well along dimensions Number 1 and Number 4. Conversely, Trump isextremelymotivatingin turning out many parts of the Democratic base (dimension Number 2). And he is a big turn-off to swing voters, or at least he is proven to be after four years in office (dimension Number 3). After narrowly beating Clinton among independent voters in 2016, Trump lost them to Biden by13 points in November. Swing voters also have not been very happy with the GOP with or without Trump on the ballot: They backed Democratic candidates for the US House by12 points in 2018. Republicans have had especially big problems with suburban swing voters, including in places that were once GOP strongholds. We will have to wait and see, but the violence at the Capitol last week may only exacerbate the GOP is problems on dimensions Number 2 and Number 3. In the fewpollsconducted since, solid majorities of Americans overall, including almost all Democrats and a majority of independents, said the storming of the Capitol represented a threat to democracy. Similar shares of Democrats and independents said Trump and congressional Republicans bore at least some blame. Republicans are in a fairly precarious position. At best, they are often fighting to a draw, and one that would often be a losing strategy without the structural advantages built into the system for rural voters. And if Republicans do not get spectacular turnout from their base, everything else potentially starts to crumble. Even a modest decline in turnout from people who are pro-#MAGA but not necessarily part of the traditional Republican base can leave the GOP in a losing position. Nor do Republicans have any sort of obvious role model for how to achieve consistent electoral success. The previous Republican president, George W Bush, saw his second term in office end with landslides against Republicans in 2006 and 2008. A series of recent presidential nominees associated with the party establishment (Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole) all lost their elections, meanwhile. You really have to go back to Ronald Reagan for an example of an unambiguously broad and successful Republican electoral coalition, and that was a generation ago. Republicans who cast their first votes for Reagan at age 18 in 1984 will be 58 years old in 2024. This does not mean Republicans are helpless, by any means. Under McConnell and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, their congressional agenda has also been largely unpopular. If you areconsistently pushing positions that a majority of the public opposes, you are liable to pay a price for it. Republicans’ structural advantages (especially in the Senate), and Trump is ability to drive turnout in the places where those structural advantages matter, served as cover for ami norit arian agenda. For all that said, the tendency of the opposition party to regain ground at the midterms is very strong. One would not want to bet that much against the GOP winning back one or both houses of Congress in 2022. (The House, where Republicans should pick up some seats from redistricting, might actually be the better bet than the Senate, whereDemocrats have a relatively favorable map.)After last week, though, I am not sure I’d want to place a lot of money on the GOP in 2022, either. If the Georgia runoffs served as a quasi-midterm, they might suggest that the GOP ca not count on the sort of gains that a party typically wins in midterms. As in the primaries leading up to 2010, the GOP is likely to have some vicious intraparty fights, possibly leading it to nominate suboptimal candidates in some races. And with the violence last week and Republican efforts to contest the Electoral College outcome in Congress, Democrats may be very motivated again in 2022, feeling — not unreasonably — as though democracy itself may be on the line.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight

State representative Gary Eisen (R-St. Clair) has been yanked from his committee assignments by Republican state house leadership after going public about the plan and saying that violence could come as a result of the fallout from Republican lawmakers doing the right thing.“Number I do not know. Because what we are doing today is uncharted. It has not been done. And it is not me who is doing it…it is the Michigan Republican Party,” Eisen said about the possibility of violence in the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarkville) has shut down the Capitol, using COVID-19 and the potential of violence as an excuse. Eisen believes that this is abdicating the duty of the legislature and another example of extreme cowardice by Republican leadership.“So they are going to lock us out of our offices, they are going to lock us out of the Capitol,” Eisen said.“How convenient is that, when they are going to sit electors to day, so that we ca not support our options. Whether it was true or not, we do not know,” he added. House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R-Levering) is receiving the blame from grassroots activists in Michigan who are enraged by this betrayal: is office has made it abundantly clear that they intend to go along with the vote steal and plan to help Michigan Democrats get away with their illicit electoral heist.“The speakers position has not changed. Michigan will follow the law and allocate the state is electors to the candidate who won the most votes,” Chatfield spokesman Giden D’Assandro said. Chatfield released a statement of unconditional surrender to Democrats earlier to day: League Politicsreportedon how it was a top Republican attorney in the state house who voted to certify the dubious vote in Michigan last month even before the many voter fraud whistle blowers could share their testimony at the hearing:Earlier this week, Big League Politicsreportedon the cowardly Republicans on the state board of canvassers who signed off on a dubious vote even after dozens of conservative whistle blowers have come forth detailing a third-world gangster vote steal operation that occurred in the city of Detroit. One Republican on the state board of canvassers, Norm Shinkle abstained from the vote, being too weak to actually oppose electoral impropriety. The other Republican on the state board of canvassers, Aaron Van Langevelde, actually voted with the Democrats to certify election results marred with improprieties and abnormalities.“We have a clear legal duty to certify the results of the election, as shown by the returns that were given to us,” Van Langevelde said. “We cannot and should not go beyond that. As John Adams once said, ‘We are a government of laws, not men.’”“This board needs to adhere to that principle and do its part to uphold the rule of law here today. This board must uphold the law and comply with our legal duty to certify this election,” he added. Van Langeveldereceived a great deal of support from the liberal media. He also received the backing of the House Republican leadership in the state,who will keep him employed in his cushy role with the party for going along with the façade.“Aaron has been a very valued member of this team and will continue to be next session,” said Republican Speaker-elect Jason Wentworth of Farwell. Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield of Clarklake praised Van Langevelde is betrayal as a great example of “America at work.”“As we have been saying consistently for weeks, the Legislature will uphold the law and respect this result as it works to improve the process for next time,” Chatfield said. Van Langevelde works as a policy adviser and deputy legal counsel for the Michigan House Republican Policy Office. He was effectively carrying out policy from his GOP establishment masters when he joined Democrats to betray his oath of office earlier this week. It has never been easier to see who the RINOs and traitors are than ever before, and the Michigan Republican Party seems to be chocked full of them. Share:",0,0,Big League Politics

I have that exact combination of distractibility and lack of spatial awareness that makes someone a complete disaster on the road. I try to drive carefully, but Texas highways are a demolition derby, and it is hard not to get carried away. And so, given how many times I likely have been pulled over, and was not, I probably had no real reason to feel affronted that day when a cop flagged me down a little outside San Antonio. I still managed to muster a sense of righteous indignation, because on this particular occasion, I was barely going seven miles above the speed limit. The cop pointed out that I was speeding, and I gave him a faintly incredulous look. People regularly did 90mph on this stretch of highway, and we both knew it. The cop wrote me a ticket with no dollar amount. “How much is it, though?” I asked., the cop told me,you have to call the phone number listed on the back. I dragged myself home, posted the ticket on my fridge, and forgot about it until a week before the payment was due. That I would eat the cost of the ticket, rather than fighting it out in court, was a foregone conclusion. I told myself that this was because of my overweening pride and haughtiness, refusing to prostrate myself before The Man, and not because I am lazy, impatient, and intermittently terrified of strangers. Nonetheless, I was still pretty shocked when I called the number as instructed, and a voice on the phone told me that I owed the city of Von Ormy a whopping $430 dollars. “I was seven miles above the speed limit!” I exclaimed. Yes, and that was $230, the voice told me patiently, plus an extra $200 for an expired registration. Still on the phone, I angrily goog led Von Ormy and immediately found a number of news articles dubbing it a “libertarian experiment,” where residents are not charged taxes and which, consequently, seems to be in a constant state of economic freefall. That certainly explained why they have traffic cops stationed right on the part of the highway where the speed limit changes from 75 to 70, looking for passing cars to shake down. I asked if I could pay the ticket online, and was told no—the only way to pay was by money order. One day before the deadline, I called the court in Von Ormy to confirm that they received the money order I’d mailed them. “Where did you mail it to?” the voice on the phone asked me. “The courthouse,” I said. The voice told me, pityingly, that I should not have mailed it to the courthouse. I was supposed to mail it to a mysterious PO box, obviously. At this point, it fully dawned on me that a money order is not like a check, where the funds will not be drawn if they do not reach their intended recipient—I had basically just sent a $430 wad of cash off into some kind of postal abyss. And now the deadline for paying by mail had passed, the voice on the phone told me, so I would have to come settle my ticket in person. I said something incoherent about how libertarianism was literally highway robbery, and hung up. In the end, I got my ticket paid, leapfrogging an entire roomful of fellow-miscreants at the courthouse who were all anxiously waiting to try to bargain down their tickets with the prosecutor. My ability to circumvent that specific, time-consuming part of the process was purely a privilege of wealth: I had enough money in my bank account to cover the sticker price of the ticket, notwithstanding my earlier fuck-up with the money order, and so I bought my way out of the room as quickly as possible. This anecdote, apart from being a classic showpiece of my unremitting administrative incompetence, is, I think, a pretty good example of how we mortals usually interface with bureaucracies, both the government and private bureaucracies which exercise control over important parts of our lives. Bureaucratic processes have lots of rules; some of those rules are unwritten; some are written down, but not consistently followed; some are written down, but not in a place you have access to; random officials determine which rules will be invoked at which times; and, usually, there are a series of escape-valves where, if you have enough money, you can just bribe yourself out of the remaining hassle. Bureaucracy, of course, looks very different when viewed from the perspective of those who govern (or those who sympathize with those who govern), as opposed to those who are governed. For political scientists, bureaucracy is a normal and unavoidable feature of large states. No executive can single-handedly administrate a large polity, and so the development of systematized decision-making procedures that can be delegated downwards is the inevitable outcome. (That bureaucratic systems would develop within private enterprises seems even less surprising, since the re is no pretense of drawing authority from any kind of public mandate.) And in many polities present and historical—from imperial China to the Carolingian Empire to 19th-century Britain—bureaucracies have been imagined as a meritocratic alternative to pure nepotism, the idea being that individuals without significant wealth or family power could enter a bureaucratic system and advance within it, based solely on talent. In the USs, where our political consciousness is mostly limited to elections, and few of us have any cognizance of how bureaucrats are chosen and elevated, this rosy view of bureaucracy is not nearly as widely-held, but some recent media has romanticized bureaucrats and civil servants. Think of, dramatizing the behind-the-scenes labors of White House administrators, orParks and Recreation, where main character Leslie Knope is presented as the quintessential virtuous bureaucrat: eccentrically delighted by regulations and procedures, tirelessly hard-working, and ambitious in the service of the public good. Bureaucrats are, in these shows, imagined to be the epitome of responsible, effective governance, separate from and more high-minded than the rat-race of electoral politics. This, however, is a vision of bureaucracy from the perspective of bureaucrats the mselves. The vision of bureaucracy from the perspective of those who are of bureaucracy is simply: paperwork. There is a thing I need, and I cannot get it unless I fill out a million incomprehensible forms. There is something I have done wrong, in the eyes of the state, and in order to correct it, I must perform a series of bizarre tasks, like a rat in an experiment. Miniscule irregularities in my compliance with these administrative rituals confer immense power on the bureaucrat tasked with evaluating me: such an error gives that bureaucrat untrammeled license to reject my request if they so choose. If the fictional face of the bureaucrat is Leslie Knope, the fictional face of the bureaucratic subject is Josef K., the protagonist of Kafka isThe Trial, who finds himself trapped between a nebulous court and a shadowy Committee of Affairs as he struggles to navigate something he knows only as “the process.”My most nightmarish encounters with bureaucratic systems, unsurprisingly, have occurred in connection with my work as an immigration lawyer. When people think about why our immigration system is bad, they often think about armed patrolmen at the border, prison guards at detention centers, ICE agents conducting workplace raids, etc. But our immigration system is also, at its core, an extremely large and intricate bureaucracy, and many of the bad decisions that affect people is lives within this system are not made by, say, racist immigration cops going rogue in the field, but by immigration bureaucrats calmly reviewing paperwork in an office. It is hard to convey the extent to which the rules of this system are deliberately set up to ensure that are unable to follow the law, no matter how hard they try. This, in turn, the n gives the government handy anecdotes and statistics to trot out in order to suggest that immigrants, much like Josef K., are not Complying With The Process. Let me give you an example of a problem that I encounter frequently. I work primarily with immigrant mothers and children who are imprisoned at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas. One of the ways that moms and kids end up in that detention center is because they were picked up by ICE for having an order of deportation that was entered against them automatically when they failed to show up for their scheduled hearing in immigration court. Now, you might well suspect that people who miss their immigration court hearings are skipping the m, knowing that our court system is incredibly hostile, and fearing that they will lose their case. I certainly would not blame any immigrant for doing this, since it is exactly what I would do in their shoes, without hesitation. However, this is not why the vast majority of the families I have worked with have missed their hearings. In fact, the #1 reason that people miss their hearings is because they never knew they had a hearing. How do I know that these families are telling the truth? Because most of them were arrested at their required check-ins with ICE, to which they continued to faithfully report even after their deportation orders had been entered. Why the hell would you keep attending your scheduled meetings with immigration officials if your intention was to go into hiding?In fact, the story I hear from these families detained at their check-ins is almost always the same: “I did everything I was supposed to do. I checked my mail every day. I went to all my meetings with immigration. I answered all of immigration is phone calls. I always complied with the law. I do not understand why my children and I were arrested.” When I would dig further into their history, I would usually find out that the family, at some point, moved to a different address than the one they registered with immigration when they arrived in the USs. They had, of course, dutifully informed ICE of their new address at their check-in, and an ICE officer had written it down on an official-looking form right there in front of the m, and the family had believed, quite reasonably, that they had successfully updated their address with “the government.” Little did they know, of course, that “immigration” (a.k.a. ICE) is housed under a completely different department than the immigrationsystem, which is responsible for mailing their hearing notices. To change their address with the court,there is a completely different piece of paper they have to fill out and mail to several specific locations within five days of relocating. ICE, with whom these families meet every month, does not give a shit whether the families get their hearing notice at the correct address, so they do not go out of their way to let the families know that there are additional steps they need to take. And so the n, of course, the family shows up at their scheduled check-in one day, never having known that they even h ada court hearing scheduled, only for immigration to gleefully inform the family that they have lost their case and take them into custody. (Other times, the family is registered address is entirely up-to-date, and the government just fucks up sending the notice in the mail—this happens with some frequency, too.)So let is suppose you have missed your hearing in immigration court, and you have automatically been issued an order of deportation—what can you do next? Many immigrants in this situation, I assume, simply get carted off and deported without fanfare, because most detention centers are remote and it is hard to get legal services. If you happen to be detained at a center where there are lawyers on hand to help you, you could perhaps get assistance in filing a special motion to reopen your case with the immigration court. Courts are generally pretty stingy about granting the se, but if you were prevented from attending your hearing for reasons that a particular judge views as sufficiently credible and legally compelling, they might decide to give you another chance. Now, you might think: okay, sure, a very poor, recently-arrived, non-English-speaking family ca not reasonably be expected to navigate the immigration bureaucracy on their own. But if a were right the re, guiding them through each step of the process, surely everything would go fine! Well, not so much. We will leave aside the substance of the lawyer is arguments, and how absurd the judge is ultimate decision can be: I have had motions to reopen denied for families who were literally kidnapped by drug cartel son the date of their scheduled hearing. Let is just focus on the bureaucratic considerations: can the lawyer even manage to get the damn motion filed in the right immigration court? When an immigrant you are trying to help has been shipped to a detention center for processing prior to deportation, the re is a very good chance that the court in which their proceedings took place is located clear on the other side of the country, and also that you are looking at a same-day window of time to get the documents filed with that specific court before your client is put on a plane. Can you file documents electronically with an immigration court, in This Year Of Our Lord 2020? OBVIOUSLY FUCKING NOT You need to file in hard copy, which means either mailing the thing overnight—very expensive, and possibly not fast enough—or finding an actual human in the city where the court is located, who can drop everything they are doing and run to deliver documents for you. Okay, let is suppose you manage to find someone who is available to file the motionEverything depends on the government clerk at the court filing window. The clerk can choose to accept your filing—thus temporarily pausing the immigrant is deportation, and possibly giving you a chance to reverse their deportation order (which again, I ca not stress enough, was probably entered against them forth e most bullshit reasons imaginable)—or reject your filing, thus ensuring their immediate removal. A lot is riding on this decision! Surely, a clerk would not reject a filing for some reason that makes no goddamn sense!Reader: the ywould. I have seen clerks reject emergency filings because they did not contain “wet” ink signatures, when, again, the person was detained thousands of miles from the court and could not have transmitted an original signature to the court in time with anything other than actual wizardry. I have seen clerks reject filings because they were not hole-punched at the to p, when a hole-punch was sitting right at the clerk is elbow at the moment of the rejection. I have endured agonizing phone calls with clerks who rejected filings for reasons they were entirely unable to explain, or who pretended to accept filings at the window and the n quietly rejected them later without telling anyone. The consequences for these administrative decisions can be huge. We are talking about people getting deported because the government never told them they had a hearing, imprisoned them so far from the courthouse that they could not send their documents in time, and rejected the documents that strangers rushed to file on their behalf. Lots of individual actors within the system had to make lots of little decisions, based on mysterious rules, for this insane result to be possible. What kind of a person becomes a bureaucrat? Honestly, part of the reason that I dislike bureaucrats so intensely, I think, is because I have certain personality traits in common with them. I prefer rote, repetitive, predictable work-tasks to complicated, highly context-dependent work-tasks. I do not really like having direct authority over others, nor do I enjoy subjecting myself to the personal whims of an individual boss, so making decisions independently but based off a tree, so to speak, is comfortable for me. I’d like to have a job that I did not have to think about very hard, where I felt like my responsibilities were pretty clear-cut, and where my mind would be freed up for my own imaginative and creative pursuits. In the right setting, I would probably be a reasonably contented pencil-pusher. I also have some of the characteristic flaws of bureaucrats. When someone asks me a question I do not know how to answer, or wants something from me that I do not know how to give the m, I have a tendency to bluster, shut down, or try whatever else I can to prod the problem away from me. When I was in high school, I worked as a cashier at a toy store, and I dimly recall that there were many times where I could not figure out how to find some item, and I sort of just… played dumb until the customer gave up. Those were low stakes, of course: other than a modicum of lost revenue for my employers, and I do not know, the tears of disappointed children, there were no negative consequences. There are some bureaucracies that are like this, too, where the work is low-stakes, and incompetence and lack of problem-solving initiative has limited consequences (or it seems that way, because the consequences are attenuated or invisible). Then there are other kinds of bureaucracies, where the bureaucrats who work within them are constantly exposed to the suffering, despair, pain, and anger of the people who are subject to these bureaucracies. I think I share some of the flaws of these bureaucrats, too. I know how it is to feel like the system you are working in is monstrously large, and your hands are tied; to feel irrationally angry at suffering people, who presume to think you have the power to do something for them when you simply do not; how it feels when a person becomes a problem for you, and you want the problem to go away, and you experience a certain psychological relief when that happens, regardless of whether it went away because you solved it, or because you failed to solve it, so long as you do not have to hear about it again. I know all these feelings intimately, and I think they are evidence that these kinds of rule-governed systems warp the minds and empathetic faculties of the people who are forced into contact with them. Of course, it is hard to get around the need to have something a bureaucracy in many areas of life. After all, if our goal is to have something approaching a world where resources are justly apportioned, that entails some sort of system for tracking how many resources are going where, and what uses they will be put to. Misuse of resources, whether from human error or calculated graft, feels inevitable if there are no systems for tracking what is going where. Keeping things efficient is impossible without set procedures on set issues that lower-level functionaries of the system can implement without needing to do a complicated moral and logistical calculus every single time. “Efficiency” is, of course, an overused term, and valueless when it describes—as it so often does—means without reference to ends. But a healthcare system, a food distribution system, a sewage system, or any other complex system that carries life and death consequences for those who rely on it, ought to be efficient. A multitude of small calculations must be made in such a system, and it is hard to imagine how anything like direct democracy could accomplish it, or how you’d get around the need to have decisions made primarily by people with expertise in the subject area. And so I am not quite proposing that the whole notion of bureaucracy—in the sense of systems whose day-to-day functioning is largely determined by procedures—should or could be eliminated in their entirety. But I think there are a few things that need to be considered when it comes to bureaucracies. One is that no bureaucracies should exist that are not absolutely necessary. To me, the immigration bureaucracy is—not shockingly—a prime example of a bureaucracy that has absolutely no justifying purpose and should be ripped up by the roots and replaced with precisely nothing. There is no good reason to be tracking and evaluating and fining and imprisoning and exiling a subset of the population that happens to be living in a different place than the one where they were born. Many bureaucracies are merely fronts for resource extraction (such as the DMV and traffic courts) or data-mining and public surveillance (such as the NSA), and could be eliminated with no ill effects, and many benefits. But other bureaucracies are harder to imagine away. For example, even if you get rid of the healthbureaucracy, some kind of healthcare bureaucracy must necessarily exist, since a healthcare system must involve extensive decisions about and tracking of the diversion of critical resources, lest we run out of something we need. So what about necessary bureaucracies—what do we do with them? Firstly, it seems important that any bureaucracy that retains a significant level of power should have its officials directly elected by the people whom the bureaucracy exists to serve. The president is ability, for example, to wield direct power through opaque executive agencies is one of the chief reasons why our nominally democratic government is forever spiraling into various forms of executive tyranny. Sure, the re is a slight check in the form of congressional approval for the heads of agencies, but presidents, including Trump, have gotten around this requirement without much trouble. Bureaucrats should not be allowed to be invisible. Any person who holds significant power should have direct accountability to—which effectively means some direct mechanism for removability by—the people whose lives are affected by their decisions. Secondly, interjecting more direct public participation into bureaucracies that theoretically serve public interests is probably the only means of ensuring that these systems remain remotely intelligible and functional. Tools like public referenda, for example, could be required to endorse significant policy shifts within bureaucracies, and help ensure that their functions are optimally useful to the public, not optimally useful to unseen administrators. The reality is that it is unwise to simply trust bureaucrats, as it is unwise to simply trust anyone with unaccountable power. While civic-minded, virtuous bureaucrats do sometimes exist in real life, they are not the norm, and are more often characterized by their willingness to bend or break procedural rules than their commitment to following them. (Think of Chiune Sugihara or Raoul Wallenberg, diplomats during World War II who, at personal and professional risk, issued thousands of unorthodox travel documents to European Jews so that they could escape transportation to concentration camps.) Most bureaucrats you encounter in day-to-day life obey the rules, and they are awful. When right-wingers invoke the specter of Big Government Bureaucrats Coming Between You and Your Doctor (or Children, Guns, Soda, etc.), their rhetoric is frequently effective, and that is because it reminds people of their actual, painful interactions with bureaucracies. Rather than trying to convince people that government bureaucrats are actually great, and that people are stupid for not appreciating public service—asandParks and Recreationattempt to do—the left should concede that 1) bureaucracies are bad; 2) at their best, they are necessary evils; 3) they will always be compromised of ordinary humans clumsily implementing best-fit rules; and 4) that constant public collaboration is necessary to prevent them from becoming burdensome and exploitative. Otherwise, bureaucracies will not facilitate service to the public. They will instead continue to impose impossible obstacles between the public and what it needs.",0,1,Current Affairs

310,Joe Biden Will Face a Much-Changed and Skeptical World,-14.0,39.67,https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/gary-grappo-joe-biden-foreign-policy-objectives-china-iran-climate-change-us-politics-news-99089/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,21,"Joe Biden was not elected for his positions on foreign policy and national security. Few US presidential candidates are. In his debates with outgoing President Donald Trump prior to the election, those issues were hardly discussed. So, the success or failure of the Biden presidency will not be determined by foreign policy. For President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, domestic policy will dominate their time and efforts. Overcoming the coronavirus pandemic, ensuring that newly released vaccines are quickly and effectively administered, and righting a still stressed US economy will be their top priorities in the first year. It is what the American people want and expect. Furthermore, there is America is worsening and more pernicious longer-term problems: increasing economic inequality, continuing racial injustice and growing political polarization. These will be profoundly difficult problems to address successfully, especially as President Biden could face a US Senate controlled by the Republican Party and a thinner Democratic Party majority in the House of Representatives. Nevertheless, after four years of an unprecedentedly destructive foreign policy and simply by virtue of the fact he will lead still the world is most powerful and wealthiest nation, Joe Biden cannot ignore foreign policy. In fact, amidst his formidable domestic challenges, he must confront serious foreign policy challenges vital to America is interests and to those of its many friends and allies around the world. We may already have caught a glimpse of how different Joe Biden is foreign policy will be from Donald Trump is, considering the first officials named to his senior foreign policy team: Antony Blinken as secretary of state, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as US ambassador to the UN with cabinet rank, Jake Sullivan as national security adviser, Avril Haines as director of National Intelligence and Katherine Tai as the US trade representative. They are all highly experienced, proven, knowledgeable, principled and committed public servants. Under President Trump, we saw few of those and many more self-interested, self-promoting political hacks and ideologues. One of the first jobs Biden must tackle is America is badly damaged reputation around the world. Donald Trump undermined critical alliances, pointlessly insulted and demeaned allies, abandoned international agreements and institutions, embraced autocrats and dictators from Russia to North Korea, discarded traditional free trade principles and turned America is back on core values of human rights, democracy and rule of law. In short, it was a side of America no one had ever seen, certainly not in the history of the modern presidency. Most profoundly, it raised the question: Who is America?Joe Biden must try to answer that question, and not just with the eloquent prose of President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president. The world expects and will demand to see concrete action, preferably guided by some overarching policy that can show to the world that the USs can still play — and indeed, must play — a leadership role again on the global stage. There are some decisions that Joe Biden has indicated he will make right out of the starting block when he takes office on January 20. He will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization. Those are relatively easy and straightforward but also very necessary. He is also likely to make clear in his inauguration address that America will return to be the leading voice for democracy, human rights and rule of law in the world, starting first at home but also unafraid to speak in their defense abroad. Then begins the hard part. One priority he has made clear that his administration will take on immediately is reaffirming American membership in and commitment to its alliances and critical partnerships. These constitute America is competitive advantage in global affairs and remain the heart of its still formidable soft power in the world. After Trump is destructive practices, Biden will have to appeal to America is allies in Europe, e.g., NATO and the EU, and in Asia and the Pacific, like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others. And he will have to do it with humility, understanding that under his predecessor, America seemingly abandoned principles that had previously united them all. China will be Joe Biden is biggest challenge. On trade, defense, the South China Sea, Taiwan, cybersecurity, human rights and global leadership, China presents a daunting challenge. We should expect his administration to drive a hard bargain with Beijing but to use a very different approach than his predecessor. Pursued smartly, however, he may be surprised by the inherent advantages America still holds. For example, fortifying the alliances and partnerships as previously mentioned will aid his administration in addressing the China challenge. In fact, if he is to succeed on this account, he will need those allies and partners with him at the negotiating table. Another advantage: He will likely have bipartisan support in an otherwise partisan Congress for taking a strong position on China. Trade is the clearest area where the US can capitalize on its extensive network of allies. China is most important trading relationships — those with the EU and the East Asian nations — also happen to be America is closest allies. The most effective approach will be one that joins their efforts with the administration to address China is aggressive and predatory trade practices. Those range from intellectual property theft to intimidation and threats against foreign businesses to coopting confidential and proprietary techniques, practices and technology. But this approach works only if the new administration can establish that it can be trusted again, and not only on trade. If the US can succeed in its trade negotiations with China, it opens opportunities on other fronts. The objective must be clear: The US is not interested in standing in China is way as it progresses to superpower status. However, China must understand that it must do so within an international community governed by collaboratively set rules. Climate and global health are two other priority issues for Biden. He has indicated he will want not only to reestablish America is commitment to them but also to take the lead. Rejoining the Paris accords will not be enough. The US must marshal a critical mass of other nations in joining a reinvigorated effort to go beyond the mandates of Paris. In that, he is likely to garner support from the EU and other developed nations. Appointing former Secretary of State John Kerry as his special envoy on climate change demonstrates Biden is seriousness about the issue and the intention to take a much-needed lead role on this global existential challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic raging at home makes it imperative that President-elect Biden make global health security a clear foreign policy priority. If there is one thing Americans have learned from the novel coronavirus, it is that there is no greater threat to America is national security and economic prosperity than another pandemic, especially one perhaps more catastrophic than COVID-19. If America is to be better prepared for the next pandemic, so must be the rest of the world. As he did for climate, Biden may even wish to name a special envoy for global health to begin galvanizing America is efforts and those of the rest of the world to prepare and coordinate global initiatives for preventing, containing and treating the next pandemic. Climate and global health present the Biden administration with just the sort of challenge-cum-opportunity to which America was known to rise in the past. They are issues on which it is uniquely positioned to lead by virtue of its power, size, wealth and technological prowess. To reassume the mantle of global leadership, President-elect Biden must lead the global effort to combat climate change and strengthen the international community is capacity to address pandemics. Unlike for the US administrations dating back to Jimmy Carter, the Middle East will not be a to p-five priority in 2021. Americans have lost their appetite for inserting the mselves into problems that the region is residents cannot or will not work to resolve the mselves. Biden and his foreign policy team recognize this, even as they know they ca not turn their backs on this dangerously volatile region. But there remains one exception. Iran is a grave problem, perhaps less for the US than for Washington is allies in the Middle East, most especially Israel and Saudi Arabia. It also constitutes a major challenge to America is traditionally unflinching support for the Nonproliferation Treaty. Nothing could be more destabilizing in that region than the introduction of nuclear weapons. It will require almost immediate attention from President Biden. The Trump administration is policy of “maximum pressure” via its punishing sanctions has indeed inflicted enormous economic pain on Iran and its people. But it has not changed Tehran is behavior. Iran today has begun to reconstitute the nuclear program that had been effectively contained under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated under President Obama in 2015 and the n abandoned by Trump in 2018. The purpose of the sanctions cannot be inflicting pain on the Iranian people, who are not responsible for their government is policies. The objective of sanctions and an overall policy toward Iran must be to change its behavior. By that measurement, the Trump administration is pressure campaign has not worked. Iran continues to: develop and build longer-range missiles; support malign behavior through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Shia proxies throughout the region, from Iraq and Yemen to Syria and Lebanon; senselessly threaten Israel; and deny the most basic human rights to its own citizens, most especially women, journalists, perceived political opponents and religious minorities. Whatever trust President Obama and the n-Secretary of State Kerry may have been able to build with the Iranians in reaching the JCPOA has been largely destroyed now. So, short of immediately rejoining that agreement, which would be unwise, face-to-face negotiations between Washington and Tehran will not be in the offing for at least one year. In fact, to tackle the Iran question, Biden and Blinken must address the failures of the Obama approach. That will mean: (a) turning to America is P5+1 partners — the UK, France and Germany — to work out a modus operandi for rejoining the JCPOA while simultaneously securing a commitment to negotiate a stronger JCPOA version 2.0; (b) consulting regularly and frequently with key regional allies to ensure their concerns and interests are addressed in any follow-on agreement with Tehran; and, most important, (c) including key congressional members in the negotiation process, at least on the Washington end. The last is most vital because the absence of Congressional support was ultimately Barack Obama and the agreement is downfall. Any new accord negotiated must have the support of a majority of the Congress if it is to avoid the fate of the JCPOA, even it is not submitted for formal approval to the Congress. All of these are sine qua non for successfully addressing the Iranian challenge and securing a durable solution. While the Iran portfolio remains an urgent priority for Joe Biden, it will not be one resolved in his first year and perhaps not until well into his second. His administration and the Congress must understand that the US cannot not sanction, bomb, assassinate or otherwise forcibly compel Iran into complying with its norms for behavior. It will take patient, deliberate and determined diplomacy. These are likely to be President Biden is top priorities. But they will not be his only ones. His administration and the US also face serious challenges from a menacing and malign Russia, an arms control agreement with whom due to expire within weeks of his taking office; still extant terrorism and cy ber security threats; a wave of autocrats with a full head of steam, from Turkey and Hungary to Venezuela and the Philippines; ill-behaved and irrationally aggressive regional actors vying for preeminence in the Middle East; continuing conflict and humanitarian crises in the Middle East, Africa and the Caucasus and elsewhere. Joe Biden will be the most experienced and knowledgeable president on foreign policy since George HW Bush. As such, he surely knows that it is issues like these that can suddenly rise to crisis proportions and take over his foreign policy or even his presidency. So, they will not be far from his attention. But a clear-eyed view of what is most important will drive Biden toward those highlighted above. However, there is likely to be a critically important domestic component of the Biden foreign policy agenda. This gets to the Achilles heel of previous administrations’ foreign policies that Donald Trump cleverly exploited. Biden and his administration must be able to convincingly articulate to the American people a foreign policy that they will see as in their interests. That will mean a policy that protects American jobs, addresses threats to climate and the environment, ensures security and offers a promise of a better future. Crafting a policy that meets these criteria may be Joe Biden is biggest challenge, especially in view of the historic disconnect between foreign policy and the American people and polarization of the American public exacerbated by four years of Donald Trump. But if this administration is to be successful in confronting and capitalizing on America is many challenges abroad, it must be able to show that it holds the interests of Americans uppermost — and that they stand behind this policy.

311,Beirut is challenge: A wealth of volunteers and a deficit of trust,-3.67,47.0,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2020/0812/Beirut-s-challenge-A-wealth-of-volunteers-and-a-deficit-of-trust,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,25,"In the early morning hours in the eastern Beirut neighborhood of Gemmayze, hit hard by the mammoth explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital a week ago, hundreds of volunteers are already on the streets with food parcels and brooms flung over their shoulders. They are offering help where a widely despised government fears to tread. Perched near a large pile of rubble, an elderly woman watches the volunteers move in and out of buildings to inspect or clean them up; others open boxes and distribute donated food and water. A basic demand of government is that it provide relief in times of calamity. But as Lebanon gets about cleaning up and rebuilding Beirut, who can be counted on to coordinate efforts and efficiently distribute aid?“I ca not explain why I am still alive, here, talking to you,” Roula, her face etched with both grief and disbelief, says about the blast that shattered the windows and to re through the walls of her first-floor apartment. Another source of wonder? The absence of any official support from a ruling class that many Lebanese blame for corruption and negligence, leaving 2,750 to ns of volatile ammonium nitrate at the Beirut port in the heart of the city. That stock triggered one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, wrecking large swaths of the capital, killing at least 171 people, and injuring 6,000.“I cry when I think of all the work the Lebanese people are doing to help one another. Even strangers feel like family,” says Roula, who gave only her first name, holding back tears. “But the n I think of how the government let this happen. This was a massacre, and the blood is on their hands.”Even if government support was forthcoming, she says, “they are not welcome here.”While Lebanese protesters and analysts alike say the explosion has brought the crisis-ridden nation to a turning point, they are wondering how the hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that international donors have pledged can be safely funneled to those who need it most, keeping it out of what they consider the predatory claws of a largely corrupt ruling elite.“The question is: How do you distribute the money? How do you prioritize it?” asks Rami Khouri, a professor of journalism and the director of global engagement at the American University of Beirut.“Those decisions cannot be done by the government. You ca not ignore the government either, you ca not de-sovereignize the government,” he says. “But neither can you allow it to keep doing corrupt work, and not doing its work.”For maximum efficiency, he proposes a consortium that includes “clean” officials, relief agencies, and professionals to ensure the integrity of the cash flow between donors and the NGOs and the UN, which will implement the relief work.“A new mechanism has to be set up,” says Professor Khouri. “Donors have to be used as leverage to force the government to get out of the way.”International donors pledged $300 million at a conference Sunday convened by President Emmanuel Macron of France, Lebanon is former colonial power. They stipulated that the assistance should be “directly delivered to the Lebanese population, with utmost efficiency and transparency.”How that will be achieved is not yet clear, as street protests against a corrupt, incompetent, and sectarian ruling class – which first erupted nationwide last October – have reignited in recent days with renewed venom. Demonstrators have rigged up gallows, calling for vengeance in slogans such as, “Hang the authorities first.”Monday night, the government resigned en masse– the second cabinet to be toppled by popular anger in nine months – further complicating any chain of command for relief distribution.“I discovered that the system of corruption was bigger than the state and that the state is bound by this system, and that it is not possible to confront it or get rid of it,” said Prime Minister Hassan Diab, who blamed entrenched interests when announcing his resignation. Analysts and protesters point to the sectarian distribution of power – and the same top players for decades – as the source of much of Lebanon is corruption. Even as protesters have implored donors not to channel funds through the hands of state institutions that they deem untrustworthy, the scale of the damage – estimated at as much as $15 billion – will require a coordinated repair effort. For a relatively small grassroots relief organization like Shaabemasouleyati (My people, my responsibility), which got its start last December assisting families in need during an economic crisis, the pivot to post-explosion support has been natural but daunting. The group is one of the many civil society organizations that have mobilized thousands of Lebanese citizens to clear debris and restore a minimal degree of normalcy. It has done everything from sending nurses and paramedics to check up on elderly residents or tend to the injured in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood, to deploying its engineers to conduct preliminary assessments of damaged buildings. Their reports are being logged in a database of damaged houses and streets so as to speed the process of repairs.“The government has not taken responsibility for the explosion, nor for what happened after the explosion,” says founder and director Afif Ayad. Help came “purely because the people were there from every corner of the country,” he says. Donor funds, he insists, should be sent with “utmost transparency and with trusted NGOs actually giving the money to the people in need, [which] would be one big step in the right direction.”That view is echoed by Bujar Hoxha, the CARE country director for Lebanon, who notes that a “triple crisis” was already afflicting the Lebanese – economic collapse, political instability, and the coronavirus – even before the explosion.“It is critical that we agree on an approach and mechanism with other NGOs, in order to have massive funds flow without any doubts and concerns,” says Mr. Hoxha. Since the explosion a number of NGOs have sprung up, including several diaspora groups that have “created a coalition amongst the mselves,” raised millions of dollars, and made their own judgments about needs, says Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.“That is good, at that scale, but when we are talking about huge money like $300 million, you do need a coherent and cohesive needs assessment, that everyone uses ... and this is something the government needs to be involved with,” she says. International and local authorities have the experience of the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Ms. Yahya points out. That 34-day conflict destroyed much of southern Lebanon and Beirut is southern suburbs. Back the n, a multi-donor emergency fund was created, funneling funds through the UN, but “there was an excess of funds in de-mining, and far too little funding in [other] vital sectors,” Ms. His database of damage could “create and build transparency,” a precursor, he hopes, “that leads to the structure that can support millions in aid.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

Unlike other sites that have had to turn people away after kits ran out, the UNO location will not have a daily cap, which means it will stay open all day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The city is opening the site with support from US Department of Health and Human Services, which it petitioned for help after shortages in test materials forced officials to cut back.

Owners of such establishments received notice this week of the increased oversight, which started on Friday, accompanied by the threat of fines and citations over complaints from customers as well as bars and restaurants that are obeying the rules that some of their competitors are ignoring. Bars and restaurants were permitted as of June 10 to reopen their indoor service areas at 50% of their fire code capacities as long as they met other requirements such as mask-wearing and keeping tables 6 feet apart. Governor Tim Walz on Friday said he wanted to thank the majority that are sacrificing and complying, and he added that he owes it to them to confront bars and restaurants that are not.""If they choose not to follow the best health guidance [they] put all of the businesses at risk, they put all of our health at risk,"" Walz said. ""That is the whole idea. The wearing of the mask is about protecting others. It is about stopping the spread and reducing it.""The guidance comes at a nervy time in the pandemic for state health officials. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 862 lab-confirmed infections on Friday of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — bringing the state is overall total to 73,240 known infections — which represented an increase from the roughly 630 per day that had been reported on average for much of August. The state also reported four COVID-19 deaths on Friday — for a total of 1,810 in the pandemic — and that 301 people were hospitalized with the infectious disease. Hospital and case numbers had leveled off somewhat in August after increasing in July. The latest COVID-19 case growth appears somewhat tied to large group events and outbreaks in bars and restaurants where safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus are being disregarded, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director. The state has confirmed 46 infections involving motorcyclists at the Sturgis rally in South Dakota and has found evidence that they have spread the virus to others within Minnesota. One apparently spread the virus at a wedding, Ehresmann said. The state also has investigated 50 establishments in Minnesota for suspected patron transmission of the virus that resulted in a total of 1,286 infections. Thirty of those bars or restaurants have been publicly identified because at least seven people were likely infected in them.""When establishments and customers do not follow the guidance, we see outbreaks,"" Ehresmann said. Inspections will occur in establishments that have been the subject of complaints, but also in random bars and restaurants as well. Unannounced ""observation-only"" inspections were conducted earlier this summer by the Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement Division of the state Department of Public Safety and various law enforcement agencies. The inspections turned up 14 bars and restaurants that committed violations. Most of those violations included employees failing to wear masks (116), followed by failure in social distancing (63) and excess capacity (30). In the advisory to the hospitality industry this week, the state commissioners for Public Safety, Health, and Labor and Industry wrote that ""most establishments are following federal and state guidelines, but it makes it difficult for them to compete or to explain to their customers when other establishments are not in compliance.""Some Republican members of the state House of Representatives challenged the stepped-up enforcement on a business community that has suffered economic hardships in the pandemic.""Threats of fines and closure are a departure from previous statements by the Governor — who has stated that their goal is 'education' — not to be punitive to businesses who are already struggling as a result of the Walz shutdowns,"" read a statement issued Friday morning by the House Republican Caucus. House GOP members said they are hearing about businesses being subjected to unannounced visits, which have led to citations and fines. The House Republicans said they are drafting a written response to Walz and relevant commissioners to his announcement. State Representative Dave Baker, R-Willmar, a longtime restaurant owner until he sold his last place in January, said he is concerned that further enforcement pressure will doom many establishments.""I am really concerned that the executive branch is switching to the adversary vs the advocate role,"" the third-term legislator said. ""The tone right now is so alarming. Why would the government go after the industry that has been wounded so badly during this pandemic?""Baker said that with summer coming to a close and outdoor seating certain to slice into overall capacity, some establishments are not going to survive if they ca not go from 50% to 75% capacity indoors. Restaurant staff are ""doing the best they can"" when it comes to wearing masks and following other rules, he said. ""I know there are a few rogue people who are snubbing their nose to everything, but let is deal with them one on one. … to publicly shame restaurants online with minor violations is just not something we need to do.""Hospitality Minnesota, a trade group that represents many restaurants and hotels, said it fears its industry is being targeted without merit.""Previous Department of Public Safety announcements [indicated] that 98.5% of operators they visited were following guidance to keep guests and workers safe,"" Hospitality Minnesota CEO Liz Rammer said. ""Enforcement efforts must be carried out fairly and evenly, and across all types of businesses that serve the public. … We are concerned that this industry is being disproportionately and unfairly targeted, and we have expressed these concerns to the Health Department.""The state is letter to bars and restaurants said that teams of inspectors from the three state departments will fan out during the next several weekends and look for violations. They will be looking for compliance in areas such as employees and customers wearing masks, social distancing, limits on party size per table, proper employee health screenings and staying under capacity maximums. Violations could lead to fines, loss of liquor license or prompt an order to close. Inspection results will be shared with the bar and restaurant operators, the letter read.

316,Texas man who famously waited hours to vote in Democratic primary faces up to 40yrs in prison for illegal voting,-1.0,42.0,https://www.rt.com/usa/528946-famous-texas-voter-arrested/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-11,25,"A man hailed by mainstream media outlets for standing in line for six hours to cast his ballot in last year is Democratic primary has been arrested for voting illegally. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Hervis Rogers, 62, was a felon on parole at the time he voted in the November 2018 general election and the March 2020 Democratic primary, according to a two-count indictment by Texas prosecutors. His arrest set off a storm of criticism from the ACLU, anti-incarceration activists, and left-wing pundits, who claimed that it was unjust and racist, since Rogers is black. Having a Democratic voter who went viral for his determination turn out to be a felon voting illegally is rather controversial for a party that has fought against claims of illegalities surrounding the 2020 vote. Some have argued that the prosecution of Rogers is another attempt by Republicans to disenfranchise non-white voters.“This is a voter-suppression prosecution, pure and simple, a poster child for Jim Crow 2.0,”the Texas AFL-CIO union group said.“Unfortunately, it confirms that Texas’ shameful legacy of disenfranchisement is alive and well and desperately needs fixing.”""This is a voter suppression prosecution, pure and simple, a poster child for Jim Crow 2.0.

I was not going to let anything stop me, so I waited it out.”The local NPR affiliate said he voted for Joe Biden. Carla Reed and Hervis Rogers, the last two voters at Texas Southern University. Finally got their ""I voted"" stickers. They waited six hours, until just after 1am.#TXDecidespic.twitter.com/ngh5gl1nNyTop Democrats, such as SenatorChuck Schumer(New York) and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, also pounced on the incident to argue that the fact Rogers had to wait so long to vote was the result of GOP voter suppression. Unfortunately, it also turned out to be an example of alleged voter fraud. Rogers was convicted of felony burglary in 1989 and 1995. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in the latter case, the n was released in 2004 with his parole scheduled to run to June 2020. That means he was still on parole when he voted in 2018 and again in March 2020, according to the indictment. He was jailed last week, with bail set at $100,000. Voting while serving a felony sentence, including parole, is punishable in Texas by two to 20 years in prison, meaning Rogers could get a 40-year term if convicted and hit with the maximum penalty on each count with sentences running consecutively. The Bail Project, an activist group that campaigns against cash bail, posted bond for Rogers on Saturday, securing his release while awaiting trial. Bail Project founder Robin Steinberg accused Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton of using the indictment as a“targeted message of fear”to suppress the“turnout of people of color.”The group added that Rogers believed he was eligible to vote. The ACLU, which is aiding Rogers’ legal defense, said the prosecution shows that“even innocent mistakes in the voting process can be criminalized.”We are so relieved that Hervis Rogers is no longer in jail. He should not have been arrested and charged in the first place. We will keep fighting for him and for our right to vote.pic.twitter.com/1why8H0mnyNicole DeBorde, a legal analyst for CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, also represents Rogers. She said Rogers completed rehabilitation after“mistakes in his youth,”adding,“This case, for us, is about who we let the government decide to throw out like trash and who we deem worthy of the basic rights to participate in the processes we all hold dear.”Rogers was about 36 at the time of his last conviction. Social media users attacked the Texas AG for charging Hervis. For instance, poll analyst David Rothschild called Paxton a“shockingly bad person”who was“doing bad things to good people to score cheap political points in your voter-suppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.”Author Megan Kelley Hall said Paxton deserves to go to jail, adding, “You are scum. You are a monster and a poor excuse for man. I hope you go someplace much hotter than Texas.”You are a shockingly bad person, doing bad things to good people to score cheap political points in your voter suppression crusade to create permanent white rule in Texas.

This liberal NPR article even says so, but buries it: “Rogers voted before his parole was scheduled to end, he was likely ineligible to cast a ballot on Election Day.”I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!

You thought it was just your aunt is casserole but no, literally millions of to ns of untouched food splatters into landfills — a lot of it never even makes it to your plate. It is thrown out by the producers and stores because it has not sold or the meaningless expiration date has gone by or the fruits and veg gies are too ugly. We should all find it maddening that producers throw out to ns of fruits and veg gies while their fellow citizens go hungry. There is nothing wrong with a malformed grotesquely distorted potato.

How do we have human beings going hungry while we throw out nearly half the edible food and a select few individuals rake in Olympic swimming pools full of money? It is inarguably because our economic system (AKA “capitalism,” AKA “slippery Pete,” AKA “the underhanded hello”) is a dumps ter fire. Just like a select few sociopaths oversee this horrible system, it is also a select few corporations that benefit the most. The Institute For Policy Studies says, “Driving this exploding inequality are 12 companies whose profits are coming at the expense of workers and communities. …They include retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target, Dollar Tree, Dollar Store, gig economy companies like Instacart, and food producers like Tyson Foods.”Ok guys I am all for wacky marketing strategies but this is just kin da bizarre even by my standardspic.twitter.com/utDPhPsAzQ— josharoo22 (@jibberingjungus)May 24, 2019Unbelievable profits do not come out of nowhere.

It is a quick and cheap solution to help people chewed up by unfettered rapacious capitalism, a societal money laundering machine that spits out millions of humans after stealing their savings, their energy, and their youth. So, just like a good capitalist town, upon realizing what Seivwright was up to, the City of Torontoissued a warning letter to the carpenter to stop building shelters for unhoused people. (Well, if all those poor people get homes, the n how will the rest of us know we are better than them? I suppose we will still have our wrist watches, but you ca not tell the brand from very far away.)Point being, Khaleel Seivwright is a hero, as are so many unheralded activists across this land trying to help those to rn up by our system.

319,The global supply chain nightmare is about to get worse,-1.0,44.0,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/business/global-supply-chain-nightmare/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-12,24,"Computer chip shortages. Epicport congestion. And a serious lack of truck drivers. The world is delicate supply chains are under extreme stress. The supply chain nightmare is jacking up prices for consumers and slowing the global economic recovery. Unfortunately, Moody is Analytics warns supply chain disruptions “will get worse before they get better.”“As the global economic recovery continues to gather steam, what is increasingly apparent is how it will be stymied by supply-chain disruptions that are now showing up at every corner,” Moody is wrote in a Monday report. IMF slashes US growth forecast and warns of rising risks to the global economyIndeed, the IMF downgraded its 2021 US growth forecast on Tuesday by one percentage point, the most for any G7 economy. The IMF cited supply chain disruptions and weakening consumption — which itself has been partially driven by supply chain bottlenecks such as a lack of new cars amid the computer chip shortage.“Border controls and mobility restrictions, unavailability of a global vaccine pass, and pent-up demand from being stuck at home have combined for a perfect storm where global production will be hampered because deliveries are not made in time, costs and prices will rise and GDP growth worldwide will not be as robust as a result,” Moody is wrote in the report. Moody is said the “weakest link” may be the shortage of truck drivers — an issue that has contributed to congestion at ports and caused gas stations in the United Kingdom to run dry. Unfortunately, Moody is warned there are “dark clouds ahead” because several factors make overcoming the supply constraints particularly challenging. First, the firm pointed to differences in how countries are fighting Covid, with China aiming for zero cases while the USs is “more willing to live with Covid-19 as an endemic disease.”“This presents a serious challenge to harmonizing the rules and regulations by which transport workers move in and out of ports and hubs around the world,” the analysts wrote. Grocery store shelves are not going back to normal this yearSecondly, Moody is cited the lack of a “concerted global effort to ensure the smooth operation” of the worldwide logistics and transportation network. Others are much more optimistic on the supply chain outlook. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that these supply chain hiccups will fade quickly.“This will not be an issue next year at all,” Dimon said during a conference held by the Institute of International Finance, CNBC reported. “This is the worst part of it. I think great market systems will adjust for it like companies have.”",2,1,CNN
320,"Dr. Lance Dodes warns we are not rid of Trump yet: He ""will continue to have no conscience""",-20.0,33.67,https://www.salon.com/2021/01/14/dr-lance-dodes-warns-we-arent-rid-of-trump-yet-he-will-continue-to-have-no-conscience/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,25,"Last Wednesday, thousands of Donald Trump is white supremacist supporters, at his de facto command,launched an assault on the US Capitolwith the goal of stopping Joe Biden from becoming the next president. While investigations are ongoing, some people in the mob may have planned to kidnap or assassinate members of Congress they consider ""traitors,""along with Vice President Mike Pence, who presided over the ceremonial count of the electoral votes. Trump is fascist mob was well equipped for the task, as some of their members were armed with guns and other weapons, and clad in paramilitary gear. Five people have now died during and after the Capitol attack. Dozens more were injured. This Trump-inspired uprising is likely not over and may be in its early stages. There are credible reports by the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies that right-wing para militaries and other domestic terrorists are planning even more violence across the country in the days leading to Biden is inauguration next week. This attack was not an isolated event: The entire Age of Trump has been typified by right-wing violence. When Trump finally leaves office, the right-wing violence he has enabled and permitted may only get worse. On Wednesday, by a vote of 232 to 197,Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for a second time, on this occasion for ""incitement of insurrection."" All 222 Democrats (along with 10 Republicans) voted to impeach, while four Republicans abstained. Trump is now the only president to have been impeached twice, and clearly rivals only Andrew Johnson or James Buchanan for the shameful distinction of being the worst president in American history. Instead of being cowed by the violence at the US Capitol and his second impeachment, Trump, like other autocrats and fascists, appears even more desperate and emboldened. On Tuesday, during a visit to his ""border wall"" in Texas, Donald Trump warned the Democrats and the American people that there will be consequences — implying more violence by his followers — for his impeachment or removal. Trump the n claimed the Democrats were causing the country ""tremendous anger, and division and pain,"" another example of stochastic terrorism aimed at inciting violence by his political cult members against their shared ""enemies"". Under pressure from Republican leaders and his remaining White House advisers, DonaldTrump released a video on Wednesday evening in which he ""condemned"" political violence and claimed that his ""true supporters"" would never engage in such behavior. This is patently insincere: From the beginning of his 2016 campaign, Trump has encouraged political violence by his followers and other cult members. Moreover,during the assault on the CapitolTrump was reportedly gleeful and excited. Ultimately, the disaster that is Trump is presidency did not need to happen. It was all a choice. Those Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 (and in even larger numbers in 2020) are responsible. The Republican Party, which embraced Donald Trump and his vile anti-democracy movement, is responsible. A news media which normalized Trump is fascist and authoritarian white supremacist regime are responsible. Those who denied the obvious warnings about Trump is coup attempt — and who mocked or tried to silence the people who were trying to warn the public — are responsible. Writing at the Atlantic,Tom Nichols locates the disaster of Trump is presidency and America is national peri las a moment comparable to the Cuban missile crisis or the darkest moments of Nixon is presidency:We ca not keep hoping for the best or relying on those not in charge to keep Trump in line. Even one day more is too long for him to be in the White House. We escaped disaster over just a few days in 1962 and in the dark of an autumn night in 1973. Peace was kept, in part, by the presence of steady professionals such as Schlesinger and the Kennedy team, the likes of whom are nowhere to be found in Trump is Washington. We no longer have a margin for error. A second impeachment is the only reliable solution, and it should take place immediately. The disaster that Nichols describes could have also been prevented if warnings from many leading mental health professionals had been listened to and the n acted upon. Since at least 2015, they have sounded the alarm and tried to educate the public about Donald Trump is pathologies, his malignant narcissism and his psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies. Dr. Lance Dodes is one such voice. He is a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a training and supervising analyst emeritus at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. In our most recent of several conversations, Dodes explains that Trump is coup attempt and other dangerous behavior are a function of the president is obvious mental pathologies, and observes that this disaster was totally and utterly predictable. Dodes warns that Trump believes that he is a godlike figure — and that when that delusion is shattered, Trump will become even more dangerous. At the end of this conversation Dr. Dodes implores the country is leaders to remove Donald Trump as rapidly as possible, noting that if this man were a private citizen he would already be in prison or a secure mental health facilityThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length. I completely agree. Most professionals in mental health have long understood that far from being a buffoon, or the naïve idea that he is ""crazy like a fox,"" he is severely mentally disturbed. Unfortunately, starting in 2016 the official psychological organizations in this country failed to speak out. The American Psychiatric Association actually threatened to throw out those of its members who understood the problem and had the courage to speak up, falsely claiming that speaking out would be unethical. Ironically, this meant that they threatened the most ethical and courageous members of the profession. If they had done their ethical duty to society it would have given the country a chance to save itself from the deaths and suffering of the past four years. Poorly, because many of them saw Trump is just a buffoon, or believed the psychologically ignorant idea that he is just being clever. As a result they did not recognize they were dealing with a dangerous and delusional psychopath whose endless lies needed to be openly and vigorously challenged. Many in the media covered his every tweet as if it was true. He was yelling at White House journalists saying, ""You are fake"" from the beginning of his term and it was years before they objected. The reporters should have said, ""No, Mr. Trump, you cannot talk to the free press that way."" They should have covered his assault on the free press as a major story. The media failed to do their job to protect the country. At this very moment he would be in jail for having incited a riot. But the multiple other crimes he is committed over many years would have put him in jail years ago. If he were in any other position his complete incompetence dealing with the pandemic would have led him to be removed from any responsible position regarding the health or welfare of Americans. That is the most valuable part of making a diagnosis. When Trump was first elected, many hopeful people said, ""He is been horrible, but he will grow into the job."" The impossibility of that was easy to predict because of his diagnosis. If a few people in my field had not incompetently denied his condition, and if the American Psychiatric Association had not tried to gag its members, the public could have been made clearly aware of his diagnosis and been in position to far better understand and deal with him and his behavior. This man is fundamentally different from virtually all the people that you have ever known. The pain and suffering of others mean nothing to him. It is hard to get that across because we all say, ""He must be like us,"" which is a normal expectation. He is nothing like us. We do not know exactly what is going to happen, but we know that he is going to continue to act on his delusional beliefs and he will continue to have no conscience about what he does to cause suffering to others. Four years ago, we said he was going to get worse. And we are still saying he can only get worse. The closer and closer he gets to being what he would consider a loser, the more dangerous he becomes. It was horrifying and terrifying to see the insurrectionists get into the Capitol building, partly because it was obvious that there was some plot going on; this was not just a mob on its own. There was a clear risk of a coup successfully led by Donald Trump. A few years ago, I said on MSNBC that among the risks Trump posed were that he would start a nuclear war, but that there were also other risks: that he would try to create an emergency, declare martial law and dissolve Congress. It is never been a secret that Trump wants to be like Putin or Hitler or Stalin or his friend in North Korea. He wants to be a supreme tyrant, and in his mind that is what he is. Anyone who threatens that delusion is his mortal enemy. If he could have taken over via a coup, he would have. Trump is a very simple person. He says outwardly, ""I am being persecuted"" and he says the same thing to himself. His beliefs are not affected by reality. It would be a sign of greater mental health if Trump were able to become depressed with a loss, because it would mean he has accepted the loss. But as we have repeatedly seen, he cannot tolerate that reality. When he loses power, rather than becoming depressed, he becomes more delusional. He attributes the problem to persecution by his enemies and mercilessly attacks them. That is what the coup attempt was. I am proud that the American Psychoanalytic Association became the first and so far only major national psychological organization to say that Trump must go. I wish the statement had come out four years ago, but I am glad they are the first to break away from the self-imposed paralysis of the major psychological organizations. And I hope the country will listen. In an ideal world Trump would be voted out today via the 25th Amendment. If he were not president, he would have already been in jail or contained in some safe facility.",1,1,Salon
321,"Reopen our schools, start COVID testing now",-0.33,30.67,https://capitolweekly.net/reopen-our-schools-start-covid-testing-now/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,15,"We have spent the past 10 months talking about how to reopen schools. Now is the time to take action. There are less than four months left in the current school year and we should not let the final bell ring before getting kids back into their classrooms. Of course, we cannot and should not sacrifice school, teacher or student safety in doing so. And we do not have to because we have all the necessary tools to reopen campuses sooner rather than later. Testing, along with safety and hygiene protocols, is the key to unlocking our schools. California has received nearly 12 million of these tests, which perform nearly on par with “gold standard” PCR tests and provide results in 15 minutes rather than the several-day PCR turnaround times. While vaccinating the vast majority of our population will take many months, consistent, rapid, testing programs can help schools immediately identify and isolate outbreaks to safely bring students back to campus. Early on, the high price and long turnaround times for COVID-19 testing made weekly or twice weekly testing impractical. But the testing landscape has evolved, giving us more options that are cheaper, faster, and — when performed and interpreted correctly — just as accurate and reliable as lab-based tests. The federal government pre-purchased 150 million rapid testing cards, with schools as a primary target for their use. To date, California has received nearly 12 million of these tests, which perform nearly on par with “gold standard” PCR tests and provide results in 15 minutes rather than the several-day PCR turnaround times. Using these cards, schools could run a regular testing program for a few dollars per test – a significant reduction from the $100 PCR tests. Of course, a testing program does not work without a plan for a streamlined, organized and automated operation that can be launched in days, not weeks. Luckily, we can learn from successful testing programs run by a growing number of schools across the nation and in the state. With so few weeks left in the school year, running such programs is affordable and attainable. The impact of distance learning is felt on the entire family unit. Parents and care givers are falling behind at work. The Newsom administration has made considerable headway in eliminating red tape and barriers for on-campus testing, which could allow districts across the state to initiate frequent testing programs to keep the school population and families safe. There is little dispute that the status quo is failing our students. Many students are falling behind and home-based learning has only deepened the divide for students in our under served communities. For students in low-income and Internet-deprived households, the achievement gap is growing. This is unacceptable. The impact of distance learning is felt on the entire family unit. Parents and care givers are falling behind at work. Others cannot apply for jobs when they spend all day troubleshooting connectivity issues, teaching fractions, and tending to the emotional needs of children who have been isolated for the past 10 months. With affordable, reliable testing options available and waiting for use, we need to take action now to implement full-scale, regular testing, with the proper safety precautions.

322,Utah lawmakers continue to debate governor is emergency powers as coronavirus wears on,6.0,48.0,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/10/20/utah-lawmakers-continue/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,25,"As they continue to face pressure from constituents who want them to end the COVID-19 state of emergency, Utah is lawmakers met again Tuesday to discuss ways to rein in the executive branch is powers but indicated the re is still a lack of consensus on how to move forward. Senator Jake Anderegg, R-Lehi, said he and other lawmakers are working to find compromise on the issue among the House and Senate as well as the governor is office and state and local health departments. But without language drafted, he said any changes to the state is Emergency Management Actlikely will not come until next year is general legislative session.“It may not happen as fast as some people would like, but the sky is not falling; we are not all going to be dead tomorrow,” Anderegg said Tuesday during a presentation to the House Economic Development and Workforce Services interim committee. “At least we hope. If we are, we have got bigger problems, right?”Several lawmakers have argued over the past few months that the emergency powers granted to the executive branch contemplated 30- to 90-day emergencies— like fires and floods and earthquakes — rather than months long ones like a pandemic. Anderegg said the re is a desire to preserve the governor is powers in cases where the executive branch needs to move quickly to respond to a crisis. But he said the state is Emergency Powers Act is “wholly inadequate” in outlining how the state should respond to longer-term challenges.“There is nothing in the code, zero. There is absolutely nothing that has anything to do with what a proper response would be policy-wise for a long, sustained emergency, so I do think we need to address this,” he said. Senator Dan McCay, R-Riverton, used the extended analogy of a house fire during his remarks to the committee to highlight when he thinks government should be involved in a crisis and when it should step back. He said that when a blaze first begins, “everyone is on the same page” about the emergency, from the homeowner to the firefighters to the neighbors and the insurance company that handles the claim.“Now the emergency itself is — I would argue and I think the policy should capture this — is when everyone is on the same page,” he said. “Because at that point, the government is the actor. The government in that situation is in the primary responsibility to do something outside the norm, make an exception.”Once the embers die down and the fire has been extinguished, though, he argued that existing code and processes would be sufficient to manage the crisis moving forward.“Can you imagine a situation where the firemen felt like they had to stay on the site until the house was completely rebuilt? That is ludicrous,” he said. “Or the police? To stand there at the house to make sure no one is injured at the house? I get it. It would be the safest thing to do. But that is ridiculous.”In connecting his analogy to the coronavirus pandemic, McCay noted that the state is code already gives the Health Department the power to manage an ongoing public health crisis, including the ability to shut down government buildings and schools, without the need for executive action. The months long debate over emergency powers also includes questions about the proper role of government, as lawmakers say the Legislature should be the one making policy for the state rather than the governor or the health departments through emergency orders. Not all power should rest with “some bureaucrat in a local or state health department,” Anderegg said. “I think for a prolonged, sustained, longer than 30-day public health crisis response management, we need to have some checks and balances in place to make sure things do not go completely off the rails.”Anderegg indicated, however, that he is looking at including some provisions in the bill that would deal with the use of emergency powers in case of COVID-19 case spikes. During a separate committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, lawmakers questioned health department officials about their authority and accountability to the public. During a line of extended questioning, health department leaders acknowledged their broad powers to close schools and restaurants, issue civil penalties for repeat offenders who do not follow their public health orders and even potentially to mandate a vaccine to control the spread of a disease. Utah Department of Health Director Richard Saunders said the question of “the boundary of control” for health departments is “a very important question we all need to be asking right now.”He and other health department officials who spoke at the Government Operations Interim Committee said they have worked in conjunction with elected officials to issue orders and noted that they have not heard of any civil penalties or fines associated with coronavirus rules issued by health departments. But Representative Brady Brammer, who was pressing health department officials for answers to the scope of their authority, said he was concerned their reach had violated the state is nondelegation doctrine, “where we have a constitutional provision that we cannot delegate the authority of the Legislature without clarity.”“I think we are both on the same page that we really need to be careful on figuring out where those lines are,"" Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, said to Saunders. During public comment at the meeting on Tuesday, several Utahns echoed those concerns and said they felt health departments have broad power to affect people is lives but little accountability to voters. Brittney Moon, a Santaquin resident, said she feels it is difficult to access public health officials.“I talked to my government officials that you have said have some sway in this but they ca not void or overturn these decisions and the n I said, ‘OK well, can we fire these people?’ And they said, ‘Yes, but here is the deal, the re is a board of nine people,’"" she said. ""So now I have to try to go through nine people to have any effect on this health director. So it is like they are two times removed.”Utah has been in a state of emergency since the day the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in the state in March. The Legislature in Juneapproved a resolution extending the state of emergency, though not all lawmakers were in support of the measure. By August, support for extending the emergency order had declined further and lawmakers declined to do so, leaving it to the governor to reissue his emergency mandates, which he did. Today, Utah is under a “public health order” mandated by the Utah Department of Health and the governor as part of the state is new strategy for addressing the pandemic. That order is slightly different from a state of emergency in that it does not need to be extended by the Legislature but it fulfills a similar legal purpose as the previous mandates. While some have raised concerns that ending the state of emergency would lead Utah to lose out on millions in federal dollars available to help states weather the coronavirus, Anderegg said that is not the case.“We contacted our legislative research and general counsel and they contacted FEMA, they contacted social services to find out if those monies would be in jeopardy and the answer was an unequivocal 'no’ it would not be in jeopardy,” he said. Opponents of the governor is emergency declarations had an opportunity during a special session in April to pass legislation curbing his power. ButHB3009, which would have limited the ability of local governments to implement lock downs and other restrictions due to the coronavirus, was pulled from consideration after several right-wing Facebook groups argued it gave too much power to local governments. Anderegg expressed frustration about that bill on Tuesday, saying that “the same people who eviscerated me personally on HB3009 are the same people who are up in arms that the Legislature has not stood up to the big, mean governor.”“Be consistent,” he said. “Otherwise, you are going to become white noise as far as I am concerned. So if that pisses you off, I am sorry. That is how I feel. Be consistent. If you want to work with us, get into the system and work with us.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.sarah(Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Soon after President Trump was inaugurated, FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silverlaid out 14 possible paths his presidency might take — ranging from him shifting to the middle and emerging as a fairly popular unifier to him resigning in disgrace or being impeached. And while going through all 14 paths at this point is a little overwhelming, it is still a useful way to think about the trajectory Trump finds himself on now. For instance, the re is a real question of whether the economy will have sufficiently recovered from a recession (Scenario 9) by November. But by the same token, it seems pretty unlikely that Trump cedes control to anyone in his administration in any meaningful way (Scenario 5). If anything, the fact that former National Security AdvisorJohn Boltonis the latest former administration official to speak out against him underscores just how comfortable Trump is with not listening to anyone. So maybe the answer is Trump is verging on some hybrid version of Scenarios 1 and 6, where he defies conventional norms and jeopardizes democratic values (firing Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in charge of investigating major crimes in the influential Southern District of New York, is just the latest example). But will it be in a way where he still manages to appeal to enough of the electorate to win reelection? Hisapproval rating and recent polls would suggest this may not be a winning tactic, but with his recent rally in Tulsa, we are definitely in full-swing reelection phase. So what path is Trump on now?nrakich(Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): So I think we should start with the caveat that, clearly, Trump is not on any one specific path. The last three and a half years have just been too unpredictable. But I think there are elements of several of Nate is paths that have come true. For example, “1. Trump keeps on Trumpin’ and the country remains evenly divided” seems pretty accurate, but Nate is supposition that that path would “sort of work” and would “make for a very competitive 2018 and 2020” does not seem to be coming true.sarah:That feels like … a cop-out.nrakich:LOL, Sarah, have you met me?julia_azari(Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): I am here to out-cop-out Nathaniel and point out two important variables in the 14 scenarios: Trump himself, and the rest of the political environment. And I do not think they play an equal role in each scenario. So I would actually adjust Nate is original framework to think about how the Trump administration has shaped up and also what is happened in the rest of politics. That being said, I think we should still consider the “things fall apart” genre and why what is happening now looks a bit different, as well as Nate is original Scenario 8 — “Trump is consumed by scandal.”nrakich:Exactly, Julia. Trump has faced a lot of scandals. He has presided over a pandemic and civil unrest. He has routinely violated democratic norms and values. He was impeached. ButTrump is popularity has not cratered in response (although it is dipping). Nate is scenarios kind of assumed that if bad things happened under Trump is watch, he would become extremely unpopular. But that has not happened in these polarized times. (He is onlyprettyunpopular.)sarah:I agree. Scenario 8 in Nate is original article implied scandal would sink Trump, but it really has not. That said, as you are saying, Nathaniel, it does not mean Trump is approval rating is indestructible — even if it is weirdly steady. This passage from Geoffrey Skelley is piece onTrump is latest dip in his approval rating has really stuck with me. The downward movement in his approval rating belies the notion that nothing matters when it comes to public opinion of this president — his actions and events can, in fact, affect his standing. And for that reason, his reelection chances could now be in real danger.julia_azari:Right, so things have kin da fallen apart: We have a recession. We have a pandemic. A few weeks ago we had national protests with curfews and Trump making some very authoritarian statements. And at one point, I think Trump might have entertained going fully authoritarian — which was a path in Nate is original scenarios — but the rest of the political system pushed back. I do not mean to suggest that anyone is here to save norms, but one thing we have seen in the Trump presidency is that systems are resistant to change, and a lot of people have incentives to push back against changes. The political system has worked largely as expected, too. For instance, party loyalty kicked in as we expected during the impeachment process.perry(Perry Bacon Jr., senior writer): That is key here — congressional Republicans and the party overall have been so loyal to Trump. Trump has had scandals and mistakes that I think rival or perhaps even top George W Bush is. His handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Everythingwith Ukraine. But my perception is that prominent Republicans have been less willing to criticize Trump than they were with Bush. Party loyalty under Trump has been extremely strong. He is fairly unpopular overall, but very popular within the Republican Party. For instance, Trump is way down in the polls right now, yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ist aking the same stance as Trump on Confederate monuments—that too many of them are being taken down. This is not a great position for a party trying to win elections.julia_azari:Right, the party environment has changed.nrakich:(Yeah, as a side note, I was thinking about this chat we did in December 2019about the most consequential episodes in Trump is presidency. That was only six months ago, and yet it feels like the list we settled on is totally defunct.)sarah:Something I think we are all dancing around now is that Trump has fewer paths to choose from, right? Initially, Nate had outlined 14 potential paths, but Trump is options feel far more limited now.julia_azari:Yeah. I mean, the path where Trump pivots is not happening — which was evident very early on.nrakich:The Trump-controlled part of his path seems to be more or less decided at this point. The thing that is left is the political-environment-controlled part. And, of course, whether he wins reelection, which will be a part of how we assess whether Trump is path “worked.”Although I would quibble with even that characterization. If something does not work for 3.5 years but the n we have a fast economic recovery or something and he hits 47 percent approval just in time to win reelection … did his path really “work”?julia_azari:So in one of the pivot scenarios, Nate wrote that maybe one conclusion from the 2016 election was that Trump is actually pretty good at politics. I think this deserves some unpacking — Trump is clearly good at building a base, but I think he is bad at legislative coalition-building, national politics, etc.perry:Trump has been brilliant in terms of consolidating power within the Republican Party. For example, he basically pushedSenator Jeff Flakeout of the Senate. He has interjected himself into gubernatorial primaries to get his favorites to win. He has forced people out of his administration who would not do his bidding. Being a Republican is about being loyal to Trump in a way that being a Democrat was not about being loyal to Obama from 2009 to 2017.julia_azari:Right. But the n when you take out the Republican Party, the results fall apart pretty quickly.perry:In a country this divided, I would argue being good at base politics is quite important. The media and other institutions in American politics, like the courts, are always trying to remain nonpartisan. So Trump is approach basically forces out intra-party critics. It means the media ca not easily say, “Even Republicans think Trump is doing something strange here.” That gives him more power. He has been great at accumulating power within the Republican Party.julia_azari:Right, but power to do what?Trump governs mostly by executive order, in part because Congress is divided and in part because even when it was not, no one could clarify an agenda and turn slogans into an actual governing coalition.nrakich:I agree that Trump may care most about being loved by a segment of the population and having Republicans depend on him for their political livelihood. But I think Trump is bad at politics. He is good at building a loyal personal following (this was always true, by the way — it was his MO as a reality TV star!), but that is not the same as governing effectively or winning elections.perry:And for three and a half years, he was close to maintaining power for eight years in America.julia_azari:So I think the sum total of what you are both saying is that Trump has mostly succeeded at his goals, and those goals were pretty tangentially related to governing.perry:Yes. Trump has been fairly effective at what Trump wanted to do, which is hold power.nrakich:I think we need to be more specific than just “power.” That word can mean a lot of things. But I get what you are saying.perry:What I am saying is pre-pandemic, Trump was at slightly below 50/50 odds of winning reelection. And that was not because he was good at governing — as defined as achieving policy goals — but because he commanded 100 percent loyalty with 50 percent of the electorate or so. So if Trump is only going to lose reelection because of the pandemic and the recession, the n that means he was not too bad at politics.nrakich:Perry,we have had this discussion before, but I think Trump was an underdog even before the pandemic.sarah:Yeah, I was going to ask… how much do we actually think the pandemic, the recession and now the protests have altered Trump is reelection odds? They definitely do not seem to have helped him at this point.nrakich:The events of the last month — which are probably impossible to disentangle — seem to have meaningfully hurt Trump is reelection odds. We do not have a model yet, but I can give it to you in terms of a polling average. On May 24, Biden led by 5.8 points in national polls. As of Tuesday,he led by 9.3points.perry:Trump is reelection odds, it seems to me, went from like 45 percent earlier this year to 20 percent. In April, The New York Times is Nate Cohn, who is a great elections analyst, wrote aboutTrump is strength in swing states. And the entire Democratic primary seemed to be, “Who can beat Trump,” which suggests to me not everyone perceived him as easy to defeat. So it really does seem to me that the pandemic and the resulting recession have rewritten his entire presidency. Trump was running on economic success, which he claimed credit for even if he had little do to do with it. And that was an argument that was kind of working. So in some ways, Trump is path was to do crazy things but focus on the economy and say, “Whatever I tweet, I get things done.”And that was a decent path until COVID-19.nrakich:I think the fact that electability was such a big deal during the primary reflects the perception — among Democrats, maybe you’d call it paranoia — that Trump would be a formidable opponent. But he basically spent all of 2019 down by around 6 points to Biden.(Now is the part where I insert the caveat that everything is still subject to change with more than four months until the election, regardless of whether Trump is down 9 or 6 points.)sarah:Huh, so maybe Trump is not that bad at politics. Maybe the external environmental factors have just become too much for Trump to course-correct in any real way?nrakich:I certainly agree with Perry that the pandemic and recession have rewritten Trump is presidency. But things have just gone from bad to worse for him. The economy used to be a plausible thing for him to campaign on, although it was really the only arrow in his quiver. Now he does not even have that.perry:Trump is not great at politics — he barely won in 2016. But he if loses in a landslide in 2020, that may be more about COVID-19 than his political skills.julia_azari:Right. I think it is worth noting that Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton would all be struggling politically right now. They probably would not have dismantled the unit in the National Security Councildedicated to pandemic preparedness and might have had a more coherent response, but presidents have limited control over events like the political environment, particularly when a recession is involved. That is an interesting question, Nathaniel. What could change between now and November?nrakich:Seems to me like quite a bit? The pandemic could be totally under control and the economy could be roaring back. Or we could be in the middle of a second wave and the unemployment rate could be in the 20s. Not to mention, all the possibilities that exist in a normal year: A bad debate. A scandal. God forbid, a terrorist attack.sarah:So how much does Trump is path matter moving forward? Do external factors matter more?nrakich:Yeah, Sarah, I think at this point external factors matter more. Trump has shown us who he is and how he is governing.perry:I think the most important thing is not any actual event, but rather how many Republican elites and voters decide to break with Trump. Will more of each say “this incident was the last straw” even if the incident was similar to something Trump did in 2017?I do not think Trump will do anything different, but I think people might react differently to his behavior, with four more years of his presidency looming.julia_azari:Yeah. I agree that this is a big variable, and not the focus of the original paths.perry:If it is clear the ship is going down, people will want to get off of it. Loyalty to the king does not matter if the king is going to be dethroned.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight
324,Biden Takes First Step Toward Restoring Reproductive Health Program Gutted by Trump,-12.0,39.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/01/biden-title-x-reproductive-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,25,"As executive director of theMissouri Family Health Council, which helps to provide low- and no-cost reproductive health care across the state, Michelle Trupiano is used to navigating a challenging political environment. “I am from Missouri, I work in Missouri, and Missouri is a conservative state where our providers, in general, are used to an onslaught of attacks on reproductive health,” she said. Even so, in 2018, when the Trump administration announced that it would be issuing new rules constraining the provision of family planning care via the Title X program, Trupiano could not help but be discouraged: The administration was messing with the nation is only program dedicated to providing contraceptives to low-income and uninsured people. And it was doing so in a way that required providers to lower their standards of care and was designed to push certain providers out of the program. “It was just one more thing in a long line of assaults,” she said. But the n last week, a glimmer of hope: On January 28, the Biden administration issued a memorandum on “protecting women is health at home and abroad,” a first step toward undoing Trump-era policies that have constricted access to reproductive health care.“I think everyone is hopeful that in the upcoming weeks everyone will be able to breathe a sigh of relief and just concentrate on what our providers do best,” Trupiano said, “which is providing the highest quality of care for patients.”Biden is action immediately lifts the “global gag rule,” also known as theMexico City Policy, which banned the US Agency for International Development from funding nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion services and counseling or engage in efforts to support abortion rights in other countries. The policy, first enacted by the Reagan administration, has been an on-again-off-again affair: It was revoked in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, reinstated by President George W Bush, and the n rescinded by President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump enacted it again and expanded its reach in ways that critics say hurt all manner of global health work, including the fight against HIV and AIDS. “These excessive conditions on foreign and development assistance undermine the USs’ efforts to advance gender equality globally by restricting our ability to support women is health and programs that prevent and respond to gender-based violence,” Biden is January 28 directive reads. But the work to repeal restrictions placed on Title X, commonly referred to as the domestic gag rule, will not be as immediate. Because the Title X changes were installed via the rule making process, it will take rule making to undo the m, an administration officialtoldPolitico — a process that will have to be deliberate in order to withstand potential legal challenges before a Trump-laden judiciary. Title X is the only pot of federal money dedicated to providing family planning and reproductive health services to low-income and uninsured individuals, the majority of whom are people of color. Since 1970, the program has provided access to contraceptives, reproductive health exams and counseling, cancer screenings, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. It has served roughly 4 million people per year, and the program rules have long allowed participation by all qualified providers. No Title X money funds abortion services; in fact, no federal funds support abortion except in exceedingly rare circumstances. Nonetheless, the Trump administration changed the rules for Title X in ways that weakened the program nationwide. Ostensibly, the changes were aimed at Planned Parenthood, the conservative right is favorite boogeyman. Before it exited the Title X program in 2019, Planned Parenthood was long the program is largest provider. Though the group accounted for just 13 percent of Title X clinics, it served 41 percent of all program clients. As with the Mexico City Policy, initial restrictions on Title X were enacted by President Ronald Reagan. They we retied up in litigation until the end of the George HW Bush presidency and ultimately rescinded under Clinton, whose rules for the program prevailed until Trump came along. Trump is gag rule has gone much further than the restrictions imposed by Reagan. Aimed at knocking Planned Parenthood out of the program, it bans grantees from referring patients to abortion providers and hobbles providers’ ability to counsel patients about abortion at all — even when continuing a pregnancy could pose serious health risks. The rule requires all pregnant patients to be referred to prenatal care regardless of the patient is wishes. And it requires physical and financial separation between clinics that provide Title X services and those that provide abortion care, a direct attack on Planned Parenthood: Roughly half of the group is health clinics are co-located with abortion service clinics. Moreover, the Trump administration to yed with the directive that Title X grantees provide every “effective and available method” of birth control and eliminated the requirement that contraceptive methods be “medically approved,” opening the door to the administration is desire to encourage wildly ineffective natural family planning and promote abstinence — anotherfavorite, yet failed, conservative policy. The rule has also undermined program confidentiality requirements by pressuring Title X grantees to compel their adolescent patients to share information about their sexual partners and include their parents in family planning care.(Notably, Trump is Title X restrictions are also the subject of ongoing litigation. TheNational Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, joined by the American Medical Association and others, has asked the US Supreme Court to resolve a circuit court split on whether the rules are valid.)“We always did hold out Title X as this thing you are not going to jack with. This is the standard … the highest quality of care at the highest standards and access for everyone,” Trupiano said. “So when those rules came out and started to deteriorate those standards, it has an impact — not just in Missouri, but across the country — and can erode trust among patients and providers.”Indeed, instead of singling out Planned Parenthood, the Trump rules inflicted severe damage on the entire Title X network. According to aGuttmacher Institute analysis, the rules slashed the network is capacity in half, jeopardizing care for 1.6 million female patients nationwide. (Title X serves everyone, so the number of patients who lost care is almost certainly higher.) Thirty states saw their network capacity drop by 25 percent or more; six states lost allo f their Title X providers. In Missouri, the network lost three Planned Parenthood clinics that served 14 percent of Title X patients. The Missouri Family Health Council receives roughly $5 million per year in Title X funds, which it currently administers to a network of 15 recipients operating 63 clinics across the state. In 2019, roughly 5,000 clients lost access because of the rule changes. That year, Missouri is Title X allotment served 37,616 clients — out of more than nearly 400,000 people in need of publicly funded family planning services. Nationwide, an estimated 21 million people are in need of Title X, yet funding for the program has remained relatively stagnant. In addition to revoking the Trump rules, Trupiano and others would like to see the Biden administration increase funding for the program. While Trupiano is disappointed that Biden has not taken more immediate action to dismantle Trump is domestic gag rule, she is hopeful that the Department of Health and Human Services will “act swiftly” and that change will come soon. “We were disappointed in the memorandum that there was not immediate relief,” she said, but “at the end of the day, we are hopeful we will no longer be burdened by the Trump administration is rules and that we can go back to providing the highest quality care for our patients.",1,1,The Intercept
325,Questions for Dr. Fauci,16.67,26.0,https://spectator.org/questions-for-dr-fauci/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-17,23,"As you may be aware, health-care providers across the country and around the world have reported great success in using Hydroxychloroquine + Zinc + Azithromycin (the “HCQ cocktail”) to treat COVID-19. According to these physicians and researchers, the key to success is to use the HCQ cocktail within the first seven days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Nevertheless, ever since President Trump endorsed Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), its use has become a highly politicized and controversial matter. The opposition to HCQ started with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At the same press conference that the president first expressed hope about using HCQ to treat COVID-19, Dr. Fauci challenged its effectiveness and stated that he would not take it outside the confines of a clinical trial. Since the n the opposition to HCQ has increased even to the point where it is almost impossible to find physicians willing to prescribe it and pharmacies willing to provide it. Three practicing physicians have published the following “Open letter to Dr. Anthony Fauci regarding the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19.” It is a devastating written cross-examination of Dr. Fauci that contains much valuable life-saving information and squarely addresses the needless deaths that have occurred due to the opposition to the HCQ cocktail. When the history of the COVID-19 pandemic is written, one of the key issues will be why the USs’ medical and government establishments joined forces to deprive the American people access to a safe, inexpensive, and highly effective outpatient treatment that could have saved tens of thousands lives and definitively obliterated the purported justification for the social and economic lock downs that have destroyed lives, livelihoods, and the economy. So, here is the article. Although it is lengthy, I urge you to read it carefully and share it with one and all. Lives, livelihoods, the economy and our very social fabric remain at risk. August 12, 2020Anthony Fauci, MDNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesWashington, DC Dear Dr. Fauci:You were placed into the most high-profile role regarding America is response to the coronavirus pandemic. Americans have relied on your medical expertise concerning the wearing of masks, resuming employment, returning to school, and of course medical treatment. You are largely unchallenged in terms of your medical opinions. You are the de facto “COVID-19 Czar.” This is unusual in the medical profession in which doctors’ opinions are challenged by other physicians in the form of exchanges between doctors at hospitals, medical conferences, as well as debate in medical journals. You render your opinions unchallenged, without formal public opposition from physicians who passionately disagree with you. It is incontestable that the public is best served when opinions and policy are based on the prevailing evidence and science, and able to withstand the scrutiny of medical professionals. As experience accrued in treating COVID-19 infections, physicians worldwide discovered that high-risk patients can be treated successfully as an outpatient, within the first five to seven days of the onset of symptoms, with a “cocktail” consisting of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin (or doxycycline). Multiple scholarly contributions to the literature detail the efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine-based combination treatment. Dr. Harvey Risch, the renowned Yale epidemiologist,an article in May 2020 in the titled “Early Outpatient Treatment of Symptomatic, High-Risk COVID-19 Patients that Should be Ramped-Up Immediately as Key to Pandemic Crisis.” He further published anarticleinNewsweekin July 2020 for the general public expressing the same conclusions and opinions. Dr. Risch is an expert at evaluating research data and study designs, publishing over 300 articles. Dr Risch is assessment is that there is unequivocal evidence for the early and safe use of the “HCQ cocktail.” If there are Q-T interval concerns, doxycycline can be substituted for azithromycin as it has activity against RNA viruses without any cardiac effects. Yet, you continue to reject the use of hydroxychloroquine, except in a hospital setting in the form of clinical trials, repeatedly emphasizing the lack of evidence supporting its use. Hydroxychloroquine, despite 65 years of use for malaria, and over 40 years for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, with a well-established safety profile, has been deemed by you and the FDA as unsafe for use in the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Your opinions have influenced the thinking of physicians and their patients, medical boards, state and federal agencies, pharmacists, hospitals, and just about everyone involved in medical decision making. Indeed, your opinions impacted the health of Americans, and many aspects of our day-to-day lives including employment and school. Those of us who prescribe hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin/doxycycline believe fervently that early outpatient use would save tens of thousands of lives and enable our country to dramatically alter the response to COVID-19. We advocate for an approach that will reduce fear and allow Americans to get their lives back. We hope that our questions compel you to reconsider your current approach to COVID-19 infection. QUESTIONS REGARDING EARLY OUTPATIENT TREATMENT:QUESTIONS REGARDING SAFETY:QUESTIONS REGARDING METHODOLOGY:COMPARISON BETWEEN US AND OTHER COUNTRIES REGARDING CASE FATALITY RATE:GIVING AMERICANS THE OPTION TO USE HCQ FOR COVID-19:FINAL QUESTIONS:While previous questions are related to hydroxychloroquine-based treatment, we have two questions addressing masks. CONCLUSION:Since the start of the pandemic, physicians have used hydroxy chloroquine to treat symptomatic COVID-19 infections, as well as for prophylaxis. Initial results were mixed as indications and doses were explored to maximize outcomes and minimize risks. What emerged was that hydroxy chloroquine appeared to work best when coupled with azithromycin. In fact, it was the president of the USs who recommended to you publicly at the beginning of the pandemic, in early March, that you should consider early treatment with hydroxy chloroquine and a “Z-Pack.” Additional studies showed that patients did not seem to benefit when COVID-19 infections were treated with hydroxy chloroquine late in the course of the illness, typically in a hospital setting, but treatment was consistently effective, even in high-risk patients, when hydroxy chloroquine was given in a “cocktail” with azithromycin and, critically, zinc in the first five to seven days after the onset of symptoms. The outcomes are, in fact, dramatic. As clearly presented in the McCullough article from Baylor, and described by Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, the efficacy of the HCQ cocktail is based on the pharmacology of the hydroxy chloroquine ionophore acting as the “gun” and zinc as the “bullet,” while azithromycin potentiates the anti-viral effect. Undeniably, the hydroxy chloroquine combination treatment is supported by science. Yet, you continue to ignore the “science” behind the disease. Viral replication occurs rapidly in the first five to seven days of symptoms and can be treated at that point with the HCQ cocktail. Rather, your actions have denied patients treatment in that early stage. Without such treatment, some patients, especially those at high risk with co-morbidities, deteriorate and require hospitalization for evolving cy to kine storm resulting in pneumonia, respiratory failure, and intubation with 50% mortality. Dismissal of the science results in bad medicine, and the outcome is over 160,000 dead Americans. Countries that have followed the science and treated the disease in the early stages have far better results, a fact that has been concealed from the American Public. Despite mounting evidence and impassioned pleas from hundreds of front line physicians, your position was and continues to be that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not shown there to be benefit. However, not a single randomized control trial has tested what is being recommended: use of the full cocktail (especially zinc), in high-risk patients, initiated within the first 5 to 7 days of the onset of symptoms. Using hydroxy chloroquine and azithromycin late in the disease process, with or without zinc, does not produce the same, unequivocally positive results. Dr. Thomas Frieden, in a 2017article regarding randomized clinical trials, emphasized there are situations in which it is entirely appropriate to use other forms of evidence to scientifically validate a treatment. Such is the case during a pandemic that moves like a brushfire jumping to different parts of the country. Insisting on randomized clinical trials in the midst of a pandemic is simply foolish. Dr. Harvey Risch, a world-renowned Yale epidemiologist, analyzed all the data regarding the use of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail and concluded that the evidence of its efficacy when used early in COVID-19 infection is unequivocal. Curiously, despite a 65+ years safety record, the FDA suddenly deemed hydroxy chloroquine a dangerous drug, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity. Dr. Risch analyzed data provided by the FDA and concluded that the risk of a significant cardiac event from hydroxy chloroquine is extremely low, especially when compared to the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with high-risk co-morbidities. How do you reconcile that for forty years rheumatoid arthritis and lupus patients have been treated over long periods, often for years, with hydroxy chloroquine and now there are suddenly concerns about a 5 to 7-day course of hydroxy chloroquine at similar or slightly increased doses? The FDA statement regarding hydroxy chloroquine and cardiac risk is patently false and alarmingly misleading to physicians, pharmacists, patients, and other health professionals. The benefits of the early use of hydroxy chloroquine to prevent hospitalization in high-risk patients with COVID-19 infection far outweigh the risks. Physicians are not able to obtain the medication for their patients, and in some cases are restricted by their state from prescribing hydroxychloroquine. The government is obstruction of the early treatment of symptomatic high-risk COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used extensively and safely for so long, is unprecedented. It is essential that you tell the truth to the American public regarding the safety and efficacy of the hydroxychloroquine/HCQ cocktail. The government must protect and facilitate the sacred and revered physician-patient relationship by permitting physicians to treat their patients. Governmental obfuscation and obstruction are as lethal as cy to kine storm. Americans must not continue to die unnecessarily. Adults must resume employment and our youth return to school. Locking down America while awaiting an imperfect vaccine has done far more damage to Americans than the coronavirus. We are confident that thousands of lives would be saved with early treatment of high-risk individuals with a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin. Americans must not live in fear. As Dr. Harvey Risch isarticle declares, “The key to defeating COVID-19 already exists. We need to start using it.”Very Respectfully,George C Fareed, MDBrawley, CaliforniaMichael M Jacobs, MD, MPHPensacola, FloridaDonald C Pompan, MDSalinas, California",0,0,The American Spectator

Gunnery Sgt. Mario A Madera-Rodriguezfaces charges of conspiracy, assault, obstruction of justice, burglary, false official statements, involuntary manslaughter and felony murder in the June 4, 2017, strangulation death of Army Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar in Bamako, Mali. Three fellow co-defendants, another Marine Raider and two Navy SEALs, have already pled guilty to their part in the death and have been sentenced. Madera-Rodriguez is the only one of the four to go to trial. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces a possible sentence of life without parole. Marine Capt. Jason Samuel, a prosecuting attorney, laid out a blow-by-blow time line of events the night and early morning hours before Melgar is death in his bedroom of the Army-Navy residence he shared with Navy SEALs and fellow soldiers on deployment to the African nation.“Their plan was to haze him that night, to humiliate him, but they killed him,” Samuel told the jury. Staff Sgt. Logan Melgar was found dead of strangulation on June 4, 2017, in housing he shared with three other special operations forces personnel in Bamako, Mali. (Army)The defense team is opening statements were held in a session closed to the public because their statements contained classified information, officials said. The four men involved in Melgar is death immediately tried to cover up the crime, Samuel said, repeatedly lying to officials. But Jennifer Brown, a female friend of Madera-Rodriguez who was with the men the night before Melgar died, later told investigators what they had planned. Navy SEAL Chief Special Warfare Officer Adam C Matthews came to Bamako, Mali, shortly before the events that led to Melgar is death. Soon after arriving, Matthews met with Chief SWO Tony E DeDolph and other members of the special operations team for a contingency planning support mission. But DeDolph told Matthews that he and others had problems with Melgar and wanted to put him in line by hazing him. In interviews, those who’d talked with Melgar revealed the staff sergeant was fed up with “juvenile behavior” by DeDolph and other special operators. He said he was anxious to finish his deployment and return home. Samuel told the jury that on the night of June 3, Melgar was driving to a party at the French Embassy in Bamako. DeDolph, Madera-Rodriguez and fellow Marine Raider Staff Sgt. Kevn Maxwell were following him in another vehicle, but they became separated. The trio thought that he’d deliberately ditched them and saw it as a sign of disrespect. They the n diverted to a local bar called the “Appaloosa.” While drinking, DeDolph came up with the idea to teach Melgar a “lesson” by hazing him, Samuel said. They contacted the two Malian guards at the Army-Navy house, telling them they needed to be ready to help pull a “joke” on Melgar. Over the next few hours, they hatched a detailed plan. Madera-Rodriguez would bust open Melgar is door with a sledgehammer. They’d all rush in on the sleeping Melgar, and Maxwell would pull back the mosquito netting around his bed. Then, DeDolph, a former professional in mixed martial arts, would pounce on Melgar and put him in a chokehold. Matthews would the n jump in, helping duct tape Melgar, the prosecutor said. They needed him restrained so that they could remove his clothing and bring in one of the Malian guards in his underwear with a belt around his neck like a leash. They the n planned to take compromising photos and videos of Melgar with the Malian man. Madera-Rodriguez’ other task was to put on music for the event.“He broke into that room and provided the soundtrack to Staff Sgt. Melgar is strangulation,” Samuel said. The group dubbed the event “Operation Tossed Salad,” a name for a sex act. The quartet and the Malian man, lined up outside Melgar is door and broke through with the sledgehammer, according to court testimony. Suddenly awakened, Melgar fought back, but DeDolph put him in the choke hold facedown on the bed as the others began to restrain and duct tape him, Samuel said. As they struggled, Melgar stopped breathing. The men stopped and began attempts to resuscitate him. They even tried a field expedient tracheotomy. But when that failed, they took him to a nearby medical clinic where he was later pronounced dead. Almost immediately, the two SEALs told the Marines they would deal with the incident and not mention the m, Samuel said. They made up a story that DeDolph had been practicing hand-to-hand combat drills with Melgar, who stopped breathing. They later said they thought Melgar had been drinking and that might have contributed to his death, according to prosecutors. But witnesses later told investigators that Melgar did not drink alcohol. A week after Melgar is death, Madera-Rodriguez and Maxwell accompanied Army investigators to the crime scene as security. Madera-Rodriguez even walked them through the fake story of a wrestling match gone wrong between DeDolph and Melgar. But investigators found duct tape under Melgar is bed with his blood on it. They also had talked with Brown, who had been at the Appaloosa bar with the men the night they talked about their plan. Cell phone records and text messages showed that Madera-Rodriguez and the others had gone from the Appaloosa bar to a restaurant, the n stopped at a Marine house to pick up duct tape and the sledgehammer at about 4 a.m. before heading to the Army-Navy house. The men broke into Melgar is room and committed the attack between 5:25 a.m. and 5:35 a.m., Samuel said. The timing matters because whether it happened at night or during the day may have bearing on some aspects of the burglary charge. Samuel told jurors an expert would testify, explaining why it was nighttime when this occurred. Subsequent interviews by military investigators uncovered what had happened, which resulted in the charges the men faced in their respective courts martial. The trial began Monday with jury selection, which lasted until late Thursday. An all-male jury of eight members, four enlisted and four commissioned officers, four Marines and four sailors were selected. Madera-Rodriguez chose to have a jury trial for his general court-martial. The members must have a rank equal to or greater than the defendant is. The highest ranking member is an O-5, Navy commander. The lowest ranking member is an E-8, Navy senior chief petty officer. In January, DeDolph pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, reduction to E-1, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge. Maxwell pleaded guilty in June 2019 to negligent homicide, conspiracy to commit assault, hazing, obstruction of justice and making false official statements. He received four years of confinement, reduction in rank to E-1 and a bad conduct discharge. In May 2019, Matthews pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and related charges. He was given one year of confinement, reduction to petty officer second class and a bad conduct discharge. All three are expected to testify as prosecution witnesses as part of their plea agreements in the trial of Madera-Rodriguez.

327,"A Top Biden Cybersecurity Aide Donated Over $500,000 to AIPAC as an NSA Official",-20.33,40.0,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/top-biden-cybersecurity-aide-donated-over-500000-to-aipac-while-an-nsa-official/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"Phillip Faraone/GettyIn mid-January, a week before being sworn in as president, Joe Bidenannouncedthat he would appoint Anne Neuberger as the deputy national security adviser for cy ber and emerging technology on the National Security Council. Cybersecurity experts praised the move, citing it as a clear sign the Biden White House would be serious about countering cyber-threats. ThedescribedNeuberger, who became the National Security Agency iscybersecurity chief in 2019, as a “rising official” at the agency. She had run its Russia Small Group, which launched a preemptive strike against the Kremlin is cy ber operatives during the 2018 elections, and in addition to focusing on preventing cyber-assaults on the US government and military, she had overseen the development of new impenetrable cryptography. But the glowing reviews left out an unusual piece of her story: In recent years, Neuberger, through a family foundation, has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC, for its efforts to influence the US government and public opinion. National security experts tellMother Jonesthat the hefty donations from Neuberger is foundation to AIPAC—a strong ally of an Israeli government that is deeply involved in cy ber and intelligence issues of importance to the US government and that has spied on the USs and been a target of US spying—raise concerns. (NBC Newsreportsthe same.)*Neuberger hails from one of the wealthiest families in the USs. Her father is billionaire investor George Karfunkel, who was in the news last summer for making a curious donation of Kodak stock—worth up to $180 million—to an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Brooklyn that seemed to barely exist. Karfunkel was listed in New York State records as the synagogue is president and chief financial officer, and the transfer of this stock—which would have yielded Karfunkel a tremendous tax deduction—occurred during a wild buying spree of Kodak stock triggered by a leaked announcement that the Trump administration might be handing Kodak an unprecedented $765 million loan. (That deal never came through.) Members of Congress have demanded answers about Karfunkel is highly unusual stock transfer. From 1993 to 2007, Anne Neubergerworkedat American Stock Transfer and Trust, a financial services firm cofounded by her father in 1971, eventually becoming a senior vice president of operations. Her husband, Yehuda Neuberger, was also a top official at the firm and a board member. Anne Neuberger the n switched from the private sector to the government. After serving as a White House fellow and working for the secretary of the Navy as an adviser on IT programs, she landed at the NSA in 2009 and helped develop its Cyber Command. Mediaprofilesof her in the years since have focused on the novelty of an Orthodox Jewish woman who grew up in a Hassidic neighborhood in Brooklyn (and whose grandparents on both sides were Holocaust survivors) becoming a leader at the NSA and have noted that her parents were on the 1976 Air France flight that was hijacked by the Palestinian Liberation Organization and diverted to Uganda, where the passengers were eventually rescued by Israeli commandos. Twelve years ago, Neuberger and her husband created the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation to “carry out the charitable and religious purposes of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore,” according to its tax records. Neuberger was vice-president of the foundation; her husband, the president. Neither received compensation from the outfit. In 2010, the foundation is first full year of operations, it received $1,183,050 in contributions and handed out $383,100. Of that, a quarter of a million went to the Women is Network for Single Parents in Brooklyn. (Neuberger is the founder ofSister to Sister, a group that assists divorced women within Orthodox Jewish communities.) The foundation made an $83,000 gift to the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore. Computer Sciences for the Blind in Brooklyn was awarded $25,000. And the foundation donated $25,000 to AIPAC for “operating support.”The following year, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation dished out $284,500 in gifts, according to its tax filings. The list included another $25,000 to AIPAC and also $3,500 to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish, pro-Israel think-tank in Washington. In subsequent years, the foundation upped its contributions to AIPAC From 2012 through 2018—the last year for which tax records for the foundation are available—the Neubergers provided $559,000 to AIPAC And this money, according to those filings, financed lobbying—either lobbying “to influence a legislative body” or “to influence public opinion.” The tax records do not provide any specifics about the AIPAC activity the foundation financed. (The contribution amounts listed for AIPAC on the Neuberger Foundation is IRS submissions line up exactly with the amounts the foundation declared as expenditures for lobbying. A nonprofit charitable foundation is allowed to pass money to a lobbying shop, as long as the amount donated is a moderate percentage of its overall giving.)There is a Neuberger family connection to AIPAC Yehuda Neubergerischairof AIPAC is Baltimore executive council. In 2011, Rabbi Steven Weil, the n executive vice president of the Orthodox Union,hailedhis “outstanding reputation as a leader of AIPAC.” Four years later, as part of a fierce AIPAC effort, Yehuda NeubergerlobbiedSenator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) to oppose the multilateral Iran nuclear deal the Obama White House had negotiated. (During the political fight over the Iran deal, the NSA,according to the,eavesdropped on Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed the accord, and “revealed to the White House how Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers had leaked details of the US-Iran negotiations—learned through Israeli spying operations—to undermine the talks” and had “coordinated talking points with Jewish-American groups against the deal.”)Around 2014, the management of the Neuberger Foundation shifted. Anne Neuberger, who was still at the NSA, moved from vice president to secretary/treasurer, and Yehuda Neuberger, the president, became vice president. Marc Terrill, the president of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore, who had previously been a director of the Neubergers’ foundation, took over as president. (According to tax records for 2014, Terrill made $700,109 in total compensation as head of the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore that year.) The Neuberger Foundation and the Associated Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore share an address and phone number in the Charm City. In its 2015 tax filing, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation reported a major development: it received a $93 million gift. The source of this large contribution—which came in the form of stock in one publicly traded company—was the Chesed Foundation of America, an organization run by George Karfunkel that started that fiscal year with assets of $148 million. (The tax filings do not disclose what stock was involved in this transfer.) In subsequent years, the Anne and Yehuda Neuberger Foundation increased its donations into the seven-figures range. In fiscal year 2017, the foundation experienced another significant change in its finances: it started the year with $88 million in assets but ended with $33 million. It handed out about $1.5 million in donations that year, and its tax filing did not explain this drop. Still, in assets, it remained over 30 times the size it was at its inception in 2010. As the Neubergers’ foundation grew—bolstered by this large infusion from George Karfunkel is foundation—AIPAC remained a beneficiary. In fiscal year 2018, it doled out $1,925,000 in donations, which included $75,000 for AIPAC In Washington, AIPAC is regarded as a powerhouse lobbying force. Itdescribesits mission as a bipartisan effort “to strengthen and expand the US-Israel relationship in ways that enhance the security of the USs and Israel.” But a top AIPAC official once said that its job is generally to support the policies of the government of Israel. In 2005, two senior AIPAC officials were charged with espionage and accused of handing US defense secrets to an Israeli official, but four years later, the case was dropped when pre-court rulings complicated the Justice Department is case by compelling prosecutors to prove the pair had intended to harm US interests. In recent years AIPAC has been widely seen as a supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right and hard line policies—perhaps to such an extent that it has, as one critic put it, engaged in “mission-distortion” or “mission-neglect.” AIPAC, for example, hasprovidedNetanyahu a platform for attacking Democrats and US policies with which it disagrees. “The Israeli government has moved right. AIPAC has gone with it,” Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington,notedlast year. In his new memoir, former President Barack ObamacriticizedAIPAC for reflexively siding with Israel in policy disputes. He wrote that AIPAC embraces the view that “there should be ‘no daylight’ between the US and Israeli governments, even when Israel took actions that were contrary to US policy.” He observed that US officials who adopted a different approach could expect to be targeted by the AIPAC and its political arm: “Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‘anti-Israel’ (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.”On cy ber matters—Anne Neuberger is field—Israel is an important player. It has become a cy ber security powerhouse. The nation is home to NSO Group, one of the mostnotoriouscyber-surveillance firms, which manufactures the infamousPegasusphone spyware, which can allow a security service or other actor to gain total control of a mobile phone and use the device to surveil its user. According to a 2018report, “At least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spy ware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.” Last year,reportedthat the Israeli government had encouraged NSO to sell Pegasus to the United Arab Emirates and several Persian Gulf states. Though Israel is a US ally, it has spied on the US government, and the CIAhas consideredIsrael a top counterintelligence threat. And it is not hard to conceive of cyber-related conflicts that could arise between the two states. So should a Biden administration national security official in charge of US cy ber policy be supporting an influence group aligned with the Israeli government? “It is unwise at best,” says John Sipher, a former CIA official. “In her world, when people think of cyber-threats, Israel is always the re, even if it is an ally. It is surprising that someone in cy ber who understands Israeli capabilities would not want to steer clear of these politics.”Several other national security experts—who asked not to be named—say that the foundation is donations to AIPAC create, at the least, an appearance problem for Anne Neuberger. They point out that the Israeli government does maintain an aggressive campaign of espionage against the USs and has a deep interest in US cy ber policy. A former senior intelligence official says, “Anne is a very smart and competent professional. I was very impressed with her work and never had any question about her integrity… That said, such a donation, if true and publicized, would raise a lot of eyebrows within the government and beyond, especially since the two dimensions involved—Israel and cyber—have their own history.” A second former senior intelligence official adds, “Is this disqualifying? Probably not. But it is not good.”A senior congressional aide who oversees national security issues says, “If you donate half a million dollars to a lobbying group, that indicates a pretty strong preference.” And a foreign policy expert with close ties to the Biden administration notes, “One question this presents is whether she would recuse herself from decisions that could impact Israel.”Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and an expert on government ethics, notes that ethics laws are primarily aimed at preventing an official is financial interests from having an impact on his or her government work. “Neuberger is past financial contribution to AIPAC does not create that kind of ethics issue,” she says. But Clark notes that it could “raise raise a question regarding her impartiality.” Clark points out that because cy ber security issues involve Israel and because AIPAC “promotes strong US-Israeli cooperation on a wide range of issues, including cyber,” the public “needs to know whether the actions of Neuberger is foundation overlap with her government responsibilities.” She adds, “Will we know what the foundation has spent or is spending its money on? Will we know what projects the foundation is supporting? Will the foundation accept donations?”Marc Terrill, the president of the Neuberger Foundation, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When reached by, Yehuda Neuberger said he was not available to discuss the foundation. On Monday,Mother Jonessent a list of questions about the Neuberger Foundation and its AIPAC donations to the NSC and Anne Neuberger. The queries included: Did Neuberger or her foundation know specifically what lobbying the donations subsidized? What was the source of the initial $1,183,050 the foundation kicked off with? What was the stock valued at $93 million that her father is foundation donated to the Neuberger Foundation? Why did the foundation receive such a large gift? Does the Neuberger Foundation consult with Karfunkel regarding any of its donations? Has Neuberger filed a financial disclosure form regarding her new position at the NSC? Does it include information related to the Neuberger Foundation? Did she file a financial disclosure form at the NSA? Did it include information related to the Neuberger Foundation?Mother Jonesalso asked,Is it appropriate for a high-ranking intelligence official or a NSC official to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to AIPAC, a lobby regarded by critics as often aligned with the policy interests of a foreign government? Is there a potential conflict of interest for a senior official in charge of cy ber policy who donates money to an American group that is seen as supportive of a foreign government highly involved in cyber-surveillance and cyber-warfare issues?An NSC spokesperson said that she would respond to the query and requested time to do so. Two days later the NSC declined to answer any of those questions. The NSC spokesperson said, “As a senior NSC employee, Ms. Neuberger will abide by the Executive Order on Ethics Commitments By Executive Branch Personnel.”The NSA did not respond to a similar set of questions. After this article was published, Emily Horne, an NSC spokesperson, sent the following statement: “We note that NBC has pulled down their own version of this story, saying it fell short of their reporting standards, and look forward toMother Jonesdoing the same. The women and men of the NSC are patriotic, dedicated, and serve their country with distinction. Being forced to endure public smear campaigns should not be part of working on behalf of the American people.” NBC News moved its story on Neuberger to its archives and said that the article did not meet the network is reporting standards because it cited only unnamed sources raising questions about the Neuberger Foundation is donations to AIPAC and because Neuberger was not given “adequate time to respond to our reporting.” ThisMother Jonesarticle cited both named and unnamed sources, andMother Jonesgave Neuberger two days to respond to a query about her foundation and the AIPAC donations. She did not respond. Mother Jonesalso contacted the president of the foundation, and he did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Mother Jonesstands by our reporting.",1,1,Mother Jones
328,Mom Faces Felony Charges For Taking a Drug Prescribed by Her Doctor While Pregnant,0.0,41.0,https://reason.com/2021/06/23/pregnant-mom-prescription-drug-charge-alabama/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"Seven cops swarmed the home of an Alabama mom charged with the dastardly crime of taking a painkiller prescribed by her doctor while she was pregnant with her son—who, by the way, is perfectly fine and now 8 months old. In 2020, stay-at-home-mom Kim Blalock of Florence, Alabama, was pregnant with her sixth child. A year earlier, she'd had surgery for back problems resulting from a car accident. She also suffered from arthritis and a degenerative disc disease, and was prescribed hydrocodone to ease her chronic pain. Though she had stopped taking the drug when she learned she was expecting, the pain got worse as the pregnancy wore on—and she had five other kids to take care of. Six weeks before her son was due, she was in such agony that she went back to her orthopedist and he renewed her prescription. When her baby was born and tested for drugs, which seems to be routine, the results came back positive. The Department of Human Resources (DHR), the state is child services division, investigated and quickly closed the case,according to AL.com. But the cops and the district attorney? They smelled blood. Prosecutors could not charge Blalock with taking illegal drugs, because she had a prescription. They could not charge her with abusing the drugs, either. (Not for lack of trying, though: DHR had actually counted how many pills she had taken.) Nor could the authorities charge her with getting the legal drugs by illegal means, such as doctor shopping, or forgery. What they could and did charge her with was not informing her doctor that she was pregnant. They labeled this prescription fraud: a felony. This represents ""the literal policing of pregnancy,"" says Ellie Lee, Director of the Centre for Parenting Studies at the University of Kent in England, one of the rare schools with a department focused on parenting policy. Wisely, the Alabama state legislature had already passed a 2016 law to make sure moms taking drugs prescribed by doctors could not be prosecuted. But Blalock was not protected by that law, ostensibly because she might not have received the prescription had she informed the doctor of her pregnancy. Blalock visited the doctor in person, but was in her car, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Authorities asserted that her obstetrician would have weaned her off the opioid, but Blalock countered that she did indeed tell her ob-gyn. In either case, hydrocodone just is not very dangerous. While babies exposed to the op io id in utero may have some withdrawal symptoms once born—including ""irritability, excess crying, poor feeding, and tremors,"" according to AL.com—those symptoms ""are not life-threatening.""Obviously, no one wants a baby to suffer. But no one should want a mother to suffer, either. And when a pregnant woman is in debilitating pain, there is no solution that promises perfection all around. Rather than recognizing that fact, police officers waited until two months after the baby was born and the n ""swarmed Blalock is house while she and her husband were out of town."" Her two teenagers were at home and said at least seven armed officers entered, asking questions about her whereabouts. The teenagers were so rattled that they went to stay with their grandparents. A public information officer with the Florence Police Department declined to answer questions about the raid because the investigation remains open. Emma Roth, a lawyer with the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, is representing Blalock along with other attorneys. Roth has asked that the charges be dropped. Hanging in the balance is not just Blalock is fate but the fate of any woman who goes to the doctor and does not inform them that she is expecting. This reminds me of theCDC recommending that women who are pregnant or even could be pregnant avoid all alcohol. That means basically no drinks from middle school to menopause. The federal government is impulse was the same as the Florence police department is: focusing so intensely on the fetus that the woman is barely an afterthought.""This is another leap forward in the long march toward erasing pregnant women as people,"" says Joan Wolfe, an associate professor of women is and gender studies at Texas A&M University, and author of""If I had known what I know now, I would rather lay in bed my entire pregnancy in pain than take a pill,"" Blalock said. ""I did not think it was a big deal. My son is perfectly fine.""The fact that this prescription drug is not known to cause any lasting damage to a child means there is no reason to prohibit a mom in pain from taking it and feeling better.",1,1,Reason

Judge Allows Indoor Services me ga church Pastor John MacArthur filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom and other state officials over ongoing restrictions for churches amid the coronavirus pandemic. Inthe filing, submitted Thursday by attorneys Jenna Ellis and Charles LiMandri, MacArthur is Grace Community Church in Sun Valley has sought “to prohibit California from enforcing its unconstitutional and onerous coronavirus pandemic regulations” against the congregation. MacArthur said in a response to the court is ruling, “I am very grateful the court has allowed us to meet inside and we are happy for a few weeks to comply and respect what the judge has asked of us because he is allowing us to meet. This vindicates our desire to stay open and serve our people. This also gives us an opportunity to show that we are not trying to be rebellious or unreasonable, but that we will stand firm to protect our church against unreasonable, unconstitutional restrictions.”The official press release from@ThomasMoreSocre:@GraceComChurchand Pastor@johnmacarthur: addition to suing Newsom, Grace Community Church has named Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D). As legal proceedings get underway, MacArthur has pledged to keep the doors of his church open to serve Angelenos eager to return for Sunday morning services.“We are simply continuing to do today what we have done for the past 63 years, that Grace Community Church has been open to welcome the Los Angeles community and serve their spiritual needs,” the pastor said. “We will remain open and teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to all who decide they want to come worship with us.”Click Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top StoriesAccording to the Thomas More Society, where Ellis serves as special counsel, the complaint from Grace Community Church states the American people “have begun to see that they are being [cheated] by their own government.”The lawsuit pointed to the double standard that has been applied to Black Lives Matter protesters, who have been allowed and even encouraged to flood the streets by the thousands while churches have been forced to keep their sanctuaries closed over concerns worship services could cause spikes in coronavirus infections.“They have witnessed how the onerous restrictions imposed on them by public officials to allegedly fight the COVID-19 pandemic simply do not apply to certain, favored groups,” states MacArthur is lawsuit. “When many went to the streets to engage in ‘political’ or ‘peaceful’ protests purportedly against racism and police brutality, these protestors refused to comply with the pandemic restrictions. Instead of enforcing the public health orders, public officials were all too eager to grant a de facto exception for these favored protestors.”LiMandri argued it is “unconstitutional” for Newsom and his cohorts to “discriminate against churches by treating them less favorably than other organizations and activities that are not protected by the First Amendment.” He continued, “This is especially the case when the government has given free rein to protesters and is not similarly restricting marijuana dispensaries, large retail outlets and factories, and abortion providers.”The legal filing comes not long after MacArthur is church was met with a cease-and-desist letter from the County of Los Angeles. MacArthur, for his part, has indicated he has no plans to comply with the demand. At the beginning of last Sunday is worship service, the 81-year-old pastor cheekily welcomed congregants to “the Grace Community Church peaceful protest.”During an appearance Tuesday morning on CNN, MacArthurtold host Brianna Keilarhe believes the California government is intentionally “targeting” the church. Church-goers, he said, “know life is being restricted in a way that is not constitutional, that is burdensome, that is targeting a church, and that makes no sense in light of the actual number of deaths that they are seeing.”As for whether it is wise for certain attenders to return to in-person worship services, MacArthur told Keilar he has entrusted his congregants with that determination. He said it is up to attendees to “make adult decisions about the reality of their physical and spiritual health and how that balance works for each one of them.”The judge is requiring congregants to wear masks and social distance between family groups while indoors. A full hearing is set for September 4, 2020.",0,1,CBN
330,The Department of Defense Contractors,-18.67,44.0,https://popular.info/p/the-department-of-defense-contractors,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-09,18,"In his 1961farewell address, President Dwight D Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex:In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. At the time, the budget of the US military was $48 billion. This fiscal year, the US military budget is$738 billion, a rise that far outpaced the rate of inflation. If military spending had increased at the pace of inflation over the last 60 years, the current military budget would be about $414 billion. Military spending accelerated dramatically during the Trump administration; more than$125 billion was added to the defense budget over 4 years. Notably, Trump is first three Defense Secretaries all previously worked for military contractors. Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump in November, was a lobbyist for Raytheon. Esper is predecessor, Patrick Shanahan, spent three decades as an executive at Boeing. And Shanahan is predecessor, Jim Mattis, served on the board of General Dynamics for four years before being nominated as Trump is first Secretary of Defense. The election of Joe Biden was an opportunity to reset the relationship between the Pentagon and the contractors that are paid billions annually by the federal government. Instead, Biden nominated Lloyd Austin, a former general and current member of the Raytheon board. Austin, who retired as a four-star general, has an unquestionably impressive resume. He was the commander of CENTCOM, and, before that, the battlefield commander who managed the complicated withdrawal of US forces from Iraq. He reportedly has a strong desire ""to avoid civilian casualties."" Unlike other top generals, he has avoided the media spotlight and focused on his work. His nomination is also historic. Austin would be the first Black Secretary of Defense. But it is also not an accident that Austin ended up on the board of Raytheon in 2016, a position which paid him $300,000 in annual compensation. In 2018, according to are port by the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), defense contractors employed 380 former ""high-ranking Department of Defense officials and military officers"" as ""lobbyists, board members, executives, or consultants."" The biggest defense contractors — General Dynamics, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed, BAE — all currently have multiple retired admirals and generals on their board. POGOconcludedthat the ""revolving door of Pentagon officials and senior military leaders seeking lucrative post-government jobs"" ends up conflating ""what is in the best financial interests of defense contractors—excessively large Pentagon budgets, endless wars, and overpriced weapon systems—with what is in the best interest of military effectiveness and protecting citizens.""Raytheon, in particular, has publicly advocated for the Biden campaign to maintain — and eventually increase — Trump is military spending levels. Ina CNBC interview in late-October, Raytheon CEO Gregory Hayes said it was ""ridiculous"" to think that Biden would reduce military spending. Although Hayes said he expected defense budgets to remain relatively flat as the country deals with the pandemic, he called for increased budgets in the long term. ""We have lost our technological edge to the Chinese and in some cases to the Russians and we are going to have to invest more dollars into some of these new technologies if we are going to be able to compete with these new threats,"" Hayes said. Raytheon spends millions to influence the federal government. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon is lobbying expenditures exceeded $2.85 million. This included $680,000 in payments to 19 different lobbying firms. Austin is connection to Raytheon is unlikely to seriously endanger his chances at confirmation. A year ago, Esper was confirmed on a vote of 90-8, despite working as a lobbyist for Raytheon. Republicans and Democrats are willing to overlook these kinds of financial conflicts-of-interest. Another issue with Austin is nomination as Defense Secretary is that he is not technically eligible for the job. ""A person may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force,"" according to federal law. Austin retired four years ago. What is the purpose of this law? It is grounded in the foundational principle that the military reflects, and is subordinate to,the will of the people. That is why the president is also Commander-in-Chief. The specific law was passed in 1947, around the time the unified Department of Defense was created, and initially required a member of the military to be retired for 10 years before being appointed Secretary of Defense. (The time period was shortened to seven years in 2008.) It was based on aconcern""that recently retired officers would be too cozy with their friends still on active duty."" Ultimately, this could undermine the authority of the president and the rest of the civilian decision-making apparatus. Austin, however, seems unlikely to resist the strategies of Biden and his civilian national security team at the White House. According to reports, Biden selected Austin in part because, unlike some high-ranking generals, he does not seek out the spotlight. Congress can waive the requirements of the law, and did so to confirm Mattis in 2017. But Mattis was only the second time that Congress waived the law. And at the time some Democrats said it was a one-time exception they would not repeat. (The conventional wisdom was that Mattis would provide ""adult supervision"" for Trump.)Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, supported the waiver for Mattis but said he would not support a waiver for any future nominees. Congress has enacted an exception one time since the creation of the Department of Defense. And waiving the law should happen no more than once in a generation. Therefore, I will not support a waiver for future nominees. Nor will I support any effort to water down or repeal the statute in the future. The waiver must also pass the House. In 2017,only 36 House Democrats supported a waiver for Mattis. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin has already raised concerns about Austin is nomination, saying that ""civil-military relations at the Pentagon definitely need to be rebalanced.""Democrats also referenced the issue in their 2020 party platform. ""We will end the Trump Administration is politicization of the armed forces and distortion of civilian and military roles in decision-making,"" the platformsays.

331,Megyn Kelly pulls kids from school for promoting ‘reform of white kids’,6.0,42.33,https://www.thecollegefix.com/megyn-kelly-pulls-kids-from-school-for-promoting-reform-of-white-kids/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,23,"Political commentator and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly announced on her pod cast Monday that she plans to pull her kids out of New York City schools. Kelly has two sons and a daughter, all under the age of 12.“The schools have always been far-left,” Kelly said on her pod cast on Monday. “But they have gone around the bend,” she said. Kelly said that an article, twice circulated among a diversity group at her sons’ school, was a final straw for Kelly. (From the description Kelly provides, it appears to be a group made up of administrators, teachers and parents that want to work on issues of diversity at the school). The opinion article comes from Nahliah Webber, the executive director of the Orleans Public Education Network. White kids need “reform,” Webber explained in the. “This time if you really want to make a difference in Black lives—and not have to protest this shit again go reform white kids,”Webber said, italicizing her central argument.“Because that is where the problem is—with White children being raised from infancy to violate Black bodies with no remorse or accountability,” she argued in the opinion piece. It is titled: “If you really want to make a difference in Black Lives, Change How You Teach White Kids.”'After years of resisting it, we are going to leave.""@MegynKellydescribes why she pulled her kids out of their NYC schools – and she,@GlennLouryand@ColdxmanHughes discuss how ""woke"" leftism has taken over schools. Listen below, download here:— The Megyn Kelly Show (@MegynKellyShow)November 16, 2020Webber explained the issue:The system that killed George Floyd and the system that raised and educated the cop who killed him are the same. And in the same way that folks are tired of the viral Black death—protest—fake trial—acquittal—rinse and repeat cycle, I am tired of folks acting like the re is no direct connection between the schools where White children sit and the street corners where they choke out Black life. There is a George Floyd in every school where Black children learn. Black children are screamed at, berated, surveil led and searched in schools. Black children are slammed and dragged, kicked and prodded in classrooms. Black children are denied an education and disrespect ed because of their culture. Black children are groomed for containment. We have got children walking on tape with hands over their mouths like prisoners in training. Kelly explained on her show that what really offended her was the demonization of white people and the implication that her own kids, by default, harbored racist ideology. Webber said:Black children are suspended, detained, “demerited” and isolated in schools for trivial things every day. And the re is a killer cop sitting in every school where White children learn. They hear the litany of bad statistics and stereotypes about “scary” Black people in their classes and on the news. They gleefully soak in their White-washed history that downplays the holocaust of Indigenous, Native peoples and Africans in the Americas. They happily believe their all-White spaces exist as a matter of personal effort and willingly use violence against Black bodies to keep those spaces white. Webber called on the federal government to “commission studies on White neighborhoods that produce and insulate anti-Black physical, economic and political violence” and “(s)chool reformers need to lobby, plot and plan on how to disrupt school systems that produce, protect and reward White violence.”“I have to tell you, it is heartbreaking,” Kelly said on her podcast, describing her reaction to what the school had promoted.“Which boy in my kid is school is the future killer cop, is it my boy?” Kelly asked rhetorically.“Because I really do not believe they are in the re,” Kelly said.

332,"Alito: Court is 'Preposterous' Trans Ruling Threatens Religion, Speech, Privacy, and Safety",21.0,36.25,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2020/06/15/alito-courts-preposterous-trans-ruling-threatens-religion-speech-privacy-and-safety-n532217,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-15,25,"On Monday, the US Supreme Court ruled that discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the case of(2020). In a powerful dissent joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito condemned the ruling as “preposterous” and betraying “breathtaking” arrogance. He noted that Congress has tried and repeatedly failed to amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in just this fashion and that no one interpreted the law this way until 2017. In this decision, as inRoe vs Wade(1973) andObergefell vs Hodges(2015), the Supreme Court usurped the power of Congress by creating “legislation.”Perhaps most importantly, however, Alito warns that the decision will have wide-ranging destructive impacts on key freedoms Americans hold dear, and he predicts that “the entire Federal Judiciary will be mired for years in disputes about the reach of the Court is reasoning.”“As the briefing in these cases has warned, the position that the Court now adopts will threaten freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and personal privacy and safety. No one should think that the Court is decision represents an unalloyed victory for individual liberty,” Alito warns. His dissent lays out seven different realms of American life that will be affected by this ruling. Naturally, the Supreme Court is position that a ban on discrimination on the basis of “sex” includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not only a preposterous extension of the 1964 law but a dangerous reading of federal law in general. As Alito warns, “the Court may wish to avoid this subject, but it is a matter of concern to many people who are reticent about disrobing or using toilet facilities in the presence of individuals whom they regard as members of the opposite sex. For some, this may simply be a question of modesty, but for others, there is more at stake. For women who have been victimized by sexual assault or abuse, the experience of seeing an unclothed person with the anatomy of a male in a confined and sensitive location such as a bathroom or locker room can cause serious psychological harm.”Based on broad understandings of “transgender status” that could include those who identify as “gender fluid” and those who have not undergone any surgery to alter their bodies. “A person who has not undertaken any physical transition ing may claim the right to use the bathroom or locker room assigned to the sex with which the individual identifies at that particular time,” Alito reasoned. This is not to say that transgender people are predators, but to note that women have passionately fought for their rights and now their private spaces will be open to biological males. The true concern is not that a male who identifies as a female will abuse women, but that prurient men will abuse this loophole and some women who have experienced sexual assault will be victimized by being forced to share intimate quarters with biological males. Alito also warns that “the right of a transgender individual to participate on a sports team or in an athletic competition previously reserved for members of one biological sex” may arise under Title VII and Title IX due to the Court is ruling in.“This issue has already arisen under Title IX, where it threatens to undermine one of that law is major achievements, giving young women an equal opportunity to participate in sports,” Alito notes. “The effect of the Court is reasoning may be to force young women to compete against students who have a very significant biological advantage, including students who have the size and strength of a male but identify as female and students who are taking male hormones in order to transition from female to male.”Alito also warned that this ruling may affect professional sports, as well. Indeed, women in Connecticut are challenging a school rule that forces them to compete with biological males. Even the, which has published an article calling for Child Protective Services to remove gender-confused kids from their parents if the parents will not give them experimental transgender drugs, also published an article condemning the “intolerable unfairness” of the Olympic Committee is pro-transgender rules.“may lead to Title IX cases against any college that resists assigning students of the opposite biological sex as roommates,” Alito warns. It may also force rape crisis centers for women to admit biological males who claim to identify as women. One such center has already been vandalized with transgender slogans, and some centers have fought long legal battles over the right to allow safe harbor only for women. Alito cites “briefs filed by a wide range of religious groups––Christian, Jewish, and Muslim–– [that] express deep concern that the position now adopted by the Court ‘will trigger open conflict with faith-based employment practices of numerous churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions.’ They argue that ‘[r]eligious organizations need employees who actually live the faith,’ and that compelling a religious organization to employ individuals whose conduct flouts the tenets of the organization is faith forces the group to communicate an objectionable message.”Alito warns that this problem is “perhaps most acute” in the employment of teachers. “A school is standards for its faculty ‘communicate a particular way of life to its students,’ and a ‘violation by the faculty of those precepts’ may undermine the school is ‘moral teaching.’ Thus, if a religious school teaches that sex outside marriage and sex reassignment procedures are immoral, the message may be lost if the school employs a teacher who is in a same-sex relationship or has undergone or is undergoing sex reassignment.”“Healthcare benefits may emerge as an intense battleground under the Court is holding,” Alito warns. “Transgender employees have brought suit under Title VII to challenge employer-provided health insurance plans that do not cover costly sex reassignment surgery.”“Such claims present difficult religious liberty issues because some employers and healthcare providers have strong religious objections to sex reassignment procedures, and the refore requiring them to pay for or to perform these procedures will have a severe impact on their ability to honor their deeply held religious beliefs,” he explains. Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)just finalized a rule rightly defining sex as biological sex and reversing the Obama administration on these issues. Doesmake that HHS rule unconstitutional?Alito warns that “the Court is decision may even affect the way employers address their employees and the way teachers and school officials address students. Under established English usage, two sets of sex-specific singular personal pronouns are used to refer to someone in the third person (he, him, and his for males; she, her, and hers for females). But several different sets of gender-neutral pronouns have now been created and are preferred by some individuals who do not identify as falling into either of the two traditional categories.”“Some jurisdictions, such as New York City, have ordinances making the failure to use an individual is preferred pronoun a punishable offense, and some colleges have similar rules. After to day is decision, plaintiffs may claim that the failure to use their preferred pronoun violates one of the federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination,” the justice warns. While Title VII cases are different from cases about the Fourteenth Amendment, Alito warns that“may exert a gravitational pull in constitutional cases. Under our precedents, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex-based discrimination unless a ‘heightened’ standard of review is met. By equating discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity with discrimination because of sex, the Court is decision will be cited as a ground for subjecting all three forms of discrimination to the same exacting standard of review.”“Under this logic, to day is decision may have effects that extend well beyond the domain of federal anti discrimination statutes. This potential is illustrated by pending and recent lower court cases in which transgender individuals have challenged a variety of federal, state, and local laws and policies on constitutional grounds,” Alito warns. Although the six justices in the majority on likely had honorable intentions in redefining the word “sex” and effectively making law in this decision, it was “irresponsible” for them not to consider its wide-ranging consequences, Alito warns.“The updating desire to which the Court succumbs no doubt arises from humane and generous impulses. Today, many Americans know individuals who are gay, lesbian, or transgender and want them to be treated with the dignity, consideration, and fairness that everyone deserves,” he writes. Even so, “The Court is brusque refusal to consider the consequences of its reasoning is irresponsible.”“If the Court had allowed the legislative process to take its course, Congress would have had the opportunity to consider competing interests and might have found a way of accommodating at least some of them.” Instead, the Supreme Court has made law, just like it did inandObergefell vs Hodges.",1,0,PJ Media
333,Tribe sues feds over policing,-1.67,46.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/18/northern-cheyenne-sues-feds-over-policing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,15,"The BIA is an agency within the Department of Interior. The tribe relies on the BIA for law enforcement services on the reservation, which it described as chronically inadequate.“The Tribe has been dissatisfied with the level of law enforcement service provided by the Bureau for several years and has attempted to work with the Bureau to address the issues, including a lack of qualified officers assigned to the Reservation and a lack of adequate criminal investigations,” the complaint states. The lawsuit comes after the tribe and others — including Montana is two US senators — have complained about high crime rates and too few police officers to effectively respond to calls and conduct investigations. According to the BIA, it should have at least 19 law enforcement staff members on the reservation, the lawsuit claims. But over the last several years, an average of fewer than six have been assigned there. At times there is only one officer on duty, the lawsuit alleges, making it difficult or impossible to respond to every call for help. In a Thursday statement, Donna Fisher, the tribe is president, said the tribe and its citizens “have paid the high price of violent crime, including missing and murdered indigenous women, unlawful drug use and distribution, and other crimes” as a result of the BIA is failure to provide adequate policing.“BIA, which is solely responsible for enforcing the criminal laws on the Reservation, has fallen down on this sacred trust and statutory obligation for many years,” Fisher said. The tribe is complaints culminated over the summer when a string of homicides on the reservation prompted Montana is US senators, Jon Tester and Steve Daines, tourge the federal government on the tribe is behalf to increase the number of officers and investigations on the reservation and improve communication with tribal leaders and victims’ families. Dainesmet with tribal leaders in Octoberto discuss their concerns. Tester, in an October 30 letter, asked for an update on what steps BIA was taking to address the complaints. A simple way to begin addressing crime rates on Northern Cheyenne land, Tester said, is to increase the number of officers available to respond to crimes and other calls for help — a responsibility he said falls to the federal government.“We have to have enough police officers on the ground to protect the people … And I think what adds to the situation in Indian Country is our trust responsibility,” he said in an early December interview with Montana Free Press. “We do have an obligation to make sure we are doing right.”After the tribe and others raised concerns over the summer, the tribe began working to take over responsibility for criminal investigations and drug enforcement on the reservation from the BIA Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, tribes can apply to take over roles, such as policing, otherwise assigned to the federal government. On July 20, the tribe sent a letter to BIA stating its intent to apply to assume criminal investigation and drug enforcement duties, according to the lawsuit. The tribe submitted its application August 19. But since the n, the tribe alleges, the government violated the self determination act by stalling consideration of the application, failing to share information necessary to complete an accurate application, and failing to offer guidance before ultimately denying the proposal on November 17, based on a variety of inadequacies in the application. According to the tribe is lawsuit, many of the reasons the BIA offered for the denial violated the self determination act. Fisher is statement said the tribe is asking the court for an injunction ordering BIA to accept the tribe is proposals. Neither the BIA nor the Interior Department, which is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to em ails seeking comment. In his October 30 letter, Tester urged the agency to provide any assistance or information necessary for the Northern Cheyenne to complete the application process.“Senator Tester believes it is imperative that the federal government upholds its trust and treaty responsibilities and work hand-in-hand with Tribes to advance self-determination,” Tester spokesman Roy Loewenstein said in an emailed statement. Daines, in an emailed statement, said, “It is unacceptable that the BIA continues to play these bureaucratic games with the Northern Cheyenne.”“Montana is tribes need to be empowered to ensure the safety of their communities,” he said. The Montana GOP uninvited a planned convention speaker amid US Senate drama. The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new fire station and additional police officers and firefighters.

334,Crowded Field of Mayoral Candidates Zooming Toward Primary Day,-4.33,47.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/18/crowded-field-of-mayoral-candidates-zooming-toward-primary-day/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-18,17,"“Zoom is not our friend. I just want to be very clear.”Andrew Yang was reflecting on the joy of campaigning, even during a pandemic. He was getting to know his city so well. People were thrilled to see him in the streets. The front-running mayoral candidate, speaking to reporters in Harlem on a frigid March day, seemed also to be growing aware of all he would probably miss: the teeming block parties, the raucous parades, the subway platforms thronged at rush hour.“Most New Yorkers are sick and tired of Zoom,” Yang added. “I think a lot of the country is sick and tired of Zoom.”Though relatively few New Yorkers may be aware of this fact, they will probably be choosing their mayor for the next eight years three months from now, on June 22. In heavily Democratic New York City, the primary winner will steamroll over nominal GOP opposition. Incumbents usually get re-elected — Bill de Blasio, for all his challenges, easily did. But this mayoral race, for many reasons, is unlike any other. The vaccination pace is heating up, but COVID-19 still lingers as a threat, shrinking crowds and keeping commuters at home. Mass death rates, along with job losses, have taken a significant toll. In 2013, the last time there was an open Democratic primary, candidates jostled for attention for many months, the race culminating in an election at the close of a turbulent summer. Hundreds of town halls, street festivals, parades, and rallies built to a satisfying crescendo. There were no fewer than three front-runners — City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the scandalous Anthony Weiner, and, finally, de Blasio — plus a city comptroller is race that featuredEliot Spitzer, the governor who resigned after he was caught soliciting a prostitute. These days, the primary is in June, not September. After a federal judge ruled that congressional primaries be moved to June to allow sufficient time to get absentee ballots to military voters for the general election, the state legislature eventually decided to set all primaries in June, including the mayoral race. This year, such a condensed contest will probably benefit those who have already built up support bases around the city. Yang is well-known to most New Yorkers from his long-shot presidential bid, but the rest of the field is not. The parades and parties are not yet materializing. There will be relatively few opportunities to meet voters face-to-face. The race, many campaigns believe, may be decided wholly on screens — traditional cable television, digital advertising, and whatever online chatter can be generated.“In this race right now, it is really hard to do any level of retail campaigning,” says Peter Ragone, a former senior adviser to de Blasio and a veteran Democratic operative. “It is really going to be, number one, are you on television? And are you creating any content yourself that has huge levels of engagement?”A traditional Democratic primary in New York City is arrayed around huge parades, captivating stunts for television, and other mass events. All the candidates in 2013 pressed the flesh at the famous West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn, with Weinerblaring musica nd shouting through a bullhorn on his blue and orange float. The Democratsall staged a sleep over at a public housing development with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Bill Thompson, the runner-up in the race, dragged reporters on a 24-hour tour of New York City,bringing them to a frozen meat locker in the pre-dawn hours. Top candidates would routinely invite reporters along for trips to the subway and door-knocking expeditions. Every day promised another debate, a rally with supporters, or a visit to a community center, synagogue, or nursing home. Everywhere were the voters — it was an imperfect system, but ordinary people, on a given afternoon on Broadway or in the South Bronx, could run into the future mayor and strike up a conversation. For the campaigns the mselves, there was a feedback loop that is clearly missing now. A campaign event, if well-attended or interesting enough, could draw journalists and end up on the nightly news. This footage could be used for paid television ads a month later. Journalists, meanwhile, could attempt to gauge how well a candidate might be connecting with New Yorkers. Were they becoming increasingly recognizable? Did they have notable interactions with voters?“In every other campaign I have worked on, the retail campaigning is front and center. Not only do you get to meet voters, reporters have something to cover, television news stories have rallies to get pictures of, and the re is this whole ecosystem of political communication that goes on apart from paid advertising,” says a top ad maker attached to one of the current mayoral campaigns.“This time around, because we have so little capacity to do old-fashioned handshakes and hugs and big rallies, the re is going to be a greater reliance on paid communication to reach voters — radio, digital, and direct mail.”This is not the first campaign to be run during the pandemic. Last year, numerous candidates for state office in New York had to suspend operations and recalibrate for a June primary that came right after the peak number of coronavirus deaths in the city. Door-knocking was ditched and campaigns turned to glossy mailers, digital ads, and phone calls to reach as many voters as they could. But these were all small-scale campaigns, operating in districts where fewer than 20,000 people could vote. The mayoral primary is expected to draw anywhere from 700,000 to a million voters, with many campaigns planning for a spike from the middling 2013 turnout. To make matters more challenging, voters have other pressing concerns. The pandemic is on the wane but remains a concrete, unsettling reality. Then there are the scandals surrounding Governor Andrew Cuomo, all-consuming online, in the newspapers, and on cable television. Granular, daily coverage of the mayoral race — the type seen in 2013 — has been far less evident.“All of our attention is drawn to stuff that is not the mayoral race,” said Micah Lasher, campaign manager for Scott Stringer, the city comptroller and one of the leading candidates. The top campaigns are gearing up for heavy cable TV expenditures in the months to come in the hope of breaking through. Most of the campaigns expect to dedicate a far larger share of their spending on television than they would have in a more ordinary year. Others, like the progressive Dianne Morales, who reported that she just qualified for public matching funds, are leaning heavily into digital campaigning, rapidly accruing online followings. One of the mayoral candidates, the financial executive Ray McGuire, is not participating in the public matching funds system at all, a move that will allow him to spend as much as he wants — those abiding by the Campaign Finance Board is regulations receive generous matching funds in return for adhering to a strict spending cap — but also permit his rivals to spend more as well. A spokesman for the CFB said a determination on whether to raise the cap in the race will be made after April 26, the final deadline for candidates to join the matching funds program. The system is designed to incentivize small-donor giving. While a mayoral campaign can receive a $2,000 check, only donations up to $250 are eligible to be matched, amplifying the power of a $25 or $50 donation. Based on the CFB is criteria, all participating campaigns will be able to spend at least several million more. The current cap, at about $7.3 million, rises to $10,929,000 if a nonparticipating candidate spends at least $3,643,000. (Surpassing $21,858,000, which the billionaire Michael Bloomberg routinely did, would mean lifting the cap entirely.)McGuire is no billionaire, but he has already spent more than $3.7 million. Raising the cap would most benefit the candidates who have raised enough to take advantage of it: Yang, Stringer, Eric Adams, and former de Blasio counsel Maya Wiley, whose campaign has recently reached the matching threshhold. Stringer and Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, have already banked more than $6 and $7 million respectively. For campaigns, TV advertising is the least efficient but most effective way of reaching a broad swath of voters. Enough older Democrats are still watching CNN and MSNBC every day, as well as local stations like NY1. The ads cannot be perfectly tailored or targeted like digital solicitations on Facebook — a resident of New Jersey can end up seeing a 30-second spot for a mayoral candidate — but they can reach, on a given day, hundreds of thousands or millions of people. It is all exceedingly expensive: a strong ad buy can easily run $1 million a week. With multiple candidates spending millions to purchase ads, the re is a fear of being drowned out. At the same time,notbeing there carries great risk, with a rival hogging precious airtime. A Democrat attempting to break into the top tier, Shaun Donovan, a veteran of the Obama and Bloomberg administrations, has already been spending on weekly TV ads. (Outside Super PACs are also stepping up for Donovan and McGuire.)To complicate the picture in 2021, well-funded candidates will be targeting popular connected TV services such as Roku, Hulu, and Apple TV, which were barely part of the mix in 2013. De Blasio won that race eight years ago for many reasons, including Weiner is implosion and de Blasio is own disciplined, anti-Bloomberg messaging, but television played a decisive role. De Blasio was prescient, dedicating a larger share of his campaign spending to television advertising than his rivals and foregoing direct mail. Years later, the“Dante” ad is still discussed in mythic terms: how 30 seconds of de Blasio is biracial son talking about his father is promise to “really break from the Bloomberg years” captivated Democratic voters and entered the popular culture. Most ads do not carry such emotional impact — at best, they may introduce a candidate, make an argument, or attack a rival. Yang is the public polling leader,and could be, in the weeks to come, the focus of negative advertising, particularly if a wealthy interest group or labor union aligned with a rival decides to spend against him.“It is not a paper endorsement,” says Kyle Bragg, the president of the influential building workers’ union, 32BJ SEIU.“Our members are super engaged voters.” 32BJ, like several other large unions in the city, is backing Adams, who is shaping up to be Yang is top rival. Yang has shunned negative campaigning thus far, while Adams has criticized Yang forleaving the city in the early stages of the pandemic. Some of the Adams-supporting unions could train their fire at Yang if they view him as a durable threat. To drive media coverage, Yang has relied on his Twitter feed, with 2 million followers, and, unlike most of his rivals, frequent in-person campaign stops. Recently, he has started appearing with opponents at events, like the press conference in Harlemto promote an app for small businesses envisioned by Kathryn Garcia, a Democratic contender and the former Department of Sanitation Commissioner. These sorts of team-ups have grown more common as candidates vie to be second choices for voters who can now rank up to five candidates. According to Yang is campaign, media turnout was much higher than a typical press conference, thanks to the unusual nature of a multi-candidate appearance. In 2013, one of de Blasio is fiercest rivals in the early months was John Liu, the city comptroller at the time. Liu was renowned for his vigorous campaign schedule, appearing at as many as a dozen rallies, block parties, and subway stops a day. Now a state senator, and happily watching the race from the sidelines, Liu says the candidates must learn to adapt to the new normal: lots of Zoom, lots of TV, and a lot of time online. And get used to not being the center of attention.“It is New York City. At what given moment is there not a whole lot of shit going down?” Liu asks. “In 2013, we had months of the Weiner circus. I think candidates can be thankful they do not have to deal with that.”❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

I can hear the wind screaming past the windows, straining the trees. I know from experience that this wind can make a spark rip through dried grass and brush in an instant. Every time a gust picks up, I feel a knot tighten in my gut. Westerners try to control fire with chainsaws, fire retardant, bulldozers, and the sweat and blood of wild land firefighters. But in conditions like the se, I am reminded of our helplessness against fire is powerful indifference. For half a century, land-management agencies adhered to the “10 o’clock rule,” a requirement that all wildfires be extinguished by 10 a.m. the following day. Now, land managers know that wildfire is a natural part of the West. Good fires prevent bad ones; small-scale burns thin out excess vegetation and dead trees, the reby helping prevent large, destructive megafires. This year, however, our efforts feel insufficient. In college, I spent the school year learning about wildlife biology and the summers fighting wildfire. The choice to work in the wilderness was clear. My dad taught me to love the outdoors. My earliest memories are of the snow in the Sierras. At 3 years old, I lay on my back making snow angels, staring up at the pines in wonder. The trees loomed against the gray winter sky, impossibly high and imposing. Even the n, I recognized their otherworldly beauty. My dad was the first to show me the magic of the forest, the majesty of rivers and lakes, the quiet beauty of the desert. When he died, I was a teenager. Those trips to the mountains ended, and for a time, so did my experience of nature. I was working my first fire season when I readThe Big Burnby Timothy Egan, which chronicles the story of the US Forest Service. I learned about the history of America is public lands while sitting within their legacy — how Gifford Pinchot and Teddy Roosevelt fought tooth and nail to protect America is wild places from privatization, at a time when there was little concept of conservation. As a racially mixed kid from the Los Angeles suburbs, many times I was acutely aware of my difference, working on wild land fire crews where most of my co-workers were white men from rural backgrounds. I recognized the exclusionary nature of Western conservation, even as I studied its heroes. On the surface, I could not have less in common with Roosevelt or Pinchot. But I identified with their love of nature, their desire to protect it, and, most of all, how nature served as a balm to their grief. Both Pinchot and Roosevelt suffered unimaginable losses. Both immersed the mselves in wilderness looking for an answer to their grief. Roosevelt lost his wife, and the n his mother, within the space of a day. Pinchot is fiancée died young of tuberculosis, and yet he continued to write to his love many years after her death. When he felt her presence, he would record a “clear day” in his journal. I felt a kinship with their loss; my father is death shaped my adolescence. I, too, ran to the forest seeking a spiritual reckoning. I heard my own answer during my first fire season, and I continue to hear it to this day. Corey Brickley/High Country NewsThree years ago, my crew was assigned to a small lightning fire by a lake in Northern California. The burn went through a rocky slope, scorching the ponderosa canopy above. The fire was already extinguished, so our job was to mop up any remaining hot spots. We went over every inch of its interior, turning over dirt, spraying water with backpack pumps between rock crevices. At the end of the day, I made my way down the slope, exhausted, my legs aching. The burned rocky slope bordered a stream that flowed into the lake. A small wooden bridge went across the stream, connecting the trail to the opposite side. The land on one side of it was burned by fire, but the other side was untouched. I crossed the bridge to a lush green forest. Broadleaf trees hung overhead in a dense canopy. Grass formed a thick carpet under my feet. The wet ground sank under my boots, still dusty with ash. Turning back, I sat on the bridge. The setting sun shone down on the lake, reflecting across the water. At that moment, I thought of my dad. I felt his overwhelming presence. The one thought that surpassed all others was, “It is all right now.” I heard a clear answer to my grief and despair, an answer I can hear even now, in this time of uncertainty. I felt a sense of peace in that beautiful place on the water, on a bridge balanced between life and destruction.",1,1,High Country News
336,QAnon moves into the shadows but movement remains active,-4.0,45.0,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/9/qanon-moves-into-the-shadows-but-movement-remains-active,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"On the face of it, the QAnon conspiracy appears to have largely disappeared from big social media sites. But that is not quite the case. Popular QAnon catch phrases like “great awakening,” “the storm” or “trust the plan” are less prevalent on Facebook these days. Facebook and Twitter have removed tens of thousands of accounts dedicated to the baseless conspiracy theory, which depicts former President Donald Trump as a hero fighting a secret battle against a sect of devil-worshipping paedophiles who dominate Hollywood, big business, the media and government. Gone are the huge “Stop the Steal” groups that spread falsehoods about the 2020 US presidential elections. Trump is gone as well, banned from Twitter permanently and suspended from posting on Facebook until 2023. But QAnon is far from winding down. Federal intelligence officials recently warned that its adherents could commit more violence, like the deadly Capitol insurrection on January 6. At least one open supporter of QAnon has been elected to Congress,Marjorie Taylor Greene. In the four years since someone calling the mselves “Q” started posting enigmatic messages on fringe internet discussions boards, QAnon has grown up. QAnon now encompasses a variety of conspiracy the ories, from evangelical or religious angles to alleged paedophilia in Hollywood and theJeffrey Epstein scandal,said Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council is DFRLab who focuses on domestic extremism. “Q-specific stuff is sort of dwindling,” he said. But the world views and conspiracy the ories that QAnon absorbed are still around. Loosely tying these movements together is a general distrust of a powerful, often left-wing elite. Among them are purveyors of anti-vaccine falsehoods, adherents of Trump is “Big Lie” that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and believers in just about any other world view convinced that a shadowy cabal secretly controls things. For social platforms, dealing with this faceless, shifting and increasingly popular mindset is a far more complicated challenge than they have dealt with in the past. These ideologies “have cemented their place and now are a part of American folklore”, said Max Rizzuto, another researcher at DFRLab. “I do not think we will ever see it disappear.”Online, such groups now blend into the background. Where Facebook groups once openly referenced QAnon, now groups are titled such as, “Since you missed this in the so called MSM,” a page referencing “mainstream media” that boasts more than 4,000 followers. It features links to clips of Fox News is Tucker Carlson and articles from right-wing publications such as Newsmax and the Daily Wire. Subjects range from allegedly rampant crime to unfounded claims of widespread election fraud and an “outright war on conservatives”. Such groups aim to draw followers in deeper by directing them to further information on less-regulated sites such as Gab orParler. When DFRLab analysed more than 40 million appearances of QAnon catch phrases and related terms on social media earlier this year, it found that their presence on mainstream platforms had declined significantly in recent months. After peaks in mid-to-late 2020 and briefly on January 6, QAnon catch phrases have largely evaporated from mainstream sites, DFRLab found. So while users might not be posting wild conspiracies about Hillary Clinton drinking children is blood, they might instead be repeating debunked claims that vaccines can alter your DNA There are several reasons for dwindling Q talk — Trump losing the presidential election, for instance, and the lack of new messages from “Q”. But the single biggest factor appears to have been the QAnon crackdown on Facebook and Twitter. Despite well-documented mistakes that revealed spotty enforcement, the banishment largely appears to have worked. It is more difficult to come across blatant QAnon accounts on mainstream social media sites these days, at least from the publicly available data that does not include, for instance, hidden Facebook groups and private messages. While QAnon groups, pages and core accounts may be gone, many of their supporters remain on the big platforms — only now they are camouflaging their language and watering down the most extreme tenets of QAnon to make them more palatable.“There was a very, very explicit effort within the QAnon community to camouflage their language,” said Angelo Carusone, the president and CEO of Media Matters, a liberal research group that has followed QAnon is rise. “So they stopped using a lot of the codes, the triggers, the keywords that were eliciting the kinds of enforcement actions against them.”Other dodges may have also helped. Rather than parroting Q slogans, for instance, for a while earlier this year, supporters would type three asterisks next to their name to signal adherence to the conspiracy theory. That is a nod to former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, a three-star general. Facebook has said it has removed about 3,300 pages, 10,500 groups, 510 events, 18,300 Facebook profiles and 27,300 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against QAnon. “We continue to consult with experts and improve our enforcement in response to how harm evolves, including by recidivist groups,” the company said in a statement. But the social giant will still cut individuals posting about QAnon slack, citing experts who warned that banning individual Q adherents “may lead to further social isolation and danger”, the company said. Facebook is policies and response to QAnon continue to evolve. Since last August, the company said it has added dozens of new terms as the movement and its language has evolved. Twitter, meanwhile, said it has consistently taken action against activity that could lead to offline harm. After the January 6 insurrection, the company began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that it said were “primarily dedicated” to sharing dangerous QAnon material. Twitter said it has suspended 150,000 such accounts to date. Like Facebook, the company said its response is also evolving. But the crackdown may have come too late. Carusone, for instance, noted that Facebook banned QAnon groups tied to violence six weeks before it banned QAnon more broadly. That effectively gave followers notice to regroup, camouflage and move to different platforms.“If there were ever a time for a social media company to take a stand on QAnon content, it would have been like months ago, years ago,” DFRLabs’ Rizzuto said.",2,2,Al Jazeera
337,"San Diego public schools can provide in-person enrichment and therapy to students, officials say",1.67,50.0,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2020-08-19/san-diego-public-schools-can-provide-in-person-enrichment-and-therapy-to-students-officials-confirm,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,20,"There is now a way San Diego County public schools can serve students on campus without applying for a waiver or breaking the state school closure mandate. Schools can offer in-person enrichment programs for free by using money set aside for state- and federally-funded after-school programs. While schools ca not provide in-person classes, there are no state rules prohibiting schools from offering other in-person support programs for students, County Superintendent Paul Gothold said recently. Therefore the San Diego County Office of Education is allowing districts and charter schools to use after-school programs to provide enrichment activities, including academic support, during the school day for small groups of students, Gothold wrote in a letter last week to the county health department. In a win for students with disabilities, Gothold also said there are no rules barring public schools from providing in-person therapy services or special education assessments to students one at a time — outdoors and by appointment. Students with disabilities have not been getting all their special education services during the pandemic, and several parents say the services they are getting virtually do not work so well for their kids.“In fact, educational agencies are required to provide services to the extent possible and are responsible for ensuring that the needs of these students are met,” Gothold wrote. “I cannot imagine that the state or county intends to deny or further delay children with disabilities access to the individual assessment and therapy services they need and are guaranteed by federal law.”Gothold said the urgency to serve students in need is too great to wait for more state guidance.“We cannot delay any further while waiting for clarifying language from the state; we must act now,” Gothold wrote. “It is a matter of equity for our most vulnerable students.”The state confirmed last week that schools can offer on-campus enrichment through after-school programs. The state has yet to address solutions for special education. Gothold is letter presents public schools with options to counteract inequities that have emerged during the pandemic. In the absence of in-person school, many parents with resources have been able to get in-person help for their kids more quickly than those without resources. They can pay tuition at private schools, which arebetter-positioned than large school districts to apply for school reopening waivers. They can pay for child care at licensed day cares. They also can pay for tutors to lead learning pods for their children. Meanwhile students with the highest needs — including homeless youth, foster youth, low-income students, children of essential workers and students with disabilities — are less likely to be able to take advantage of such opportunities. ASES, or the After School Education and Safety program, is the state-funded after-school program that could provide solutions for those students, along with 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which is a similar federally-funded program. ASES programs are run by organizations like the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club in partnership with schools, and they are funded based on the numbers of low-income students at a school. There were 309 ASES programs in San Diego County last school year that served 45,690 students, according to the San Diego County Office of Education. Some school districts are offering child care but are charging fees. ASES is one of the only options that are free for families, said Kim McDougal, executive director of the YMCA Child Care Resource Service.“That is a program we are really prio rit izing getting open ... because it serves the most high-need families,” McDougal said. Chula Vista Elementary, the fourth-largest district in the county, is one of the first districts to take advantage of this new permission from the county office. Last week the district announced it will offer free enrichment programs through ASES for 1,500 students as soon as Sept. 8. It also will offer fee-based spots for another 500 children. Priority for enrichment programs will go to the children of Chula Vista teachers, foster and homeless youth, and other children in need, the district said. The district had about 23,000 students last school year.“To be able to do distance learning, we need to be able to provide options for our neediest families, and those include essential workers,” district spokesman Anthony Millican said. “In our opinion this is an essential, protective service for our most vulnerable populations.”The county education office says that these after-school programs must keep students in fixed cohorts of 10 or fewer students. Students in third grade and higher will have to wear masks, while children in lower grades would be encouraged to wear masks, which is in line with state school guidance. Six-foot physical distancing also must be enforced. Some district officials are willing to bring students back to campus for ASES but not for regular school. Chula Vista Elementary has said it will not apply for a reopening waiver because the COVID-19 levels are too high in south San Diego County. ASES would involve bringing far fewer students back to campus, Millican said. And because ASES programs are run mostly by third-party staff, the district also does not have to bargain for the approval of teachers or other staff unions. Chula Vista is teachers and teacher unions in other districts have said they do not want to return to campus until their local zip codes reach low COVID-19 levels and until schools implement stringent safety measures — some of which districts say they may not be able to afford.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune
338,Democrats to lift ban on earmarks.,1.67,46.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/democrats-lift-ban-on-earmarks,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-16,16,"Congressional pork is back on the menu. Hello to everyone, except all my readers in Texas who apparently still do not have any power. Today we are talking about the return of earmarks. Plus, a reader question about what political stances will be deemed unacceptable 20 years from now. Earmarks. Also called member-directed spending, pork, pork-barrelling, bacon, fat, or fluff. Generally speaking,earmarksare funding or projects that get inserted into legislation at the request of a senator or representative, usually in an effort to earn that member of Congress is vote. Typically, they are not spending commitments added onto a bill, so much as changes in “how the pie is cut.”Earmarks often come in the form of special projects or funding that members of Congress direct back to their home districts. Hypothetically, if Democrats were one vote short of passing an immigration bill, and they wanted to get Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on board but she was hesitant, they might offer to include $20 million in an immigration bill for a hospital in the Bronx — that way she could go back to her district and say, “look what I got for us.”For decades, earmarks were a critical part of pushing through major legislation. But in the early 2000s, the public soured on earmarks, beginning to view them as open bribes and wasteful spending after they became closely tied to several scandals. Perhaps most infamous was the “Bridge to Nowhere,” a$223 million earmark that was drafted in 2005 to connect the Alaskan town of Ketchikan to its nearby island airport. The earmark was lifted and the bridge never happened. There was also Jack Abramoff, the infamous lobbyist who went to prison on fraud charges tied to earmarks being used as bribes. In 2007, Democrats tried to tamp down public criticism of earmarks by instituting reforms around them that required public disclosure of earmark requests. Then in 2011, when Republicans took over the House of Representatives, earmarks were banned. This had a big impact on legislating. As you can imagine, a potent tool to win over votes with what some call a “legislative bribe” is quite effective — and the result of not being able to use it was equally significant. In 2018, former President Trump actually suggested to members they reinstate earmarks as a way to clear the path for immigration reform. Now, though, Democrats are the ones who look poised to bring them back. With control of Congress, Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) are the respective chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations panels, which oversee rules like this. And in the coming weeks, they are reportedly planning to reinstate earmarks. Leahy and DeLauro say the new earmarks will be transparent, with disclosures about who requested them and what entity is getting the money. They also say members will not be able to request them for entities that they have financial ties to, or for for-profit institutions,according to Punchbowl News. They will be limited to state and local governments and nonprofits. The left is supportive of bringing earmarks back with tighter regulation and oversight. In The Atlantic,Annie Lowrey argued that earmarks were exactly what Democrats need to win over moderates like Senator Joe Manchin, asking “Why should not Democrats curry his favor with a few sky bridges and concert halls?”“At its peak, pork-barrel spending made up a tiny sliver of the government budget,” she wrote. “Earmarks were never that wasteful either. Most of the money went to reasonable projects — bridges, community centers, worker-training programs, schools. Those are the kinds of things the government exists to finance. Voters like the m, communities need the m, and members of Congress, with their intimate knowledge of their district, are often pretty good at knowing where to put them.“Since the demise of the earmark, both Republicans and Democrats have voiced their quiet lamentations about the lost opportunities to secure money for needed projects and to win over their colleagues’ votes,” she said. “Even former Speaker of the House John Boehner—who, as a matter of principle, never sought or got an earmark for his Ohio district—has bemoaned the loss, saying that a little pork would help ‘herd the cats’ on the Hill.”In a 2018 piece,then Vox reporter Jonathan Allen wrote that earmarks should come back with reforms that limit the amount of money and create more transparency, similar to what Democrats are proposing.“The problem was not in the earmarks, it was in the process that doled them out,” he said. “Until the very end — when Congress tried to save the system — the sponsors of earmarks were not publicly named. The money was distributed based on political calculation — to increase the power of a particular appropriator or help vulnerable party members win re-election — rather than being spread equitably or based on the merits of the projects competing for cash. There was no vetting to safeguard against lawmakers exchanging earmarks for campaign money.”The right is mostly opposed to earmarks. While some concede the practice could grease the wheels of Congress, there is a general belief that it is been proven to be ineffective and to breed corruption. In Roll Call,Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) wrote that“Pork was taken off the menu (temporarily, I guess) a decade ago after years of politicians literally pigging out on taxpayer dollars, earmarking millions for special interests and their own pet projects, like that infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska. Some even went to jail for exchanging bribes over congressional pork. But now Congress wants to bring the bacon back to the legislative process.“Defense earmarks are especially harmful because they take away critical research and development funds and direct them to things that have value to the military or will actively harm our troops,” she wrote. “The Navy was forced to buy luxury speedboats they did not need, so they turned around and gave them to a local college. Second, the Marines were forced to buy ‘combat’ T-shirts that would have burned their bodies if they were caught in a fire in Iraq or Afghanistan. You ca not make this stuff up. Instead of putting taxpayer money to good, important use — like researching and developing new technologies and weaponry — the largest government agency blew it.”In 2019,The Wall Street Journal editorial board tried to nip talk of reinstating earmarks in the bud.“Some Republicans have been nostalgic for better times that never existed,” the board said. “President Trump waxed last year about the ‘great friendliness’ when earmarks ruled. The claim is that earmarks make it easier to pass legislation, and this might be a worthwhile conservative trade if it meant Congress could pull together majorities for, say, something big like entitlement reform. Slices of pork would supposedly be the grease for difficult but essential reform that would shrink the burden of government. In our observation, the opposite is closer to the truth: Earmarks grease the skids for bigger government.“None of to day is gridlock would be overcome by earmarks,” the board wrote. “Democrats are not going to give President Trump a political victory in return for a local courthouse. A bike path in Portland would not have won the vote of Maine Senator Susan Collins to repeal ObamaCare.”The best argument for restoring earmarks is that Congress has been slowly abdicating its responsibility to the presidency. Consolidated, unchecked executive power is a great concern of mine — and it should be one of yours, too. From Bush to Obama to Trump and now Biden, presidential power is running more unchecked every term. Starting wars, spending tax dollars and signing executive orders in the place of legislating is the new norm on both sides. And, as has been well argued, earmarks could be a way to get Congress moving again. Members should have a vested interest in every spending bill, but the cold truth is they do not, and earmarks could bring that interest back. Still, color me skeptical. Last time we had earmarks, some members of Congress were trading those dollars for campaign contributions, lobbyists were begging for earmarked cash in exchange for campaign support, and entire firms were created to help facilitate these transactions. Worse yet, the re is a good argument they did not do much to help under served districts:numerous reports show that more influential members of Congress received the bulk of earmarked money while lesser-known members failed to “bring home the bacon.”As Linda Stamato noted in her NJ.com piece,which is worth reading, a practice openly described as “organized bribery” by the people advocating for it (as The New York Times editorial boarddid) is not exactly the way to reinstate public trust in a broken institution. She also pointed out that a Congressional Research Service report showed even the seemingly good ones, like money for hospitals, “did not reflect an analysis of hospital needs for states as a whole and they did not originate from requests from the Department of Health and Human Services. Other hospitals, having greater need, but lacking political heft, gained nothing at all.”It is also true that just as earmarks can grease the wheels of Congress, they can also bring it to a screeching halt. As it turns out, earmarks are not just used by a Congressional majority or leadership to sweeten the pot for a dissenting member — they are also used by dissenting members to hold the Congressional majority or leadership hostage. Take the example at the beginning of this newsletter and turn it on its head: what if AOC refused to support a bill she got that hospital? How is that greasing the wheels?Finally, I am skeptical of the efforts for reform. They sometimes seem in good faith on both sides, but we are ultimately relying on Congress to regulate itself. Even an all-out ban on earmarks actually produced different workaroundsfor porked-up spending — loopholes that should be closed too, rather than used as proof that you ca not stop members from finding ways to spend on pet projects. Even if the requests are public, the root of those requests — the true reasons — will remain behind closed doors and out of public view, and by the time we get answers the bills and earmarks will be out the door. Congress had its chance to earmark responsibly and blew it — that they ca not legislate now is no reason to reward them for the crimes of the past. I love this question, and imagine I could write a whole newsletter on it (I just might). For the sake of brevity, I will give three big ones that come to mind:Fighting for non-renewable energy jobs. Obviously, the progressive left has already moved past this, but something like f racking is still such a hot-button issue that Joe Biden would not take an oppositional stance on it while campaigning in Pennsylvania. The next generation is very, very left on climate change. And whether you think humans are a primary cause or not (I think we are), the fact that our environment is sick is more apparent every day. Even worse for the people fighting “climate-friendly” initiatives: none of this is going to change anytime soon. Even if the leftmost climate activists fighting to stop all emissions got what they wanted, the experts tell us it would take decades of focused action to undo much of the damage already done, meaning in 20 years, our progress still would not be obvious. But when water shortages start regularly popping up in America, along with things like the increasing frequency of extreme wildfires, droughts and floods, the political lexicon is going to shift even further. I also think acquiescence to China will be a political death knell. I am cautious not to sound like a fear-monger in China and aware I have written a lot about this recently; but plenty of trends point to their economic and global dominance as world superpower (a position the US currently occupies) in the next 20-30 years. I am imagining a world where China is influence on trade and its military strength give it a more powerful position than the US on the global stage, even amongst our European allies, and Democrats who have spent the last decade becoming intertwined in corporate and Chinese interests will look very, very bad in retrospect. Finally, the moderate position on crime and criminal justice today will look as bad as Biden is positions in the 1990s do now. I think moderate Democrats and many Republicans will seem unthinkably draconian in 20 years, while progressives, Libertarians and a big chunk of the anti-establishment “Trump base” will seem forward-thinking. My belief is the next great civil rights movement will be the rights of incarcerated people in the US I actually think we are already at the beginning stages of it. To the next generation of voters, a criminal justice system that seeks to punish someone rather than rehabilitate them will look absurd. The reality of more than two million people currently languishing in cages will be far more embedded in the public consciousness than it is now. The reality of someone being stuck in prison because they ca not pay for bail at a time of egregious income inequality will become reprehensible. Trump is embrace of some criminal justice reforms planted the seeds of this on the right, while civil Libertarians and progressives were already there. In 20 years, I think it will be a sliver of a minority position to support being “tough on crime,” and a lot of the people supporting that position now will not be looked on favorably in 20 years. The winter weather that to re through Texas this week has left nearly five million people without power. It is also set off a robust debate about how the largest energy producing state in the US can fail to make it through a week of below-freezing temperatures without rolling blackouts. The Wall Street Journal editorial board was quick to blame the outages on a move away from coal and nuclear power and an over-reliance on wind and solar. At the same time, articles like one in The Washington Post framed the unprecedented weather as a product of climate change. The diametrically opposed reactions illustrate the challenges clean energy will face in this political climate, and could be a look into the future as states across the US modernize their energy grids with renewables.

339,Undersheriff Indicted In CA Concealed Carry Bribery Scandal,5.17,40.83,https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2020/11/21/undersheriff-indicted-bribery-scandal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-21,18,"A top official in the Santa Clara County Sheriff is Office was indicted on Friday, becoming the fifth person to date to face criminal charges for allegedly participating in a pay-to-play scheme in which a number of individuals received their licenses to carry after first making sizeable donations to a committee set up to re-elect Sheriff Laurie Smith. Undersheriff Rick Sung is Smith is second-in-command in Santa Clara, and he now joins sheriff is Capt. James Jensen as the first two members of the department to face indictments in the probe. Jensen was first indicted several months ago, but a new charge was added along with Sung is charges by a grand jury empaneled to investigate the bribery accusations. The specific charges are not yet known, but Santa Clara County DA Jeff Rosen is promising to release more detail sat a press conference on Monday morning. To date, three people have pleaded guilty to participating in an alleged scheme in which prosecutors accuse members of an executive protection firm of conspiring with two attorneys and a gun manufacturer to make campaign donations to an independent expenditure fund in exchange for permits to carry concealed weapons. AS Solution CEO Christian West entered a plea a few months ago. Two of his managers, Martin Nielsen and Jack Stromgren, followed suit in October. The other defendants include attorneys Christopher Schumb and Harpaul Nahal and The Gun Co. owner Michael Nichols. Sheriff Laurie Smith—who, like other top cops in California, has the authority to issue the gun permits—has not been charged with a crime. When Smith testified before the grand jury, she invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to almost every question that was posed to her. So did Sung, with his attorney suggesting at the time that the sheriff and her second-in-command should not be considered suspects in the probe.“He asserted his rights based upon my advice, based upon my understanding of the case. It was the wisest course for him to take,” Chuck Smith said Friday. He also defended Sung against being implicated by association with the case.“He was subpoenaed as a witness. Not as a suspect, not as a target of the grand jury,” Chuck Smith said. “Based upon that, I do not believe he is culpable of any wrongdoing.”Well, clearly the prosecutor disagrees, and I am very interested to learn the specifics of the charges against Sung come Monday. In the meantime, Sheriff Smith is still clinging to office, despite the bribery scandal and calls for her to step down by many locals, including the editorial board of the, which demanded Smith is resignation back in September. I am in agreement with the paper that it is time for the sheriff to go, but that is not the only change that is needed. Until California removes the broad discretion that sheriffs have in approving or denying carry licenses based on a “justifiable need,” the opportunity for graft and corruption is going to remain a temptation for corruptible cops. By refusing to change the law, legislators in Sacramento are not just turning a blind eye to the growing bribery scandal in Santa Clara County; they are enabling sheriffs departments in other counties to engage in the same type of illicit activity at the expense of our trust in law enforcement the lawful exercise of our constitutional rights.",1,0,Bearing Arms

So far this year the county has received nearly $26 million less in sales tax than what was expected when officials adopted the 2020 budget, County Executive Ryan McMahon announced today. Today is payment, which represents much of the sales tax collected during June and July, was $22.3 million, 12.5% less than the $25.5 million payment for the same period in 2019. McMahon has been a vocal advocate of federal aid to help municipalities deal with the pandemic. He has warned of county layoffs if assistance does not come. Sales tax is the largest single source of revenue for the county.“Without direct relief from Washington, DC, Onondaga County will be forced to take drastic and draconian measures to fill this budget hole,” McMahon said today in a news release.

342,One District is COVID-19 Journey: A Year of Upheaval and Unexpected Insights,0.0,45.0,https://www.edweek.org/leadership/one-districts-covid-19-journey-a-year-of-upheaval-and-unexpected-insights/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,25,"Principal Dave Peters was judging a student talent show at Henry M Jackson High School in the Everett, Wash., school district on February 28 of last year when his cell phone rang. It was the district superintendent with news that a Jackson High student had tested positive for the the n-novel coronavirus. The district was alerting families that the building would close for 72 hours for deep cleaning and reopen for classes the following Tuesday. The auditorium soon started buzzing as parents got the notifications. That case—believed to be the first K-12 student in the country with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis—and the subsequent school shutdown made the threat of the coronavirus very real for many in this Seattle suburb. It proved a bellwether of the nationwide disruption of schooling that continues to this day. By March 12, the Everett leadership team had decided to close all of Everett is 29 schools for two weeks. Two weeks turned into six weeks, after Governor Jay Inslee shut down schools statewide, the n became the entire spring semester. It would be nearly a year before children set foot back in the district is buildings for classes—and even the n, the majority of the district is nearly 20,000 students remain in remote or hybrid instruction. With millions of students nationwide still locked out of in-person instruction and schools sweating over how to welcome them back safely, Everett is teachers, parents, students, and administrators are reflecting on what they have lost and what they have learned over the course of two interrupted school years. The coronavirus had been hovering around Everett since it first appeared in the country in January 2020: The first US COVID-19 patient was treated at Everett is Providence Regional Medical Center. About a week after the Jackson High case, an Everett elementary school shut down because of a positive COVID-19 case. Then on March 5, the Northshore School District, about 20 miles south, closed all of its schools to prepare for remote learning.“We are talking about the span of about a week and a half, when you are not sure what is happening and the n everyone is closing,” said Michael Takayoshi, who was in his first year as principal at Everett is Cascade High School.“It was so fast that you did not have time to even contextualize or come to terms with it.”Jen Hirman and her husband, Joe, had been discussing whether to pull their two children out of school as the new virus marched across the globe. They had already equipped Elizabeth, an 11th grader at Jackson High, and Amanda, a 7th grader at Heatherwood Middle School, with hand sanitize rs and advised them not to feel guilty about avoiding people who were displaying flu-like symptoms.“All of a sudden you see Jackson High on the news,” Jen Hirman said. “That is our high school principal, that is our superintendent on CNN … For us, it was our school and our community. And it definitely brought it home. It brought it home very clearly—that it is here, and it is real.”Heather Paddock, the principal of James Monroe Elementary School, still gets emotional thinking about that last day of in-person schooling last March, when her staff prepared take-home packets for students, telling them they’d see them in a few weeks. She stood at the bottom of the stairs bidding them goodbye.“I definitely felt uncertain,” she said. “No one had a crystal ball at the ready.”Jared Kink, the president of the Everett Education Association, who taught math and social studies in the district before taking over the union job, remembers seeing teachers in tears in their cars after packing up for the day.“They had spent the day saying goodbye to their kids; they had gathered everything in their classrooms,” Kink said. “They had held it together for the kids to make sure they were OK ... and the n when the kids left, it all collapsed on them. ... That is a memory that will stick in my mind for a really long time.”“There was high anxiety, high sense of urgency, lots of unknowns, and quite a bit of fear.”In some ways, Everett was more prepared than most districts for the switch to fully online instruction; the district had been planning for years to become a full 1-to-1 computing district in which every student had access to a digital learning device. Teachers had been trained on educational platforms, and high school students and those at one middle school were already taking home their district-issued Chromebooks. The district quickly sent out resources for parents to help them navigate online learning. Still, it took a while for everyone to get the hang of things as the district transitioned to a new way of schooling.“The teachers would be so happy when you did the work,” said Amanda Hirman. “You turned it in? You get an A.’”One day felt like a snow day, two weeks were manageable, but six weeks started to veer into uncharted territory. Elizabeth Hirman initially thought two weeks off from school would be a good break, like a mini-vacation. At six weeks, she started to think: “We ca not learn.”It is gotten better, but she still misses things like hands-on labs in her chemistry class, and she is worried about having to take AP exams online instead of in-person like the SATs. The initial lack of structure to the school day left Joe Hirman a little disappointed, though he gives the district a lot of credit for listening to feedback and making improvements for the new school year.“They now have a system down, and it is much improved,” he said. “But this is not how I would hope for my daughters to be educated.”Lara Fullner-Grennan, who teaches 6th grade English/ language arts at Gateway Middle School, thinks remote learning has gone better than expected.“I have almost all of my kids showing up on Zoom every, single day,” she said. “We celebrate getting to see each other and getting to hear each other is voices—even for a short amount of time.”But she is clear that she would prefer to be in the classroom with her students.“As fun as some of these activities are … [remote learning] is nothing like in-person learning,” Fullner-Grennan said. “In-person learning is still more exciting and more rewarding—and I also think more effective.”Fullner-Grennan also spends her time differently as she prepares for remote classes. She now has to think about things like: Would a link work? Is this the most accessible way to present information to students? Is this lesson engaging? How video-friendly is this Google Slide?Those are questions she did not have to answer when students were right in front of her and she could peer over their shoulders, see a mistake or misunderstanding, and address it in real time.“The biggest thing with remote learning is the importance of celebrating small successes,” Fullner-Grennan said. “I do not want to dwell too much on the negative part of it, because I know this is not going to be forever.”At Cascade High, Principal Takayoshi was just a few months into his first year as the building leader when everything changed. The most challenging aspect of running a school during a pandemic is the unpredictability of it all, he said. School leaders live by routines: bell schedules, testing periods, the normal flow of the school day and school year.“One of the elements of being an administrator is being able to, in some ways, conceptualize the next month ... or the next couple of months,” Takayoshi said. “When you remove that degree of predictability from your day, you are kind of operating in the moment—always.”It helped that Takayoshi had been an administrator in the building for five years before the pandemic. But the re is a lot that he misses: For example, he still wishes he could have had a traditional graduation for students last year, instead of the drive-through option that was offered at the end of last spring. This time period has showed that the way that school is traditionally structured has not worked for many children, he said.“Part of the work we should do as an industry moving forward is, how can we rethink public education so that it does work for more people than it does now,” Takayoshi said. Everett educators envision plenty of permanent changes as a result of the past year is experience. Superintendent Ian B Saltzman sees a continuing place for the remote learning option because some students thrived in that environment. The superintendent also thinks schools must rethink how they use afternoon hours, particularly with parents and care givers in mind. That could mean ideas like keeping the school libraries open until 7 p.m. or offering tutoring and assistance such as SAT prep during that window. Interactions with parents will also change. The switch to remote has made it easier for teachers to connect with families and for families to participate in parent-teacher conferences and in activities that their children are involved in. Teachers like Fullner-Grennan and Mark Dersom, a 4th-grade teacher at Monroe Elementary, see the benefits of continuing to use tools they took up during the pandemic, such as quick video feedback for students, and thinking about the user-experience when they return to their buildings. Professional development will evolve, too, said Jo Anne Buiteweg, the district is director of Learning and Information Technology Services. In districts like Everett, where getting from one school to the central office can eat into the day, teachers can log into professional development sessions without leaving their buildings or missing out on valuable learning opportunities. Fullner-Grennan, the 6th grade English/language arts teacher, is among those who want to see time built into the schedule to allow students to engage in directed independent work, meet with teachers for office hours, or finish incomplete assignments.“It is become obvious to me how much kids really need and have come to rely on this extra gift of time,” Fullner-Grennan said. “That is not something that is available when it is done as homework.”Everett started welcoming back students for hybrid learning in January, starting with students with disabilities. At this point, only K-3 students and those with special needs are back, in hybrid. Five-days-a-week in-person learning for everyone is still some ways off, though Washington is governor has been urging districts to reopen for in-person schooling, with masks and proper distancing and while providing parents the option of continuing with remote learning. (Educators were just moved up on the priority list on the state is vaccination schedule.)Saltzman described the feeling of having children back in the buildings as “Christmas all over again.”“To have them back in slowly—it is been refreshing and energizing,” Saltzman said. But Takayoshi, the Cascade High principal, is still waiting for a normal school year—whatever that is. It is still unclear when his students will return to the building part-time for hybrid learning. The pandemic “is probably going to change our school for years,” he said. “And who knows what that would look like next year. Certainly, next year is going to look different from this year and will look different from any other school year.”",2,1,Education Week
343,"Campaign Spending at Trump Properties Down, but Not Out",0.0,44.0,https://www.propublica.org/article/campaign-spending-at-trump-properties-down-but-not-out,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-20,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they are published. The number of federal political committees that have spent money in the first half of 2021 at Trump Organization properties has dropped dramatically from the same period two years ago, Federal Election Commission filings show. Those continuing to spend: a smaller circle of loyal supporters of former President Donald Trump and candidates jockeying for his favor in contested Republican primaries. During the first six months of 2021,27 federal committees have reported spending $348,000 at Trump Organization properties, with the Republican National Committee accounting for more than half the total. That is a steep decline from the177committees that did so during the 2019-2020 election cycle or the 78 committees that spent more than $1.6 million at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump International Hotel in Washington and other company sites in the first half of 2019, filings show. Of course, that spending came in the run-up to a presidential election in which Trump was the incumbent. The biggest spenders in 2019 were the RNC and Trump is own political committees raising money to support his campaign. While the RNC is the top spender so far in 2021, many of the other PACs that used Trump properties as venues for fundraising events and other activities appear to have stopped their spending. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the fundraising arm of House Republicans, has not reported spending any money at Trump properties through May of this year afters pending $32,532during the previous election cycle. (National party committees will file reports covering activity in June on July 20, which may show some spending at Trump is facilities.)Those that have spent money at Trump properties this year represent some of the former president is most fervent loyalists, including Reps. Mo Brooksof Alabama, who is running for an open Senate seat, andRonny Jacksonof Texas, who previously was the White House physician. Overall, 13 of the 23 committees spending this year are connected to current members of the House or Senate.“Republican candidates are in a delicate moment, I think, because of uncertainty surrounding Trump is future power,” said Abby Wood, a professor of law, political science and public policy at the University of Southern California, in an email. “Trump is power in the next election is much less certain than it was from the vantage point of folks spending money (and enriching him) at his properties in 2019.”The drop in political spending comes at a precarious time for the Trump Organization, which in early July was hit with 10 felony charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., as well as additional charges against Allen Weisselberg, the organization is chief financial officer. Both Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty to the charges, but the impact of the investigation and the fallout of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol appear to have damaged the company is business prospects. The Washington Post described the company as at its “lowest point in decades.”The other spenders include congressional candidates advertising their ties to Trump, such asLynda Blanchard, who is one of Brooks’ opponents for the GOP nomination in the Alabama Senate race, andJosh Mandel, who is running for an open Senate seat in Ohio. Brooks, Blanchard and Mandel have each paid to use Mar-a-Lago, Trump is property in Palm Beach, Florida, while Jackson paid for an event at the Trump hotel in Washington.“It is my intention to do fund raisers at Mar-a-Lago as often as I can, so long as they help generate positive cash flow for my Senate campaign for America First policies,” Brooks said in a statement. “I personally thank President Trump for allowing me to use Mar-a-Lago and hope he will continue to be so generous in the future.”The campaigns of Blanchard, Jackson and Mandel, along with the RNC and the Trump Organization, did not respond to requests for comment. The RNC has spent more money for events at other locations this year, including $529,000 for a donor event at the Four Seasons Resort in Palm Beach in April. Read MoreMar-a-Lago, a private club that also doubles as the former president is residence, has been the leading recipient of federal political committee spending among Trump properties, bringing in at least $283,000 this year, much of it for hosting an RNC donor retreat in May In addition to getting the venue and Florida weather, politicians holding events at the club stand a good chance of having Trump make an appearance. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, and the BLT Prime restaurant located the re, have seen a significant drop-off in political spending compared to the first half of 2019. Two years ago, the DC hotel and restaurant brought in more than $518,000, according to FEC records. This year, without Trump in the White House nearby, the total is less than $15,000.“Given Trump is no longer president and there is less need to curry favor with him, congressional incumbents and party committees may choose less expensive venues,” said Paul Herrnson, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut.",2,2,ProPublica
344,Hopes and Doubts in Beijing,-3.33,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-11-13/hopes-and-doubts-beijing,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,17,"Never before has Beijing paid such close attention to the outcome of a US presidential election. Chinese leaders recognize that competition will define US-Chinese relations no matter who occupies the White House. But they also believe that former Vice President Joe Biden is triumph over President Donald Trump provides an opportunity to halt—or at the very least slow—the two countries’ alarming march to confrontation. Relations have deteriorated at an astonishing rate during Trump is presidency. The trade war has been the most conspicuous example of friction, but larger strategic tensions have also heightened the risk of conflict. The Trump administration is barrage of blame, overtly racist remarks, policies aimed at decoupling, and rhetoric advocating regime change has jolted many officials in the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Unsurprisingly, the prevailing mood on Chinese social media in the wake of the US election is one of relief and optimism, although views of Trump among the general public are by no means uniform. A popular Internet mem e captured the public is enthusiasm for a Biden presidency, rechristening Beijing is Forbidden City as the “For-Biden City.”But moods of optimism can turn quickly. Only four years ago, China received the news of Trump is election with similar enthusiasm. Many Chinese leaders viewed Trump as a businessman with whom they could get things done. That proved to be wishful thinking. China is foreign policy establishment is wary but cautiously optimistic about better relations with a Biden administration. Still, many of the conditions that shaped Trump is China policy still exist, and resetting relations between the world is greatest powers will not be easy. During US presidential elections, Chinese leaders have historically avoided suggesting any preference for a particular candidate. The long-standingofficial line is that “China never interferes in the internal affairs of the USs.” But China is leadership was generally pessimistic about the prospects for improving relations with the USs as long as Trump was at the helm. Although some Chinese decision-makers believed the chaos and bluster of another Trump term would strengthen China, they have also witnessed how the US president is unpredictable foreign policy pushes both countries closer and closer to conflict. The Trump administration is actions toward Taiwan have been of particular concern to the Chinese. With the passage in the US Congress of the Taiwan Travel Act of 2018 and the 2019 Taipei Act—bills that have strengthened US-Taiwanese relations and were signed into law by Trump—Beijing fears that Washington is edging toward recognizing Taiwan as an independent country. The administration is actions and rhetoric on this front have hardened antipathy toward Trump within the CCP leadership and bolstered those Chinese officials eager to take an aggressive approach toward the USs. Beijing believes the Trump administration has sought to defeat China in much the same way that the USs defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War. Some Trump officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the senior trade adviser Peter Navarro, have even called for regime change in China. As a result, Chinese President Xi Jinping and the CCP leadership were under no illusions about the possibility of tranquil, harmonious coexistence with a second Trump administration. During an October event in Beijing to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, Xi urged China is military to prepare for potential conflict with the USs. In his words, China will “use war to prevent war.”Chinese leaders know that US hostility toward China is not confined to the Trump administration. Both Republicans and Democrats have directed harsh criticism at Beijing and advocated decoupling US supply chains from China. At the same time, many Chinese officials do not believe there is an anti-China consensus in Washington. One noteworthy episode during the vice-presidential debate—when neither Vice President Mike Pence nor California Senator Kamala Harris could give a clear answer about whether the USs sees China as a competitor, a rival, or an enemy—garnered the attention of opinion makers in Beijing. It seemed to underscore the lack of a strategic framework for US-Chinese relations in Washington. Biden has also routinely characterized Trump is China policy as a failure, suggesting to Chinese officials that the incoming administration will not adopt all of Trump is confrontational positions, including the goal of decoupling. Analysts within the Chinese foreign policy establishment are pleased to see that theBiden foreign policy team features many seasoned professionals with reputations for sensible diplomacy. It has been widely observed in both China and the USs that Biden and Xi maintained a long and friendly working relationship during their overlapping tenures as vice presidents of their respective countries. According to Daniel Russel, a former senior official in President Barack Obama is National Security Council, Biden and Ximetat least eight times and spent roughly 25 hours together in one-on-one meetings within a span of 18 months in 2011 and 2012. Biden spoke harshly about Xi and the CCP during the presidential debates, but Chinese officials understood those remarks as rhetoric for domestic consumption, not a foreshadowing of Biden is foreign policy. More broadly, China is US watchers have come to realize that their long-standing view dating back to the era of President Richard Nixon of Republicans as friendlier and easier to work with than Democrats no longer holds true. Chinese researchers point out that all 15 congressional members of the China Task Force—a group known for its hawkish approach toward Beijing—are Republicans; that 229 Democrats in the House of Representativesvoted in favor of a September congressional resolution condemning all forms of anti-Chinese discrimination, but only 14 Republicans supported the resolution (and 164 opposed it); and that numerous US public opinion surveys showRepublicans to be far more hostile to China than Democrats. But even if Beijing is more predisposed to work with a Democratic US administration, a significant reset of the bilateral relationship will be tricky. Chinese leaders tend to attribute the deterioration in US-Chinese relations entirely to the Trump administration is desire to contain China is rise. There is no recognition in Beijing of legitimate US concerns regarding unfair Chinese economic and technological practices and its aggressive behavior in the Asia-Pacific region. On the US side, the criticism of the CCP by Republicans in the Trump administration and in Congress—as well as the general public is hostility to China—poses a major barrier to the new administration is attempts at rapprochement. The likelihood of a Republican-controlled Senate after the election makes reversing course still more difficult. Chinese officials understand that the serious political divide exposed by the election result—with the USs highly polarized—will force Biden to assuage domestic tensions and could leave him without the political capital to fully transform US China policy. Moreover, Chinese leaders fear that in an effort to bridge partisan divisions, the Biden administration may see an aggressive China policy as a means of finding common ground with Republicans. If so, confrontation between the two countries could continue, or even accelerate, instead of giving way to a more stable balance between cooperation and competition. The Biden administration will surely continue to articulate concerns about Chinese human rights abuses in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Biden could even bring greater force to these criticisms, wedding them to the wider moral mission of defending human rights and searching for racial justice at home. He will likely be more effective than Trump was at harnessing American soft power in US outreach to the Chinese people. Of course, it is highly doubtful that Beijing would meet the full demands of the USs and the international community on these matters; Chinese authorities view unrest in its peripheral regions as a threat to their country is national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and domestic stability. As a result, Beijing is conduct in these restive areas is not up for negotiation. Xi and Biden in Beijing, December 2013Lintao Zhang / ReutersThe Chinese leadership is weighing all these possible trajectories of a Biden China policy and seems to be hedging its bets on the incoming administration. On the one hand, Beijing will be eager to reengage with the USs in multiple areas. During Obama is eight-year tenure, there were as many as 105 government-sponsored bilateral dialogues on subjects including women is leadership, early childhood education, space exploration, cybercrime, and climate change. The Trump administration condensed those channels to four during the first two years of the administration and subsequently discontinued them entirely. In line with Biden is foreign policy agenda, China will be particularly interested in working collaboratively on issues of global public health (especially the shared battle against COVID-19), climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, antiterrorism, cybersecurity, and global economic and financial stability. This past summer, Yang Jiechi, one of China is top diplomats,outlinedthese subjects as areas for close US-Chinese coordination and cooperation. In addition, he saw the possibility of cooperation with the USs in addressing geopolitical challenges in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East. At the same time, however, Beijing believes that China is economic recovery, its internal handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its relative sociopolitical stability, and its growing international clout give it added leverage in the bilateral relationship. The Chinese leadership may accommodate US demands in certain areas, but it will likely remain firm and uncompromising on anything touching on China is self-declared core interests of its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan and the maintenance of CCP rule. Unquestionably, tensions with China will persist as the Biden administration navigates the areas where it will cooperate and where it will compete with Beijing. But some influential Chinese scholars see in Biden is victory the potential for a more productive relationship. Shi Yinhong, a professor of American studies at Renmin University and an adviser to the State Council (the top government organ),recently argued that Biden would provide stability and predictability in US policy toward China. In Shi is view, however, the window of opportunity to stop “tit for tat” escalation with the Biden administration will be brief. The growing influence of China on the world stage and the volatile domestic political environment in the USs will make it harder to patch up the bilateral relationship. Both Beijing and Washington, Shi insists, should not miss the precious opportunity available in the coming months to reexamine past missteps and to reset relations. Shi departs somewhat from the party line in his desire for overcoming the zero-sum mindset, reflecting the goodwill many public intellectuals and Chinese citizens have for the USs—and for the incoming Biden administration in particular. Time will tell how such views might inform the decisions of China is leadership.",2,2,Foreign Affairs

The warning comes as Brussels publishes its drafts of two major new pieces of tech regulation. A Digital Markets Act will aim to tackle unfair competition in the sector, and a Digital Services Act will force tech companies to take more responsibility for illegal behavior on their platforms. The long-awaited regulations are the first significant overhaul of the EU is approach to the Internet for two decades. After the European Commission publishes its proposals on Tuesday, they will be voted on by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and there is no timetable yet for when they will come into force. Both of the regulations carry huge fines for bad behavior. Big Tech companies that deliberately break new competition rules will be liable for fines of up to 10 percent of their global revenues. Big Tech companies that do not police their platforms will be liable for fines of up to 6 percent of their global revenues. But the draft of the Digital Markets Act also states that Big Tech companies that are fined three times within five years will be labeled as repeat offenders, and the EU will move to structurally separate their businesses, according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans. If an investigation shows systematic bad behavior that further strengthens a company is position, the EU may impose “any behavioral or structural remedies which are proportionate to the infringement committed and necessary to ensure compliance,” a draft of the regulation said. The new rules, if they pass into law in their current form, would represent one of the most stringent sets of regulations on Big Tech in the world. They are also an acknowledgment that existing competition law is inadequate and too slow-moving in the digital age and has failed to curb the rapid ascent and huge market power of the Silicon Valley giants. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are also facing growing hostility in Europe for paying low levels of local tax, invading privacy, and crushing their rivals. Thierry Breton, the EU is commissioner for the internal market who is co-leading the overhaul of the digital rules, told the Financial Times in September: “There is a feeling from end users of these platforms that they are too big to care.”Margrethe Vestager, the EU is executive vice-president in charge of competition and digital policy, also recently expressed her frustration of how antitrust probes have not tamed Big Tech.“It is painful that in digital markets the harm that can be done in that marketplace can happen very fast but the recovery of that marketplace can be very, very difficult,” she recently told the Financial Times. As it publishes its draft regulations, the EU will also set out how it aims to assess which companies are “gatekeepers” that dictate the rules of the marketplace. The criteria will include a company is global turnover over the past three years, its number of users, and its market capitalization over the past year. EU officials said a company is market cap was an important metric since it determined a company is ability to raise money quickly to acquire potential rivals. However, Brussels’ ambition to take on Big Tech faces at least two years or more of political wrangling and debates in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Paul Tang, a Dutch socialist MEP who will be taking active part in the discussion of the new rules next year, said: “The commission is plans are good, but not good enough to curb the monopoly power of tech giants.“Instead, the commission should take direct aim and at least dismantle the perverse business model of these tech giants: monetizing personal data via advertising.”Others in the European Parliament expect Big Tech will try to water down the new rules. Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, another European lawmaker who has played a prominent role in competition policy discussions, said: “I expect platforms to try to divide the EP around fake and simple debates such as being pro versus anti freedom of speech or pro and versus anti innovation.”",2,2,ARS Technica

But in to day is world, the press and the Democrats use it as a political football. They blame President Trump instead of the ones who are really culpable: the Chinese Communist government.

He explained to American Thinker, ""Last May China defined their role, declaring a people is war on the US If China viewed America as an enemy the n they should be viewed as an enemy.""But the Democrats and mass media do not look on China as the enemy. Rather, they consider President Donald Trump the enemy. Just consider Andrew Yang, who recently said Trump is a racist for referring to the ""Chinese Flu."" Nancy Pelosi said of the president that he is about ""delay, denial, death."" They ignore what Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx have said: ""[t]he first and only time that Dr. [Deborah] Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president to actually have a shutdown in the sense of strong mitigation, we discussed it. Obviously, there would be concerns by some, and in fact, that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation. The next, second time that I went with Dr. Birx to the president and said 15 days are not enough, we need to go 30 days, he also listened.""Chang does not think the president should be blamed: ""I have been looking at this for quite some time and it took me by surprise. He got the first and most important decision correct: the travel restrictions on China. Maybe he should have put the travel restrictions on Europe sooner, but overall, he has done a lot right. Looking from a partisan lens, the Democratic Party has nothing to boast about. Clearly, President Trump was blamed because he is blamed for everything.""Interestingly, some Americans accuse President Trump of ignoring the doctors and scientists. Maybe they should refer back to what was said. Dr. Deborah Birxsaidduring one of the press conferences that any lack of preparation from US officials in responding to the coronavirus pandemic was due to the fact that ""we were missing a significant amount of the data"" from China.

The world has not seen this dangerous of a virus since the Spanish flu of 1917. But in to day is world, the press and the Democrats use it as a political football. They blame President Trump instead of the ones who are really culpable: the Chinese Communist government. American Thinker interviewed experts on China to get their opinions on who is really to blame. In looking at the Chinese government over the years, should Americans think of them as friendly, adversaries, enemies, or ""frenemies""? Gordan Chang (@GordonGChang), an expert on Chinese affairs, is also a columnist, lawyer, and author of. He explained to American Thinker, ""Last May China defined their role, declaring a people is war on the US If China viewed America as an enemy the n they should be viewed as an enemy.""But the Democrats and mass media do not look on China as the enemy. Rather, they consider President Donald Trump the enemy. Just consider Andrew Yang, who recently said Trump is a racist for referring to the ""Chinese Flu."" Nancy Pelosi said of the president that he is about ""delay, denial, death."" They ignore what Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx have said: ""[t]he first and only time that Dr. [Deborah] Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president to actually have a shutdown in the sense of strong mitigation, we discussed it. Obviously, there would be concerns by some, and in fact, that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation. The next, second time that I went with Dr. Birx to the president and said 15 days are not enough, we need to go 30 days, he also listened.""Chang does not think the president should be blamed: ""I have been looking at this for quite some time and it took me by surprise. He got the first and most important decision correct: the travel restrictions on China. Maybe he should have put the travel restrictions on Europe sooner, but overall, he has done a lot right. Looking from a partisan lens, the Democratic Party has nothing to boast about. Clearly, President Trump was blamed because he is blamed for everything.""Interestingly, some Americans accuse President Trump of ignoring the doctors and scientists. Maybe they should refer back to what was said. Dr. Deborah Birxsaidduring one of the press conferences that any lack of preparation from US officials in responding to the coronavirus pandemic was due to the fact that ""we were missing a significant amount of the data"" from China.

It goes both ways though. The Trump campaign has been heavily focused on attacking Biden is decision to pick Harris even though it is clear they have no idea how to go after her besides drumming up the usual racist nonsense, with a number of em ails and online ads focusing on standing with Mike Pence. A new campaign commercial produced by a group not affiliated with either campaign, Don Winslow Films, might make Pence wish that he stayed quiet in this fight – or at least that Trump would stop hailing him as a great running mate, amidst media speculation that Trump was ready to switch him out for another candidate. The video wastes no time digging into both Mike and Karen Pence is sordid history when it comes to LGBT rights in the USs – going all the way back to when Pence denounced the 1996 Republican convention for allowing HIV-positive speakers, to his support of gay conversion therapy as governor of Indiana, and his wife Karen is job at a private school that requires employees to sign a pledge against homosexuality. In addition to being unflattering for Pence, the commercial serves as a reminder that the progress made in this movement has only happened recently, against staunch opposition – dealing with the likes of bigots such as the Pences. A second term of this administration would only make their lives even harder. As fun as it will be to see Kamala Harris stomp all over Pence and all the backwards ideals he stands for, we must remember that he is still a dangerous man in a dangerous position, and this is why we need to vote him out with Donald Trump on November 3.

348,Peters on James' refusal to concede: 'It is pathetic. They lost',-8.67,46.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/05/senator-peters-james-election-complaints-its-pathetic-they-lost/6173116002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,25,"— Michigan Democratic US Senator Gary Peters officially declared victory Thursday and called on his Republican opponent to accept defeat, while John James refused to concede and called for investigation into what his campaign is calling cheating in the balloting process. In a news conference with his family and campaign staff at his favorite cider mill, Peters laughed heartily when told that the James campaign said it was cheated out of an election win amid allegations of voter fraud. An attorney representing James said there are irregularities that called into the question the integrity of the election during a Thursday meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers.“It is sad and it is pathetic. They lost,” Peters said to reporters at the Goodison Cider Mill. “It is very clear. Just count the votes. I understand Mr. James has been running for four years, he is lost twice now. I understand that does not sit well with him.”But Peters said James, the 39-year-old Army veteran and businessman, should not be a sore loser. He said he had not heard from James in a campaign Peters decried as filled with smear attacks on his record.“This is where you see someone is character,” the senator added. “And they come up and realize that they need to accept the vote of the people of the state of Michigan. I would hope that this nonsense could go away.”About three hours after Peters' remarks, James said in a statement that ""while Senator Peters is currently ahead, I have deep concerns that millions of Michiganders may have been disenfranchised by a dishonest few who cheat.""He called for an investigation so voters are confident the election ""was fair and honest.""""When this process is complete, I will of course accept the results and the will of the people,"" James added, ""but at this time there is enough credible evidence to warrant an investigation to ensure that elections were conducted in a transparent, legal and fair manner. Those who object likely have something to hide.""At a Thursday meeting of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, James' attorney Charlie Spies said he had""very serious concerns""about the way the election was administered in the Democratic-dominated county, but he did not provide specific evidence to back up his comments. Spies made a variety of claims about problems in the county, saying Republican poll watchers had faced intimidation and were not able to ""meaningfully participate"" in monitoring the vote count.""We have seen and we have witnesses that saw the mysterious appearance of ballots at the TCF Center that ca not be accounted for,"" Spies said. But it would be normal for legal votes to show up in batches at the center, where Detroit is absentee ballots are tallied. The claims by Spies came as election workers in Michigan neared a final unofficial tally of votes across the state. The Wayne County board met Thursday morning to approve the beginning of the election is canvass — the process of examining and confirming ballot and voter totals. In Michigan, counties must complete their canvass on November 17 and the n forward results to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Later Thursday, Spies and two other attorneys sent a letter to Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett asking her to preserve absentee ballots, footage from all ballot drop box locations and personnel records, among other documents.""It has come to our attention that due to apparent widespread fraud and irregularities, the absent voter ballots counted in Wayne County may be in question,"" the attorneys wrote on behalf of the James campaign. ""The vote counts in Wayne County appear to be irregular, if not fraudulent.""This letter places you on notice to preserve and not destroy any evidence related to the absent voter process in Wayne County.""The attorneys said they had documented ""hundreds of reports of irregularities that occurred during the processing"" of Wayne County absentee ballots. They listed challenger intimidation, lack of access, insecure ballots, improper processing, failure to verify signatures, mismatched envelopes and ballots, and ballot back-dating. Peters called the lawsuits filed by President Donald Trump in Michigan and elsewhere to stop the counting of votes “frivolous.”“I would just say to Mr. James and their campaign: Accept the opinion and the votes of the people of the state of Michigan,” Peter said. “That is the right thing to do.”Peter, D-Bloomfield Township, said he expected a close race since Michigan is a battleground state where Trump won four years ago. But that will not stop him from doing his job and “to be able to work in a bipartisan way to solve the tough problems that we face,"" the senator said. Since the election is over, Peters said he hopes the country can get past hyper-partisanship and division. No matter who voted for him or not, the senator said he would continue to work hard for all of Michigan.“We have to come together, particularly right now when we are in the middle of this pandemic. This is a significant crisis,” Peters said. “Every time we come together as a country, every time we come together as Michiganders..., we can get through anything.“Peters said when he returns to Washington next week, he will push Senate Republicans to pass a COVID-19 relief package. In September and October, Senate Democrats filibustered or blocked a vote on a $300 billion Senate GOP COVID-19 relief package that Democrats said was inadequate as they held out for a vote on the Democratic House is $2.2 trillion package.“We have to do that,” he said. When Biden is officially declared president, Peters said he is looking forward to working with the incoming Democratic administration on the coronavirus pandemic and “put together the comprehensive national strategy that we should have had right from the beginning.”",2,2,Detroit News

The growing list means that travelers from much of the country are restricted upon entry into Connecticut. The decision also raises new questions about the ability of sports teams to travel to and from Connecticut. As states across the country see spikes in COVID-19 cases, the number of states on the list has grown larger. Because of this, Connecticut is advisory list is “a fast-moving target,” Governor Ned Lamont said Tuesday.“Unfortunately it is not going down, it is going up,” Lamont said. “I worry.”Thestate is web site says the 14-day self-quarantine “is the best option to prevent spread of disease,” but those who cannot quarantine can also enter the state by testing negative for coronavirus within 72 hours before they cross the state line. The self-quarantine measure applies to anyone traveling into Connecticut, whether they are entering the state by car, train or plane.“You go to a hot spot, you come back to this state, you either have a test that shows you tested negative or you must quarantine for 14 days,” Governor Ned Lamont said at a Monday news conference when he announced the state would track all arrivals from states on its advisory list. Although the advisory list has been in place since late June, Lamont is Monday announcement outlined new guidelines that also require travelers to fill out an online form in order to enter the state. That form requires travelers to self-certify that they are following the self-quarantine guidelines. Travelers who refuse to fill out the questionnaire may face a fine of up to $1,000. Lamont said Monday that the state has “no plans” to begin issuing fines yet. The state “wanted to make sure that people knew how seriously we are taking the quarantine,” Lamont said Tuesday. The governor formalized the new guidelines i nan executive order, which the state released late Tuesday evening. The new guidelines take effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, meaning that travelers entering the state after the n will be required to fill out the health questionnaire and follow the self-quarantine protocol. Thequestionnairewas also posted online late Tuesday evening. With well over half the states in the US now on Connecticut is advisory list, the state is increasingly closing itself off from visitors — and, potentially, from danger. The travel advisory aims to reduce COVID-19 spread from hot spot states, defined as places with a new daily positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or a 10% or higher positivity rate over a 7-day period. In addition to the 22 states previously on the list, Connecticut has now added Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Virginia and Washington state. Minnesota, which was on the list as of Monday, has now been removed. The list also includes Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Connecticut has coordinated its travel advisory with neighboring states New York and New Jersey, which also expanded their lists and stepped up enforcement in recent days. Lamont said the specter of a fine, and the travel advisory itself, is meant to safeguard the progress that Connecticut has made in fighting back the coronavirus.“The numbers are all trending, blessedly, in the right direction, still,” he said Monday. The new rules are “one more way we can remind people we are taking this seriously.”The full travel advisory li stand the health questionnaire can be found on the state is website.

350,COVID trips: How to easily plan international travel right now,0.0,45.67,https://fortune.com/2021/07/24/covid-delta-variant-travel-planning-tips-advice-safety/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Travel is back and more complicated (and satisfying) than ever. With many otherworldly adventures returning to our fingertips, eager travelers are facing the bliss of getting away coupled with the complex web of regulations, paperwork, canceled flights, and the ebb and flow ofCOVID-19 variants. Some are opting out of travel until it settles. Others are using tour companies to ease worries and soothe complications presenting the mselves while planning. Rather than navigating the confusion on your own, these bespoke specialists are taking matters into their own hands.“It is more complicated than ever for us. We are monitoring things closely and notifying our clients when necessary, trying to take the burden away from our clients and onto ourselves,” says Aeneas O’Hara, founder of Scotland-basedAway From the Ordinary(AFTO). His upbringings in the country and close relationships with hotels, restaurants, and tour guides help manage safe, streamlined itineraries. “We are absorbing as much of the logistics and organizational work as possible for people. Some of our clients lead very busy lives, so if they just turn up in Scotland with their passport and their suitcase with zero preparation, they will have an amazing time as we will take care of everything for them.”When the pandemic hit,AFTO is bookings seized completely, as did tours withAfrica Adventure Consultants(AAC) whose 2020 safari expeditions were slated to have its best year since the company started two decades ago. Because of COVID-19, however, 90% of its booked clients postponed their trips and 10% canceled entirely. As globetrotters begin to wander to far-off destinations again, the strain of COVID is Delta variant is causing unpredictable planning, especially inhigh-risk regions such as South America and Africa, where vaccines are scarce and some borders remain closed. Tour companies work tediously with trusted vendors to ensure those traveling can still have a successful and safe experience. Kent Redding, president and co-founder of AAC, says a large percentage of his company is time is spent monitoring regulations from where clients are coming from and going. “We have a couple different tracking spreadsheets for each country and what the regulations are, which by the way, keep changing.” In addition to visas, which are standard when visiting many African destinations, documentation varies for each country, such as required health surveillance forms before arrival. Often, systems set up to process these forms are glitchy, so AAC directs guests through what has shown to be a frustrating process.“There is one park in Zimbabwe where you ca not get testing,” he shares as one example. “So, you have to either fly in a nurse, a great expense of $2,000 to $3,000, to get the swabs taken. Or you have to rearrange your itinerary to go to Victoria Falls for an extra night before leaving.” Knowing these policies and making amendments for yourself is tedious and can lead to mistakes, which can the n lead to getting stuck somewhere or cancelling the trip. “If I had not been doing this for 20 years, I do not know how we could do it, how somebody else can do it, because it is really confusing.”A company likeQuasar Expeditions, whose main destinations include Galapagos Islands and Patagonia, is constantly shifting its protocols. “Our sales staff tell us that on average, maybe a third of their day is spent answering COVID-related questions and easing people is concerns,” says Fernando Diez, marketing manager of Quasar. A high-risk area like Ecuador, the jumping-off point for Galapagos, closed borders from March to July 2020. Currently, to circumvent any issues in Ecuador, Quasar reroutes its clients to a more isolated airport and seeks out rural accommodations away from densely populated areas. In Galapagos, a private party donated 60,000 Pfizer vaccinations to the province is approvement 30,000 residents and workers. Once travelers arrive to the islands, safety protocols are strictly met. Quasar, along with AAC and AFTO, also only use vendors they know are adhering to measures that keep guests safe: consistently adapting to COVID testing for staff, cleaning procedures, social distancing, and mask wearing when needed“They are following all the procedures that they should,” Redding says, who remains closely connected with AAC is camps and lodges. “Once you get the re, I feel very good about the safety of the people that are the re, the visitors that are the re, especially if you are vaccinated as the traveler.”As far as travelers should prepare, O’Hara suggests being flexible because plans may change and some things may be closed. “Also, prepare to be welcomed and appreciated,” he says. “Foreign visitors will be welcomed back with even more verve and enthusiasm than before as we have been waiting for you to visit us for a while now.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential business stories straight to your in box each morning.",2,2,Fortune

The kids do very well with this. The idea that we are going to put masks on the kids, and the n we are going to punish the kids who, for their own medical decision-making or their parents, decide not to submit to this mandate. To me, it is the biggest, basically advertisement and encouragement to get out of the government schools. Go to private schools, if you can afford the m, teach your kids at home. But do not submit to the state, do not submit to the government.”“Not only they are making you worry unless they are going to indoctrinate you with Critical Race Theory,” Paul continued. “So, it is a win-win if you leave the schools if you are able to. And the re is been more of an exodus from the government schools this year than any other year because they are not following science. They just want you to be your – you are part of the collective, you are part of the hive, do as you are told, do not think, your kids do not belong to you, they belong to the state. These are all arguments for trying to flee the schools if you can.”The Kentucky Republican also revealed he was pushing a bill that would end the federal government is mask mandate on commercial airliners.“I am introducing legislation that will get rid of the federal mandate,” Paul said. “This happened by executive order by President Biden, and the airlines hide behind it. I, for one, am a frequent traveler. I am sick and tired of getting on the plane. Instead of them thanking me for buying a seat and buying a ticket, they tell me I could go to jail for not wearing a mask. Then they tell me I could go to jail if I am unable to open the door. Then they say, God forbid, you brought a drink on board so you could relax because of all the mandates. They will put you in jail for that too.”“So, I want them to get – I want to get on the plane, and somebody thanked me for buying a ticket instead of telling me three different ways they are going to send me to jail if I do not submit to some mandate,” he continued. “But they hide behind the federal mandate. They kind of act like, oh, it is not us. Well, Airlines are not doing this to you. It is your federal government. They begged for this, the airlines. And the thing is, they begged for our money. They could fly in their planes. And now they are begging to continue these mandates. The mandates need to end. They are not working. You are more likely to get it in their house than you are to get it on a plane.”",0,1,Breitbart

353,Washington is NFL Team Says it Will Drop 'Redskins' Name,-1.62,49.12,https://time.com/5866143/washington-redskins-name-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-13,25,"Under mounting pressure from sponsors and retailers, Washington is NFL team said it will no longer be known as the Redskins, an offensive term for Native Americans. The club began a review of the name July 3 and “will be retiring the Redskins name and logo upon completion of this review,” according to a team statement Monday. Dan Snyder, the principal owner, and Ron Rivera, the head coach, “are working to develop a new name and design approach.”It is a stark reversal by Snyder, who for years refused even to entertain the possibility. As recently as 2013, when the franchise was defending its name in court, SnydertoldUSA Today, “We will never change the name. It is that simple.”This time, sponsors and other financial partners left Snyder little choice. Earlier this month, FedEx Corp., which holds the naming rights to the team is stadium in Landover, Maryland, told the team to make a change. Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Nike Inc. stopped selling the team is merchandise. The National Football League said it would support a change. The support for the name change suggests the power of the current reckoning on race in America. Protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of police in late May have expanded to target systemic racism across US industry, government, culture and sports. The NFL, the most popular sports league in America by a wide margin, has been grappling with the growing Black Lives Matter movement for years. Then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began protesting police brutality by kneeling during the pregame national anthem in 2016, a controversial demonstration that divided fans, players and league officials. In June, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized on behalf of the league for “not listening to players” and failing to encourage and support peaceful protest. He did not mention Kaepernick by name but later told ESPN he’d encourage a team to sign him. The Washington team has a long history of racism beyond its name. George Preston Marshall, who founded the team in 1932, actively opposed integration; the team was the last in the league to sign a Black player. It did so in 1961, and only under threats from the government. That Black player, Hall-of-Famer Bobby Mitchell, is getting new attention as well. The team retired his number last month, making him the second player in the history of the organization to receive that honor, and a section of the venue will be named in honor of Mitchell. It had previously been named for Marshall, who will no longer be recognized in the stadium or in team materials, the team said. Late Sunday, “Hail to the Redskins” trended on Twitter, with several fans who both supported and opposed the move saying they wanted to sing the team is fight song one last time.

355,"Blame the Left, Not Trump, for America is Crack-Up",26.67,15.67,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/12/blame-the-left-not-trump-for-americas-crack-up/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,25,"What happened at the Capitol last week did nothing to change the Left is hostile disposition toward Donald Trump and his base. It has always seen Trump and his supporters as a malignancy that needs to be cut out of society. It never had any intention of letting Trump go down as a legitimate president, neither does it have any desire to acknowledge the grievances that fueled his rise in the first place. The words “President Trump” would never have entered the history books if not for the Left and its relentless, pathological hatred of anyone to the right of center. If America is heading towards civil strife, it is because the Left—with the complicity of an opportunistic establishment—has slowly but surely nudged half the country into a corner. The Left has categorized millions of ordinary people who just want decent, honorable lives as “far-right extremists” and “conspiracy the orists” who deserve to be silenced, fired from their jobs, and rendered socially untouchable. These “dangerous people,” held in such contempt by the Left and the ruling elite, retain such fringe notions as “nations should have borders” and “men and women are different.” The Left has been playing a game of “stop hitting yourself!” with these people for years, and in 2016, those people finally had enough. It is now four years later and his supporters have watched the president they legitimately elected spend every waking moment in office fight a war of succession with a faction of narcissistic psychopaths. Without a single day of rest, the most powerful institutions in the country conspired in a temper tantrum to overturn the will of the people, all in the name of “democracy,” simply because they did not like who the people had chosen. From day one, they have treated Trump like a usurper whose mere election was an “insurrection,” and they have not concealed their disgust for his supporters, whom they regard as “racist,” subhuman scumbags. If Trump is base is a bit inured by now to the outrage over this “sedition” at the Capitol, perhaps they can be forgiven. After all, Joe Biden spent a whole summer pretending that leftist riots were not happening for the sake of power. He only “condemned” them after his hand was forced, and even the n, he had the chutzpah to blame them on Trump supporters, even blaming a Trump supporter who was assassinated by a leftist for his own death. It was the most vile gaslighting conceivable. America is now being treated to lectures on “civility” and “democracy” from these very same people. The hypocrisy is obvious and galling, but the Left does not care: their philosophy is “heads we win, tails you lose.” Those on the “right side of history” are permitted to do anything. On the other hand, simply taking up space in the public square is a provocation if you are on the “wrong” side. They could bash your skull in with a rock, and the media would blame you for getting killed. Butso much as complain about this crooked deal,and you have engaged in “hate speech” and you must be destroyed. Tucker Carlson is formulation summarizes how arbitrary it all is:theirviolence is “speech,” but your speech is “violence.” And by the way,so is your silence. Endorse the official narrative, or else. Yet the Left is hostility increasingly has little to do with matters of conviction, which can be altered, if only involuntarily. Amidst the “reckoning” that began this summer, the Left started talking about whites like they were some form of disease. We saw the consequences of this bizarre trend in practice after the Left erupted into war-whooping bloodlust against the Capitol “seditionists,” who, they were disappointed to see, were not immediately gunned down in a hail of bullets. (One of them was, but this was not enough apparently.) Presumably the ir“whiteness” was a count against them. Biden and his allies are now abandoning any pretense of a desire for “unity” or reconciliation, as if this event is what finally convinced them that Trump is a fascist whose supporters need to be marginalized and silenced. Right. With Trump gone, they will use the Capitol “insurrection” to further disenfranchise his supporters without hesitation. While many on the Right have condemned the Capitol protesters, hoping that by doing so they will be spared, the Left has already launched a propaganda offensive to convince the public that what transpired was one of the worst things ever to happen in American history, and the inevitable consequence of an aberrational presidency. Everyone who supports Trump now, or has ever supported him, is the reby implicated in this “terrorism.”We find ourselves in an unsustainable situation. Millions of Americans never have felt more unwelcome in their own country, more disillusioned, or more vulnerable to an unaccountable enemy that hates them with a powerful, homicidal loathing. Their own party has unconcealed indifference and contempt for them. They are “racists” and “conspiracy the orists” just for existing and having thoughts and perceptions that contradict the propaganda of the people who want to destroy them. If they try to defend the mselves by voting, their votes will be dismissed as “illegitimate” and they will be branded enemies of the public. When your back is at the wall and you are facing a mob, sooner or later you have to defend yourself before they bludgeon you to death. What we are experiencing is the culmination of an effort to crush any resistance to the Left is power. After years of bitter counterinsurgency, the Left finally has their orange scalp. And they will want many, many more.",0,0,American Greatness

357,McConnell is “Liability Shield” Is a Weapon Aimed at COVID-19 Victims,-10.0,38.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/06/mcconnells-liability-shield-is-a-weapon-aimed-at-covid-19-victims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"Last week, Senate Republicans unveiled the HEALS Act, their proposal to address the continued devastation that COVID-19 is wreaking on the country. The Act, a collection of discrete bills authored by various Senators, would have far-reaching consequences. One of the bills, Texas Senator John Cornyn isSAFE TO WORK Act, would restrict lawsuits based on coronavirus exposure against employers, businesses, and many other potential defendants. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that the liability restrictions are a critical Republican requirement for further COVID-19 relief measures. Senator Cornyn claims that his bill “would protect those acting in good faith from being sued into oblivion while ensuring bad actors who willingly put their patients, employees, or customers in danger will still be held accountable.” Employers and businesses no doubt are dealing with great challenges given these extraordinary circumstances. And it is sensible for legislators to seek a balance between accountability for bad actors who fail to take reasonable precautions and the threat of ruinous liability for employers and businesses doing their best. Yet the bill is complex procedural requirements make any hope of accountability impossible. In fact, the bill actually encourages harmful behavior. The legislation is provisions are complex, but here is a brief overview of how it works. It creates a new federal cause of action that preempts other federal, state, or tribal causes of action “related to recovery for personal injuries caused by actual, alleged, feared, or potential for exposure to coronavirus.” The federal cause of action requires plaintiffs to prove that the defendant is “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” caused injury. That means that even if, say, Missouri law permitted a line cook harmed by a restaurant is ordinary negligence that caused them to contract COVID-19 to sue for damages, federal law would forbid the suit. The only exception is for laws that are more restrictive, meaning the goal is not uniformity, just limits on liability. This alone is quite significant. The bill is purportedly justified under Congress is constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Senator Cornyn himself has previously stressed that “the states retain the general lawmaking power” and rejected the notion that “the power to regulate interstate commerce essentially makes the federal government a government of unlimited power.” Yet he and his fellow Republicans, who extol the virtues of federalism, seem happy enough to make an unprecedented federal power grab here by federalizing tort law—which is normally within states’ control. That is especially unjustified given that many states have already beguncraftingliability-limitation legislation. But the bill goes much further. It contains numerous interlocking procedural restrictions that make it essentially impossible for a plaintiff to prevail. For one, the bill requires proof by “clear and convincing” evidence—an unusually high burden for most civil cases. It requires plaintiffs to detail their factual allegations with a much higher degree of specificity than is usually required. The bill also creates a “safe harbor” for defendants, which says that whenever a defendant can point to any “written or published policy” in line with applicable government regulations, the defendant will be presumed to have acted reasonably, even if the “policy” is just boilerplate language they did not actually follow. If a defendant is motion to dismiss the suit is unsuccessful, it can take an immediate appeal—potentially delaying litigation for years. Plaintiffs’ ability to obtain relevant evidence through discovery is sharply limited. Damages for any plaintiff lucky enough to achieve a victory are restricted. Each one of these requirements individually puts a big thumb on the scale in favor of defendants. Collectively, they pose nearly insuperable obstacles to recovery for plaintiffs—even when they seek recovery from actors who engaged in egregious misconduct that caused death or serious injury. The effect will be to discourage entities, such as warehouse operators or meat-packing plants, to take even reasonable precautions to prevent harm. But few plaintiffs would really ever risk getting this far. That is because of the worst provisions in what is already a bad bill. The Act does not just make it hard for plaintiffs to win; it makes it potentially devastating for them to even consider suit. If a victim requests compensation “in exchange for settling . . . or otherwise not pursuing a claim that is, or could be, brought as part of a coronavirus-related action,” the recipient of the request can seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees if the claim is “meritless.”Given how hard the Act makes it to win such claims, and how easy it makes it for defendants to demonstrate that they took “reasonable precautions,” the Act has all but pre-ordained all COVID-19 claims as “meritless.” In practice, an employee who merely em ails her employer requesting compensation for COVID-19-related harm caused by the employer is negligence exposes herself to thousands of dollars in damages. This provision would discourage reasonable requests for compensation by employees. And it may well violate the First Amendment is guarantee of free speech, given that it effectively punishes employees for simply communicating with their employers. Nor will victims easily find legal representation. Lawyers, too, can be sued for “meritless” compensation requests. The Act also permits the US Attorney General to sue anyone who he “has reasonable cause to believe . . . is engaged in a pattern or practice of transmitting demands for remuneration” that are meritless. Each compensation demand exposes the sender to a civil fine of up to $50,000. Lawyers representing COVID-19 plaintiffs would quickly be put out of business. At the same time, the bill would create a cottage industry for suits against injured plaintiffs and their attorneys. These lucrative counter suits are subject to none of the stringent requirements the bill places on injured parties seeking compensation. In total, the bill represents an assault on the American civil justice system that is without precedent in federal law. In the few instances where Congress has broadly preempted state lawsuits, it has done so alongside federal regulatory schemes designed to promote the public good or alternative systems for compensating injured parties. Congress preempted lawsuits against the airline industry arising out of the September 11 attacks, but it quickly created a Victims’ Compensation Fund to compensate 9/11 victims and their families. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act bars tort claims against vaccine manufacturers, but it also created a compensation program to provide recovery to those injured by vaccines without the need to establish fault by the manufacturer. Here, by contrast, Senate Republicans want to prevent states from using tort liability, but they are leaving health regulation to the states and are not creating any federal mechanisms for compensating victims. There are steps Congress might take that would strike an appropriate balance between victim is interests, the need to protect essential services acting reasonably, and federalism values. Instead, this bill gives businesses a free pass at the expense of COVID-19 is victims. If passed into law, the bill would make it anything but safe for the country to go back to work.",1,1,Washington Monthly
358,Skirting Ida,-4.67,37.33,https://www.thebulwark.com/skirting-ida/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,17,"Just as we finish repairing the damage to our home from last October is Hurricane Zeta, my husband and I board up and sandbag for Ida. We have plenty of water, food, batteries, flashlights, gas for the generator and the car. For 48 hours, we move furniture and computers away from windows, roll up rugs and place to wels under the windows and doors. Saturday evening, while gulls fly with the bats, we even relax and ride our bikes around town, taking before-Ida pictures to post on social media, telling friends that for Mississippians, Ida would just be a tropical storm, and we are staying put. Six years ago, we moved to Pass Christian, a beautiful coastal town that Hurricane Katrina mostly destroyed in 2005. Nothing is good when it comes to hurricanes, but hurricane season is when coastal communities come together. We help each other. And in a divided, COVID-sick South, kindness is a welcome distraction. But, late Saturday night right before we go to bed, the hurricane quickly shifts course east towards Mississippi, going from a Category 2 to a 4. The tone in the TV newscasters’ voices shifts, too. We have our hurricane kit with important papers, granola bars, can opener, peanut butter, and toilet paper, but it is strange and nonsensical what you choose to throw in a car at midnight. I grab a favorite painting, my computer, purse, embroidery, a first edition of Eudora Welty is, instant coffee, a bag of muffins, my grandmother is pearls, and a bag of paperclips. Then I pack an ice chest full of gumbo. My husband packs his documentary film footage, some shorts, t-shirts, and boots. The roads are clear as we head north in the dark. Our plan is to go to a friend is house outside of Jackson, but that is where Ida is headed, too. We decide it is safer to drive east into Alabama. As we near a town, we call hotels. They are all booked with hurricane evacuees from Louisiana. In Montgomery, we luck out. One last room at a Holiday Inn Express, where, at 4 a.m., we pull into a packed parking lot. Safe, sort of. Inside, some evacuees are milling around, sleepless and without masks. Late the following morning, we doom-scroll through Twitter for Ida news, discovering that even a hurricane can be political. QAnon conspiracy the orists tweet that Ida is man-made. They cheer for the destruction of New Orleans. We check the TV Ida is wreaking havoc in New Orleans and it is on its way to Pass Christian. In downtown Montgomery, we walk around in the rain, stopping for coffee at a hip coffee shop and community center. We read plaques honoring Rosa Parks, the n tour a small,Hank Williams museum with Williams is old dinette set, cowboy suits, and boots. For a long while, we stand in front of his blue Cadillac convertible, where he died in the back seat of a heart attack. In 1953, he’d been on his way to a performance, and had hired a college kid to drive him because of a threatening ice storm. Back at the hotel, we check the weather again before we go to bed. Our friends in Pass Christian are in for a terrifying night of howling winds and tornado warning sirens. It is strange to wish we were the re, riding it out with them. Ida is a different kind of hurricane, not only because of its sudden change in strength, but because of how some people are reacting. Monday morning, we watch NBC correspondent Shaquille Brewster reporting live from a Gulfport beach when a pickup truck drives up behind him. A white man jumps out, runs toward him, shouting “cover this accurately,” and lunges at Brewster, who is black. Brewster cuts to a newscaster who says the re is a lot of crazy out there. The Memorial for Peace and Justice is closed, so we head back home early, even though it might be too soon. We drive through a rainy outer band, wipers at full tilt and hazards blinking, slowing at tornado warnings as we cross Little Lizard Creek near Satsuma and Chickasaw. A neighbor sends a picture of our house, saying it looks okay. We ca not believe it. When we get the re, Pass Christian in general looks okay, too. Some fences and shutters are down, but nothing like the aftermath of Zeta. The book store reopens that afternoon. So does the Waffle House. Back at our house, we survey the damage. A few shingles have blown off the roof, but nothing that ca not be fixed. Our Louisiana neighbors were not as lucky. We are exhausted with the weather. Our backs ache from lugging sandbags and moving furniture. Why do we live in this crazy place?In his book, Sebastian Junger writes about how nomads are not bound by fixed areas, how they move without difficulty, often at a moment is notice. This is a form of freedom. Sometimes, neither one of us wants the burden of a home, but we are tied to this place whether we want to be or not. I check our community Facebook page, scrolling through funny posts about hurricane food and updates on neighborhood flooding bringing unwanted visitors—alligators. I read an alert that the Gulfport police need help identifying the white man who harassed Shaquille Brewster on the beach. There is a follow-up post. The man has beenidentified—his truck has Ohio license plates. We open the shutters and begin to put our house back in order. Newscasters shift from talk of Ida back to Afghanistan. There is a text from a neighbor asking if we need any help and a message that a guy is coming over to fix the roof tomorrow. We invite New Orleans friends without power or water to come stay with us. Tonight, we will have gumbo.",1,1,The Bulwark

360,Omaha police warned of arrests during march; protesters call officers' actions 'unnecessary',-1.0,49.33,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-police-warned-of-arrests-during-march-protesters-call-officers-actions-unnecessary/article_8fb28b34-a3ee-51e2-8bec-2f01397ba7ee.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"For nearly an hour Saturday, a group of more than 150 protesters marched from near Midtown Crossing to downtown Omaha before heading back west on Farnam Street. They were a couple of blocks away from where they had started when officers, who for 47 minutes had announced that the protesters’ march was an unlawful assembly, began arresting people. Protesters have said they planned to disperse as they neared their cars, but the police moved in. Police said they could have arrested the protesters any time after their first warning, but were “looking for a safe opportunity to make an arrest.”A time line of events released Wednesday by Omaha police details the protesters’ route and officers’ response. Protesters have criticized the arrests as excessive or unnecessary. The protest began at 7:30 p.m. as a gathering in Turner Park at 30th and Farnam Streets. The event was organized by 23-year-old Alexander Matthews to stand in solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, and demand justice forJames Scurlock. Scurlock was shot and killed in the Old Market after a protest May 30. Matthews, who goes by the name Bear Alexander, is one of the leaders of proBLAC, a local organization that supports and inspires activism, especially prio rit izing voices of people of color. After the rally at Turner Park, Matthews said, he and other proBLAC leaders planned to go to the City-County Building for another rally but decided to mount a full march instead.“We wanted to march down Farnam and show everybody whose streets these are,” he said. “There was no malicious intent whatsoever.”Matthews and other protesters told The World-Herald that they noticed police cruisers blocking cross streets and following them as they marched downtown, around the Old Market and back along Farnam. No acts of vandalism were reported by police, but they said protesters knocked over construction barrels and cones. Doing that impeded cruisers from following the group and “caused a safety issue for anyone else utilizing the streets after the (protesters’) passage.”Omaha police said protesters knocked over construction barrels and cones, which they said could impede others using the streets. Mark Vondrasek, 29, was riding a bicycle during the march. He said that on the way downtown, near 24th and Farnam Streets, he heard officers announce that the march was an unlawful assembly and that protesters were subject to arrest. The announcements were repeated several times, and the fifth announcement, police said, ended with “go home now.” Other protesters said they did not hear those warnings until they returned to the Farnam bridge about an hour later. One officer noted that he saw a handful of people leave after the announcements were made. Police said they repeated the warnings at 19th and Farnam, 13th and Howard Streets and 12th and Howard. At the Farnam Street bridge over Interstate 480, the announcement changed to “you are under arrest.”Police said walking in the street can be extremely dangerous and is against the law without prior authorization and planning with local authorities. “There are numerous examples across the country of protesters taking to the street and being struck and even killed by motorists,” police said. At 8:50 p.m. Saturday, an Omaha police officer in a cruiser at 24th and Farnam Streets announced to protesters, “This has been declared an unlawful assembly. You are all subject to arrest.”In its statement Wednesday, the department said Matthews “did not contact police for safety assistance and had not obtained a parade permit.”Matthews said he never will tell the police about his organization is plan for a rally or march.“We at proBLAC will never, ever ask an oppressive system if, when and how we can protest against their oppression,” he said. “The police want us to stay on the corner. They want us to be docile. They want us to not make noise. They want us to be submissive and they want us to be weak. Because when we are weak, we can be controlled.”During the march, police said, protesters blocked all lanes of Farnam Street. Some people also walked on the sidewalk. Police said Vondrasek blocked a police cruiser with his bicycle in the Old Market before taking off when police attempted to apprehend him. Omaha police said protester Mark Vondrasek intentionally blocked a police cruiser in the Old Market during Saturday is march. At 9:36 p.m., police said, all remaining protesters were on the bridge over I-480. Police the n blocked both ends of the bridge. Police said the lieutenant supervising the protest “had a plan in place to make arrests on the bridge as it had better containment of individuals and was a better safety option.”Police said a police sergeant yelled 12 times that the group was under arrest while Matthews yelled with a megaphone: “We are peaceful protesting.”According to a separate police report, officers had given “numerous direct orders for protesters to get on the ground,” telling them they were under arrest. Officer Robert Soldo the n saw Vondrasek “turn his bicycle towards officers, load his pedal and attempt to flee while riding his bicycle directly at officers,” the narrative says. Soldo saw Officer Nicola Bay “attempt to stop Vondrasek from fleeing, at which time Vondrasek crashed his bicycle into Ofc. Soldo,” the report says. A video of the altercation shows one officer pushing Vondrasek on his bicycle, causing him to crash into an officer. Soldo pushed Vondrasek away, the report says, and the n Soldo fired “five direct impact pepper ball rounds to Vondrasek is right side.”“The pepper ball deployment was approximately five feet away and appeared to be effective,” according to the report. Vondrasek said the pepper balls hit his chest, shoulder, back and butt cheek and caused bleeding and bruising. Saturday, Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza told reporters that one pepper ball was deployed, but the report lists more. Be the first to know when news happens. Get the latest breaking headlines sent straight to your inbox. OPD did not respond to a request, submitted Tuesday, asking how many officers fired pepper balls. According to police reports, Soldo was the only officer who fired pepper balls. Whencounting force for their own statistics, OPD counts each force type per incident per officer — not the number of pepper ball rounds or, for example, Taser trigger pulls. Vondrasek said he was attempting to get away, and not trying run into anyone.“I had sort of moved to the front, and I had an opportunity to try to bike away,” Vondrasek said. “I tried to and (officers) caught me. They sort of started throwing me around, they shot me with some pepper balls and tackled me to the ground.”Vondrasek said he thinks the use of force by police was “excessive.”“We were two blocks away from where we had started, and if police had let us continue we would have gone back to the park and immediately dispersed,” he said. “It would have been over within 10 minutes, but they chose to end it on their terms and commit unnecessary acts of violence.”Police said that at that point, they did not know whether the march was going to continue or end. Vondrasek was the first protester arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail. Cole Christensen, 28, was arrested shortly thereafter. Police say he was arrested on suspicion of interfering with officers. According to the police report, Omaha Police Sgt. Brendan O’Flynn was arresting Vondrasek when Soldo saw Christensen, who was holding a leaf blower and a sign, run toward them. Soldo the n fired six pepper ball rounds at Christensen is back, according to the report. In the report, officers said the use of force was appropriate because Vondrasek and Christensen were “actively resisting” — Vondrasek “bumped into” Soldo and Christensen interfered with the arrest and reached to grab O’Flynn. Vondrasek and Christensen were told to use soap and water to wash off residual powder from the pepper balls, the report said. Christensen said the injuries caused him to bleed through his shirt. Protester Neal Duffy, 38, said he never heard any instruction or announcements from police that night other than “back up” right before he was arrested. He said the group was constantly chanting and Matthews was on the bullhorn, adding to the noise.“If (the police is) message was for us to disperse, it was a minimal attempt for them to tell us that,” he said. “And a lackadaisical one at that.”After the altercation with Vondrasek, Duffy said, he heard one officer tell others, “Put them all in handcuffs.” He said an officer the n slammed him into the bridge railing, took him to the ground, put a zip tie on him and the n kneed him in the ribs. Duffy said he plans to file a complaint, but said he does not know who the officer was. Matthews said that when he was arrested, he was told he was resisting arrest because he put his hands up and did not lie on the ground. Matthews, Duffy and Vondrasek said police should have just issued citations and allowed people to go home, which is what they said protesters were trying to do.“If people think that this kind of police violence is necessary in order to protect traffic flow, I think that is pretty clearly an excuse for you to feel OK about the state using violence in order to oppress your political opponents, which is fascism,” Vondrasek said. In its Wednesday timeline, Omaha police said “on-scene command made the decision to book the involved parties into jail out of fear that disturbances and potential further criminal activity would continue in the downtown area if they were cited and released.”Officers arrested 120 people. Most of them were booked on failure to disperse and obstructing passage. Other charges included negligent driving, obstructing officers, resisting arrest and unlawful assembly. Those who were arrested said they experienced harsh conditions and long processing delays at the Douglas County Jail. Jail officials said computer issues delayed the release of many people, some of whom did not get out until early Monday.

361,Community groups urge SF not to shut down shelter-in-place hotels – The San Francisco Examiner,-5.33,34.33,https://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/community-groups-urge-sf-not-to-shut-down-shelter-in-place-hotels/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,19,"San Francisco is major service provider coalitions, whose members comprise almost the entire homeless response system, have asked The City to pause its shelter-in-place (SIP) hotel “rehousing plan.” The plan, developed without input from the service providers tasked with implementing it, lays out an unrealistic, even dangerous time line for closing hotel sites and relocating nearly 2,400 homeless people and families. The first seven hotel closures— scheduled for December 21, mere weeks away—will likely trigger a spike in street-based homelessness during a time when deaths among unhoused people are up 123% and overdose deaths are up 70%. The closures will require mass layoffs of front line hotel workers right before a major holiday. And according to the plan, only one in five of the 500 hotel residents slated for “rehousing” will actually get a housing referral (a referral is a match with housing; it is not housing). The time line raises disturbing public health questions: why now? The SIP hotels have been a mainstay of The City is COVID-19 response. Why shut them down now, at the onset of flu season, in the middle of a fall surge that experts have warned about for months? Why shut them down now, earlier than almost all of the other Bay Area counties, when these counties coordinated successful public health orders that have held off disaster for most of the year?The City is answer is that SIP hotels, while effective, are expensive. But we all knew this. San Francisco put a premium on public health when Mayor London Breed ordered, and stuck to, months-long closures of non-essential business and activities. Those investments are paying off as the virus rages beyond the Bay Area. To shut down the SIP hotels because they are expensive is a deeply shortsighted reversal. The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in funding support services in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd it does not answer the question, “Why now?” A Biden-Harris administration will help us all breathe easier about federal reimbursements. At the state level, Project Homekey has awarded San Francisco almost $75 million over the last two months to convert hotel properties to permanent housing—new inventory that could rehouse people from the SIP hotels once it comes online. And just last week, San Francisco voters approved several new revenue measures that could generate substantial funding for similar initiatives. With nearly $500 million in Proposition C funding unlocked by the courts in September, it is dumbfounding why The City would ask the SIP hotel operators to issue potentially hundreds of pink slips to their workers, right before the holidays. Proposition C is win means that our sector will need to hire — not fire — an expanded workforce of case managers, shelter counselors and other front line staff to maximize our housing-related investments. Now is not the time for layoffs: it is time to start ending homelessness and creating an inclusive economic recovery. Our homeless response system has made a commitment to data-driven decision-making that centers racial equity. But we lack basic demographic data for about half of the SIP hotel residents. This is a critical gap given the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on people of color. The most rational, data-driven thing we can do right now is collect the demographic data and develop a clear plan that does not relocate people of color either to the unemployment lines or to the streets. There is too much at stake to forge ahead on a “rehousing plan” that is short on planning and even shorter on housing. We simply lack capacity to relocate 2,400 people in less than eight months without returning many of them to the streets. No service provider in either coalition thinks of the SIP hotels as a long-term response to homelessness—but we broadly (if not unanimously) agree that now is not the time to shut them down. It is not good policy. We can do better in the City of St. Francis.",1,2,SF Examiner

363,Joe Biden Taps ‘Transgender’ Rachel Levine to HHS Position,7.33,39.33,https://www.ncregister.com/cna/joe-biden-taps-transgender-rachel-levine-to-hhs-position,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,16,"President-elect Joe Biden will nominate a supporter of the contraceptive mandate to a top position at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he announced on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Biden announced that he would nominate Dr. Rachel Levine, a biological man identifying as a transgender woman who has served as Pennsylvania is health secretary since 2017, to be HHS Assistant Secretary for Health. Before serving as Pennsylvania is health secretary, Levine served as the state is physician general. Levine has been outspoken on social issues, supporting gender-transition surgery and the contraceptive mandate while opposing a proposed 20-week abortion ban. Levine is nomination to HHS, along with that of Health Secretary nominee Xavier Becerra, signals that social issues could be priorities at the agency for the next several years. These might include pro-LGBTQ policies, funding of abortion providers, and religious freedom conflicts with Catholic organizations. Regarding the Obama-era HHS contraceptive mandate, Levine in 2017 called it “immoral and unethical” to allow for religious exemptions to the mandate. Hundreds of non-profits and businesses—including the Little Sisters of the Poor—had objected to the mandate and the Obama administration is opt-out process for objecting non-profits. After the Trump administration announced in 2017 that religious employers and other organizations morally opposed to the contraceptive mandate could receive exemptions from it, Levine issued a sharp statement in opposition.“It is immoral and unethical to give any employer the ability to take away access to health care from an entire gender,” Levine said as Pennsylvania is acting health secretary, in 2017. “We cannot allow women is health to be reduced to one issue or be jeopardized in any way.”Levine also wrote an op-ed against the Trump administration is reversal of Obama-era rules on transgender accommodation. In February, 2017, the Trump administration said it would stop defending the Obama administration is transgender bathroom policy in court; the policy had directed schools to allow students to use gender-specific bathrooms according to their gender identity, and not their biological sex. In an op-ed for thePatriot-News, Levine wrote that “[t]he decision by the Trump administration to roll back the most basic protections for transgender and gender expansive youth is heartbreaking.”“To Pennsylvania‘s transgender and gender expansive youth and their families who are worried or concerned, I want you to know that Governor Wolf is administration has your back,” Pennsylvania is the n-physician general wrote. In 2016, Levine spoke out against a 20-week abortion ban that criminal i zed abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy except in cases where the mother is life was in danger. The bill also banned the “dilation and evacuation” abortion procedure. Levine said at the time that the bill “punishes women whose pregnancies have complications.”“Women and their families, when faced with a devastating diagnosis of a significant fetal anomaly, have the right to make the decision which is appropriate for the m, in consultation with their doctors,” Levine said. Levine is family moved their mother out of a personal care home early in the COVID-19 pandemic, because of the high spread of the virus; the decision invited some media scrutiny. Levine was also questioned for the state is policy of requiring nursing homes to accept recovering COVID patients from hospitals, although the state health secretary responded that asymptomatic staff at the homes—not patients discharged from hospitals—were the primary spreaders of the virus there. If Levine is confirmed to HHS, along with Becerra, they together could craft policy to influence a number of issues including abortion, gender-transition surgery, and the contraceptive mandate. While California is attorney general, Becerra fought aggressively in favor of an abortion coverage mandate that religious employers were not exempt from, and continued the prosecution of pro-life activist David Daleiden. If confirmed as Health Secretary, Becerra — a Catholic — could reignite a number of Obama-era policies that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and other Catholic groups were opposed to. These might include resurrecting court battles with the Little Sisters of the Poor and other Catholic groups that opposed the Obama administration is procedure by which to “opt out” of the contraceptive mandate. The groups said that the policy still required them to provide coverage for contraceptives through their employee health plans, which they morally objected to. Other HHS policies could include re-imposing the full transgender mandate—a requirement that doctors perform gender-transition surgery upon the referral of a mental health professional—and various requirements of religious groups that receive HHS grants, such as adoption agencies having to match children with same-sex couples.",1,1,National Catholic Register
364,Former Representative Dave Brat: We must fight back!,19.0,27.0,https://dailytorch.com/2021/02/former-rep-dave-brat-we-must-fight-back/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-torch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,15,"ByCatherine MortensenIn are cent columninAmerican Greatness, professor emeritus and thought leaderAngelo Codevillamakes the bold proposal that “in order to preserve republican freedoms… [w]e can start by boycotting an institution that undeniably, has become ruinously partisan: the House of Representatives.”The piece generated hundreds of comments on the site, many of them supportive. One reader, Tony_Petroski, said, “[Y]ou have to start somewhere. You need some strategy beyond civil war. I think the Professor is suggestion is a good one and not mere satire.” Reader Gefilte Fisherman added, “Angelo Codevilla has a Great Idea.” A reader named Patriot wrote, “I like this idea as well. At every opportunity, we need to go on the offense and talk about the lawlessness and how their total corruption is anti-constitutional and costs taxpayers billions.”Still others thought it was unrealistic to expect the GOP to show any “bold” leadership, as Watsyxz noted, “Wishful thinking. Our elected Republicans have already surrendered to the will of the Democrats. Both Ds and Rs do not give a wit about the voters who put them in office. They care only about getting re-elected, staying in good favor with the Media, and care about socializing with each other, the elite members of The Ruling Class.”Former Virginia Congressman Dave Brat, who served two terms in the House of Representatives after defeating former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said it would be a bad idea for Republicans to disengage from the process. He said the most important thing Republicans can do now is strongly push back on “the terrible stuff going on in our country right now.”“We are going to have to fight back,” Brat said. “The awful comments that Pelosi has made about Members on the Republican side of the aisle are just horrific. We have a platform, and the American people want to hear from us.”Brat said he understands the temptation to “cut the cord” from institutional power right now, but he said that is the last thing we should do. “Instead we need to stand up to this radical leftist push for power.” He said too often conservatives makes rational policy arguments that just fade away in time, when what we really need to be doing is “taking real estate back in our major institutions, such as the CIA, the FBI, and the State Department, basically the Deep State.”House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appears to recognize that many Republicans are disengaging from politics and started a series on his blog,The Starting Line,that features stories of average, hard-working Americans who are suffering under Biden is job-crushing executive orders. Earlier this week, McCarthy posted, “We received some positive feedback on yesterday is post aboutLaurie Cox and her hotel in Midland, South Dakota. This got us thinking about communications. The more time spent focusing on what is happening on Twitter, the less in touch we are with what our constituents are thinking about or what their lived experiences are. Those stories are far more interesting. We will continue to share them.”While efforts such as those are a start, they are far from the robust response Brat thinks is needed.“Even the minority party in Congress has tremendous power in terms of reaching out to the media and educating the American people on all the things that the people want to hear right now and they are just not hearing it,” Brat explained. “They are not hearing anybody step up to the plate and defend the Main Street folks.”Brat added that Republicans need to focus less on policy and more on big picture cultural issues dividing the country. “The reason people are so upset on a gut level is because they know the fundamental American values are being tipped upside down right now.”Americans for Limited Government PresidentRick Manningagrees that Republicans need to stand and fight in Congress, and not disengage. “While it is tempting to pack up our bats and balls and go home, people get elected to Congress to be in the game and to fight like crazy for the interest of their constituents and America. Disengagement in surrender.”Brat said he misses the friends he made in Congress, but not the vile personal attacks, which he noted have gotten worse since Biden is Inauguration. “Since they do not have Trump to vilify anymore, they are going to vilify anyone who supported him. And our leadership is not standing up to these attacks because they are scared and hiding under their desks.”Brat, who is now dean of the business school at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, recommends reading the introduction to the 1987 classic “Closing of the American Mind” by Allan Bloom. The book anticipates America is cultural collapse stemming from “moral relativism.” Brat said there is much we can learn today from Bloom. “One of his major the mes is the revaluing of all values, and that leads to George Orwell and all that we are seeing right now.”",0,0,Daily Torch
365,Samsung profit surges on strong chip demand,0.67,51.5,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/samsung-profit-surges-on-strong-chip-demand-2020-07-29,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,25,"SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. reported a boost in its second-quarter net profits Thursday, aided by a one-time gain in its display business and the continuing coronavirus-fueled bump in memory chip demand. But the world is largest smart phone and memory-chip maker is likely to face challenges, as the realities of the Covid-19 pandemic settle in. Large cloud computing companies that stockpiled chips so far may dial down their buying, while smart phone demand recovery may be slow in the near future. Samsung is a proxy for the global economy, both as a manufacturer of smartphones, televisions and home appliances and as a parts supplier to the world is largest electronics firms. The firm is unexpected success in the first half of the year showed how the tech industry could profit from a surge in internet demand, as more workers clocked in from home. Demand for online services and data-server suppliers -- which include Samsung is memory chips -- soared. But the pullback in global discretionary spending, resulting from job losses to pandemic lockdowns, has harmed Samsung is sales of smart phones and other consumer electronics. Samsung is second-quarter net profits rose to 5.56 trillion South Korean won ($4.67 billion) in the quarter ending June 30, versus 5.18 trillion won for the prior year is quarter. Operating profits rose to 8.15 trillion South Korean won ($6.8 billion) over 6.6 trillion won a year before. Revenue dipped about 6% to 52.97 trillion won ($44.4 billion) from 56.13 trillion won during the same period a year ago. Analysts had projected a slight decline in revenue but a rise in profits after the company is earnings guidance earlier this month. Much of the positive performance in the second quarter was driven by peaking demand from data centers, which ramped up as employees hollowed out offices to work from home and socialize remotely. But many of those buyers, who feared supply-chain disruptions early on, built up inventories of memory chips that will now carry them through the second half of the year, said SK Kim, an analyst at Daiwa Securities. Samsung is display business also got a profit bump from Apple Inc., thanks to a penalty payment baked into a deal between the smart phone rivals, analysts said. Samsung is the main supplier for the premium flexible OLED screens used in Apple is newer iPhones. Typical industry contracts require a penalty payment to the component supplier, if a client purchases fewer units than required, especially in capital-heavy manufacturing. This year is payment, estimated to be around $900 million to $950 million, would be the largest payment by Apple to Samsung since the Cupertino, Calif.,-based company signed an OLED deal with its South Korean counterpart in 2016, analysts said. Samsung is overwhelmingly the Number 1 player for these particular displays, prized because the glass can be curved to give users a bigger screen or a sleeker design. But the Apple payment is less a windfall than a cushion for the major investment Samsung has already made in building up its OLED manufacturing, said Bob O'Brien, co-founder of Display Supply Chain Consultants. For now, Samsung appears to have overshot demand, as the OLED screens -- generally the priciest component in a premium handset -- have not been adopted by other smart phone makers outside of Apple and Samsung, Mr. O'Brien added. ""Samsung built more capacity than they needed,"" he said. ""This payment from Apple is sort of like insurance -- you only collect insurance when something bad happens.""Lowered consumer demand for handsets -- Samsung is other main profit driver -- have also weakened the company is performance. As it prepares to debut new models in its flagship Galaxy Note line next week, the company is still trying to move excess inventory of its main Galaxy S20 devices, said Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst with Susquehanna International Group. The Galaxy S20 hit shelves in March, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down retailers and crimped consumer purchasing. The company is leaning on affordable options like its mid price 5G-enabled options like the Galaxy A71 in the US and other markets to boost volume. Samsung is also expected to price its Galaxy Note phones much more competitively and potentially trim the price tags on its Galaxy S20 devices to recoup some losses. Worldwide smart phone shipments sank by nearly 20% in the first quarter of the year compared with the year prior, according to industry research firm Strategy Analytics. Samsung is phone shipments sank by more than 18% to 58.3 million devices during that period, the firm said. But retail sales are picking up again globally, as lock downs are eased, even though coronavirus cases still continue to tick upward, especially in the USs. Write to Elizabeth Koh at Elizabeth.

366,"How ""SoHo Karen"" Miya Ponsetto is Privilege Dominated That Gayle King Interview",-5.33,38.67,https://www.popsugar.com/news/miya-ponsetto-gayle-king-interview-essay-48099874,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-10,25,"Many things about 22-year-old Miya Ponsetto is interview with Gayle King on Friday were puzzling and infuriating, and her choice of attire was one of them. Turns out,Ponsetto is lawyer suggested she remove her ""Daddy"" baseball cap before the exclusive interview. ""We asked her to wear professional attire,"" attorney Sharen Ghatan told The Daily Beast. ""I specifically asked her to remove it before the interview."" But Ghatan described Ponsetto as ""defiant,"" ""insistent,"" and a ""very challenging client,"" so the cap stayed on. Notice the lawyer neglected to use the word ""racist,"" yet Ponsetto is attitude, actions, and, by extension, her outfit are charged with supposed superiority. There is privilege at work here. Ponsetto was arrested on Friday in Californiaafter allegedly physically assaulting 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. on December 26 at the Arlo Hotel in New York City. Onlookers (including Harrold Jr. is father, renowned jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold Sr.)caught Ponsetto is tirade against the Black teen on camera, as she falsely accused him of stealing her cell phone and threw him to the ground. After the attack, the internet labeled Ponsetto as ""SoHo Karen"" when video of her aggression went viral. You'd hope that Ponsetto would have used her time with King on Friday to apologize and show remorse for her actions. You'd be disappointed. Ponsetto appeared on camera in a puzzlingly casual outfit, wearing a $16 Urban Outfitters baseball cap. If an outfit makes a first impression, one could assume Ponsetto was aware the message her indifference would send to King and to the world watching. ""[The hat] was important to her,"" Ghatan said, although she could not explain why. The lawyer admitted she is concerned for Ponsetto is mental health. Clearly, Ponsetto is obstinance indicated what was to come. She gaslit Harrold Jr. with insincere apologies, only acknowledging ""if I insulted him or hurt his feelings."" She danced around questions and leaned heavily on excuses in an attempt to spin the story as a victim. She ignored her lawyer is attempts at intervention. In an especially improbable exchange, she snapped at King. The seasoned interviewer tried to hold Ponsetto accountable by telling her, ""You are 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better."" Ponsetto responded with a wave of her hand, and said, ""All right, Gayle, enough.""Every second of Ponsetto is six-minute interview further emphasizes her immense privilege. She described herself as ""super sweet"" and the n, in nearly the same breath, shushed an acclaimed journalist — and Black woman — on national TV She treated the interaction as if it were barely worth her time, seemingly undaunted by the consequences of her actions. In fact, she appeared blind to her own actions entirely. ""I am a 22-year-old girl. . . . How is a girl accusing a guy about a phone a crime? Where is the context in that?"" she asked. Despite Ponsetto is insistence, she is not a girl, she is a woman. A full-grown adult, actually. Harrold Jr., on the other hand, is not a ""guy"" — especially in comparison to Ponsetto. He is at the beginning of his teen years, closer to childhood than whatever innocence Ponsetto tried to claim for herself. And for the record, making a false accusation is a crime if it is reported to the police. Privilege and assumed power like Ponsetto is are engrained over time. Society consistently reaffirms that just looking a certain way will fill in the gaps for any shortcomings. Frighteningly, Ponsetto is privilege acts as the same supposed ""shield"" that emboldens people like the Donald Trump-supporting mob who attacked the nation is Capitol. A MAGA hat and a ""Daddy"" cap never felt so eerily similar. Hours after Ponsetto acted invincible in her conversation with King, she got her mugs hot taken. Much like Amy Cooper,the white woman who falsely claimed a Black birder was threatening her, Ponsetto will face charges, although it is unclear what they will be. Ponsetto still does not see her actions as racially charged, despite singling out the Black teen and refusing to relent. For the record, the hotel had her phone. Although Ghatan canceled her client is future interviews, the re is still a chance Ponsetto could resurface to spin the same lies. Perhaps she would do well to heed her own advice: ""Alright, Miya, enough."" In the meantime, someone please pour Gayle King a glass of something strong and give her a raise. There is not a paycheck big enough to cover the audacity she dealt with this week.",1,1,Popsugar

And while he claimed ""Chris Wallace is not my concern,"" Perez correctly identified that ""at the highest levels of Fox News the y"" — meaning right-wing ideologues — ""have infiltrated the news side."" Perez had to de fend his decision to Democratsat the time, but Chris Wallace is hapless performance as a presidential debate ""moderator"" on Tuesday evening may have finally made clear that Fox News is not an honest media broker. Not one host from the network can be trusted to present facts outside the requisite right-wing narrative. It is easy to feel for Wallace. At no point during thatrage-inducing national embarrassment did DonaldTrumpallow the first presidential debate of the 2020 campaign to play out as planned, at least according to what Wallace repeatedly reminded the president were the mutually agreed-upon rules. Wallace lost control in the first 90 seconds and Trump ran roughshod over him for the next 90 minutes.""I am the moderator of this debate and I'd like to ask my question,"" Wallace pleaded with Trump at one point. The host of ""Fox News Sunday"" told The New York Times earlier this week, ""If I have done my job right, at the end of the night, people will say, 'That was a great debate, who was the moderator?'"" Wallace not only failed to meet his own low standard of uselessness, he actively aided Trump by peddling dangerous misinformation and pushing modulated versions of the same right-wing narrative deployed by Trump, creating a dangerous feedback loop. Despite Trump is day-after complaints, for much of Tuesday is debate it was clear that Wallace simply let the president moderate. ""If you want to switch seats, we can do that,"" Wallace offered Trump a little more than an hour into the debate. Wallace repeatedly interrupted Biden to ask Trump questions. He the n permitted Trump to keep talking over Biden without cutting him off, and allowed lie after lie to go unchallenged. Much too late, Wallace tried to exert some control, but he rarely, if ever, succeeded. To be fair, no moderator deemed acceptable to the Trump campaign would conceivably have the chops to rein in the president. That would defeat his whole debate strategy. Indeed, I'd predict that Wallace will eventually be graded the highest of the three presidential debate moderators after CSPAN call-in host Steve Scully and NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker get their turn. As Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote, the idea that either of them ""can hope to control things any better is a dubious one unless the format changes substantially."" On Wednesday, the the Commission on Presidential Debates announced it may do just that: ""Last night is debate made clear additional structure should be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues,"" the commission said in a statement, adding that it is ""considering the changes"" and will ""announce those measures shortly.""But what was even more troublesome than Wallace impotently shouting ""Mr. President!"" in exactly the way I ask my 10-month-old to not put every single thing he picks up into his mouth was the frame and premise Wallace deployed for several of the night is most serious topics. On police violence and the ongoing protests in Portland, Oregon, the Fox News host portrayed the issue as nightly riots by the protesters — rather than nightly violence by police. People have assembled in Portland to protest police violence every night and cops have responded by brutalizing them. Wallace did not mention the Trump supporters driving down the streets following a pro-Trump rally, shooting random people with paint ball guns and pepper-spraying them. Wallace brought up anti fa — all-purpose right-wing bugaboo of the moment — but made no mention of the men who traveled to a Walmart in El Paso and a synagogue in Pittsburgh to carry out what they interpreted as a mission of violent racial animus supported by the president. Even if Wallace deserves plaudits for pressing Trump to denounce white supremacists, we would not even be in this situation if Fox News and the right-wing media had not spent decades and billions of dollars promoting hate. Trump is most rambling monologues on Tuesday night were hard to follow for anyone not completely immersed in the Fox News conspiracy universe. Right after his horrific call-out to the Proud Boys, Trump declined an invitation to call for restraint following the election, calling instead for his supporters to show up as an intimidating force at the polls. Wallace the n just let him go on unabated, making groundless allegations about election integrity. When Wallace asked Trump why he insisted on holding campaign rallies in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump falsely said all of his rallies had been outdoors. Wallace simply replied: ""You are right."" Wallace also tried to get Trump to shut up by promising him a softball: ""You will like this next question.""Give Wallace credit for asking a climate change question, the first in a presidential debate since 2008, and almost getting an answer. But he failed as a moderator because Fox News ca not be trusted when the network is entire motive is propaganda. The network even ran Trump campaign propaganda after the debate. Wallace is own colleagues will not defend him from Trump, even in the next hour, because they rely on Trump and his viewers.— Donald J Trump (@Donald J Trump)1601438270.0And no, Bernie Sanders, who famously held a Fox News town hall, would not have fared better.

368,Ivanka Trump Is Probably Next on the Chopping Block: Former Federal Prosecutor,-11.83,36.17,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/ivanka-trump-next-for-manhattan-da,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-06,25,"As you have no doubt heard by now, last week the Trump Organization and its longtime CFO,were hit wit ha slew of criminal charges, including conspiracy, grand larceny, and multiple counts of tax fraud and falsifying records, all of which they pleaded not guilty to. Clearly this is extremely bad news for not just the company, which former executives believe is going to be “destroy[ed],” and Weisselberg, who faces more than a decade in prison if convicted on all charges, but the entire Trump clan too. WhileDonald Trumpis obviously the first name that comes to mind when envisioning a scenario in which a Trump family member is sentenced to time in prison, according to numerous experts, his adult children should be extremely concerned as well, starting with his favorite offspring:Ivanka Trump. Appearing on MSNBC on Monday, former federal prosecutor told hostAlicia Menendezthat last week is charges were merely “an opening salvo,” and that the Manhattan District Attorney is Office has sent a message that (1) Weisselberg should really, really consider flipping and cooperating against the Trumps, and (2)Cyrus Vance Jr.is just getting started. “Prosecutors went to an amazing amount of effort to show Weisselberg ‘we have everything we need,’ and they are really not only pressuring him to flip, but the amount of detail in this indictment tells me that they are trying to tell other people you have got to flip, because ‘we have everything; we have the double books. We know what you told your tax accountants was a lie. We know that we are gonna be able to prove these cases,’” Alksne told Menendez. “So I think...first it is Weisselberg and [then] there are a lot of other people mentioned, ‘individual number one’ or ‘person X signed’ or ‘person Y signed.’ Those people who are mentioned in the indictment, I would expect they are next and the n it builds.” Asked how she would proceed if she were prosecuting the case and “had access to the years of hidden records kept by the Trump Organization,” Alksne said, “I would focus [the investigation] on the kids. Apparently they have had some testimony byth e comptroller; in the state of New York that means they have essentially given him immunity. So I would focus on the kids. My guess is [COOMatthew] Calamariis kind of easy picking and that there are similar ways to give money for the kids. We have heard a lot of this reporting about Ivanka Trump getting consulting fees, ‘consulting fees’ for things that she may or may not have done. That looks to me like the next place, but we will just have to see.”(In November,New York Timesreportedthat both Vance and New York attorney general had issued consulting-fee-related subpoenas to the Trump Organization following an investigation by the paper that revealed the president had paid little to no income tax over the last two decades. That report also showed that Trump was able to reduce his taxable income by deducting approximately $26 million in “consulting fees” as business expenses between 2010 and 2018. While the consultants’ identities were not shown on tax records, some of the fees definitely appeared to have been paid to Ivanka, given that on a 2017 disclosure form, she reported having received $747,622 in payments from a consulting company she co-owned, a figure that, per theTimes,“exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.” (At the time the payments were made, Ivanka was an executive officer of the Trump companies that made the payments, meaning she seemingly was treated as a consultant to a company at which she was, wait for it, a full-time employee.)Alsopredictingthat Princess Purses could be in legal trouble was Trump biographer who told CNN isJim Acostaon Sunday, “The other person who I think is in peril is Ivanka Trump. One of the things that Allen Weisselberg is in trouble for is [allegedly] taking money as a contractor and the n claiming self-employed status so that he can get some of the retirement benefits that the tax code allows for self-employed people. Well, we know that Ivanka Trump got quite significant sums paid to her as non-employee compensation. That freed the Trump Organization from paying part of her taxes, and it put her in a status that I think the IRS would have lots of questions about. So these folks do not know how to play the game straight. I think everything they do is crooked.”Ivanka Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing; in response to the news that both Vance is and James is offices had subpoenaed records related to consulting fees, she issued a very testy statement on Twitter,writing: “This is harassment pure and simple. This ‘inquiry’ by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. They know very well that the re is nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. These politicians are simply ruthless.”As for whether Trump would sacrifice himself to save his daughter, his former attorney has a prediction:This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.hereto subscribe.— InsideJeffrey Epstein is Decades-Long RelationshipWith Leslie Wexner— Trump is Deranged Replacement Theory Might haveLost Him the Election—Jeff Bezos and Elon MuskWant to Burn Their Cash in Space— ThreeTexans Bust MythsAbout the Alamo is Famous “Last Stand”— The Guy Who Could Send Trump to Prison May SoonCooperate With the Feds— Bill and MelindaGates is Epic Divorce SagaEnters Its Next Phase— Juneteenth, Critical Race Theory, and theWinding Road Toward Reckoning— Trump Is NowUrging People Not to VaccinateTheir Kids Against COVID— From the Archive: Microsoft is Odd Couple, in the Words of Paul Allen.",1,1,Vanity Fair
369,Inside the Project Veritas Plan to Steal the Election,-19.0,33.0,https://newrepublic.com/article/158622/inside-project-veritas-plan-steal-election,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-03,25,"James O’Keefe had big plans for 2020. The founder of Project Veritas, the conspiratorial right-wing group that specializes in Fox News–friendly “stings” intended to expose supposed liberal bias and corruption in American society, was planning on getting married this past May The wedding, to a public schoolteacher, was to be at an exclusive country club in upstate New York. The guest list was packed with Make America Great Again world cognoscenti: Donald Trump Jr., Sean Hannity,Michelle Malkin, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and his activist wifeGinni were all invited, as were several of O’Keefe is most generous conservative donors, includingTexas shale oil billionaire George Bishop and Bullpen Capital founder PaulMartino. The wedding was, per an email blast, “postponed indefinitely”over the coronavirus, as the pandemic swept across the state this spring an dearly summer. Although O’Keefe himself declined to comment on this and many other details for this story, awell-placed fr enemy is “90 percent sure they broke up.” Inany event, while the pandemic may have derailed his personal life, it has only heightened the urgency of some of O’Keefe is most lucratively funded dirty tricks. For well over a year, Project Veritas has been secretly producing undercover stings designed to undermine the integrity of absentee and mail-inballot counts—an endeavor code named “Diamond Dog,” according to documents we have obtained. Diamond Dog began as only one facet of Project Veritas is 2020 rat-fucking strategy, but with the onset of the pandemic, which has made in-person voting a dicey proposition, it has since become one of the group is to p-line actionitems. The shift reflects the Republican Party is near-existential concerns about mail-in voting in November. Donald Trump has disingenuously railed against the practice numerous times over the past few months, betraying a deep anxiety. “Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime andVOTER FRAUD!” he has tweeted. At other times he hasclaimed: “It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history”;“IT WILL ALSO LEADTO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY”;and “SCAM!” Last week, he went so far as to suggest that the election should bedelayed,saying that because of “Universal Mail-in Voting,” the vote would be “INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT.”The purpose of Diamond Dog, as one source close to the organization put it, is “literally to get Trump reelected.” Thissource, like other past and present Project Veritas employees who have talked to us for this article, expressed fear of reprisals from the group and would only speak under the condition of anonymity. Last year, Project Veritas isdonor development team solicited big-ticket funders with a pitch deck—frequently tailored to a given patron is pet ideological grievances and personal hang-ups—offering tantalizing details about the group is undercover operations for the 2020campaign cycle. One iteration of this Apple Keynote file was prepared for ana sk meeting with a person who appears to beCognex Corporation founderRobert Shillman, a devoted funder of Islamophobic causes who was also one of O’Keefe iswould-be wedding guests. (Shillman ended up pledging to donate $50,000 to the group.) The slate of investigations in the “Dr. Bob” pitch included schemes to procure evidence of “illegal aliensvoting,” mail-inballot tampering at “nursinghomes,” and“the sale of absentee ballots and voter profiles on the ‘Dark Web.’”By the end of summer 2019, Diamond Dog had already grown to be across-country effort, based on internal Project Veritas memos, research notes,and other documents that we have obtained. InCalifornia and Texas, Project Veritas has tasked its operatives with unearthing supposed evidence of widespread mail-in ballot forgery. In bothstates, Project Veritas has worked to infiltrate the groups of volunteers and paid canvassers who collect absentee and mail-invoter applications from low-income, elderly, and minority groups—a perfectly legal practice in most states that conservatives have tried to label as nefarious “ballot harvesting.”In Texas, Project Veritas has also coordinated in secret with a local Republican operative named AaronHarris, code named “Dragon,” currently chief of staff to Republican congressman Lance Gooden. In turn, through the activist grouphefounded, Direct Action Texas, Harris has helped Project Veritas covertly strategize with a staffer working for the office of the state is Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxtonis leading the state is “election integrity initiative,” one of many Republican efforts nationwide to suppress the vote under the guise of rooting out the nearly non-existent threat of voter fraud. Granted, Project Veritas, whose fervor to own the libs is matched only by its comical incompetence, is hardly likely to tip the election inDonald Trump is favor all byitself. But it is at the vanguard of a larger underhanded approach thatRepublicans, starting at the very to p, are taking to the 2020 cycle. If they want to win, they really have no other choice but to undermine the vote: Trump is poll numbers are in the basement, and he appears constitutionally incapable of making appeals beyond his hardcore supporters on the right. Republicans have all but admitted that this is their strategy. Incoordination with the Republican National Committee and a raft of independent conservative groups, Trump has staked the success of his entire reelection campaign to a widespread voter suppression effort built on the pretext of preserving election integrity. The project, led by his campaign is senior counsel Justin Clark, has worked top lace operatives in at least 10 battleground states to challenge voter rolls and procedures. Between lawsuits and local advertising blitzes—allregularly relayed to Trump in the Oval Office—the effort could cost “wellover $20 million,” as the RNC told The Washington Post. Project Veritas has been among the on-the-ground organizations at the forefront of these efforts and has benefited substantially as a result. According to internal Project Veritas documents, the group is fundraising total for 2019 leaped up to mor ethan $13.44 million, $4.58 million more than their 2018 returns and the group is largest reported annual revenue figure to date. The group may be comically incompetent, but in these cursed times, we all know how dangerous comical incompetence can be once enough money and cl outline up behind it. For an operation premised on conspiracy the ories and fueled by raging paranoia, it will come as no surprise that the agents helping to spearhead Project Veritas is election mischief are oddballs on the fringes ofAmerican political life. In one slide prepared forDr. Bob, a 69-year-old Florida resident, a registered Republican named JosephVancheri notifies O’Keefe of his soon-to-bestatus as a poll worker in Broward County, likely for undercover Election Daysnooping on Project Veritas isbehalf. Vancheri,an ex-copanddie-hardTrumpsupporter,has routinely taken to Facebook to lash out against “all the Trump haters” and “SHEEP,” including“SHIFTY SCHIFF” and “the Idiot Warren,” using Trump ispreferred epithet “Pocohontas[sic].” Afirst-generation immigranthimself, Vancheri has nevertheless long harbored hard line views on immigration that echo his anxieties over the potential for illicit enfranchisement of foreigners. In anotherslide, Project Veritas boasts of receiving a tip fro ma former broadcast meteorologist named ArchKennedy, who found it suspicious that 300 people were all registered to vote at the address for Emory University isEmory Muslim Student Association in Atlanta. (In all likelihood these voters,who constitute 2 percent of Emory istotal student population and .0028 percent of Georgia is population, have their mail forwarded there.) In 2017,Arch organized one of the anti-Muslim groupACT! For America is28 nationwide “March Against Sharia” rallies. Held in Atlanta isPiedmont Park, it was a sparsely attended affair but still managed to includeRepublican Georgia State Senator Michael Williams, the n mounting a doomed primary campaign for governor. It is unclear if either Vancheri or Kennedy is offerings matured into full-fledged stings banked for the 2020 election. Neither they nor Project Veritas responded forcomment, while the Project Veritas source who supplied the “Dr. Bob” pitch deck admitted that “a lot of it was kin da BS,” another example of the group “hyping the mselves up to make the mselves look better” and squeeze more money out ofdonors. Project Veritas went back to the well this weekend, soliciting donors in amassemailSaturday afternoon that promised a major ballot harvesting investigation that needs to be “completed as soon as possible.”But other stings outlined in the Keynotefile did materialize. The presentation, for example, teased an inside man atPinterest who was “increasinglyworried” about the platform is “expanding community safetyrestrictions.” Sure enough,two months later, an ex-Pinterest Android app developer named Eric Cochran came forward with (later debunked)allegations in aseriesofProject VeritasvideosandaNewsweekop-edclaiming that the platform was censoring anti-abortion Christian advertisers. The pitch deck also promised an exposé from a “CNN Insider” namedCary Poarch, a bombshell that fizzled in October 2019 when Poarch is hiddenrecordings, taken while working asa freelance satellite truck operator for the newsnetwork, failed to expose more than the personal opinions of a few randomemployees. Well before the pandemic drew national attention to mail-invoting, these documents show a discernible focus on “ballot harvesting” asp art of the larger Republican effort to paint voting by mail as a threat to democracy. The concern stems from the party is entrenched belief that, as Trump hastweeted,vote-by-mail “does not work out well for Republicans,”since it often helps low-income people and minorities. By late August 2019, the “Story Objective” for DiamondDog had expanded, per one internal meeting document, to exposing “corruptionwithin CA ballot harvesting companies and other states (TX) based on intelgains.” A Project Veritas undercover operative code named “Magnum” had been busy “attending localDemocratic events in CA to find discussions of harvesting.” Anotheroperative code named “GDog” was creat ingan entrapment scheme by posting “ads online looking for people to join his ballot harvesting.”Texas has been a major the ater for Project Veritas is Diamond Dog operations, in no small measure because raw demographics have been threatening to turn the state blue for years. The sense of crisis comes from the state GOP isfailure to bring Latinos into their voting bloc. The legacy of such botched strategi zing has been an assault on the state is Latinoelectorate itself, with right-wing officials and political operatives raising suspicions about their very legitimacy as legal participants in the votingprocess. Aaron Harris,a son of white evangelical missionaries who picked up Portuguese while growing up in Brazil and went on to become fluent inSpanish, has been relentlessly stoking paranoia over mail-in ballots since his first failed foray as a paid political consultant in 2014. Despitea sizable war chest from Dallas hotel magnate andTea Party financier Monty Bennett, Harris is candidates in the 2015 local election forth e Tarrant Regional Water District lost. He quickly became fixated on the idea that thousands of forged mail-in ballot applications had been responsible forth eir defeat. Unlike someProject Veritas associates, Harris has already managed to stir up some public alarm about alleged balloting fraud in cooperation with elected officials from the Republican Party. He has made repeated open records requests for “applications for ballot by mail” and copies of signed “ballot carrier envelopes”inTarrant Countyandelsewhere in Texas, eyeballing the signatures one ach for signs of fraud. (Emily J Will, the board-certified forensic document examiner who tried to warn60 Minutesabout the dubious provenance of President George W Bush issupposedly doctored Air National Guard records in 2004, told us that anon-expert like Harris could not be relied upon to discern a forged signature.)In 2016, Harrissent the fruits of that labor to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, leading to four conspicuously timed indictments two years later ont he eve of the 2018 midterm elections. Paxton described the four Hispanicwomen, paid canvassers soliciting mail-in ballot applications door-to-door, asa n “organized voter fraud ring.” He named (but did not charge) a former local Democratic Partyleader, Stuart Clegg, as the ringleader in the court filings. That case, which is still ongoing, reveals the ways in which the official GOP subtly coordinates with its army of right-wing irregulars in the field. Paxtonstridently enforce sone of the strictest voter ID laws in the nation,while Harris and his political allies at Direct Action Texas and Empower Texanswork to independently legitimize the attorney general is partisan vendettas. Harris and local Republicanlawyer Alex Kim, for example, inserted the mselves into the prosecution is case by independently visiting one of the charged canvassers inprison, seemingly on their own initiative, in an effort to coerce the woman into flipping on Clegg. (A month after helping Harris sneak into the TarrantCounty Jail to harass the canvasser, Kimwona local race top reside over the entire county as a judge for Texas is 323rd District Court.)Paxton is office has often pursued these voter fraud cases through a prosecutorial diversion program, allowing them to juke their stats with“de minimis”caseswithout ever having to prove their arguments in open court or subject their methods to independent review. Their biggest confirmed conviction to date: sending a 37-year-old Mexican citizen and mother of four,Rosa Maria Ortega,to prison for eight years for the high crime of being confused that her status as a legal resident in Texas did not actually confer unto her the voting privileges of full USs citizenship. Ortega voted inf ive elections between 2004 and her 2017 sentencing, casting ballots forRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012—and, tragically,for Ken Paxtonhimself in the 2014 Texas attorney general is race. All signs point toward Paxton getting even more aggressive in2020, thanks to a wrecked-up and paralyzed response to the pandemic by bothTrump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Republicans are nervous that evenblood-red Texas might be in play come November. Last April, Paxtonthreatenedfelony charges for anyone who requests or advocates for mail-in ballots “based solely on fear of contracting Covid-19”—a move that was upheld by the Texas Supreme Court in May, the n by the Trump-stacked US Supreme Court in June. It is now sure to set the stage for many of the alleged mail-in schemes that Project Veritas will purport to expose later thisyear. One local ProjectVeritas operative assigned to coordinate with Aaron Harris in Texas is also af ormer undercover volunteer: Cassandra Spencer, code named “Foxtrot” and sometimes “FoxtrotSmith” internally. In 2017,Spencer became O’Keefe is “Facebook Insider” after leaving a public information officer post with thePflugerville, Texas, police department to joinFacebook is contingent workforce operationsatBCForwardin Austin as a social media content moderator. Spencer has positioned herself at the extremely online intersection of gaming culture and the alt-right. She hasdescribedherselfas a “Proud Boy is Girl” onMedium andattended“Austin is premier anime convention”IKKiCONinFinal Fantasy Xcosplay. She traveled toWashington, DC, for the inauguralDeploraBalland operates her own Twitch stream, which she dubbed “a FirstAmendment zone” for her conservative followers, “not like many others.” For the 2020 Democratic primary in Iowa,Spencer posed as a volunteer for presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren andBernie Sanders as part of a Project Veritas sting the n-codenamed “GoldMine.”Already staked out on the Texas ballot-harvesting vanguard, Aaron Harris “met with Foxtrot”in person and “gave her a lead with someone to follow,” per internal Project Veritas research notes. As Diamond Dog progressed, Harris is ties to Project Veritas deepened to include longtime employee and recruiting directorSpencer Meads, code named “Brady,” and possibly an undercover journalist(UCJ)codenamed“Peter Pan.” Project Veritas is expanding pool ofTexas sources was meant to be a state secret, but the document offered a huge clue about who might be involved in an all-caps and highlighted portion that read: “CANNOT MENTIONATTORNEY GENERAL.” In the samedocument, after listing a series of major metropolitan areas in Texas as potential sites for their “ballotharvesting” investigation, a question is proposed: “Wheredoes the AG is guy suggest they go?”When pressed for comment on his apparent role in facilitating communications between the Texas attorney general is office and Project Veritas, Harris responded via his congressional email, “Do not contact me about my previous employment on official channels. Learn to be competent at your job.” Afterit was pointed out to Harris that the internal Project Veritas documents we resourced in the early fall of 2019, approximately 10 months after he became CongressmanGooden is chief of staff, Harris becamebelligerent. To questions reiterated via personal text message, he responded, “I have asked you to stop harassing me and you want to argue about it? You are an idiot. You just keep proving it.”Spencer did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Only two principal targets, old Harris foes, were mentioned byname in the Project Veritas strategy document: Texas-based personal injury attorneyDomingo Garcia, a former state representative and the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC; and theHarvestProject Food Rescueof Dallas, a community group that Harrisseemstobelieveis an insidious front through which the state is left-wing operatives entice immigrantcommunities, with the lure of unsold fresh produce donated by localdistributors, into filling out their own mail-in ballots and thus enfranchising the mselves. (“I wake up usually at 4:30 in the morning,I have to go pick up the food by six,” Harvest Project co-founder Danaë Gutiérrez-Martínezsaid when asked about Harris is allegations. “Ido not get home ’til eight at night, nine at night, sometimes, to get up the next day and do it again, especially right now with everythingthat is happening. You know, I must be Superwoman if I have time to do anythingelse.”)A long-since-ousted co-founder of the Harvest Project, JoseBarrientos was very publicly implicated in a mail-in ballot forgery scheme in 2017. But Paxton and the local district attorney ultimately indicted someone else entirely, 27-year-old Miguel Hernandez, for the felonyoffense. After 180 days stewing in jail, Hernandez was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor with the understanding that his sentence would be limited to time served. Less well known than O’Keefe is blunders on the national stage are the numerous documented instances in which his stings have been cited to justify new and more onerous voter ID laws. The beef between Harris isgroups and LULAC has been considerably more fraught. In the fall of 2016,Garcia publicly offered a $25,000 reward, funded through LULAC, for any information leading to the conviction of individuals “trying to intimidate a senior in Fort Worth or anywhere in Texas.” The target of their bounty was pretty clear, teed-up as it was by a Texas staterepresentative, Ramón Romero, who had called out Harrisby name for his door-to-door inquisition of seniors in Fort Worth is predominantly Hispanic north side. Later at that same press conference, a related community service nonprofit, the UnitedHispanic Council of Tarrant County, announced that it had filed a complaint with the US Department of Justice against Harris is Direct Action Texas for creating “anatmosphere of fear and intimidation” in local Hispanic neighborhoods. In January 2019, LULACfiled a lawsuit against Attorney General Paxton and the secretary of state in Texas, David Whitley, accusing them both of violating the Voting Rights Act in their haphazard attempt to purge the state is voter rolls of non-citizens. Whitley is offices would quietly walk back their initial list of 95,000suspicious voters, many of whom were discovered to be, in fact, naturalizedcitizens. Shortly thereafter, San Antonio federal district court Judge FredBieryput a stop to the purge, declaring that stateRepublicans were trying “to ferret the infinitesimal needles out of the haystack of 15million Texas voters.” Harris, for his part, was unrepentant,telling theTexas Observer, “We are changing the entire discussion on voter fraud in Texas.” He was notwrong. While Harris is now planning to run for a House seat himself, his tireless efforts there have laid the groundwork for Project Veritas and its GOPpartners this election season. When mainstream Americans think about James O’Keefe, if they think about James O’Keefe at all, it isusually in reference to his most hilarious failures:ruining his owns ting on George Soros is Open Society Foundationbyleaving a self-incriminating voicemail;failing to lure a CNN reporter onto his yacht for adet ailed “faux seducing” prank;revealing his unseemly ties to the billionaire mercenary ErikPrinceby posting his own vanity spy training photos on social media. If Diamond Dog follows theProject Veritas playbook, it will likely focus on goosing a few unguarded comments out of canvassers and other volunteers in the hope of netting an inflammatory sound bite or two. A modest, practically harmless October Surprise. But it is typically down ballot where the averageProject Veritas video tends to have its most pernicious effects. Less wellknown than O’Keefe isblunders on the national stage are the numerous documented instances in which his stings have been cited to justify new and more onerous voter ID laws or other election integrity legislation in state legislatures across the country. In April 2012, Chris McDaniel, the n Mississippi is Senate elections committee chairman, cited aProject Veritas voter fraud video as evidence justifying the passage of the state is “photo identification requirement” bill⁠,which the state is Republican GovernorPhil Bryant signed that May Despitelegalchallenges, this law is still on the books today. Also that year, a Republican Minnesota state representative,Steve Drazkowski, praised a locally shot O’Keefe video—in which ProjectVeritas undercover operatives requested ballot applications for their friends “TimothyTebow and Thomas Brady”—during a floor debate for his party is own draconian voter ID bill. WhileMinnesota is Democratic GovernorMark Dayton vetoed a strict version of that voter ID legislation, and Minnesotavoters backed his decision in a ballot initiative later that year, the state is Republican Party still plans to revisit the issue again this year. (“Wehave had a number of studies that have been completed, the re is a lot of new data on this to pic, and there are court cases that have been decided,” as Minnesota GOP State Senator ScottNewman ominously put it, “none of which we had in 2012.”)O’Keefe is “Primaryof the Living Dead” stunts during the NewHampshireandNorth Carolinaprimaries in 2012—inwhich his operatives requested but crucially did not actually attempt to use,the ballots of deceased primary voters—aidedthe passage of stringent voter ID laws in thosestates. After New Hampshireenacteda law in 2018 tightening the state is voting statutes, partly in response to anew series of Project Veritas videos, Democratic legislators maderepeatedattemptsto repeal the m, only to be thwarted byRepublican Governor Chris Sununu isveto. O’Keefe iswealthy donors surely remember these and other victories in vivid detail, in no small measure because they are reiterated tirelessly during O’Keefe is paid speaking engagements and fundraisingconclaves. Among Project Veritas is2019 contributors were several wealthy political groups, charitable foundations,and conservative billionaires with apparent interests in the outcome of DiamondDog. From California,a donation of at least $10,000froma pledged $100,000came to Veritas from SusanGroff,presidentof the Los Angeles-area construction equipment rental company Northwest Excavating. A prolific Republican donor along with her husband Howard, both Groffs were praised as “good friends, entrepreneurs and patriots” i na loving tribute entered into the Congressional Record byth eir longtime beneficiary, former GOP House Representative Elton Gallegly. (Another $50,000 came into Project Veritas from a donor listed only as “Arnott”; the Orange County-based investment guruRobert D Arnott, aKoch network ally and prolific Republican donor, denied responsibility when reached via email.)In Texas, another $50,000 was passed on to Project Veritas from the Texas Free Market Fund through the groupDonors Trust, the dark money “donor-advisedfund” that has helped make contributions from the Kochs, the DeVos family, and others untraceable in future IRS filings. Thecharitable foundation of late Texas oilman Ken W. “Stinky” Davis, based like Project Veritas allyAaron Harris in Tarrant County, also kicked in $5,000 to the group, the latest in the foundation is influential spending spree on Republican politics in the Lone Star Stateandacross the country. In Florida, another donation of $50,000 came to the group throughDonors Trust, this time from the free market defenders at the Thomas W SmithFoundation. There was also a whopping$261,000 donation from the “Smith Family.” Could it beth e Smith family that has monopolized local network TV affiliates through SinclairBroadcasting? Or is it Randall and Barbara Smith, Palm Beachresidents whose vulture fund Alden Global Capital was once described by JoshuaBenton, the founder of Harvard is Nieman JournalismLab, as “the gelatinous cu bescouring the news industry is dungeon”? Neither Smithfamilies responded to requests for clarification on this issue. Many additional hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of contributions to Project Veritas were attributed solely to “DT” ont he group is quarterly financial meeting documents. The initials may refer to Donors Trust or to the constellation of corporate and (ostensibly) philanthropic organizations tied toPresident Donald Trump himself. While Trump is a well-known past donor toProject Veritas—a framed photo of him and O’Keefe rests prominently on a bookshelf at ProjectVeritas headquarters in Mamaroneck, New York—many other donors were evidently so secret that they were listed simply as “anonymous” even on the group is own internaldocuments.

But as usual for Reid, the bitter, vile pundit refused to apologize and accept responsibility. Reid instead chose to put the onus on the American people, President Trump, and even the news media for refusing to put sufficient focus on the terroristic threat that wide swaths of Christianity and the right pose to a safe America. As far as she was concerned, Reid only conceded her claim that Trump supporters were bein gin the way Muslims were, was“not exactly the most artful”point.hat does the radicalization of…Muslim extremists, why does that get so much more attention than the radicalization of white domestic terrorists like the Boogaloo Boys? My next guests will help us unpack that duel reality,”Reid said in a tease. Reid returned after a break for what would be almost 16 minutes of discussion and began with Reid complaining about Islamophobia for about four minutes before she brought up the whole reason why she was having the segment. Here were some highlights of her lead-in (click “expand”):For decades, America is Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or head scarf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased.(….)To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they are not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It is the mis portrayal that is the problem, not the people…. But when white Christians are radicalized, we do not react the same way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them?I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groups seeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both a scare tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather than stand up to that threat, the President of the USs is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the fire starter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election.(….)We have never had a president do that and he is getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he is doing?Should terrorism across the spectrum be denounced? Absolutely. Whether it is Antifa or the Boogaloo Boys, it should all be denounced. But for Reid, she wants you to think the issue lies almost exclusive with the right. After that bout of whataboutism, Reid addressed her own rhetoric by stating that she wondered on Monday how else one could describe what Trump is allegedly doing in priming millions to commit and/or support acts of terror and it spawnedReid took a shot at those criticizing her, condemning of those talking about the Monday shindig as having“not”engaged“in good faith.”Before bringing on is Naveed Jamali and Institute for Social Policy and Understanding is Dalia Mogahed to praise her as a true friend of Muslims, Reid added:Some of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have been subjected to the kind of stereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and we should all be sensitive to that, and I certainly should have been sensitive to that. Having been on-set on Monday, Reid called on Jamali first and asked him to help their discussion since what she had originally said was“not exactly the most artful way of asking that question.”Jamali spoke to his military service following 9/11 and a desire to serve his country as a way of showing his fellow Americans that Muslims are patriotic and not to be seen as terrorists. But after that important and necessary reminder, he shifted to Reid is comments and defended her by attacking the President. Before asking Mogahed to bail her out, Reid again appeared to admit that what she said on Monday did not “work,” but never apologized (click “expand”):REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entire segment was about. The segment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying about saying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he is done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we will put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entire subject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It is something he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work, so I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?MOGAHED: Well, thank you so much, Joy. I want to first say that I have been on your show before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fair shake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let us speak for ourselves and you are fair to us when we are on your show, so I think that that is an important point to make. The way that I heard your statement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard by some people, many people, in fact, was unintentionally saying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that is why I think it is so important to have this conversation[.]Reid the n rehashed what isbecome a fact-free cr i de coe ur in insisting that Black Lives Matter groups and sympathizers are not to blame for any of the violence seen this summer across American cities, but it is right-wing groups that have been the troublemakers. And in a truly farcical claim, she insisted that the two men killed in Kenosha were merely out in the streets when Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot them. She described Anthony Huber as merely“a young skateboarder”(instead of a domestic abuser) and Joseph Rosenbaum as only“a dad”when, in reality, he was a convicted sex offender.

We will be right back.(….)7:44 p.m. EasternREID: For decades, America is Muslim community has endured blanket portrayals that focus on one thing, just one thing. Not their families or individual achievements or even anything about Islam. Nope! Just one thing: terrorism. Particularly after 9/11, profiling became a near American obsession for anybody brown God forbid with a beard or head scarf, whether they were Muslim or not, traveling through an airport could be hell. Physical attacks on not just Muslims but also Sikhs, who are not Muslim, increased. And TV shows about Muslims like Homeland and pounded the terrorism the me 24/7. UNIDENTIFED CHARACTER [on Showtime is]: I am a soldier.“CLARE DANES” [on Showtime is]: You are a terrorist.“REBECCA INGRAM” [on Fox is]: I would like to acknowledge the many dedicated people at CTU, and the six Army rangers who risked their lives to stop Ben Khaled from carrying out the attack on this country. REID: Average American Muslims have, for two decades, been pressed to answer for every act of terrorism committed by anyone, anywhere in the world, who claimed to be a Muslim. They are constantly asked, are you going to condemn terrorism, are you, are you? And unfortunately, that has too often been true of the media. According to a 2018 Institute for Social Policy and Understanding study, someone perceived to be Muslim, accused of a terrorism plot will receive 770 percent of the media coverage as somebody not perceived to be Muslim. To be clear, the vast majority of the more than one billion Muslims on the planet, and the millions in this country are decidedly unradical. Everyday people just living their lives when they are not getting profiled by the NYPD or banned by the Trump administration. It is the mis portrayal that is the problem, not the people. And we are all too quick to call out those who seek to radicalize the small number of mostly young men who are vulnerable to be co-opted by violent people. There have been lengthy treatments of this all over cable news for years. But when white Christians are radicalized, we do not react the same way. When is the last time Donald Trump or anyone in his campaign was asked if they are willing to condemn the boogaloo boys by name? Does Bill Barr ever get asked about them? I mean, one of them literally allegedly killed a federal agent in Oakland using a Black Lives Matter rally as cover. Experts, including the FBI, have been warning for years about the radical right-wing, and white nationalist groups seeking to radicalize white Americans and posing a threat of domestic terrorism, including using black lives matter rallies as both a scare tactic and as physical cover to wreak mayhem. And rather than stand up to that threat, the President of the USs is accelerating it. We are living in a time when the President is the fire starter. He is helping to radicalize his own followers, to try to help his re-election. The same way that he gleefully encouraged violence during his initial presidential run. DONALD TRUMP [on 03/01/16]: Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. Look at these people. [SCREEN WIPE] Get out of here. Get out! Out, out, out. [SCREEN WIPE] In the old days, which is not so long ago, when we were less politically correct, that kind of stuff would not have happened. Today, we have to be so nice, so nice. [SCREEN WIPE] [on 06/28/20] They are not protesters. Those are not -- those are anarchists. They are agitators. MARK MCCLOSKEY [on 08/24/20]: Anarchy and chaos on our streets. HARRIS FAULKNER: The NYPD is reporting 28 shootings from over the weekend. That is a 600% increase. REID: We have never had a president do that and he is getting help from his party and media outlets who are literally celebrating vigilantism and turning an alleged killer into their version of a hero. If Trump was a Muslim leader, not the leader of the Christian right, how would we in the media describe what he is doing? I asked that question on Monday, and there was a lot of conversation, particularly online after the segment aired, some of which was frankly not in good faith. But some of the conversation reflected the genuine feelings of people who have been subjected to the kind of stereotyping that I just described and who take matters like this to heart because of it and we should all be sensitive to that, and I certainly should have been sensitive to that, so let is talk about it now. Joining me now is Naveed Jamali,editor at large, and my guest on Monday. And Dalia, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. Thank you both for being here. And Naveed, I am going to back to you. I am going to play quickly the section of the interview that was in question. REID [on 08/31/20]: When leaders let is say in the Muslim world talk a lot of violent talk, and encourage their supporters to be willing to commit violence, including on their own bodies, in order to win against whoever they decide is the enemy, we in the US media describe that as they are radicalizing those people, particularly when they are radicalizing young people. That is how we talk about the way Muslims act. When you see what president trump is doing, is that any different from what we describe as radicalizing people?REID: Not --- not exactly the most artful way of asking that question, obviously, based on the reaction, but Naveed, can you contextualize it a better way of making that point just from a national security point of view. NAVEED JAMALI: Let me just tell you what it meant to me and the actual visuals that I had in my mind. You know, I am someone that came of age as in the 9/11 generation. When I think of being a brown man in America, there are two-way points that define what it Americans for me and that is 9/11 and the n the Muslim ban. And after 9/11, you know, when you talk about being radicalized, we all know the 19 hijackers, who they were, what they were I felt a very strong urge to counter this, that it was not enough to stand up and say something, but I wanted to do something and the best way I thought I could do that is join the military, and that is exactly what I did. I am not alone. There are plenty of brown and Muslim men and women, whether they joined the military or anything else, wanted to speak out and address this, so to me, what I took that to be is a question of, you know, this double standard that exists when we talk about brown and Muslim people in this country and how we hold us to a monolithic standard. You know, as you said, when there is a terrorist act within our community, we are all expected to apologize, to condemn it, which we do because it is the right thing to do. And that same standard is not often applied to other communties. It should be a standard that should be applied universally. So, I took what your question --- not just from a national security standpoint --- but I took it as a brown man whose father is Pakistani, whose father is Muslim, and by the way, who watched that segment. And I wanted to answer in that vein that I took it exactly as this idea that we are a country that has a double standard and even someone that can serve and prove his loyalty, be patriotic is the n thrown the Muslim ban in his face, just like my --- you know, the fellow members of my community. And that is really that double standard that I think we really have to address. I thought that was what the question was and I think it is an important one to ask. REID: Well, Dalia and I want to let you in this and let you respond however you want to respond as well. I mean, you know, and by the way, for the audience, that was not what the entire segment was about. The segment was actually about Donald Trump radicalizing people and his rhetoric and you can go all the way back to, if you talk about Muslims, him lying about saying, you know, I know that, you know, Muslims were celebrating 9/11. I mean, he is done a lot of it. But in that particular instance it was about his relationship to the far, far, far right that he is not discouraging, we will put it that way. But just to let people know that was not the entire subject of the piece because this would have been the panel and not that panel that we had yesterday that was about a different thing. But it did come up and Dalia, you know, I threw that question to Naveed. It is something he and I have talked about and been angry about for a long time. But I guess, you know, the way that I framed it obviously did not work, so I want you to respond to me how that was taken and how that can really be brought up and do you think it even is a fair analogy to make or a fair question to be asked?DALIA MOGAHED: Well, thank you so much, Joy. I want to first say that I have been on your show before and ---REID: Yes. MOGAHED: --- you have always given Muslim voices a fair shake. You --- you are a fair reporter. You give us air time to make our case. You let us speak for ourselves and you are fair to us when we are on your show, so I think that that is an important point to make. The way that I heard your statement was intended to make the analogy, which is a fair one, between radicalization of Muslim extremists and the radicalization of young, white men in this country. The way that it came --- the way that it landed and the way that it was heard by some people, many people, in fact, was unintentionally saying that Muslims were inherently violent or that Muslim --- the way in which Muslims act is violent and though that was not your intention, it is important to correct that notion for your millions of viewers and that is why I think it is so important to have this conversation because what the facts are is that while Muslims receive the vast majority of media coverage when it comes to ideologically-motivated violence, they are by no means the majority of --- they are not the ones that are committing most terrorism in America. The vast majority of terrorists casualties at the hands of terrorism are at the hands of white supremacists and far right extremists in the USs. Most people do not know that. Not only that, but Muslim publics around the world and in the USs are more likely than the general public to actually reject violence against civilians. So, you have this media portrayal on one hand implying and reinforcing the stereotype while the reality on the other hand says the exact opposite. REID: Yeah. I mean, and I guess this is why it annoys me to see the way that Donald Trump has talked about it because you are absolutely right. Here is some statistics and this is from a Georgia State University study. Muslims 80 percent, are as likely as the general public, 74 percent --- so more likely to reject violence targeting civilians carried out by an individual or small group. That is just actual facts. Attacks by Muslims perpetrators received on average 357 percent more coverage than other attacks. So, you know, Dahlia it --- it is vexing because when I see the Boogaloo Boys, you have an officer who Donald Trump sometimes cite who was gunned down. They never tell you who gunned this person down. It was a Boogaloo Boys member. It sounds like a silly name, but they are actually quite dangerous, using nearby peaceful protests that Black lives matter were holding as a cover. Federal authorities identified this man as an Air Force Sergeant, Steven Carrillo. He is 32 years old. He is a member of this group. I ---- I mean, I guess when I do not hear that just described as domestic terrorism in the same way, it irks my spirit and I wonder for the Muslim community how does that land? The fact that we, in the media, do not say immediately terrorism?MOGAHED: Well, I think that many of us do not necessarily want everyone to be called a terrorist and that is a legal term that the media really should not be throwing around against anyone. What we want, though, is simply objective fair coverage of all communities, of all acts of violence, whether they are ideologically motivated or not. What we see is that the term terrorist is only used against Muslims, no matter what their motivation might be and before there is a legal assessment. And that really hurts ordinary people. I mean, we know from our research, Joy, that Muslim children are the most likely group, twice as likely as other children, to be bullied in school and for their faith and as was mentioned, people who are not Muslim who are perceived to be Muslim has the same treatment, so it has real world consequences. Muslim is also the most likely faith group to report, you know, religious-based discrimination. It --- it matters how the media talks about these things because it impacts ordinary people. REID: Yeah, and Naveed, It also matters how our political leaders, and I think Dahlia is absolutely right that let is take that whole terrorism conversation off the table, just encouraging violence when it comes from a leader with as much power as the President of the USs, it feels, to me, more dangerous. I mean, you have had --- and let is just show that --- people do not often show the two men killed in Kenosha. These were two innocent men. Their names are Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum. They were the victims in this case. They died as a result of somebody who came from out of state, allegedly, and shot three people, and they died. One of them was a dad. One of them was a young skateboarder. You have Donald Trump sharing a video on CNN, a white nationalist video that he retweeted falsely blaming Black Lives matter for a 2019 subway assault. So, you know, it is sort of an all --- everybody in on getting blamed for things that they have not done and I want you to listen to an ad by a woman named Elizabeth Newman who left the administration. She was a former assistant secretary for threat prevention in the Department of Homeland Security. Then I want to give each of you a response to respond, Naveed and the n Dahlia. ELIZABETH NEWMAN [in RVAT ad]: From January until March 11th, what you saw instead was a number of good public servants attempting to do their job and the President telling them to stop because he did not want the economy to tank and he did not want a distraction from his campaign. I am sorry, Mr. President. You are hired to handle America is worst day and you have absolutely failed. REID: I am up against very little time. But Naveed, a very quick reaction from you and the n I will give Dahila the last word. JAMALI: So, this is all about dehumanizing people, right? And, you know, when Trump goes on TV and talks about a man shot in the back seven times by a police officer and compares that to choking playing golf, that is who we are dealing with and it is important to understand that really when we talk about this, brown people have been dehumanized. The only way to solve that is by treating us like equals. REID: Yep. Dahlia?MOGAHED: Joy, fair coverage is important for democracy overall. It is not just about how Muslims portrayed. It is about informing the public and giving them facts. REID: Indeed. Naveed Jamali, Dahlia Mogahed, thank you both very much. I really appreciate you guys being here tonight.",0,0,NewsBusters
371,AP Exams Ca not Be Business as Usual This Year (Opinion),-2.33,40.0,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ap-exams-cant-be-business-as-usual-this-year/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,25,"High school seniors are stressed. Their lives have been turned upside down from the pandemic. The process of applying to college, learning, and socializing have all changed. This is a year of disrupted routines. Students and teachers are grappling with new instructional models. Compounding this education challenge is COVID-19 is disproportionate impact on students from families with low incomes and for students who are Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and other people of color. In this turbulent time, there is a constant: In May, students across the country will sit for Advanced Placement exams. Those exams can feel like a golden ticket. The coveted 3, 4, or 5 score on an AP exam means earning college credit while in high school. These exams are a rite of passage for many high school students and a path to academic upward mobility for others. Success on AP exams can mean shaving off a semester or two of pricey college tuition. The College Board knows this and markets the AP exam as a game-changer for students, particularly students of color. And their marketing has worked:Last school year, 2.6 million students from 22,152 secondary schools took more than 4.7 million AP exams during the pandemic. EachAP exam was $94. The total adds up to nearly half a billion dollars. In addition to exams, AP courses go through a strict audit process so that, as the College Board explains, “admissions officers and college faculty can be assured of the rigor of the courses that carry the AP label on student transcripts.” There are no federal regulations or oversight: The College Board determines which students earn AP credit, and those AP credits have a positive impact on those students’ transition to college. I know AP well. I serve as the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction in a diverse suburban school district just north of Chicago. Over the years, I have been a vocal advocate for Advanced Placement exams. I havewrittenabout the importance of an inclusive AP program. In fact, my district has gained national prominence by increasing access and success in AP courses for students of color. I know that taking AP courses can change a student is academic trajectory. We have dedicated teachers and hard-working students. But this year, we have hard-workingandstressed-out teachers and students. Last year, I was apprehensive when the College Board announced that it would provide 45-minute remote, online AP exams to students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was remarkable that with no experience in online assessment, the College Board was making this commitment. However, I held out hope that the College Board could deliver a positive standardized-test experience to students. I was wrong. I received many calls from frustrated parents. Students were unable to up load responses. One hopes that the College Board will be able to resolve the widespread technical difficulties that negatively impacted students and improve test security so that this year online testing will go smoother for those students who cannot test in person. Despite the problems of the past year, high schools are not being afforded flexibility for Advanced Placement exams this spring. According to the College Board,“Looking ahead to May 2021, AP Exams will cover the full course scope and content because colleges expect it.”The message from the College Board is clear: Push through no matter the collateral damage. Pandemic education is not business as usual. Pretending otherwise damages the health and well-being of student sand teachers. In the end, I am left to wonder if, this year, in particular, AP exams will assess privilege rather than academic attainment. Stop and consider that only 21 percent of students nationwide live in districts that started the school year fully in person, and many of those districts have had to to ggle between remote and in-person instruction. From a racial-equity perspective,two-thirds of students of color live in school districts that started the school year fully remotely. Compounding this challenge is that many students have insufficient or no access to the internet. As I write this, more than half a million Americans have died of COVID-19. Yet, the College Board is insistence that this school year is normal has transformed the AP exam from an instrument of upward academic mobility to one of our students’ greatest mental-health risks and will negatively impact many of their transitions to college. There is more than a score at stake this year. In a perfect world, in this imperfect time, the College Board would award credit based on the grades earned in AP classes, not on the end-of-course exams. The College Board credentials AP courses through a strict audit process. It follows that the College Board should trust the grades earned in those courses. Dual-credit programs throughout the country seem to have figured this out already, but they do not make half a billion dollars for their nonprofit. However, we do not live in a perfect world. Instead, let is at the very least acknowledge it is essential that the content of AP tests appropriately represent what is taught during the pandemic. This is a pillar of good assessment practice. That is why it is essential to reduce the content covered on AP exams in the spring. While this is not a perfect solution, it will relieve some stress and is more responsive to the day-to-day uncertainties of schools across this country. In fact, it is what the College Board did in spring 2020. It is far superior to revised pacing guides and videos designed to deliver 75 percent of course content between now and May It is just not an equitable solution given that a Pew Researchstudyfound that 40 percent of low-income parents reported that their children did not have reliable internet access at home. One voice is not enough. In fact, in defending business as usual during the pandemic, the College Board says that it has surveyed AP teachers, and “the majority urged us to stick with the full exam.” Based on my conversations with AP teachers, that does not sit right. If it does not sit right with you, the n make your voice heard; share your perspective with the College Board and the broader community. Together we can work toward a change that preserves the promise of a golden ticket based on what students can do, not on the privilege they hold.",1,1,Education Week
372,VP Harris to campaign for California Governor Newsom as recall race heats up,2.67,43.67,https://nypost.com/2021/08/20/vp-harris-to-campaign-for-california-gov-newsom-in-recall-race/,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,25,"Vice President Kamala Harris will put in a good word forCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsomlater this month as Golden State voters grapple with whether to recall their state is chief executive. The Sacramento Bee reported that Harris will join Newsom at a rally in the Bay Area on August 27 to encourage Californians to vote “no” on Sept. 14 election — in the state is second recall election in fewer than 20 years.“I am excited to join my friend and our vice president next week,” Newsom said in a statement. “The stakes of this election could not be higher.”The intervention from Harris shows the extent of White House concerns about polls showing a close vote on the question of whether to keep or remove Newsom, who was elected governor in 2018 after eight years as second-in-command under fellow Democrat Jerry Brown. Last week, President Bidenissued a statement urging Californians to stand by Newsom, saying the governor had been “a key partner in fighting the pandemic and delivering economic relief to working families and helping us build our economy back better than ever … He knows how to get the job done because he is been doing it.”An average of polls published since July 14 by the web site FiveThirtyEightshowed that support for keeping Newsom as governor was just 1.2 percentage points ahead of the support for ousting him. Under California law, voters who take part in the recall election will first be asked if Newsom should be recalled. If a simple majority votes “yes,” Newsom will become the second California governor to be removed from office midway through his term by the electorate — joining fellow Democrat Gray Davis, who achieved the dubious distinction in 2003. Voters will the n be asked to chose from a list of 46 potential candidates to replace Newsom — nine Democrats, 24 Republicans, two members of the Green Party, a Libertarian and 10 other fringe candidates. If Newsom is recalled, the candidate on the list with the most votes will become California is next governor — no majority necessary. No Democratic office-holders have put their names forward to succeed Newsom should he be recalled. The list of Republican candidates includes former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Newsom is defeated 2018 opponent John Cox and state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley — as well astalk radio host Larry Elderand Olympic gold medalist-turned-reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner.

373,COVID-19: CDC Updates Travel Guidelines For Fully Vaccinated People,0.0,50.0,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/04/02/covid-19-cdc-updates-travel-guidelines-for-fully-vaccinated-people/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-02,17,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidelines for fully vaccinated people on Friday, including flight guidelines, gathering guidelines, and what to do if exposed by someone with COVID-19. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final COVID-19 dose. Those receiving thePfizeror Moderna vaccine are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second (or “booster”) shot. Those receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after taking the single-dose shot. The CDC still recommends caution as variants of the COVID-19 virus have been discovered and are still being researched as far as severity, spreadability, and reaction with the current vaccines.“We are still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19,” the CDC said in its updated guidelines. “After you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions – like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces – in public places until we know more.”As far as flight regulations, those who have been fully vaccinated will not need to take a COVID-19 test, or self-quarantine before a domestic flight. Tests are required three days before flying into the US from another country and there are instances when an international destination may require a test before a flight. The CDC still recommends testing from vaccinated individuals when returning to the US from another country, although it is not mandatory. If you have been fully vaccinated and learn that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, it is not necessary to take a test unless you feel symptoms. As of this writing, all three vaccines have shown to be 100% effective in fighting against severe symptoms of the COVID-19 virus, with Pfizer releasing data, Thursday, showing effectiveness through six months of ongoing trials. The only time the CDC recommended vaccinated folks to self-quarantine for 14 days is if exposed while living in a group setting such as a detention facility or group home. The CDC released its first set of gathering guidelines onMarch 8and they still apply. Fully vaccinated individuals can safely gather indoors with each other. Vaccinated people may also gather with unvaccinated people as long as the unvaccinated people are not at high risk of contracting severe symptoms from the COVID-19 virus. In all cases, fully vaccinated individuals do not need to wear masks or keep 6 feet of distance. ❖NOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

374,"Jim Hormel: Buttigieg, not Grenell, will be the first out LGBTQ Cabinet official",-6.0,42.0,https://www.washingtonblade.com/2020/12/17/jim-hormel-buttigieg-not-grenell-will-be-the-first-out-lgbtq-cabinet-official/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-blade-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"In the aftermath of President-elect Joe Biden nominating Pete Buttigieg as secretary of transportation, the left and right are at each other is throats over whether Biden is pick will be the first openly gay Cabinet official, or if that distinction belongs to former acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell — but one appointee who achieved a historic first for the LGBTQ community says the honor falls to Buttigieg. Former US Ambassador to Luxembourg Jim Hormel, who became the first openly gay US ambassador in 1999 after President Bill Clinton gave him the job through a recess appointment, downplayed Grenell on Thursday and said the real achievement “as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet” goes to Buttigieg.“Pete Buttigieg will be nominated as secretary of transportation, subject to confirmation by the Senate,” Hormel said. “Following his approval he will serve with full authority at the will of the president. He will be the first official openly LGBT member of the Cabinet. His appointment, if approved, will be a milestone.”Hormel, now 87 and responding to an inquiry from the Washington Blade via email, said the basis for rejecting Grenell is appointment as a first for the LGBTQ community rests with the word “acting” in the Trump appointee is title.“The president may appoint an individual to be temporary ‘acting’ head of an agency, bureau or department,” Hormel said. “That appointee can serve in that capacity for a limited period of time without being confirmed by the Senate. Trump has used ‘acting’ appointments time and again, thus avoiding Senate inquiries and investigations.”Like Grenell, Hormel never won Senate confirmation for his presidential appointment. Conservative senators, including the late Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and former Senator John Ashcroft (R-Mo.), refused to allow the Senate to confirm Hormel explicitly on the basis of his being gay. Clinton had to short-circuit the process, using his presidential powers to grant Hormel a recess appointment. But Hormel at least sought Senate approval for his role. Grenell neither sought nor obtained confirmation as acting director of national intelligence, although he had won confirmation for his concurrent role as US ambassador to Germany. Even though Hormel and Grenell had similarities in not obtaining Senate confirmation, Hormel said his “situation differed in two ways.”“First, the hierarchy within the State Department is unique,” Hormel explained. “In the absence of an ambassador there is a charge‘ d’affaires who assumes the duties of ambassador. There is no ‘acting’ position per se. Secondly, in my case, I went through the process of confirmation, but the Senate was prevented from voting. The president the n made a recess appointment, and I went to my post fully accredited.”Grenell, who did not respond to a request for comment for this article, has largely stayed away from the fray on social media on who gets to be called the first openly gay Cabinet member. However, Grenell upon leaving his post as acting DNI this year posted on Instagram that Trump gave him his chair from the Cabinet room and told him being the first openly gay Cabinet official was a “big deal.“Grenell also said during the election in a video that he was the “first openly gay Cabinet member,” which he said demonstrates Trump is “the most pro-gay” president ever despite the anti-LGBTQ record the administration has built. (The Log Cabin video, though widely seen, was also criticized for inaccuracies and taking facts and quotes out of context. During the Biden team is announcement on Wednesday, Buttigieg was careful in his language about the milestone he was setting out to achieve and said his nomination marked “the first time an American president has ever sent an openly LGBTQ cabinet nominee to the Senate for confirmation.”But Buttigieg also recognized he was following in the footsteps of LGBTQ pioneers, explicitly recognizing Hormel is achievement.“I can remember watching the news, 17 years old and seeing a story about an appointee of President Clinton, named to be an ambassador, attacked and ultimately denied a vote in the Senate, because he was gay — ultimately able to serve only by a recess appointment,” Buttigieg said. Buttigieg, who made history as a gay Democratic candidate in the 2020 primary said at the time his career aspiration was to become an airline pilot and “was a long way from coming out, even to myself,” but gained knowledge from Hormel is story.“I learned about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong, and just as important, I saw how those limits could be challenged,” Buttigieg said. “So, two decades later, I ca not help but think of a 17-year-old who might be watching right now, someone who wonders whether and where they belong in the world, or even in their own family, and I am thinking about the message to day is announcement is sending to them.”Hormel, in the email to the Blade the day after Buttigieg praised him, was able to return the favor by offering support.“I enthusiastically support the nomination of Pete Buttigieg as secretary of transportation and will acknowledge him as the first openly LGBTQ member of the presidential Cabinet,” Hormel said.",1,1,Washington Blade
375,"Republicans Want to Overturn Roe vs Wade, and They May Soon Be Able To",-12.0,30.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/abortion-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,23,"Growing up during the 1980s and 1990s, my second-wave feminist mother, writer Erica Jong, was obsessed withBorn in 1942, she came of age in a world without safe legal abortion. She knew what was at stake with the 1973 ruling that protected a woman is right to choose “without excessive government restriction.”Roe vs Wadewas a huge victory for my mother is generation. They could point to the Supreme Court decision as something tangible they did; their blood and sweat had changed the calculus of women is lives. “No more women will die of back-alley abortions,” my mother would say. “No more wire hangers.”When Trump came down that gold escalator on June 16, 2015, to announce his presidential run, there was speculation that a thrice-married adulterer might even be pro-choice. But that was before he said, “There has to be some form of punishment for abortion.” Trump even said that he would install two Supreme Court justices who would overturn telling the polymaths atFox & Friends,“It is certainly possible. And maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they’d give it back to the states. You just do not know what is going to happen.”The irony is,is popular. A NPR/PBS poll released in 2019 showed that77%of Americans believed that the Supreme Court should upholdRoe vs Wade. And making abortion illegal does not actually prevent it. AsZara Ahmed writes, “Abortion rates are actually four times higher in low-income countries where abortion is prohibited than in high-income countries where it is broadly legal.”This week, the dynamic in this long debate took on new dimensions when the Supreme Courtagreed to hear a case that could and likely will result in the overturning ofThe case,Dobbs vs Jackson Women is Health Organization,is a chance for the Supreme Court to rule on the Mississippi law that forbids abortions after 15 weeks. The law was largely created in order to be kicked up to the Supreme Court and give conservatives the opportunity to overturnRoe vs Wade. Previously, it had ruled that bans on abortion before viability—about 24 weeks—were unconstitutional. A decision here would open the door to other conservative states being able to ban abortion. It is worth noting that Mississippi is the poorest state in the nation, with a poverty rate of almost 20%. Many of the women who live in Mississippi cannot afford take a day off of work in order to drive to another state for an abortion. But Governor Tate Reeves is way more interested in regulating women is uteruses than helping his constituents. The reality is that Donald Trump has dramatically changed the makeup of the Supreme Court. NPR is Nina Totenbergsums it up best: “The court now has a 6–3 conservative supermajority, with all six having taken positions hostile to abortion rights at one time or another, and the newest justice, Barrett, the most outspoken critic of abortion before joining the high court.”But before next fall, when the Supreme Court takes up(it will likely deliver its ruling the following summer), before any of that happens, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has already been emboldened by this new conservative “supermajority” to push the infringements on women is rights even further. On Wednesday of this week, Governor Abbot signed an antiabortion bill that would ban abortion after six weeks. (This was the same day, by the way, that his state executedQuintin Jones, a man who was convicted of killing his great-aunt and whose relatives had pleaded for clemency. So much for the sanctity of life.) Six weeks is a mere two weeks after a missed period, when many women do not even know that they are pregnant—but the n, that is the idea. The law also “essentially empowers private citizens to enforce the law by suing abortion providers, whether or not those citizens are connected to a patient,”according to the Texas Tribune. Governor Abbot is extremely concerned about the “life” of an embryo the size of a sweet pea, but he is less worried about those 151 Texans who died during the 2021 winter when the Texas power grid froze after years of deregulation. TheAP reported at the time that, “Many homes went without power or drinkable water for days after subfreezing temperatures, failing power plants, and record demand for heat pushed Texas’ electric grid to the breaking point,” but the n they were not embryos, so. The Trump Supreme Court, the n, is going to overturnThe die is cast; the course is set. We need to be clear-eyed about what is coming. Wealthy women in blue states will be okay. They will have access to safe, legal abortions—but they always (or almost always) have. The women who will suffer are the women who always suffer.“The impact of whatever the Supreme Court decides to do, will be felt by people who are already subject to criminalization and lack of access,” says executive director of We Testify Renee Bracey Sherman, “people of color, trans and non binary people, and undocumented immigrants among others, anybody who already has a difficult time getting the care that they need. We are already seeing the impact of these restrictions and have for the past decade. Our nation is already unjustly punishing people for self-managing their abortions and miscarriages and stillbirths.”We see what is coming, a public health nightmare for women. AsKatha Pollitt writesinAtlantic,“In 1971, the year after decriminalization, the maternal-mortality rate in New York State dropped 45%.” This is not some philosophical conversation about when life begins; it has real-world consequences for people who are actually alive. Women in Mississippi, in Texas, in Louisiana—women who ca not afford an unplanned pregnancy—will die. History tells us that making abortion illegal does not prevent abortion; it just prevents safe abortion. I think of my mother is generation and how hard they fought for us to have control over our bodies.

376,US Democrats Can Learn From the European Left is Failures,-7.0,37.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/04/u-s-democrats-can-learn-from-the-european-lefts-failures/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-04,25,"Despite the Trump administration is corruption, incompetent handling of the pandemic, and racially divisive politics, the Democratic Party did less well in the 2020 elections than many expected.

Despite the Trump administration is corruption, incompetent handling of the pandemic, and racially divisive politics, the Democratic Party did less well in the 2020 elections than many expected. Joe Biden won the presidency but by a smaller margin than predicted, and Democratic performance at the congressional, state, and local levels was disappointing. These results refocused attention on the political challenges facing the Democratic Party, most notably its long-term loss of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, who make up42 percent of the electorate and were Donald Trump is most important constituency. Many view the behavior of white voters through the prism of the USs’ particular history. From this perspective, white voters’ abandonment of the Democratic Party and embrace of Trump are best understood, asVann R Newkirk IIput it, as “The embodiment of half-century of backlash” against the policies Martin Luther King fought to enact. But asLawrence Glickmanargues, the latest backlash is part of “a reactionary tradition, one that is deeply woven into American political culture and that extends back to the era of Reconstruction, at least.”However distinctive and often dismaying US history may be, the defection of working-class, non-college-educated white voters from the left and the success of a nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right are not uniquely American phenomena. Indeed, despite different histories, over the past decades similar developments have occurred in almost all European countries, indicating that some broader, cross-national factors are at least partially to blame. The defection of working-class, non-college-educated white voters from the left and the success of a nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right are not uniquely American phenomena. One that has come in for particular attention in the USs after the 2020 election is what the Democratic strategistJames Carvillerecently referred to as the left is “wokeness” problem. Although simplistically and crudely put, Carville is surely on to something. Over the past several years, the relative emphasis placed by the Democratic Party as well as mainstream left-wing parties in Europe on cultural versus economic issues, and the degree to which these parties have shifted to the left on the former, has created a gap between them and working-class, non-college-educated voters. It is hard to explain the problems currently facing mainstream left-wing parties on both sides of the Atlantic without examining their shifting profiles over the past few decades. During the postwar decades, mainstream left-wing parties in Europe consistently received the support of the vast majority of working-class votes, in some countries up to 70 percent. Indeed, although these parties always enjoyed the support of voters outside the working class, they generally presented the mselves as the champions of workers and the underprivileged and advocated policies such as high levels of social spending, large public sectors, and generous unemployment support that were designed to help them. But as in the USs, voting patterns in Europe began shifting in the 1970s, and working-class voters gradually abandoned mainstream left-wing parties. Today, labor and social democratic parties are not primarily working-class parties but rather parties of whatThomas Pikettyhas referred to as the “Brahmin left”—led and supported by highly educated metropolitan voters. This is similar, of course, to the contemporary American case: Although the Democrats have lost the support of a majority of white working-class voters, the party currently enjoys the support of a majority of college-educated metropolitan ones. (Biden won this group by55 percent to Trump is 42 percent.) Also mirroring the American pattern, in most European countries working-class voters now heavily support nativist, xenophobic, and illiberal right-wing parties such as the French National Rally or the Austrian Freedom Party. In their examinations of support for these parties,scholarsof European politics consistently find views on immigration, national identity, and related issues to be an almost “perfect predictor” of right-populist voting. This is not because racism and xenophobia directly or inexorably determine vote choice. In fact, there is littlecross-nationalor temporal correlation between such sentiments and populist success. Some European countries that score low on measures of racism and xenophobia, like Sweden, have very successful right-wing populist parties, while others that score relatively high on such measures, like Spain and Ireland, have less successful parties of this type. In addition, support for right-wing populism has grown over time, but surveys show that racist and anti-immigrant sentiments have diminished over the same period inEurope. What seems to explain right-wing populist success is not increasing racism or xenophobia but rather that citizens concerned about immigration, and national identity have increasingly voted on the basis of these concerns. With regard to non-college-educated, working-class voters in particular, it is important to stress that in Europe, as in the USs, these voters have always had moderate-to-conservative views on such social and cultural issues. The significant change that has occurred over time is not in these views but rather in the importance or salience of them to their voting choices. Dramatic events such as terrorist attacks or the wave of Syrian refugees that came to Europe in 2015, and the intense media attention focused on such things, have surely mattered. But certainly equally, if not more important, in affecting salience are the actions of politicians and politicalparties. Recognizing that they do well when the salience of immigration and related issues is high, right-wing populists in Europe have worked hard to keep voters’ attention focused on the m,demonizingimmigrants,blamingthem for rising crime, the erosion of national values, and so on. But it is not only right-wing populists who have increased the salience of these issues; mainstream left-wing parties have played a role as well. During the postwar decades, political competition in Europepivotedprimarily around economic issues, with labor and social democratic parties championing the welfare state, government regulation of the market, full-employment policies, and so on. But during the late 20th century, this changed as these parties shifted to the center economically and the differences between them and their center-right competitors diminished accordingly. Read MoreBut in the USs, they show no signs of abatement. Can European far-right parties overcome their differences and boost their clout in Brussels?As Macron is luster fades in local elections, Socialist leaders are planning a return to national politics—in alliance with the Greens. Tony Blair is Labour Party in Britain was the avatar of this trend, but it occurred across Western Europe. The result, as one study put it, was that by the 1990s, mainstream left-wing parties “had more in common” economically with their “main competitors than with [their] own positions roughly three decades earlier.”As they abandoned much of their distinctive economic appeal during the late 20th century, European labor and social democratic parties began paying increasing attention to noneconomic issues such as immigration and national identity and particularly during the last decade or so shifted their positions to the left on them. (Some, such as Denmark is Social Democrats, have recently shifted back to the center, seeking to win their old voters back.)As they abandoned much of their distinctive economic appeal, European labor and social democratic parties began paying increasing attention to noneconomic issues like immigration and national identity. This, along with economic convergence between the mainstream left and right, helped increase the centrality of noneconomic issues in political debate. It also moved mainstream left-wing parties away from the preferences of working-class, non-college-educated voters in particular and the electorate more generally. Arecent study by the political scientists David W Brady, John A Ferejohn, and Aldo Paparo, for example, found that while “[a]nxieties over immigration have risen sharply in recent years” in Europe, mainstream parties increasingly came to be “perceived by their partisans to be more welcoming towards immigrants than their own partisans.” Moreover, the “further a partisan perceives the distance between herself and her party on immigration the greater the likelihood is that they will desert their party in a future election.”Here, too, of course, there are similarities with developments in the USs. Although the Democratic Party is economic profile was never as distinctively left-wing as that of most of its European counterparts, during the late 20th century the party shifted to the center economically, with Bill Clinton presenting himself as an advocate of small government, fiscal restraint, welfare state retrenchment, globalization, and so on. (Reflecting this, former US Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspanonce called Clinton as “the best Republican president we have had in a while.”)Alongside this economic shift, the Democratic Party also moved left on social and cultural issues, a shift that was particularly pronounced during the last two elections. Studiesof the 2016 election found not only that Trump focused more directly on social and cultural issues, most notably immigration, than his predecessors but that his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, did as well. The result of the increasing attention paid by both candidates to immigration, for example, was that the correlation between preferences on this issue, and which candidate people chose to support, went up. Many of the stances taken by the Democratic Party on social and cultural issues such as illegal immigration, so-called political correctness, police reform, and affirmative action are to the left of working-class, non-college-educated white voters, the party is own partisans, and the electorate more generally. Many internal party critics, accordingly, believe that these “wildly unpopular” positions, alongside the party is general “cultural leftism,” are a major reason why it has been hard to attract back more working-class, non-college-educated white voters as well as culturally conservative nonwhite voters. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, left-wing parties across the West have lost the support of non-college-educated, working-class white voters. In Europe, the electoral decline of labor and social democratic parties—many of these parties have lost 30 percent or more of their previous electoral shares over the last decades, and some, such as the French Socialist and Dutch Labour parties, essentially disappeared in the last elections—cannot be separated from their loss of working-class, non-college educated voters. While the two-party system in the USs protects the Democratic Party from the threat of splinter parties, it hard to see how it can compete with the Republicans at the national, state, and local levels over the long term without winning back more working-class, non-college educated voters. Analystsof the 2020 election, for example, have argued that Biden is modest gains with such voters, particularly in pivotal states, were more important to his win than the growth in the share of the nonwhite electorate that has occurred over the previous 30-40 years. It is hard to see how the left—much less liberal democracy—in the West can be reinvigorated without reversing this trend. And in the USs, where observer shave begun morbidly joking about Republicans “assembling the multiracial working-class coalition that the left has always dreamed of,” Trump managed to recapture the percentage of minority voters that his Republican predecessors had previously received and he improved significantly on his 2016 performance with such voters. Many right-wing populist parties in Europe also currently enjoy the support of a majority of the working class. It is hard to see how the left—much less liberal democracy—in the West can be reinvigorated without reversing this trend. There are many causes of the dramatic voting realignment that has occurred across the West over the past few decades, but ignoring the role played by the mainstream parties of the left would surely be a mistake. Shifting to the center on economic issues and to the left on social and cultural ones contributed to increasing the salience of the latter while also moving left-wing parties away from the preferences of non-college-educated, working-class voters and the electorate at large. This created, in political science parlance, a “representation gap” between the left and many voters and thus an opportunity for right-wing populists to capture some of them. None of this requires the left to abandon important goals including humane immigration policies, racial justice, and police reform. It does mean recognizing, however, that in a democracy sticking with consistently unattractive positions entails accepting permanent political disadvantage, if not impotence. Winning elections requires either persuading voters of the desirability of your positions or reconsidering them. Concretely, this means convincing activists who generally have views far to the left of other voters on noneconomic issues that unless they are able to shift public opinion, they will have to accept some compromises on them. It also means that left-wing parties should recalibrate the amount of time focused on economic versus noneconomic issues (with the left is positions on the former being broadly popular among working-class and other voters), as well as the way in which they discuss the latter so as to make clear to working-class voters of all backgrounds and other sympathetic citizens that progress on these issues is a positive rather thanzero-sum game.is a professor of political science at Barnard College, Columbia University and the author ofRead MoreBut in the USs, they show no signs of abatement.

But not at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and definitely not when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. If the topic comes up at your Zoom holiday party, here is a cheat sheet for the specific uses of these similar terms. No COVID-19 vaccines have been approved. Approvalmeans the FDA has officially decided that a product is safe and effective for its designated use. The process for approval involves rigorous reviews of all available data on the product and can take several months. To speed things up in an emergency like a pandemic, the FDA can grant anEmergency Use Authorization(EUA). An EUA, as its name implies, authorizes a product for use during unusually urgent circumstances if the benefits of its use outweigh any known or potential risks. A vaccine that combats a global pandemic is an ideal candidate for an EUA – we ca not afford to lose any more time in the midst of a crisis with an ever-climbing death toll. The FDAgranted an EUA for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, and it is likely to do the same for the Moderna vaccine this week. As long as no serious harms from the vaccines are discovered, they will maintain authorization until the pandemic is over. At that point, the pharmaceutical companies will decide if they want to seek FDA approval. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was granted an EUA for COVID-19 treatment in May before gaining approval in October. The expedited process for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines does not mean decisions are being made willy-nilly. FDA reviewers still had to pore over all the currently available data from clinical trials before signing off on the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. FDA clearance is usually applied to devices — anything fromheart-monitoring ap ps on a smart watch to X-ray machines. The FDA groups medical devices into three classes based on the level of risk associated with their use. Low-stakes products like gauze and tongue depressors are Class I, while products like pacemakers are Class III Devices in Class III are the only ones which require FDA approval before they can be put on the market. Those in Classes I and II do not necessarily need to be approved to be marketed. If they are a brand-new low-risk product, they can potentially get something called aDe Novo classification. Others can be cleared by the FDA if they can show that they are similar enough to products that have already been reviewed.",2,2,The Verge

The next day, Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Manatee County and issued a mandatory evacuation order to​“protect the lives and property of the people in the threatened communities.” More than300households were within the mandatory evacuation zone, and many fled the area, relocated by the local and state government to hotels where they received free meals. Detainees at the jail, meanwhile, were left neglected, just over a mile away from the Piney Point phosphate plant. Local organizers tweeted an urgent plea for the public to flood with phone calls the offices of the Sheriff for Manatee County, Rick Wells, the Board of County Commissioners, and the Emergency Management Division at Manatee County, in hopes that the pressure would force officials to evacuate the incarcerated people. At first, the sheriff moved the medical unit and jail staff to the second floor of the facility, leaving detainees vulnerable to the consequences of the flood on the first floor, surrounded by large bags of sand that were allegedly placed there to delay the effects of the flooding. By early morning on April4, the sheriff had crammed as many inmates as possible into the second floor is cells. Only267of1,200inmates we reevacuated during the crisis, and they were sent to the nearby Polk County Jail. Jordan Mazurek, an organizer with Florida Prisoner Solidarity (FPS) — an abolitionist collective whose mission is to prioritize the needs of all incarcerated people, their community, and​“care networks” — fumed about Sheriff Wells’ response to the looming crisis.​“The immediate excuse from the sheriff is office for why they were not evacuating people was,​‘Covid. We ca not evacuate people because it is not Covid safe.’ Well, keeping people in cages is not at all Covid safe.” In overcrowded cells, prisoners faced a greater risk of spreading Covid-19. Detainees waited nervously to see if the breach would mean that a toxic flood would cut off all access to the critical infrastructure on the first floor, their water supply — or worse. Had the jail flooded, emergency access to the facility would not have been possible since the Florida Highway Patrol had already closed US Route41, the only road to the jail. On April6, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against Rick Wells and the state of Florida for presenting an​“unreasonable risk of serious harm” to those that remained detained at the jail. Thankfully, the crisis for Manatee County was averted by pumping millions of gallons of polluted water into Tampa Bay, providing reprieve to the detainees. But the gamble taken by the state of Florida and the sheriff carried large risks: When the evacuation order was lifted on April6— four days after the breach was discovered — more than1,000inmates remained at the jail. On April12, the lawsuit against Florida and Sheriff Wells and was dismissed by the ACLU For Florida Prisoner Solidarity, questions regarding the safety of incarcerated people during climate disasters are not new. The organization connected with an incarcerated person at a Florida prison that has frequently been threatened by hurricanes. The person asked to remain anonymous out of concern for their safety.“They come with plywood and cover up the windows — this is when everybody just walks around in their box,” FD OC Slave, whose chosen pseudonym is a reflection of the abuse he has experienced while imprisoned in Florida, told with respect to preparations for incoming hurricanes. While FD OC Slave has not personally experienced extreme flooding at his prison, there have been many reported cases of severe flooding across the country due to the poor infrastructure installed, allegedly, to protect inmates, proving that plywood is not adequate protection for hurricanes. Though the plywood is typically installed two to three days before the hurricanes,​“it usually takes two weeks” to remove them. If another hurricane is expected soon, prisons keep the plywood for up to a month, often during90-degree temperatures in June and July.​“Because the re is no AC, and they close all the windows… the re is no ventilation,” said FD OC Slave. Over1,200legal cases werefiledfrom1980to2019that claimed violation of the Eighth Amendment right to protection from dangerous temperature conditions. According to Prison Legal News,79inmates and prison staff suffered from heat-related illnesses in the first10months of2018. Natural disasters, accelerated by climate change, are a growing threat to incarcerated people across the USs, who are vulnerable and often left behind during environmental crises. Deidre McDonald wrote in a first-person account for the Marshall Project about being incarcerated in a Texas prison during Hurricane Harvey in2017:​“To get to the main building, I must wade into it, knee-deep. That is when I notice the ladies with wheelchairs, walkers and crutches are struggling. One woman is crying hysterically because she is afraid of water, and the dorm boss ca not get her to take one step forward.” Her account calls attention to how lack of planning and infrastructure poses additional risks for prisoners with disabilities or phobias.“Folks [were] up to their waist and chest in water for12hours,” Jordan Mazurek, an FPS organizer whose background is in toxic prisons and environmental justice, said of Hurricane Harvey is devastating impact on Texas prisons.​“The feds did not have enough water to go around and so folks started drinking toilet water because it was the only thing left, and as a result, two prisoners died of bacterial infections.”The intersection of mass incarceration and environmental disasters is not coincidental. While the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that no group should be discriminated against when considering the public is right to live in hazard-free areas, the re is a clear link between unsafe environmental conditions and sites of incarceration. Frequently located on cheap undesirable real estate, nearly one-third of federal and state prisons in the USs are less than three miles away from a Superfund cleanup site — highly contaminated areas, also known as toxic waste dumps, that the EPA determines as needing long-term clean-up since they pose a risk to the health and wellbeing of either humans or the environment. Marcos Santos, an inmate at the State Correctional Institute at Fayette in Pennsylvania — built on top of an old mining site and surrounded by​“about40million to ns of waste” —toldAl Jazeera in2016,​“I have had to endure numerous medical problems: rashes throughout my body that hurt and keep me up all night. Extreme swelling of various parts including my throat making it difficult to breathe.”Inmates are at the front lines of​“the most brutal effects of every single disaster situation,” said Mazurek of FPS Incarcerated persons’ lack of mobility makes it so that they cannot​“move out of the path of a hurricane on their own free will or move out of the path of what would have been a20-foot-high wall of toxic water coming at their jail,” Mazurek continued.​“Prisons are just an ongoing disaster, and that is how it is going to be until we close them all.”I hope you found this article important.

Now, the state wants the money back. The district learned about the problem last week, said Michelle Glover, the schools’ business manager. She said the over payments amounted to between $630 and $730 per employee. The state is not demanding that workers repay it now, according to Glover. But if they do not fork it over, the state will deduct the funds from any future unemployment claims those staffers make.“This is going to be a hardship on our staff,” Glover wrote in an email Thursday. The employment department has struggled to administer its benefits program throughout the pandemic. It declined to address this latest issue, saying state law prevents it from discussing unemployment claims at any organization – even school districts and other public entities that are normally subject to public records disclosure. The origin of the issue in Baker City is extremely complex. The Baker City schools, like other districts around the state, furloughed employees for one day a week when the pandemic hit last spring to save money in anticipation of a fall budget crunch. The Baker School District and many other Oregon school districts tapped into the state is Work Share program to compensate employees for the lost wages.(In many cases, employees actually got a raise during their furloughs thanks to the $600 weekly unemployment bonus Congress authorized in March.)Work Share requires that participating employers furlough their employees for at least 20% of their work week, with a 40-hour limit on the work week. The Baker School District, though, usually operates on a four-day-a-week schedule – no school on Fridays. And because of a quirk of the calendar, the district did not meet that 20% threshold for the week in May that included Memorial Day. The school district said it was not aware of the 40-hour-week maximum, and the employment department overlooked it, too. Glover said the department has acknowledged that this was, at least partially, the state is mistake. Now, though, she said the burden falls on employees. Senator Lynn Findley, R-Vale, raised the Baker City issue Thursday ata legislative hearing on the crisis at the employment department. Oregon owes backlogged jobless benefits to tens of thousands of laid-off workers and tens of thousands more went for long periods without benefits early in the pandemic as the employment department struggled to cope with the unprecedented volume of claims. On Thursday, Findley said the Baker City issue is indicative of broader problems at the department.“The state leadership has failed to provide oversight with adequate followup with this agency,” Findley said.-- Mike Rogoway |mrogoway@oregonian.com| twitter:@rogoway|",2,2,The Oregonian
381,"‘Jim Crow Strategy’: Trump Files Lawsuit In Wisconsin Targeting 200,000 Votes In Two Counties with Highest Number of Black Voters",-4.67,47.33,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/12/02/jim-crow-strategy-trump-files-lawsuit-in-wisconsin-targeting-200000-votes-in-two-counties-with-highest-number-of-black-voters/,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,15,"On Tuesday, December 1, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin targeting more than 200,000 votes in two counties containing the majority of the state is Black residents. After a partial recount, for which the Trump campaign paid $3 million, the state-certified the results for President-Elect Joe Biden on Monday. The new lawsuit, filed in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, seeks to overturn the state is election results by targeting 221,323 votes cast in Milwaukee and Dane Counties, two regions where much of the state is Black population resides. The two counties were also targeted by the requested recount, which ultimately yielded 87 more votes for Biden after it was completed. Biden won the state by a margin of 20,682 votes after the recount. Legal experts and James Troupis, a member of the Trump campaign, have admitted the suit likely will not impact the results of the election. All six swing states President Trump has contested have certified the results in favor of Biden. The largest share of the targeted votes, some 170,000, are absentee ballots, while the rest of the votes the campaign wants to ssed out are comprised of ballots missing a witness address, those submitted by people who identified as “indefinitely confined” and those returned during the Democracy in the Park event hosted by the city of Madison. The suit describes the event as having created “unlawful polling locations.”The suit does not allege voter fraud, but instead claims the votes were cast in violation of state law because voters who filed the in-person absentee ballots did not have to submit a separate written application. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that voters have been allowed to sign a form on the ballot envelope, which serves as a ballot application, and certifies that they have filled out the ballot for over a decade. The campaign asks justices to void Governor Tony Evers’ certification of Biden is win. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul called the move a “Jim Crow strategy” in a statement on Monday before the suit was filed. It is clear thatPresident Trumpand his representatives used the recount to seek after-the-election changes to the rules. Those changes would result in tens of thousands of votes, if not more, being thrown out — and the president is representatives have only sought to have those changes applied to votes cast in our two most populous counties, in which the majority of Black Wisconsinites live,” Kaul said.“I have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail.”",2,2,Atlanta Black Star
382,Experts Warn Latest Trump Administration Move on Iran Could Backfire,-4.0,47.0,http://time.com/5575620/donald-trump-iran-sanctions-waiver/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-22,25,"President Donald Trump is decision Monday to end six-month waivers from US sanctions for five countries that have continued buying Iranian oil — the latest turn of the screw in his Administration is “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran — was met with predictable outrage from Tehran. But some US State Department, Defense and intelligence officials and outside experts warn that the move could backfire by causing ripple effects in countries like China, Turkey and Iraq. In response to the sanctions, Greece, Italy and, Taiwan had stopped buying Iranian oil, but China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have continued to import Iranian oil. The economic pressure has reduced Iranian oil exports from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 1 million, discouraged foreign investment, and sent the value of Iran is currency plummeting and inflation soaring. Announcing the move in a press briefing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeosaid the decision to end the waivers was “dramatically escalating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well-supplied global oil markets”. The Administration is objective, Pompeo said, include prompt Iran to renegotiate the international agreement halting its pursuit of nuclear weapons, halt its ballistic missile tests, and end its support for terrorist groups, which US officials say include Lebanon is Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas, Houthi militias in Yemen, and authoritarian regimes in Syria and Venezuela. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the move, and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country and others would ensure that “the global oil market does not go out of balance.”Some US and foreign officials and outside experts, however, argue that the escalating attack on Iran is economy is unlikely to prompt Iran to halt its support for terrorist organizations; force the country is clerical rulers to renegotiate the deal halting their efforts to develop nuclear weapons; weaken its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Force; or turn everyday Iranians against the Islamic regime.“If you do not know where you are going, any road will get you the re,” says Aaron David Miller, a Mideast expert and vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “And what is the Trump Administration strategy toward Iran? Even if it is regime change or forcing Iran to retrench in the region, this recent move will accomplish neither goal. It might ultimately goad Iran to give the Administration a pretext for military action. But how would this change the balance to America is advantage?”Instead, said two US officials who spoke only to the condition of anonymity to criticize the Administration is Iran policy, the Administration has not given much thought to the likely effects of its Iran policy on oil markets or on the nations, especially China, India, Turkey and Iraq, that now will be sanctioned if they continue to import oil from Iran.“The Administration has launched a fairly significant initiative without doing the necessary groundwork with the countries that will be most affected,” Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at Washington is Brookings Institution, tells TIME Iraq, which remains unstable, host to some remnants of ISIS, and divided on ethnic and religious lines 16 years after the US invasion, is especially vulnerable because imports of Iranian natural gas and electricity are critical to its economy, she says. Worse, says Maloney, the Administration had signaled since November that the exemptions for buying Iranian oil cut would be made gradually until it abruptly announced they will end on May 2. Nor, says Maloney, does the Administration appear to have given much thought to how Iran might respond to the latest turn of the screw, which she says are likely to include efforts to disrupt global oil markets when demand reaches its peak this summer. In a tweet, President Trump said: “Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian oil.”Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil. Iran is being given VERY BAD advice by@JohnKerryand people who helped him lead the US into the very bad Iran Nuclear Deal. Big violation of Logan Act?The two US intelligence officials on Monday dismissed Iran is threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, but said Tehran could retaliate by disrupting Iraqi oil exports or launching cy ber attacks on oil and gas production and export facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, or even US or European oil companies, which could send oil prices upward during the vacation season in the US and Western Europe. The officials said the 2012 Shamoon virus attacks on Qatar is RasGas and on the Saudi oil company Aramco — an attack the n Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta called “probably the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date” — were traced to Iran. Oil prices rose about 3 percent at midday on Monday, but remained far below their October high of $86 a barrel for the benchmark Brent crude. Contact us atletters@time.com",2,1,Time Magazine
383,The CoronaVirusFacts Alliance will get specialized support from the Paris Peace Forum,-0.67,47.67,https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2020/the-coronavirusfacts-alliance-will-get-specialized-support-from-the-paris-peace-forum/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,24,"TheCoronaVirusFacts Alliancewas one of 10 projects selected to be supported for one year by theScale-Up Committeeof theParis Peace Forum. The alliance was one of 10 selected from a field of 100 projects presented at this year is forum. It was chosen for its potential impact as well as its potential for development through the support of the committee. The alliance is a collaboration between 99 fact-checking organizations from over 70 countries producing fact-checks in 43 different languages. It has been coordinated for the last 11 months by the International Fact-Checking Network, and has produced a database of over 9,000 COVID-19 fact-checks, which have since been translated from English into Spanish, Portuguese and Hindi.“This is a big day for fact-checkers,” said IFCN Associate Director Cristina Tardáguila. “This means that all the effort fact-checkers put together for the last 11 months to fight mis/disinformation about COVID-19 not only helped many people during this pandemic, but is being recognized as something that must continue.”The annual conference brings together world leaders, global dignitaries and various non-profit and non-governmental organizations to discuss ways of avoiding global conflict, and providing solutions to global challenges. Due to the pandemic, this year is forum was held virtually and welcomed 12,000 participants as well as 50 heads of state from around the worldIn her pitch to the committee Thursday, Tardáguila talked about the alliance as a solution to the global problem posed by both mis- and disinformation about COVID-19.“It is widely known that falsehoods travel fast, do not respect barriers,” Tardáguila wrote in her prepared remarks. “Fact-checkers have decided to collaborate, to work together and to share knowledge in order to be faster.”She spoke about the power of having a global fact-checking database, which for some alliance members acted as an early warning system for potential coronavirus misinformation.“Thanks to the alliance, we have misinformation spotted and located in advance by other fellow fact-checkers,” said Joaquín Ortega, head of content at Spanish fact-checking organizationNewtral. “This undoubtedly facilitated the verification process when these pieces of content were adapted to go viral in Spain.”The collaboration helped some alliance members improve their abilities as fact-checkers, and better understand the global flow of misinformation.“Thrown into the deep end as a relatively new fact-checker, the alliance created the needed environment to see beyond our immediate target audience,” said Rabiu Alhassan, managing editor of Ghanaian fact-checking organization,GhanaFact.“The knowledge we gained from this collaboration gave us new views on how to analyze and report misinformation, and I believe we could apply this for other topics in the future,” said Natalia Leal, content director at Brazilian fact-checking organizationAgencia Lupa. PolitiFacteditor Angie Holan said fact-checkers collaborating across borders is not a new phenomenon. What sets the alliance apart is its longevity and scale.“We have been fact-checking and sharing information for months now about an issue that has affected countries worldwide,” Holan said. “It is been quite an undertaking.”As part of her pitch, Tardáguila also talked about the four WhatsApp chat bots developed by the IFCN that help the public easily access fact-checks from their phones. The project also yielded partnership opportunities with WhatsApp and Facebook that helped support 21 alliance member fact-checking projects with over $800,000 in grant funding. Giovanni Zagni, content director at Italian fact-checking organizationFacta, praised the collaboration for creating the easy-to-use chat bot and a database of fact-checks that can be studied by misinformation researchers.“The only problem that I see is that it should be much more famous,” Zagni said. The 11-member committee made up of representatives from organizations like the World Bank and the UN, acts as a project incubator that will give customized support to the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance. Fact-checkers who praised the project also offered suggestions for how it could improve.“Misinformation around the virus is moving to offline word of mouth,” said GhanaFact is Alhassan. “Then it is also becoming obvious that the number of (new) fact-checks around the pandemic is dwindling, so how can we evolve to deal with this new phenomenon?”Others advocated for more coordination from the IFCN to address both the global and regional spread of misinformation, narratives similar to efforts undertaken by fact-checkers inEurope.“Periodic roundups of the hottest stories in disinformation around the world could serve as a global alert system, like the one you have for tsunamis,” Zagni said, adding that such a system will need increased investment. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter is media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up.

An emotional President-elect Joe Biden sniffled and slurred his farewell to his home state of Delaware. By noon tomorrow, Donald Trump will be at Mar-a-Lago with his gorgeous and amazing wife, set to return to his enviable life building resorts on the most beautiful spots on the planet. By noon tomorrow, Joe Biden will be at the US Capitol with a sea of National Guard in front of him and barely a supporter in sight, with Iran and China and Russia and North Korea set to inflame the most dangerous parts of the planet. By tomorrow afternoon, Trump will be on the back nine at Dural. By tomorrow afternoon, Biden will be feeling the knives in his back from those thirsting for control of the West Wing. Tell me, who really won? Would you blame Joe if he finally did push for a forensic audit of the election? Would you blame Trump if he laughed his face off all the way to Florida?Joe Biden is not the only one weepy today. Check out the writers’ rooms of the late night comedy shows. Sure, their smug bosses like Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel are perfectly happy their non-stop efforts to tear down Trump for four years had some effect. Their banning of him from late night appearances played oh so well with their cancel culture buddies, who would have hung them from the Hollywood sign had they dared make Trump a guest. The same Donald Trump who was such a fixture on late night TV that he actually hostedtwice. But their writers are not nearly as jolly at the installation of Joe Biden. They know that starting tomorrow they actually have to work for a living. As a former Hollywood topical humor writer, I guarantee Donald Trump has been a gift from God to those who have to write jokes every day. Coming up with jokes is not necessarily the hard part of the job. The hard part is the set up. The little news item that can be turned into a joke. Thanks to Trump is Twitter feed, you had numerous set-ups set up to go before you finished breakfast. And once Trump got rolling during the day, who knows how many perfect set ups the man would serve up. You’d have half your number of requisite jokes done by lunch. Trump made you look like a comedy genius when you were at best a glorified stenographer. What are they getting with Biden? Sure. You can make jokes about his mental lapses and feebleness. The Grim Reaper is practically a cabinet member. But how quickly does this grow old? How cruel does it become given his clear infirmity? How unnerving is it to joke when his shaky hand is on the nuclear trigger? “Sure it is funny, until someone loses a city.”Beyond that, while Trump was a nearly 24/7 news-generating machine, Biden is only capable of so much action in a given day. The comedy beast must be fed at regular intervals. So those sad comedy writers will have to break a sweat. They will have to leave the White House watch to hunt and gather for food to feed the beast. Yes, propagandists like CNN is Jake Tapper will be raising to asts with their collaborators like James Clapper at Trump is departure. Overthrow Mission Accomplished. But one suspects the news rooms around America will soon suffer post-Trump depression. What in the world are they going to do? Go back to spending days obsessing over a disappeared plane? Go back to dry analysis by inside the beltway bores of inside the beltway shenanigans that do not matter even to people living inside the beltway? Heaven forbid, will they be forced to leave the comfy confines to cover real news that matters to real people?No more spending hours a day spend fussing over something Trump did or said that day. That usually ends up being proven false within a day, but that is not their problem. Then again, perhaps I am being naïve. Of course, they are still going to cover Trump. Unless they go to Betty Ford to deal with their addiction, they will still have to get their Trump fix. They will still share their daily Trump talking points like the junkies sharing dirty needles. They will be happy for Biden to put a lid on his day at 10 a.m. as long as Trump does something they can feign outrage over. “Trump visits his resort in Scotland! How many children could be fed with the money spent for Secret Service?!” “Girl breaks arm in fall at Trump run ice-rink. Thank God for Obamacare!” “Leftist radicals burn leftist businesses in leftist run city in leftist run state. 10 Reasons It is Trump is Fault!”For Donald Trump, it will be old hat. He is been subject to constant media attention since the Carter Administration. For Joe Biden, he will be denied the one thing he is craved since he first ran for office: To be seen as The Guy. Starting tomorrow, Joe Biden will be the most powerful man in the world. And he will still be playing second fiddle. Love him or hate him, Trump will still be The Guy. And that is no joke.

The majority of men, and notably a wide cross-section of women, in the early days of the republic viewed education as a “critical bridge to responsible citizenship,” according to Appleby. They admired the intellect of our Founding Fathers and felt a patriotic duty to elevate their knowledge so they could better understand the leaders and politics of the day, and thus become better citizens. In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville captured his enthusiasm for America and its enlightened citizens in his famous book, “Democracy in America,” proclaiming that in the future, “all the world will be America.” How times have changed. Following Boris Yeltsin appointment of Vladimir Putin as his successor to the Russian presidency in 1999, after the death of China is Deng Xiaoping in 1997 and, finally, at the end of the Arab Spring in 2012, the world has seen a reversal of democratic government and the rise of authoritarianism. More than a few Americans would say that had President Donald Trump been reelected to a second term, it is likely that many of our institutions and norms built to protect democracy would have suffered a similar fate. Many were already under assault in his first term, like the politicized Department of Justice. For the first time in our history, we are witnessing something other than a peaceful, orderly transition of presidential power that was enshrined in our American memory beginning with Washington is “Farewell Address” in 1796. We have never seen anything like Trump is assault on the facts, the electoral process and the sacred nature of a free and fair vote for all Americans. How in the world can more than half of Republicans believe the election was rigged?The answer — a campaign of relentless disinformation and lies, spread by social media and irresponsible cable TV and talk radio journalists, believed to be true by a large swath of the population, who apparently received little or no instruction in civics and US history. If this debacle teaches us anything it is that civics and history deserve a much bigger role in our primary and secondary education curricula, even at the expense of a reduced STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) curricula that has been over-emphasized for too long. Look at the voting process. Severalrecent surveys of Republican voters indicate that anywhere from 50% to 80% of them believe the 2020 presidential election was not free and fair. This despite the fact that Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure and Security Agency and a former Microsoft cy ber security expert,statedthat the recent election was “the most secure in US history.” Every state and every Republican and Democratic governor has certified their results with only negligible, immaterial changes in vote counts. Yet we are witnessing a horrific display of threats against state officials — of both parties — who have certified the election results by those who do not trust the voting process. Why? Because they do not understand the voting process and how it is protected. Many do not understand the Electoral College either. This unacceptable in America. We are looking a lot more like a banana republic than the beacon of democracy to the rest of the world. Clearly America is reputation has suffered terribly around the globe. The vitriol and emotion, amplified and reinforced on cable TV and social media, builds continuously until it drowns out rational thought. These conditions — extreme ideologies, absence of compromise and bipartisanship and the threat of domestic terrorism created as a result — are a major threat to our republic. Left unchecked, the situation will worsen and could destroy us if we do not act immediately. Let is hope and pray that nobody gets hurt as a result of these mindless protests dangerously getting close to becoming violent. There are some short-term political and economic solutions to mitigate our divisions. Not the focus of this essay, but initiatives like publicly-financed campaigns to take “dark money” out of politics will go a long way to bringing the parties together. Economic policies to rebuild the middle class and reverse the growth of inequality will foster a shared prosperity to reduce fear and anxiety amongst a large portion of our population. However, these political and economic solutions will not take hold unless we begin to restore the health of our underlying culture and start to remember who we were as Americans, and who we need to be going forward. It starts and ends with an informed electorate. In times of crisis, we look to history — and those who made it into history books for all the right reasons — to instruct us in a time of need. The 19th-century thinker Horace Mann often called the founding father of public education in America called out the importance of an educated public to the health of a democratic government: “A republican form of government, without intelligence in the people, must be, on a vast scale, what a mad-house, without superintendent or keepers, would be on a small one.” Even before Mann, Thomas Jefferson offered similar wisdom: “Ignorance and despotism seem made for each other, [but if the new nation could] enlighten the people generally … tyranny and the oppress ions of mind and body will vanish, like evil spirits at the dawn of the day.”Regarding the importance of a strong civics curriculum in our schools, we have George Washington stating, on the one bookend of US history: “A primary object should be the education of our youth in the science of government. In a republic, what species of knowledge can be equally important? And what duty more pressing than communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?”Echoing similar opinions some 244 years later as the world is longest-enduring democratic, self-governing republic, is Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts: “But in the ensuing years [following the ratification of the Constitution], we have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside. In our age, when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand the public is need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital.”This is quite a commentary on the importance of education generally, and civics specifically, to the health and continued survival of “American exceptionalism.” Beyond the voting process and the Electoral College, how well does the public understand how government is structured, how it works? The Annenberg Public Policy Center reported the results of a broad survey of Americans and found that only one in four Americans could name all three branches of the federal government. This an astounding discovery. The same survey found that fewer than 15% of the same cohort could name more than one First Amendment right, with only 37% of respondents able to name a single First Amendment right — their response, by and large, was freedom of speech. How beneficial would it be to society if everyone knew that our federal government does not sanction any religion, nor prevent anyone from practicing their own beliefs, or not? Freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble and the right to petition the government round out all the First Amendment rights. How are we doing in terms of education outcomes in this age of information overload, hyper-partisanship and emotion crowding out reason and thoughtful reflection? Not so great. According to DoSomething.org — a youth nonprofit whose corporate sponsors include 3M, Ford Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, Google and General Motors among many others — in 1985, the quantity and quality of high school graduates in the US as a group was ranked number one in the world. But by 2015, our high school population was ranked 36 in the world. Michael Porter at the Harvard Business School has been conducting expansive and thorough surveys since 2011 of more than 2,000 senior-level business leaders, across a wide spectrum of industries in the US, regarding the competitiveness of the US economy. The conclusions of the study team strongly align with the findings of DoSomething.org noted above. Porter has concluded that shared prosperity is a key component of an economy is competitiveness and that the US economy is failing to deliver shared prosperity to an ever-shrinking middle class. More importantly, Porter has tied this economic failure to political and cultural failures. To find solutions to our political failures — climate change, inequality, health care and immigration — we must focus on revising election and campaign financing laws. To find answers to our cultural failures — systemic racism, increased polarization, domestic terrorism and crime — we must improve outcomes in K-12 public education as the most critical solution. There is nothing more important to the long-term survival of our democracy than a large investment in education as well as in our defense and military capability. Turns out, that as a nation, we invest about the same amount annually in each, which is surprising to most people. The 2020 defense budget is projected to be about $750 billion, and totals pending on public education— elementary plus secondary — in 2015 across the country, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics, was $706 billion. The problem is that education is funded and administered locally and, as a result, there is a wide variation in the quality of its delivery as the DoSomething.org and the Harvard studies both demonstrate. The current noise and disinformation around election fraud — a president asking state legislators to overturn a popular vote in choosing electors to the Electoral College and how presidents can lose the popular vote of the nation and still be elected — threaten our democracy. How? In short, even more people begin to lose trust in our government to be fair, and “for the People.” Trust in Congress is already at an historical low point according toPew Research. How do we restore this trust? A strong civics education is a good start. Why is this so important? Here is the deal: The 2016 presidential election came down to fewer than80,000 voter sin Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Even though Trump lost the popular vote among over 125 million total voters, his narrow wins in these three battleground states gave him an Electoral College majority of 306 over Hillary Clinton is 232. This means that just 0.06% of all the voters in America determined the outcome of the 2016 election. In the 2000 presidential election, it came down to 537 votes in Florida. It is frightening to consider that so few voters could make such a difference, and how easily it might be to corrupt such a small number of voters. If that does not argue for a strong civics curriculum in our schools, what does?Education is the single most important component of the common good for maintaining the long-term health of our democracy. Why? Because we will not meaningfully transform our political and economic models until we begin to transform our culture. And you do not transform culture by screaming at people. You transform culture by educating people and celebrating rational discourse among all citizens. We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Per MonthAs the squabbling over the January 6 commission heats up in the US, India offers a cautionary tale about democracy. Maintaining a vibrant democracy in the USs requires recognition that exceptional ism does not make us invulnerable to autocratic impulses... Disparity, dysfunction and discord have destroyed democracies in the past and endanger American democracy today.",1,1,Fair Observer
387,‘My African-American Brothers and Sisters’: Fauci Attempts to Calm Concerns of Black Community About COVID-19 Vaccine with Focus on Black Lead Scientist,-6.0,44.67,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/12/11/my-african-american-brothers-and-sisters-fauci-attempts-to-calm-concerns-of-black-community-about-covid-19-vaccine-with-focus-on-black-lead-scientist/,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-11,15,"Dr. AnthonyFauci is attempting to assuage the discomfort of Black people who are averse to taking the COVID-19 vaccine by noting a Black woman scientist was involved in its development.“The very vaccine that is one of the two that has absolutely exquisite levels — 94 to 95 percent efficacy against clinical disease and almost 100 percent efficacy against serious disease that are shown to be clearly safe — that vaccine was actually developed in my institute is vaccine research center by a team of scientists led by Dr. Barney Graham and his close colleague,Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, or Kizzy Corbett,” Dr. Fauci said. The nation is top infectious disease expert made the comments when he was asked how “to break down the myths and the historic trepidation” during a virtual conversation called “Making It Plain: A Conversation with Dr. Fauci and The Black Community.”Corbett, a viral immunologist, rose to public prominence in March when it was revealed she was a lead scientist with Dr. Barney Graham is coronavirus team in the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. She was among the team of scientists who met within April when he took a tour of NIH is Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory. In addition to over 10 years of research experience, Corbett holds a PhD in microbiology and immunology and graduated from the University of Maryland-Baltimore County with a degree in sociology in 2008. A few tweets have resurfaced of Corbett speaking candidly about the medical community. In a March tweet, she alleged the poor Black community may be overlooked for treatment if ventilators were in short supply. The following month she “plead the fifth” on the suggestion that the pandemic is an act of genocide against Blacks. Dr. Fauci said while he understands the Black community is mistrust due to decades of racism in medical care and inhumane experimentation on Black Americans, the pending COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. He reiterated his claims were underscored by the involvement of Corbett — who came under fire for tweets dating back to February which addressed the correlation between systemic racism and medical malpractice.“Kizzi is an African-American scientist who is right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine,” Fauci added. “So, the first thing you might want to say to my African-American brothers and sisters is that the vaccine that you are going to be taking was developed by an African American woman. And that is just a fact.”Thanks to@blackdoctor_orgfor asking this question. And, for Dr. Fauci for now making it likely impossible to enforce “Kizzmekia” cause everyone now knows he is allowed to say “Kizzy”. Haha 😂 recent survey by theCOVID Collaborative showed only 14 percent of Black Americans trust the safety of a vaccine, while slightly more, 18 percent, believed it would actually work. Corbett told CNNshe understood why Black Americans had reservations and noted the medical profession had work to do to earn the community is trust again.“I would say to people who are vaccine-hesitant that you have earned the right to ask the questions that you have around these vaccines and this vaccine development process,” Corbett said. “Trust, especially when it has been stripped from people, has to be rebuilt in a brick-by-brick fashion. … And so, what I say to people firstly is that I empathize, and the n secondly is that I am going to do my part in laying those bricks. And I think that if everyone on our side, as physicians and scientists, went about it that way, the n the trust would start to be rebuilt.”Reports of Fauci is comments were met with mixed reviews on social media. While some Twitter users asked why Corbett is race should even matter, others praised Corbett being recognized for her great work. Still, others said they did not care if a Black woman was involved, they still would not take the vaccine.“Why is this a headline?” tweeted user @blondieinohio in response to one of TMZ is tweets about it.“Almost everyone ment io ing (sic) why is this news happens to be Caucasian. That is part of privilege minorities hardly ever hear about our accomplishments, history in school is about whites minorities have take classes to learn about ours. And considering the % of population that we are,” responded user @RafaelBoriqua.“Boy the re is nothing they will not try in an attempt to convince people to take this poison. It is a SOLID “NO” for me,” wrote user @MichieMonique.",2,2,Atlanta Black Star

It comes as House Republicans are moving to remove Number 3 Republican Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) after her critical comments about the former president.“I would just say to my Republican colleagues, can we move forward without President Trump? The answer is no,” Graham told Fox News. “I have always liked Liz Cheney, but she is made a determination that the Republican Party ca not grow with President Trump. I have determined we ca not grow without him.”In an opinion article for the Washington Post on Wednesday, Cheney again criticized Trump and said the Republican Party needs to move on from the “the Trump cult of personality” and claimed he is attempting to “unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work.” In February, Cheney was 1 of 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach the former president. Graham noted that Trump is “economic populism” and “America First“ agenda are popular. Cheney drew the ire from Republicans after she called a proposal from Representative Jim Banks (R-Ind.) about how Republicans can retain working-class voters ”neo-Marxist.”“If you do not get that, you are making the biggest mistake in the history of the Republican Party,” Graham said. Cheney survived a vote among House Republicans earlier this year, but several top Republicans have expressed dismay with her leadership in recent days. Cheney is likely successor as head of the House Republican Conference, Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY), is considered a staunch Trump supporter.

389,Whatever Happened to the Populist Left?,12.33,34.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/whatever-happened-to-the-populist-left/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-22,25,"Against the surreal backdrop of sometimes violent nationwide protests, one alarming story as reported by seems to have slipped under the radar. Law enforcement arrested a 21-year-old Idaho man on suspicion of firing a semi-automatic rifle at the White House. Several days prior to the arrest, the Secret Service had responded to reports of shots fired near the National Mall and pursued a vehicle departing the area on Constitution Avenue. They found the vehicle abandoned with an AK-47 and spent casings inside, and soon afterward extracted several bullets that had struck the White House. The suspect is relatives told investigators he appeared to have a “fixation” on the White House and the president. Thisreally did happen, but it was not during the chaotic “Stop the Steal” rally earlier this month, or even any of the fiery demonstrations across the country last summer. It was on Wednesday, November 16, 2011, during the Occupy Wall Street protests. As the media and the incoming Biden administration froth at the mouth over Trump is failed “insurrection,” it is fashionable for conservatives to point out the obvious double standard the media employs when comparing the events of last week and the BLM and Antifa riots of the past year, the latter of which were many orders more violent and destructive. Axiosreportsthat the insurance claims for the riots could approach $2 billion, and that an estimated 30 people, many of whom were African Americans, have lost their lives. Yet what is also interesting—and alarming—is the fate of the progressive-powered Occupy Wall Street movement and the left-leaning populist movement it helped ignite. If the bailouts of 2008 were their spark, where are they now amid the pandemic, when corporate profits have soared and middle-to-low-income workers have been crushed?The answer is that they the mselves have been occupied—transformed, rebranded, and redirected by corporations and the media. As Vladimir Lenin once said, “The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.”The government is response to the financial crisis of 2008 was unique in that it drew the condemnation of both the left and the right. Take, for example, the response it evoked from President Reagan is first budget director, David Stockman: “A decisive tipping point in the evolution of American capitalism and democracy—the triumph of crony capitalism—took place on October 3, 2008.” On that day, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was passed to bail out Wall Street. Stockman is book,, is a 768-page moral outrage manifesto, accusing the state and its central bank of becoming disciples of misguided “Keynesianism, monetarism, and supply-side-ism.”Despite promises of change, President Obama disappointed many of his optimistic voters. Asreportedbyin December 2011, Obama had secured more funding from the financial elite than all other GOP candidates combined. Simmering resentment and the let-down of the Obama presidency led to the birth of Occupy Wall Street, which launched in September 2011 and called for increases to the minimum wage, protections for the environment, and student debt relief. Their slogan was “We are the 99%” and their enemy was the other 1 percent: the corporate elites. The message from Occupy Wall Street was generally devoid of any mention of race, creed, or ancestry. It was Marxist in tone to be sure: the haves versus the have-nots, the oppressors versus the oppressed, the 99 percent versus the 1 percent. Yet while their solutions might have been wrong and unrealistic, their prognosis was not exactly inaccurate. Wealth inequality had skyrocketed. The nefarious actions of Wall Street firms should have been punished, not rewarded. The bailout of AIG had dwarfed all combined expenditures of the food stamp program since its inception in the 1960s. Faced with seething anger, the corporate media soon went to bat to reprogram their attackers. Thanks to the meticulous research of political scientist Zach Goldberg, we know that the actions of the press following the Occupy movement did not fit a coherent, organized pattern. In an article for magazine in August 2020, Goldbergpresentsa graph that clearly shows that the media is use of racial terms in its opinion and reporting skyrocketed around 2012. Goldberg points out that “wokeness”—what he defines as “sensibilities of highly educated and hyper liberal white professionals with elements of Black nationalism and academic critical race theory”—was present in our political discourse well before the BLM- and Antifa-led riots of the past year. As noted in his graphs, from 2011 to 2018, the use of the words “racist/racists/racism” increased inandThe Washington Postby about 700 percent and 1,000 percent, respectively. His conclusion is that the media was crafting a narrative that explained disparities in our society not due totalent or work ethic, or even the crony capitalists of Wall Street and the 1 percent, but bias—specifically racial bias. But was this reporting effective at reprogramming the left? Goldberg seems to think so: “Specifically, I find that the causal effects of race-related media coverage are strongest for white Democrats and liberals, weaker for nonwhite Democrats and liberals, and are largely nonexistent for white Republicans and conservatives.”Whether it is left-leaning or right-leaning, populism is the enemy of the current American regime. By enlisting left-leaning populists in the fight against “white supremacy,” that regime has managed to stave off a two-front war—and, in fact, to pit one of its enemies against the other. Corporate powers simply absorbed the left-leaning populist movement, pretending to lead it while launching an attack on right-wing populists in conjunction with the press and its government allies. The election of Donald Trump clearly shook the American regime to its core. Populism, left- or right-leaning, never bodes well for the elites, but during the Trump era, left- and right-leaning populists started sounding dangerously alike. The looming convergence posed the threat of a substantial, effective, anti-elite political movement. How the media crafted a corporate-friendly narrative to diffuse and the n redirect this anger is quite remarkable. The metamorphosis of Bernie Sanders in 2016 to his candidacy in 2020 serves as an instructive case study. In 2015, Sandersattacked open borders as a Koch brothers proposal, essentially tying corporate interests in lowering wages and maximizing profit to increased illegal immigration. Sanders’ populist message was devoid of race or religion, focusing only on class. Yet using their control of the moral narrative in the political space, the media and corporations reframed the fight for justice as one centered on race and oppression instead of populism and cronyism. The whole left, including its populist wing and the Bernie camp, was subsumed into the race narrative. It was no longer about economic oppression or injustice; it was about oppression and injustice. The problem we faced was not rule by the elites but the enduring reign of white supremacy. What the average person does not understand is that when the modern, post-1619 Project left refers to “white supremacy,” they do not mean David Duke or Nathan Bedford Forrest. They mean the Founding Fathers and the nation that was born following the Revolution. Just as the sin of Adam was passed down to all of mankind, so too were the sins of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson passed down to all white Americans. Ironic, is not it, that those same left-leaning protesters who a few years ago were calling for the prosecution and incarceration of bankers were year calling for (and attempting) the removal of a statue of President Andrew Jackson? Called the first populist president by many historians, Jackson actually fought the bankers, whom he called a “brood of vipers.” It was his stubborn resolve against Treasury Secretary Nicolas Biddle that ended the Second Bank of the USs in 1836, ensuring the absence of a central bank until the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1914. But Jackson is sins against the Native Americans deny him any place in a new narrative focused on race. One of the great heroes of American populism becomes not just forgotten but demonized. Jackson gets a reckoning, and the bankers he condemned get off scot-free. Talk about misdirecting your enemies’ firepower.is a former Marine officer.

390,Joe Biden Should not Shy Away From the Radicalism of the New Deal,-17.33,37.33,https://inthesetimes.com/article/joe-biden-shouldnt-shy-away-from-the-radicalism-of-the-new-deal,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"President Joe Biden struck an urgent note during his address to Congress on April28.​“We have to prove democracy still works,” he said.​“That our government still works — and can deliver for the people.”To those familiar with the history of the New Deal, the echoes are clear. As was the case in1933, the USs finds itself at a crossroads. The Covid-19pandemic has killed nearly600,000Americans and widened what was already a chasm separating the country is rich from its poor. Meanwhile, the far right has entrenched itself in our politics, even with former President Donald Trump is defeat in the2020election. Like Franklin Delano Roosevelt before him, Biden is betting on an ambitious set of programs and reforms to restore faith in the American project before it is too late. As historian Eric Rauchway argues in his new book,, embracing FDR is signature programs is not just a moral imperative — it is good politics. The Civilian Conservation Corps, a version of which Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) include in their Green New Deal proposal, offers a model to create well-paying jobs while addressing the existential threat of climate change. By the same token, the Tennessee Valley Authority — which built the Wilson Dam and transformed the economy of seven impoverished states — can serve as a blueprint to repair the country is crumbling infrastructure. These measures would not only help address a pressing crisis, but — if recent polling of Biden is American Jobs Plan is any indication — would be enormously popular with the American public. Over the phone, Rauchway spoke with about the lessons of the New Deal and how it can be revised for modern-day America. He also explored the ways the New Deal reinforced and perpetuated the racism and misogyny of1930s America. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. What did President Franklin Delano Roosevelt hope to achieve with the New Deal?The key thing to understand about the New Deal is that it was a response to a crisis of democracy. The Great Depression had broken the economy, and many representative governments both in the USs and elsewhere were not particularly responsive. With far-right movements on the rise around the world, people looked at Benito Mussolini and said,​“Well, that fella has the right idea.”Adolf Hitler came to power in January1933, right between Franklin D Roosevelt is election and his first inauguration. One of Roosevelt is friends told him during that period,​“If you succeed, you will be remembered as one of the best presidents of the USs; and if you fail, you will be remembered as one of the worst.” To which Roosevelt replied:​“If I fail, I will be the last.” He really did think that democracy was in dire straits, and with good reason. There were mass protests throughout the USs that were ideologically inchoate, and they could have very easily tilted toward the far right. Roosevelt feared those discontented with the government is inaction could follow a leader like Huey Long, who was charismatic but unscrupulous and not particularly respectful of the rule of law, or perhaps a business-backed authoritarian like Douglas MacArthur, who would be installed to put down mass movements in the name of opposing Communism. In his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination in1932, Roosevelt argued the only way to defuse far-right threats was to offer a positive program of reconstruction. And that is what the New Deal was — a program to restore people is belief that democracy could work for them and broaden conceptions of social justice. I would like our legislators to see the New Deal as essential support for democracy and the programs the mselves as essentially humane. Roosevelt talked about the idea that people do not just need something to live on; they need something to live for. That was the purpose of the New Deal. Some have called its programs​“socialist,” but Roosevelt did not see them that way and neither did Norman Thomas, a Socialist Party leader in the1930s. What mattered was that they gave people a sense of dignity and decency; they made people feel they were participating in a society that was worth living in. If to day is policy proposals have a sustainable set of goals and offer people a chance to lead decent lives, the n they are worth supporting. Jamelle Bouie wrote about in the New York Timesrecently, concluding that the New Deal can be seen as a third founding moment in the history of American democracy. Why do you think, as Bouie writes, that the USs still has not lived up to the New Deal is promise of economic equality and opportunity?To put things bluntly, because it threatened people who have lots of money or power. The New Deal came about at a time when everything seemed to be in crisis, so lots of people were willing to support dramatic changes in the existing political and economic system. No sooner had it been successful than folks in boardrooms and in banks began to worry that it might besuccessful. Even within the first100days of his presidency, Roosevelt had already begun to run up against resistance to some of the things he wanted to do. But he and the New Dealers in the Democratic Party, along with some liberal Republicans, managed to seize that moment and put through a number of policies that were effective and popular. Not only did the economy recover, but a lot of people shared in that recovery, which made the Democratic Party become more popular. Democrats gained seats in the1934elections, and the n Roosevelt won in a record landslide in1936. One of the groups that Roosevelt is first term won over to the Democratic Party was Black voters, which has remained a staple of the Democratic coalition since.​“FDR is legacy was not good for Black people”?I am going to side with the vast majority of Black voters who clearly believed FDR is legacy was good for Black people. They seem to be a better judge of their own interests than James Clyburn. The Roosevelt administration represented a Democratic Party that was divided in the1930s between its white, Southern, segregationist wing and its Northern, multiracial and more labor-based wing. The New Deal marked the Democratic Party is shift toward the latter, although it did not happen overnight. When New Deal programs were administered by the local Democratic Party in the South, they tended to perpetuate segregation, perhaps unsurprisingly. A good example here is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the Tennessee River Valley, which is the birthplace of the original Ku Klux Klan. You can derive what the racial politics of the region were from that observation alone. But while the TVA had segregated works, it also had Black workers and even Black managers. They expressed their frustrations within the TVA rather than attack it because they knew it was providing well-paying jobs under good conditions. What Clyburn is remarks leave out is that when the New Deal was administered at the national level — for example, by Harry Hopkins at the Works Progress Administration (WPA) or Harold Ickes at the Public Works Administration (PWA) — both were committed to civil rights. Discrimination was not only against policy, but it eventually became illegal in public works. As the National Urban League said at the time, the WPA offered the first meaningful white-collar opportunities to Black Americans. In many ways, it allowed them to move out of the South and into the urban parts of the North and the West.nreferred to him by his initials, JRB Would you say Biden and his administration have internalized the lessons of the New Deal?Biden has been involved in Democratic politics through a time generally referred to as the neo liberal period, when the Democratic Party has been highly skeptical of the New Deal. This period really lasted until, I do not know, last week? It was not an overnight shift. People like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Left have been calling for Democrats to revive and improve on the New Deal, both as a source of inspiration and as a concrete set of programs. I think the Biden administration could have gone even farther than it did on the recent stimulus package. The package is far bigger than the one the Democrats passed in2008–2009and far more focused on Main Street than Wall Street, but it does not get close to the New Deal. Describing payments as a​“stimulus” implies the re is nothing fundamentally unhealthy about the US economy, that it just needs a solid jolt of caffeine to start moving again. The focus of the New Deal was not a Keynesian-style stimulus; it was aimed at rebalancing the scales in the American economy and in American society more generally.[The American Jobs Plan] that is now before Congress is much closer in spirit to the New Deal, especially with its broad conception of what infrastructure entails. If we have a program where we spend a lot of money to build solar panel arrays, wind farms, pumping facilities for endangered shorelines and things like that, we are talking about concrete achievements that can empower people. If the American Jobs Plan goes through, and it is implemented in a way that is visibly effective, the n I would be surprised if the Biden administration and the Democratic Party did not reap the benefits electorally. One of the great lessons of the New Deal is that good policy is good politics. It may seem like an obvious thing to say, but if the administration is effective and it helps people in ways they appreciate, the n they tend to support the administration and its programming. It should be intuitive, but it is not. In the age of austerity, politicians have told the mselves,​“Let is make our voters suffer, and the n they will appreciate how competent and serious we are.” The Roosevelt administration took the opposite view. As Harry Hopkins put it at the time,​“We will spend and spend, tax and tax, and elect and elect.” These types of programs, if they work and people appreciate that they work, tend to lead to lasting majorities.?We need to meet an ecological crisis now just as we did in1933. Intensive farming had used up a lot of the land in ways that had destroyed its utility, leading in part to the Dust Bowl. A large part of the New Deal was devoted to making agriculture sustainable through hydroelectric power, which we would now call green energy, but also through soil conservation. The USs adopted physical and chemical methods of farming that would allow the prairie to yield good crops and sustainable grazing areas for decades to come. As I point out in the book, the New Deal is one of the largest — if not the only — successful articulation of American patriotism that does not involve going to war and killing people. That is a resource that folks can draw on to try to mobilize people and give us pride in our ability to do constructive rather than destructive things. Representative Ocasio-Cortez has also said she would like the Green New Deal to rectify some of the shortcomings of the original New Deal and specifically address structural inequalities created by infrastructure projects of the past with an emphasis on racial justice. Civilian Climate Corps for Jobs and Justice Act of2021. How did FDR is Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work and what kind of potential would a new version hold?The original CCC was not only focused on conservation but on employing young men, precisely because they were understood to be the most susceptible to dangerous anti-social movements and behaviors. It was run by the War Department and was aimed at giving folks who might otherwise have been drawn to paramilitary movements a democratic, pacific thing to do instead. The CCC was not very big during the New Deal compared to the WPA, but it was immensely popular in large measure because of the kinds of work it did. It focused specifically on conservation projects that included reforestation and reclamation, irrigation and flood control. It did a tremendous amount of work in both state and national parks. The idea of getting the country is youth into the wilderness and doing things for the common good has struck a chord with people since the Great Depression, so I am not surprised they want to revive it, although I doubt it would be implemented in the same way.: I’d say that idea is lifted directly from the original New Deal. One of the things I tried to do with this book is integrate Native discussions about what was the n called the​“Indian New Deal.” The Indian Emergency Conservation Work program was specifically thought of as an​“Indian CCC,” and it was quite large and effective in bringing material benefits to these nations in many cases. Perhaps the Roosevelt administration did not achieve its greatest successes with the Indian New Deal, but it did reverse a policy of breaking up native lands and giving them away to individuals. It also restored the federal government is commitment to Indian sovereignty. From the beginning, the Roosevelt administration contained a particular strain of feminist politics, and not only because of Eleanor Roosevelt is influence in the Roosevelt household. Frances Perkins, Roosevelt is secretary of labor, also became an integral figure in the implementation of social welfare policies. But those social welfare policies generally focused on preserving the normative idea of the family, with the male breadwinner at its head. They thought their top priority was giving men jobs, and that it would lead to assistance for their wives and children. Women were eligible for specific employment under New Deal programs that included leading in-kind assistance and library programs, among other stereotypically feminine jobs. There were women professionals and artists who were employed by divisions of the WPA, but most of this work was in construction, which was limited to men at the time. The New Deal reinforced and preserved the gender norms of the time, by and large.lective bargaining, and the National Labor Relations Act is one of his lasting legacies. Do you think legislation like thePRO Act, which strengthens collective bargaining rights, is necessary to implement an effective modern-day New Deal?During the ultimately failed effort to organize an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., President Biden gave a statement about how it is up to the workers to decide whether they want to join a union — that it is not up to him, and it is not up to management. That is no more than a statement of the law that we now have in this country to day, but it was greeted as a revolutionaryJoe Hillkind of thing — because merely affirming that we have union rights in law now seems radical for a president of the USs. It suggests to me where we are as a society. New Deal legacy laws are actually pretty good already. The problem is that we do not staff or adequately fund the agencies that are supposed to enforce them. We have also allowed the federal judiciary to strip away many of the rights that the letter of the law guarantees. To reinvigorate the union movement probably would be a tremendous boon for any New Deal type program going forward, and the Democratic Party more generally. I hope you found this article important.

391,Wyoming is last contact tracers,0.0,47.33,https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-wyomings-last-contact-tracers,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,16,"In November, the state of Wyoming announced that it had ceased calling the contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 to let them know they may have been exposed to the virus. Instead, i tasked Wyomingitesto do it the mselves. Health officials from some counties and tribes have continued their own contact-tracing programs, however — and, with the state is resources stretched thin, that patchwork of local coverage remains key to supporting Wyoming communities. About six weeks before the announcement, the number of COVID-19 cases in Wyoming began to spike. The state saw just a few dozen new cases a day throughout the spring and summer, but by late November, there were multiple days with more than 1,000 new cases. Surges in hospitalizations and deaths soon followed. With only around 130 public health workers available to make calls statewide, the state had to triage its efforts. It chose to focus on calling people who test positive, but it no longer attempted to notify their close contacts. As a result, groups like Teton County is contact tracing team — comprising two dozen County Health Department employees and volunteers — are the state is remaining contact tracers. When the group started contact tracing, in March, the caseload felt manageable. By late November, it had become overwhelming.“There is no break,” said Andi Gordon, Teton County is COVID-19 lead case coordinator. But the team remains dedicated to trying to curb the virus’ spread — and keep the community united. “We are trying to hold on so strongly to that personal touch. I want to keep calling people, because I think people really value that.”The Teton County Health Department held a drive-through testing event this May 1,346 people were tested for COVID-19. As case loads have risen in the last two months, contact tracing efforts have dwindled. Ryan DorganOn the ground, contact tracers are making vital connections between local residents and community resources. Erin Engavo-Munnell, the COVID coordinator at Eastern Shoshone Tribal Health on the Wind River Reservation, said that she and her team are able to connect with their neighbors in a way people outside the area may not be able to. (The state has contracted with a company called Waller Hall to help with case investigations, but its employees largely call from outside Wyoming.) “All three of us who do contact tracing are enrolled members, and members of the local community — people are more likely totalk to us and give us information, and be more open,” said Engavo-Munnell. She also tells people about services that can deliver food and cleaning supplies to them while they are in quarantine, whether they live on the reservation or not.“There was not anyone to drive them. Who is going to drive a COVID-positive person?”In Teton County, Gordon is team is so well-connected that they frequently end up calling people they know. “It is a small community,” she said. “We say to the team, ‘If you think it is going to facilitate the work, go for it, but if you think it is going to complicate it, recuse yourself.’ It happens a lot.” The team has also facilitated some on-the-fly problem solving. For instance, they realized that COVID-positive people often were not able to get home from the hospital. “There was not anyone to drive them. Who is going to drive a COVID-positive person?” said Gordon. Ultimately, local firefighters and EMTs pitched in, as did the police department, which used sheriff is vans with enclosed cabs to transport people. The team also enlisted the local sheriff is office to help pick up and deliver prescriptions to quarantining residents. The borders between reservations and counties are permeable, however, and that can complicate the tasks these small teams are doing to try to control the spread of COVID-19 in their communities. Sometimes, said Gordon, they will call someone only to discover they have already traveled somewhere, if only as far as the next county. That means more potential exposures, and more calls for the team. The Wind River Reservation is surrounded by Fremont and Hot Springs counties, so people often end up traveling through it. In the initial weeks of the pandemic, while Fremont County clinics limited testing amid staffing and supply shortages, the Wind River Reservation offered testing to any local residents, enrolled tribal members or not., other areas, inundated by new cases, have handed off all calls to the state — which means only COVID-positive people are being contacted. Fremont County is nurse manager, Becky Parkins, confirmed in mid-December that the county is no longer contact tracing. (She declined to answer further questions, noting that she was focused on facilitating the county is imminent rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.) Without tracing, there are fewer opportunities to stop the chain of viral transmission; even though Wyomingites are asked to call their contacts, illness or stigma may prevent them from doing so. It also masks the extent of community spread — and that can make peopleless concerned about the virus and less willing to take precautions. New cases started to decline in December, and Clay Van Houten, the Wyoming Department of Health is infectious disease epidemiology unit manager, said that the state will monitor COVID-19 numbers to determine whether it can resume contact tracing. “It will depend on what we see over the next few weeks,” Van Houten said in mid-December. One option is to contact trace on a case-by-case basis to maximize resources. “If we can identify clear exposure for folks, or clear exposures for others to the case, the n it makes sense to do more intense contact tracing,” he said. Meanwhile, local contact tracers continue calling, and calling, and calling. “While sometimes it feels like we are just drowning, at the same time, I always want to keep in mind that every person we do get ahold of is one person we have been able to make a difference with,” said Janet Garland, Teton County Health Department is nurse manager. “If we do not get to everybody on the list to day, they will be there tomorrow — and we have made a difference for those folks we got to today.”High Country Newsand an independent journalist who writes about science,technology and the outdoors.

392,Jim Carrey Resigns From Joe Biden Duties at ‘Saturday Night Live’,-1.5,42.83,https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/jim-carrey-joe-biden-saturday-night-live-departure-1234867021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-19,21,"The nation has a president-elect. But who will play him on “Saturday Night Live” as he prepares to be sworn into office?The question is open anew after actorJim Carreytook to Twitter Saturday to tell fans he was leaving behind the impression ofJoe Bidenhe has offered over the course of the first six episodes of the show is 46th season. Carrey has not appeared in sketches in “SNL is” last two broadcasts, nor has Alec Baldwin, who has portrayed President Donald Trump for the past four seasons and the early part of the current one.“Though my term was only meant to be 6 weeks, I was thrilled to be elected as your SNL President,” the actor said via Twitter. ” I would love to go forward knowing that Biden was the victor because I nailed that s–t. But I am just one in a long line of proud, fighting SNL Bidens!”Carrey is announcement opens the part to someone else. While “Saturday Night Live” did not immediately offer insight as to who might pick up the impression, Carrey is departure could allow a cast member to take over or give the show a chance to find a different contributor. Former cast member Maya Rudolph has been playing Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in recent episodes. Playing the role of the US president on “SNL” can be overwhelming. In press reports, Baldwin has suggested he is grappled with some of the response his Trump impression has sparked. Chevy Chase is still remembered for playing a clumsy, stumbling President Gerald Ford in the show is earliest days, and Dana Carvey is impression of President George HW Bush was recognized by the Commander-in-Chief himself. Others have played Biden in the past. Former cast member Jason Sudeikis for many years offered a version of Biden whose brio often overtook an ability to stay on message. Woody Harrelson played Biden during a hosting stint on “SNL” in 2019, and returned to play him once again. John Mulaney played him last season. The first “SNL” cast member to portray Biden was Kevin Nealon, who provided an impression in 1991, when the show lampooned the US Senate is confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas’ nomination the Supreme Court. Carrey is portrayal took “SNL” to new places. Opening sketches featuring Carrey as Biden were longer and more involved than usual — one was more than 13 minutes in length — and often featured Carrey tangling with Baldwin is Trump; being assisted by Rudolph is Harris; or accompanied by Heidi Gardner is Dr. Jill Biden. In one of these “cold opens,” the ersatz former Vice President transformed himself into a fly and traveled to the national debate between Senator Harris and current Vice President Mike Pence. In the process, Carrey went from imitating Biden to aping actor Jeff Goldblum, who had the starring role as an eccentric scientist in the 1986 film, “The Fly.” In another broadcast, Carrey is Biden used a remote control device to turn off Baldwin is President Trump and give the nation a moment of peace. “Is not that satisfying?” Carrey is politician asked.“SNL” viewers will no doubt be eager to see who might play Biden for the next period of time. Given Carrey is resignation, it is certainly possible a new impersonator could be revealed soon. The next broadcast of “SNL” appears tonight onNBCat 11:30 p.m. eastern.",1,1,Variety

394,US election drama ups the ante for Europe is signature next-gen weapon,2.67,45.5,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/11/06/us-election-drama-ups-the-ante-for-europes-signature-next-gen-weapon/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-06,24,"STUTTGART, Germany – The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election has reinvigorated conversations regarding Europe is efforts to rebuild its own defense capabilities – no matter who occupies the White House. Recent commitments to invest in pan-European defense solutions are becoming more urgent, and observers are looking for proof that these proposed joint programs are truly coming to life. One effort being held up to the microscope is mainland Europe is program to field a next-generation fighter aircraft and weapon program by 2040. TheFuture Combat Air System, or FCAS, includes a sixth-generation fighter jet, multiple “remote carrier” drones, a next-generation weapon system, a brand new jet engine, advanced sensors and stealth technologies, and an “air combat cloud.” Airbus and Dassault Aviation serve as lead contractors for the program, representing Germany and France, respectively. Indra leads Spain is industry participation. FCAS is among multiple pan-European defense programs that have emerged amid four years of a US presidency under Donald Trump. Since 2016, Trump has questioned the ongoing relevancy of trans-Atlantic efforts, including NATO, and called on European allies to spend more on their collective defense. As of Friday morning, votes continued to be tallied to determine the next leader of the USs. On the eve of the election, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warned in an op-ed published by Politico that the “illusions of European strategic autonomy must come to an end.”While the minister emphasized that policymakers in Germany and Europe must continue to ramp up their military capabilities, she also urged the continent to acknowledge that “for the foreseeable future, we will remain dependent” upon US security cooperation. Other US-European policy observers wrote on social media this week that the chaotic process of the presidential election should be a wakeup call for Europe to maintain a laser focus on its own strategic destiny. Asked whether the US election may complicate Europe is motivation to build joint military capabilities, Joel Barre, director of the French procurement office Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) recently told reporters that the Franco-German cooperation on FCAS and other programs would remain “anchored.”The next five years will be crucial for the program to prove itself, analysts and nation stakeholders agreed. The partners involved are moving quickly through the effort is initial stages, said Bruno Fichefeux, FCAS leader for Airbus, in an interview. Since the program is inception in 2017, the industry team is now 19 companies wide and has invested over 200 million euros into the ongoing Joint Concept Study phase, along with signed technology demonstrator contracts, he noted.“It is a sign of a strong motivation by all partners to make it happen,” he said. The results of the Joint Concept Study, launched in 2019, are expected to be revealed in summer 2021, the French defense ministry told Defense News. Meanwhile, the teams are working in parallel on Phase 1A of the demonstrator portion, launched this past February and scheduled to run for 18 months. Theinitial demonstrators for the next-generation fighter and remote carrier drones are expected by 2026, while the advanced combat cloud may be introduced a year earlier, a source close to the program told Defense News. The full development program is currently slated to begin around 2027. While all of the FCAS components should enter service in 2040 – to replace the partner nations' fleets of Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon fighters – certain capabilities may come online sooner. For example, some first-generation remote carrier drones may be available in the early 2030s to upgrade existing Eurofighter jets, the source said. Several key decisions remain to be made. The stakeholders have not yet established a date when they will solidify the fighter jet and remote carrier designs, according to Fichefeux. The question of work share division also remains in flux. “You have to base the work share on the typical criteria – who has the skills, who has the knowledge, who has the technology, who is the best player to ensure that we can move forward on this technology without duplicating it – while ensuring a level of cooperation. And this is what the nations are expecting of us,” he said. “It is not a competition program. It is a cooperation program.”Programs like FCAS will position Europe is defense companies to remain competitive in the global market, analysts said. The complex effort to build a “system of systems” involving multiple components and cutting-edge technical fields, has no equivalent in the history of arms cooperation programs in Europe, said Hélène Masson, a senior research fellow at the Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique, a French independent think tank. There is pressure to ensure that European industrial players maintain and enhance their technological prowess, and to compete against their American, Asian and Russian counterparts, she told Defense News. The success of FCAS will depend on the quality of the Joint Concept Study and demonstrator phases, with the goal of reducing technological risks “and the refore limit delays and possible additional costs,” Masson said. The program needs to start showing that it has a “degree of momentum,” said Sash Tusa, an aerospace and defense partner at Agency Partners, a London-based independent research firm.“It is important to focus on three key data points: one, when is the demonstrator going to fly; two, when is the prototype going to be flying; three, when is the in-service date,” he told Defense News. “Those are the three absolutely cast-in-stone dates, and as soon as they start moving, that tells you something about the program.”FCAS could still suffer from its “deeply political nature,” Tusa noted. Previous efforts to build a Franco-German fighter jet have devolved into separate programs amid disputes over workshare. The program could be a “litmus test” for France to prove that it is committed to a joint European weapons program this time around, said Dan Darling, a senior analyst for Forecast International, a US market intelligence firm. With Spain joining FCAS nearly three years into the program, questions still remain regarding work share among the partner nations. Indra, Madrid is industry lead, did not respond to requests for comment by this article is publication. But even if its work share portion is smaller than that of Paris and Berlin, the research and development efforts that Spain will be privy to as part of FCAS serve as an opportunity that the nation “did not want to pass up,” Darling said. Some watchers remain skeptical that this joint fighter jet effort will succeed where previous endeavors have failed. “It is important to remember that it would take a serious breakthrough in Franco-German defense politics to change the status quo,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group, a US-based market analysis firm. But the current geopolitical pressures on Europe serve as powerful incentives for the program to succeed, Fichefeux noted.“The complexity of [FCAS] requires nations to put their strengths together, not only in terms of funding, but also in terms of industrial capacity and technologies,” he said. “This trend towards sovereignty ... really favors such a program as FCAS.”“The geopolitical situation that we are facing reminds us every day that we need to have our own capabilities, and need to be able to operate in the future the aters within a sovereign manner,” he continued.

395,How Trump could factor into legal defenses of North Texans accused of threats and storming Capitol,-0.33,40.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2021/01/31/how-trump-could-factor-into-legal-defenses-of-north-texans-accused-of-threats-and-storming-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-31,25,"They were just following the instructions of their president. They had become “radicalized” by Donald Trump is speeches as well as the hyper charged language of his cult like following on social media. Those are the legal arguments that are expected to be advanced by some North Texans along with dozens of others accused of taking part in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol in Washington DC that left five dead. Dozens of arrests have been made across the nation. The pro-Trump mob included known extremists as well as ordinary people seemingly caught up in the moment. Most of those charged have either documented their involvement on social media or were identified in photos and video, making it challenging for their attorneys to mount a defense. Luis A Reyes, a former federal prosecutor who is held senior positions at the White House and in the Justice Department, said the government does not always have video and photographic evidence in criminal cases. Read the crime and public safety news your neighbors are talking about. “So the defense has to start getting a little creative,” said Reyes, a lawyer for the Ashcroft firm in Austin. A common the me to emerge from several North Texas detention hearings over the past two weeks is that many of the alleged intruders at the Capitol were following the instructions of Trump, who held a rally the same day in which he claimed the election was stolen. The “public authority” defense has already been hinted at by some defense lawyers as an option. One lawyer — for an Arizona man known as QAnon Shaman — has said Trump bears responsibility for what happened. But the bar is high and it is considered a long shot, legal experts say. Most of the accused will probably enter pleas and hope for leniency, as long as they do not face the more serious charge of seditious conspiracy, according to experts. Other approaches might include a First Amendment defense — that they were exercising their right to free assembly; while some might use the opportunity of a public trial to highlight their convictions or attempt to sway jurors with appeals to their sense of patriotism and justice. But defense lawyers say many alleged rioters could use the “Trump defense” and similar arguments not to seek acquittal but as a mitigating factor during the sentencing phase. This public authority defense, sometimes used by police informants, makes the argument that someone in authority approved or sanctioned the conduct in question. Jennifer Ryan, a Frisco real estate broker whose intrusion into the Capitol was captured in photos, for example, said the president asked his supporters to be the re, and she “answered the call” because she believes that the November election was rigged.“We were going in solidarity with President Trump,” said Ryan, 50. “President Trump requested that we be in DC on the 6th. So this was our way of going and stopping the steal.”She wrote in a statement that she did not condone the violence that occurred and was “heartbroken” for those who died. Dallas resident Troy Smocks said he went to Washington at Trump is invitation, the FBI says. Smocks believes all citizens have a duty to rise up and defend the nation if the president calls for it, an FBI agent said during testimony. Smocks’ attorney has said that the government used snippets from his online posts that were taken out of context and that his client had no intent to threaten any specific people. Reyes said the public authority defense can be challenging because it comes with a reasonableness test. The question is, would a reasonable person think it is really OK to storm the Capitol because someone in authority directed it — even when police were trying to stop it?Derek Staub, a Dallas defense lawyer who practices in federal court, said that defense “typically never goes anywhere” unless the defendant has a signed cooperation agreement with a government agency. Family members of other local defendants have said their loved ones had become increasingly radical in their politics and that their personalities completely changed. The QAnon conspiracy theory, often likened to a cult, has been blamed for some of the more extremist views held by Trump supporters. Garret Miller is brother, Jason Miller, told a Dallas federal judge recently that the 34-year-old Richardson college graduate had transformed from a regular person uninterested in politics into a true believer in a larger cause after being sucked into a “cult” of Donald Trump. He blamed the social media “feedback loop” that has radicalized many ordinary Americans, leading them to believe, falsely, that the November election was stolen. Miller is attorney, Clint Broden, said there is no evidence that his client harmed anyone or acted violently while on the Capitol grounds. Broken said in a statement that Miller is “prepared to testify” at any congressional proceeding. Trump has already been impeached for a second time, for inciting the mob to descend on the Capitol, and Democrats are currently trying to convict him in the Senate. Family and friends of Larry Brock told The New Yorkerthat the retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and Grapevine resident had become increasingly extreme and radical in his political beliefs in recent years. Brock was captured in photos and in video walking around inside the Senate chamber with zip ties during the January 6 uprising. His federal public defender said in court that his client is charged with misdemeanors and is not accused of hurting anyone. And the teenage son of accused rioter Guy Reffitt, an oil rig worker from Wylie, has said his father became increasingly aligned with “far-right extremists” online. He blamed Trump for pushing his father to the far right and said he could not recognize him anymore. Reffitt is wife said he never entered the Capitol or harmed anyone. His attorney declined to comment. The families of accused Islamic terrorists also described loved ones as being brainwashed or radicalized, but such claims did not become legal defenses in federal courts. Relatives and friends of Richard Reid, known as the “Shoe Bomber,” and John Walker Lindh, the “American Taliban,” insisted the men were brainwashed by al-Qaeda. And the brother of Zacarias Moussaoui, who helped plan the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the US, said the French citizen had fallen prey to an “extremist brainwashing cult.”Both men ended up pleading guilty. Most famously, the brainwashing defense was used — and failed — during the 1976 bank robbery trial of heiress Patty Hearst, who was kidnapped by an armed revolutionary group called the Symbionese Liberation Army. Reyes said lawyers who wish to make a case for brainwashing or political radicalization would have to demonstrate that their clients have a strong enough mental disability to prevent them from knowing right from wrong. Destroying evidence, as some of the rioters are accused of doing, would be one way to show the person understands the distinction, he added.“That is a hard burden to prove,” Reyes said, “and it is almost akin to an insanity defense.”Mark Reichel, an attorney in Sacramento, Calif., said an argument for brainwashing could be made in some cases by claiming that members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol were repeatedly “provided mass suggestions of fraud and criminal theft of the election.”He said many of these cases involve a combination of “mass suggestion,” the “repetition of the message,” and the star qualities of a president who is a cultural celebrity in addition to being commander in chief. Combined, these factors could overly burden an “already unsteady mind,” he said. Such a defense might have a better chance in a trial before a judge rather than a jury, particularly if the judge is a Trump appointee, Reichel added. It could also be reserved for sentencing to try to lessen the punishment, he said. But Chris Jenks, an SMU law professor, said the claim that an alleged wrongdoer was just following orders has not worked “since the Nazis tried it at Nuremberg.” And trying to blame it on the cult of QAnon also is a stretch, he added.“Anyone who completed junior high and managed to find their way to DC at the right time and place is going to have a tough time raising competency” as a defense, Jenks said. He said federal criminal law also recognizes the excuse of duress, but that Trump “did not threaten the protesters with violence.”Reyes said he thinks most of the federal cases related to the storming of the Capitol will end with plea bargains, especially the less serious ones involving trespass. Some of the more prominent defendants, however, will probably be made examples of by the government to send the message that “this is not OK,” he said. A few might resist their lawyers’ advice, saying, “No, I want to tell the world why I was the re,’” Reyes said.“If a defendant wants a trial, he will get a trial,” he said. Others may attempt to “cloak the mselves in the First Amendment” by arguing that their freedom of expression and assembly was infringed upon, Reyes said. This is, as Reyes put it, the claim that “what I am being prosecuted for is my viewpoint and my right to free assembly.”Juries can be unpredictable. The Bundys, a family of ranchers with extremist militia support, were acquitted more than once by federal juries for charges related to their armed takeovers of federal land and standoffs with law enforcement. Those juries, however, were in Oregon and Nevada. Brian Poe, a former federal prosecutor in Fort Worth, said outcomes are likely to be different in the insurrection-related cases that are charged in Washington.“Given the political climate in DC, I am not sure the jurors in that venue will accept such a defense,” he said.",1,2,Dallas Morning News

397,Hunter Biden is art deal will keep buyers' identities a secret,-3.67,45.0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunter-bidens-art-deal-will-keep-buyers-identities-a-secret/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"When Hunter Biden is art is sold later this year, the public will not know who is buying his paintings —and neither will Hunter Biden, the White House, or his father, President Biden. According to a White House official, any buyer is identity will be kept secret by the gallery owner. However, buyers may choose to make their identities known. Another source familiar with the sales arrangement told CBS News that the New York gallery owner who is showing Hunter Biden is paintings, George Bergès, will have the ability to reject offers that raise alarms. Potential conflicts could include offers above the asking price from buyers seeking political influence with the Biden family. Bergès estimates that Hunter Biden isworkcould fetch between $75,000 and $500,000 per painting, according to a spokesperson for the gallery. According toArtnet, Biden has no formal artistic training and has only begun working as an artist full time in recent years. Art prices are subjective and vary considerably, and paintings by celebrity artists can be overvalued. The decision to reject offers above market value, against Bergès financial interest, will be left to him. And since the buyer is identity is shielded, only Bergès, not the public, will be able to scrutinize the transaction. Bergès will be compensated for selling the paintings, CBS News confirmed with his gallery is spokesperson. He will retain a percentage from the sales comparable to the arrangements his gallery has with other artists, though the spokesperson declined to provide the exact percentage. Typically, galleries take around 50% of a sale.

It is not clear the White House could legally stop Hunter Biden, a private citizen, from profiting on his art. The White House expressed satisfaction with the arrangement that is being implemented.""After careful consideration, a system has been established to allow Hunter Biden to work in his profession within reasonable safeguards,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. ""Of course he has the right to pursue and artistic career just like any child of a president has the right to pursue a career. But all interactions regarding the selling of art and the setting of prices will be handled by a professional galler ist adhering to the highest industry standards, and any offer our of the normal course would be rejected out of hand.""The president has also championed his administration is commitment to transparency in government. Yet Psaki presented the secrecy of the anonymous-buyer arrangement as a virtue.""The galler ist will not share information about buyers or prospective buyers including their identities with Hunter Biden or the administration which provides quite a level of protection and transparency,"" Psaki said.

The gallery is holding two art shows for BIden is work later this year, according to the gallery spokesperson.""I do not paint from emotion or feeling, which I think are both very ephemeral,"" Hunter Biden told Artnet in June. ""For me, painting is much more about kind of trying to bring forth what is, I think, the universal truth.""During the 2020 presidential campaign, Republicans pounced on Hunter Biden is business dealings with aUkrainian energy company while his father oversaw US-Ukraine policy as vice president. Former President Trump argued the Ukraine deal showed impropriety in the Biden family. Joe Biden stood by his son — and the foreign deal — during a Democratic primary debate in October 2019. ""My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,"" Biden said at the time. In December, federal prosecutors announced they had been investigating Hunter Biden is taxes, beginning in 2018. The Trump family also drew intense scrutiny for profiting from its eponymous hotel and golf business during Mr. Trump is presidency. Hunter Biden, while promoting his memoir in April, continued to defend his previous foreign business actions but told CBS News' Anthony Mason he would not make the Ukrainian deal again.

398,The Trump Presidency and What Happens After: A Catholic Take,1.67,36.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/the-trump-presidency-and-what-happens-after-a-catholic-take,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-19,16,"As Donald Trump exits the national stage, it is a good time for Catholics to reflect on what factors gave rise to his unique presidency and to assess how to respond to his conflicted legacy. The rise of Donald Trump is unintelligible apart from the larger forces that have reshaped our politics since the end of the Reagan administration, forces associated with the passing away of the post-World War II order that defined political life across the West. For nearly half a century, politics was dominated by centrist parties competing for centrist voters over who could best manage economic growth and the Cold War. The collapse of Soviet communism and large-scale changes brought about by increased automation, globalization and financialization of the economy broke that mold. As Gerald Seib recently noted inTheWall Street Journal, one can see harbingers of Trumpism in the losing presidential campaigns of both Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot. Buchanan, himself a Catholic, is a particularly interesting figure, since, having earlier been a speech writer for Richard Nixon, he served as an aid to Ronald Reagan before challenging Reagan is vice president and successor, George HW Bush, in a 1992 campaign that stressed the costs of deindustrialization, global trade and military over-commitment. Buchanan pointed to the struggles of working-class Americans increasingly unable to achieve stable middle-class economic status in the world of rapidly changing, high tech-driven, and globally interconnected labor and capital markets. Automation and competition with foreign workers, as well as immigrants, were seen by these workers as driving down wages and shrinking the number of available jobs. Both Democrats and Republicans still seemed to agree on the virtues of free trade and globalization in the 1990s; only in the wake of the Great Recession of 2007-2008 did radical critics from both left and right emerge to challenge the mainstream, most dramatically in the form of the Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party movements, followed by the insurgent presidential candidacies of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Understanding Trump, however, requires noting something else about the collapse of the post-war order: the concomitant shift in mainstream views about morality and culture. This, too, followed a long process of development. Here, the harbinger of change was already visible in the late-1960s with the emergence of the “new social movements” associated with ecology, women is equality, the rights of racial minorities and sexual liberation. In many cases, these movements were responses to real injustices that demanded correction. However, they are related to two other factors that have worked to challenge the viability of the traditional political parties and to alienate, in particular, Christian voters from political elites. First, these movements manifested and further drove a turn in politics from issues of economic welfare to those of identity. Political scientist Ronald Inglehartand his collaborators have gathered decades worth of data to show a large-scale shift in politics across the West from what they call “survival values” associated mainly with material well-being and emphasizing self-discipline and solidarity to “self-expression values,” which emphasize autonomy, creativity and identity, enabled by the growing material prosperity in these societies since the Second World War and correlated with a loss of both a broader sense of national identity and — here is the second factor — religious faith. The result of this is secularization and identity-driven politics, twin phenomena that lead to a public life that is more fractious and less subject to compromise, but also invested with a pseudo-religious significance. Politics becomes both more ultimate and more dysfunctional. The ruling classes of Western societies have internalized all this, but those who live outside the great metropolitan concentrations of wealth, privilege and influence, and who have paid a disproportionate share of the price of these processes in a loss of stability, community and respect, have, as one might have expected, reacted against it. They and their communities have been left behind, as documented in one way by George Packer and in another by Timothy Carney, and, in their alienation, were ready for the message of someone like Donald Trump, with his promise to “make America great again,” a reaffirmation of distinctly national identity and of associated traditional values, values that have come to be identified with life in rural America and the white working class. Evangelical Protestants and Catholics are important segments of this population, with Catholics, in particular, concentrated in swing states. Many of the concerns of these Americans resonate with Catholic social teaching; for example, the role of work in understanding and promoting human dignity; the centrality of family and community; the importance not just of a healthy natural environment, but of a healthy moral and spiritual one; and a concern that the common good of our political community not be lost in more abstract concerns for the global common good, real though they are. They are also more likely to oppose abortion and to favor strong protections for religious freedom. On those last two issues, Trump made specific commitments and largely kept them. With other aspects of Catholic social teaching, there were serious differences, especially the Trump administration is regrettable enthusiasm for the death penalty and prosecution — intentional, we now know, thanks to theJustice Department is inspector general— of a shockingly callous and destructive policy of family separation against illegal immigrants at the southern border. While the terms “populism” and “nationalism” have often been used to describe the movement led by Trump, these abstractions are of little help in understanding the concerns of real people. That their interests be considered as part of the common good, and that national identity remains a valuable force for unity in political communities, a unity necessary to underwrite sacrifices undertaken by some for the benefit of others whom they do not know, and which are essential for political life, are truths not to be easily dismissed. When they are dismissed by the people in charge, others will assert the m, and likely without the intellectual or moral depth that they require in order to serve as reasons for policy and practice. Trump is “Make America Great Again” agenda seemed to present possibilities distinct from the traditional positions of the post-war Republican Party and the aggressive identity politics and secularism of the contemporary Democratic Party: an unabashed affirmation of pride in US history and accomplishments; an alignment of immigration policy more closely with US national interest; attention to the problems of rural and Rust Belt areas, especially by infrastructure and industrial policies meant to recover middle-class jobs; and commitment to the protection of unborn life and religious liberty. Catholics constituted a crucial component of a coalition supportive of such priorities. These concerns, however, have not had the expression they deserve and expected in Trump is presidency. His conduct in office has been, notwithstanding some specific exceptions, too often uninformed, superficial and shambolic. Assisted by speech writers and teleprompters, and in moments of self-discipline, he could say things that needed to be said. But much of the time what was most important was drowned out by his habitual coarseness and indifference to both facts and values. Even when he did commit to the right things, execution was clumsy and often ineffective, as in the cases of immigration, the trade war with China, and much foreign policy. The real problem, however, manifested repeatedly in word and deed, was that Trump is main interests seemed not to be those of the people whose champion he claimed to be and who put him in office. His basic outlook is, in a word, primitive, centered on himself, his immediate family, and his useful friends. He took to people based on appearances, transactions and, ultimately, personal loyalty, as distinct from intelligence, competence or character, and this led him to tolerate and even encourage dangerous extremists among his supporters. His mode of government was prepolitical or patrimonial, in that he looked on the institutions of government as property that he had acquired and on public officials, elected or appointed, as his employees or retainers — with the exception of those who were simply his enemies. In the end, for Trump, there are only winners and losers, and his inability to make sense of himself as anything other than a winner surely encouraged the violence of January 6. The appalling events of that day as well as the violence and disorder of this past summer are a warning about the sort of future we can expect if the present polarization is not moderated by a renewed commitment to a common political destiny. Our Catholic tradition tells us that politics is an enterprise grounded in reason and self-restraint deployed for the sake of a common good, the flourishing of all of us. Moreover, Catholic social teaching fits with a focus on priorities that would seem conducive to the promotion of a centrist politics that combines a commitment to the welfare of the poor and the working class, an immigration policy that is both reasonable and humane and fidelity to the Constitution is protection of religious freedom as good in itself and as the foremost guarantee of a free and vigorous civil society, as well as advancing the protection of all human life. The exit of Donald Trump from the scene can be an occasion for Catholics to give witness, by word and deed, to the enduring truths contained in our tradition but intended for all men and women of goodwill. Our republic needs them more than ever.

399,Who are the out-of-state billionaires backing ranked-choice voting in Massachusetts?,-5.0,47.33,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/25/metro/who-are-out-of-state-billionaires-backing-ranked-choice-voting-massachusetts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-25,25,"In April of last year, John Arnold warned in a Houston Chronicle op-ed that democracy at the local level was in “crisis.” A former energy hedge fund manager and Enron trader turned philanthropist, Arnold argued that a ranked-choice voting system, in place of runoff or two-round elections, could help spur more competition and, perhaps, voter interest.“Houston,” the billionaire wrote of his hometown, “should aim to lead the way in bringing it to Texas.”Eighteen months later, it is voters in Massachusetts and Alaska — not Texas — weighing whether to push into a new frontier of voting this November. It is also still Arnold helping drive the case for why they should. AdvertisementArnold and his wife, Laura, are among a network of wealthy out-of-state donors helping fuel ranked-choice voting ballot initiatives in Massachusetts and beyond, by seeding local committees with millions of dollars and, in the Arnolds’ case, buttressing research on the system is potential impact. Through their Action Now Initiative, the Arnolds have committed nearly $3.4 million in support of the Massachusetts ballot proposal, known as Question 2. Kathryn Murdoch, the daughter-in-law of Rupert Murdoch, has personally given $2.5 million since early September. The Denver-based nonpartisan group Unite America, which she co-chairs and has seeded with millions toward supporting democratic reforms, has contributed $445,000. Neither the Arnolds nor Murdoch agreed to interview requests sent through the respective organizations they lead, which instead offered on-the-record statements. In all, of the $9.8 million the Yes on 2 committee has raised, just 19 donors — 12 of whom hail from outside Massachusetts — gave a combined $9.2 million. Donors outside the state make up 84 percent of all the cash it has reportedly collected. It is a similar story elsewhere. In Alaska, where voters are weighing athree-pronged initiative, including using ranked-choice voting in general elections, the Arnolds and Unite America have given a combined $4.6 million, the vast majority of what Alaskans for Better Elections has raised. The Arnolds also put more than $1 million behind two separate, and successful, ranked-choice voting efforts in Maine, as well as$1 million mo rein the successful effort last year to adopt it in New York City, making Action Now Initiative its leading donor. That financial heft underscores the intense interest, and faith, that national advocates say they have in the system, as well as the role that states, including Massachusetts, could play as a bellwether in its adoption on a wider scale. Fewer than 20 cities or counties currently use ranked-choice voting, and Maine is the only state where it is deployed for statewide and federal races.“We are a very important bell cow,” said Michael Porter, a Harvard University professor, Brookline resident, and, with $450,000 in donations, Yes on 2′s biggest in-state contributor. “I think Massachusetts will be one of the next rounds of states that are serious and are putting this measure in place because we believe that political innovation has to happen in America.”But the spigot of out-of-state funding has also drawn skepticism from ranked-voice voting is critics, who have used the heavy reliance on national cash as a key plank in their opposition to something that would have a profound effect on Massachusetts elections. It remains to be seen whether that sways voters’ feelings forth e ballot question, which has run even or ahead in scant public polling. Advertisement“Money flows around the political system all the time. This thing will either win or lose on the strength or weakness of the arguments, and whether, more broadly, people view it as a solution to a problem that exists,” said Jack Santucci, an assistant teaching professor at Drexel University who has researched ranked-choice voting. “You ca not create demand for this stuff. And you ca not purchase demand for it.”As proposed inQuestion 2 on Massachusetts' ballot, ranked-choice elections would give voters the option of ranking candidates for an office in order of preference. If a candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-choice votes, he or she isth e winner. But if no one does, the candidate with the fewest votes is stripped away and those voters are reallocated to the remaining candidates based on their second choice. The process goes for as many rounds as it takes for one candidate to earn a majority of votes. If approved, the new system would be used for primary and general elections for statewide offices — governor, attorney general, and more — as well as congressional, state legislative, and district attorney offices starting in 2022. It would not apply to presidential elections or municipal elections. The Arnolds’ group began seeding such efforts beginning in Maine, struck by what it has described as paralysis in lawmaking and frustration with the status quo. Sam Mar, a vice president at Arnold Ventures, said that in Massachusetts and elsewhere, the Arnolds donated money because there already was a base of local support and volunteers behind the ranked-choice initiatives. Advertisement“Ultimately we are all part of this country, and we should all be pitching in to help voters strengthen our democracy, regardless of where we live,” Mar said. That has included pumping money into political reform research, including$500,000to the think tank New America. (Santucci, the Drexel professor, is among the researchers who have a contract with New America, under which he is studying whether ranked-choice voting promotes more women and people of color to run.)The Arnolds also are not strangers to Massachusetts’ political landscape. In 2016, John Arnold gave $250,000 to an unsuccessful effort to lift the cap on charter schools in Massachusetts, and they poured more than$500,000 into a PACthat helped bolster Governor Charlie Baker is reelection in 2018. Last year, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now, a bipartisan political group that the couple has funded, put hundreds of thousands of dollars into an ad campaign backing a Baker proposal to control prescription drug costs. Those helping lead the ranked-choice ballot initiative argue that despite the out-of-state help, the push is rooted in local support. Evan Falchuk, Yes on 2′s chairman, said he first joined the effort in 2017, and the ballot question has the backing of prominent Massachusetts officials, from former governors Deval Patrick and William F Weld to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J Markey, among others. AdvertisementPlus, the committee directly solicited the out-of-state financial help, saidMike Zarren, the assistant general manager of the Boston Celtics and a Yes on 2 board member.“We reached out to a bunch of democracy activists. They all did not find us,” Zarren said, arguing that the outside donors have no financial incentive to see ranked-choice voting pass. “If you care about this nationally, you sort of have to do it state by state.“Still, the zip code of the donors has provided a consistent rallying cry for its opponents.“Why are they so interested in Massachusetts voting system?” said Anthony Amore, a former Republican candidate for secretary of state who has acted as an informal volunteer spokesman for the committee opposed to Question 2. Asked what he believes the motivation is, Amore said he is hesitant to speculate.“It should give people pause, as it should for any political candidate or ballot initiative, of who is funding it,” he said. Some Democrats, too, have preached wariness. Kevin Connor, an aide to state Senator Harriette L Chandler, warned in aCommonwealth Magazineop-ed that Murdoch is endorsement of ranked-choice voting as a way to help alleviate extreme partisanship “erases the impact of progressive champions like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.”He added that “for Massachusetts progressives fighting the status quo, a voting regime that drags election results to the center should be viewed with skepticism — especially when moneyed interests are so supportive.”Nick Troiano, the executive director of Unite America, which Murdoch co-chairs, said in a statement that it is backing ranked-choice in Massachusetts because it can give voters “more power in their elections and more choice on their ballot.”The narrative is not limited to Massachusetts. In right-leaning Alaska, the state Republican Party, as well as groups such as Planned Parenthood, oppose the ballot measure the re, which also would create so-called open, or nonpartisan, primaries. Alaskans, known for their libertarian and independent streak, often bristle at the specter of outside influences, said Alex Hirsch, an associate professor of political science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.“If outside money gets identified as an influential force,” Hirsch said, “that often backfires.”Correction: Because of a reporting error, an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified John and Laura Arnold is connection to Patients For Affordable Drugs Now.

Suni Lee won goldin the event, defending the title for Team USA despite the reigning champion is absence. In a series ofInstagram Storiesposted early Friday, Biles invited her 6.1 million followers to ask about the phenomenon that can cause gymnasts to lose their sense of space and dimension in midair — even if they have performed the same maneuver for years without problems. The four-time Olympic gold medalist also posted two videos of herself struggling with dismounts from the uneven bars. The first showed her landing on her back on the mat, the second showed her falling to the mat in apparent frustration after she still needed to complete another half twist. She said the videos, which have subsequently been removed, were taken during practice Friday morning. Biles, who appeared to become disorientated while performing a vaultTuesday before she stumbled on her dismount, said she had “no idea” how she landed on her feet.“If you look at the pictures and my eyes, you can see how confused I am as to where I am in the air,” she told her followers. The 24-year-old superstar is still scheduled to compete as an individual in the vault, bars, balance beam and floor exercise.

She also lauded Lee on Instagram on Thursday. ""So so so beyond proud of you!!!"" Biles said. Addressing those who suggested she gave up by pulling out of the competitions earlier in the week, Biles said: “I did not quit, my mind and body are simply not in sync.”“I do not think you realize how dangerous this is on hard/competition surface,” she added. “Nor do I have to explain why I put health first.

401,JPK III did not demolish the Kennedy dynasty — it faded long ago,-5.67,37.67,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/03/opinion/jpk-iii-didnt-demolish-kennedy-dynasty-it-faded-long-ago/?p1=HP_Feed_ContentQuery,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"At the risk of raining on the political world is national narrative parade, Joseph P Kennedy III did not take the glittering Kennedy dynasty out for an ill-advised joyride and wrap it around a tree. Yes, he waged an entitled and impatient Senate primary challenge to a more accomplished incumbent, Ed Markey— and got his clock cleaned. But the notion so prevalent nationally that in doing so he somehow totaled a family dynasty is silly. The Kennedys have not been a dynasty for decades. Wipe the mystique from your glasses and that supposedly gleaming Kennedy juggernaut is actually a rusted 1960s Studebaker sinking into an overgrown field behind the barn. AdvertisementBut wait, does not JPK III is defeat mark the first time a Kennedy has lost an election in Massachusetts? Yes, but that oft-repeated cable TV formulation obscures more than it reveals, making it seem as though this state has been under a spell that lasted from John F Kennedy isfirst congressional run, in 1946, through to this week. Um, no. To the degree that there was a Kennedy dynasty, it faltered in 1980, when Ted Kennedy lost his presidential primary bid to incumbent Jimmy Carter, and faded to impotence in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. (That is not to say that Ted Kennedy did not become a legendary senator after his failed national bid, but one senator, no matter how formidable, does not a political dynasty make.)Ted himself got an all-political-hands-on-deck scare in 1994, when Mitt Romney, the n in his liberal Republican incarnation, took him on in a race that was a dead heat two months before election day. Ultimately, Kennedy posted a solid win, one that reflected his value to the state. Still, he pulled decisively ahead only after strafing Romney with an enfilade of negative TV ads. AdvertisementAfter years of playing Hamlet, Joseph P Kennedy II, the n a congressman, launched a 1998-cycle campaign for governor, but when several controversies cast him in an imperious and unflattering light, he abandoned that quest. Younger brother Max, uncle to JPK III, explored a run for the House in 2001, to fill the South Boston-South Shore seatJoe Moakleyhad held but, after a few public appearances revealed him to be lighter than a dandelion seed, he floated off in a different direction. In a proper accounting, the n, JPK III is ill-fated senatorial quest is really the third failed Kennedy candidacy or quasi-candidacy in Massachusetts alone. Which puts things in proper perspective: Yes, Boston is home to theJohn F Kennedy Library, where it is always Inauguration Day 1961, but for most of Massachusetts, the notion of the Kennedy family as a dynastic force faded long ago. Nor should it come as any shock that JPK III lost. When Kennedy first got into the race, many primary voters knew relatively little about Ed Markey, who had been a House member for decades but had only served six and a half years as a senator. However, once that cloudy picture clarified and it became clear that Markey was the more progressive and accomplished candidate, the race began to reset. Given Markey is status as a national leader on climate, neither is it a surprise he became the big favorite of younger voters. There, his political partnership with, and endorsement by,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezwere particularly helpful. AdvertisementSo will this defeat spell the end of JPK III is political career? No reason it should. Conducting a largely pointless primary challenge to a fellow liberal left a bad taste in many mouths, but Kennedy, who was a good congressman, can recover. Just look at Charlie Baker. He waged an off-putting, misbegotten, and unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2010 — and now he is among the most popular governors in America. Kennedy should do what Baker did after that loss: Sit down with those who will tell him the unvarnished truth about his political misadventure. People will forgive you a lot if you demonstrate that you have thought about your mistakes and learned from them. Despite his loss, many Democrats retain a fondness for Kennedy, who, before this empty-calorie flight of the ego, had seemed smarter and less entitled than others in his family. He will get another chance — as long as he waits for the right opportunity. Scot Lehigh is a Globe columnist. He can be reached atscot.lehigh@globe.com. Follow him@GlobeScotLehigh.",1,2,Boston Globe

In the run-up to this month is Vietnam summit, Trump is acutely aware that a potential landmark deal on Kim is complete, verifiable and permanent denuclearization would be a significant foreign policy win for him, the region and the world. Unfortunately, that potential deal is where Trump is foreign policy successes both start and end. By any other measure, the president is aggressive pursuit of nativist policies has weakened America is global leverage, given its adversaries strategic openings and made the world a little less safe for democracy and human rights. In normal times, this would be seen as a failure of leadership and a threat to America is fundamental values, global stature and international dominance. These are not, however, normal times. The Trump Doctrine is an “America First”agendathat plays well at home and sounds good on the stump. At best, it is a shortsighted and dangerous foreign policy play that ultimately creates a global leadership vacuum. It is not surprising that America is adversaries are dying to fill this vacuum. This is not partisan ideology talk. It is dollars and cents. When America retreats and withdraws, its markets retrench, its buyers look for better deals and its partners start looking for the exits. Trump is America is either up and leaving longstanding US commitments or setting radically different and sometimes onerous terms on long-term partners for the delivery of the same—or even worse—goods and services. Those partners are open to new and different commercial, military and diplomatic relationships elsewhere. They are more open to Russian and Chinese overtures. Why buy American? Why rely exclusively on one Western supplier or questionable security guarantor? Why trust Trump?The simple answer is, they do not. As a result, polls are showing that in certain disparaged NATO countries—Germany and France, for example— citizenstrustChina is President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin more than POTUS Let that sink in for a second. European allies ca not count on America to help in times of need, as German Chancellor Angela Merkelmade clear when she said Europe could no longer “rely on the superpower of the USs.”What does this mean in practical terms?In the short run, these nations recognize they are entirely dependent on America as a security supplier. Political scientists call this current hard reality apa th dependence on American military hardware and professional services, from inter operable weapons systems and aircraft to integrated communications infrastructure. They are locked in to American products and suppliers. But that can change over time. In fact, it already is. Suddenly, countries that would never consider buying Brand X from another,adversarialnation are opening their arms and their markets to Chinese technology and Russian weapons systems. If data is the lifeblood of the modern era, the n 5G telecommunications infrastructure is the 21st century is global circulatory system. Digital information courses through the world at a head-spinning pace. China is Huawei has moved quickly to develop much of that data circulatory system. As a result, if America ca not compete and Beijing wins this race, free-flowing data will pump through a Beijing-based digital heart to feed China is Artificial Intelligence-driven brain—giving it unparalleled insights and intelligence. The stakes are high as heated competition for next generation digital dominance is fully under way. America is bullying reaction and response to Huawei is global growth may not ultimately be as effective as China is profligate financial underwriting for Sino-systems around the world. As they say in Trump is New York, “Money talks and BS walks.”In the military realm, orders for America is next-generation F-35 fighter jet and any number of other future American military systems are being either cancelled or countered. One example? Russia is advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missiles will find new homes in India, Turkey, Egypt, Vietnam, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Russia is successfully courting allies, a deeply worrisome development that can be traced directly to Trump is policies—or lack the reof. The list of new Russian and Chinese globally underwritten projects is growing, from critical port and road infrastructure to nuclear power plants. The world does not wait for America to find its voice and provide global leadership. Two more years is a lifetime in geopolitics, and the rebalancing of power has been under way since November 9, 2016, when a candidate unschooled and inexperienced in foreign policy and insensitive to its subtleties and systems won America is presidential election. China saw its opening. Russia grabbed its opportunity. The USs now watches agog as, one-by-one, the global chess pieces get moved and America keeps losing its partners and its pawns. What Trump has not yet realized is that foreign-policy chest beating is not chess playing.",0,1,Washington Monthly
404,"Despite judge is ruling, Chicago-area immigration activist still hopeful: ‘It is not the end and we can fight’",-9.67,43.33,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/7/16/22580886/chicago-daca-texas-federal-judge-lawsuit-ruling-dreamers-congress-immigration-reform,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Just a couple of days ago, Luis Rodriguez is friend had stopped by to show him her newly authorized work permit. Rodriguez, who in recent months had applied for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, figured his would come soon enough. Then on Friday, a federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of states that had challenged the legality of DACA, adding to the uncertainty for young immigrants like Rodriguez, who were brought to this country as children. Lea es te artículo en español enLa Voz Chicago,la sección bilingüe del Sun-Times. As part of the ruling, US District Judge Andrew Hanen ordered the federal government to stop granting new DACA applications; the program allows certain immigrants to work legally and also provides temporary protection from deportation. Rodriquez and others in his situation often are called “Dreamers,” a reference to the DREAM Act, proposed legislation that provides protections similar to DACA The judge is order means pending applications from Rodriguez and other young Dreamers will not be processed, for now.“It is not the end and we can fight,” Rodriguez, 20, said hours after news of the judge is order. His spirits were boosted by a phone call with other immigrant activists.“We got this. I know that my people will do the very best to organize against this injunction.”He also will spend time putting pressure on Senator Dick Durbin, D-Ill., an original sponsor of the DREAM Act, to pass immigration reform. Rodriguez is still trying to continue his education, but without DACA that could mean a bigger financial hurdle. Friday is news comes as more young immigrants were applying for the program, said Kathleen Vannucci, an immigration attorney who is part of the Chicago chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Thewindow for first-time DACA applications had opened in Decemberbecause of a court order. Before that, new applications had been halted since 2017, when the Trump administration tried to end the program. As of March 31, more than 55,000 initial DACA applications were pending, according to the latest statistics from US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which also reported more than 616,000 DACA recipients nationwide. The group estimates31,210 immigrants living with DACA protections in the Chicago metro area. What those with pending applications could do now will vary case to case, but many were so young that DACA was their only option to seek legal status, Vannucci said. It is unclear what will happen to those who had not submitted their application.“Those are going to be the difficult conversations,” she said. People who already had DACA should be able to continue renewing their status and work permits, said Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. The ruling also puts added pressure on Congress to decide on immigration overhaul. President Joe Biden has pushed for a path to legalize undocumented immigrants.“Those efforts which are happening in Congress have now taken on even more urgency,” Tsao said. “Whether it is a stand-alone Dream Act or a more sweeping legislative fix.”Vannucci hopes Friday is ruling eventually means leads to a permanent solution particularly for young immigrants, pointing out that DACA was also supposed to be a temporary program.“This roller coaster ca not continue,” she said. Rodriguez would like to see a pathway for citizenship for all of the country is undocumented immigrants.“Citizenship is key to all the struggles my community have,” Rodriguez said. “People like my mom worry more about what it is going to cost to have surgery because they do not qualify for Medicaid because of immigration status. If there was a pathway for citizenship that was easier and attainable — it can be if Durbin steps up — it would make a world of a difference.”Elvia Malagón is reporting on social justice and income inequality is made possible by a grant from The Chicago Community Trust.",1,2,Chicago Sun-Times
405,A Brief History of the Flu Vaccine,0.0,52.33,https://weather.com/health/cold-flu/news/2019-12-23-a-brief-history-of-the-flu-vaccine,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-02,25,"desktop or mobile phone. Every year, three to five million people catch a severe flu, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and between290,000 and 650,000 people die from it worldwide. Still, thanks to the flu vaccine, this is only a fraction of how many people it used to kill. During the last major flu pandemic of 1918-1919, it killed between50 and 100 million people around the world. For a long time, scientists had thought that the flu was caused by a bacteriacalled, but after the 1918-19 pandemic, they started to suspect it was caused by a virus instead. However, it would not be until the 1930s that they would confirm that. In 1933, three scientists isolated the Influenza A virus in ferrets— one of the three types of flu — and in 1936, it was discovered that the virus could begrown inside embryonated chicken eggs, a key step towards making a vaccine. Just two years later, in 1938, Jonas Salk (who would later go on to develop the Polio vaccine) and Thomas Francis developed the first vaccine using fertilized chicken eggs anda n inactivated strain of the Influenza A virus. This new vaccine was first used to help protect soldiers fighting in World War II; it would not be approved for civilians until 1946. According to a1944 study of the new vaccine, it helped reduce illness that was accompanied by a temperature above 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Vaccines at this time were not as purified as to day is vaccines though, and those impurities could cause side effects, including fever, aches, and fatigue, leading many people to incorrectly assume they caught the flu from the vaccine. Also, this early flu vaccine only protected against one of the three flu types, Influenza A There are three types of flu — Influenza A, B and C — and each one has its own viral strain that replicates and changes independently of the others every season. Influenza A and B are the most common. A vaccine against Influenza A did nothing to protect people from Influenza B or C It was not until 1942 that the first bivalent vaccine was developed, meaning it worked for both an Influenza type A and type B strain. In 1976, a swine flu outbreak hit New Jersey, which incited fears of a new pandemic, soPresident Gerald Fordannounced that the federal government would vaccinate all Americans. Congress approved $137 million for producing a vaccine for this purpose before flu season started. Unfortunately, hundreds of people developedGuillain-Barré syndrome(which causes nerve damage and paralysis) after receiving this vaccine, making many people fear it. The Ford family tried to alleviate fears by televising getting their flu shots, but ultimately the swine flu vaccination program was cancelled. Despite this setback, production of seasonal flu vaccines continued. Seasonal strains of each type of influenza mutate and change very quickly, so the flu shot is the only vaccine that needs to be continually updated. In 1973, WHO developed am ore rigorous process for targeting the strains that affect people, and in 1978, the first trivalent vaccine was developed, protecting people against two different strains of Influenza A and one strain of Influenza B In 2003, the first live attenuated influenza vaccine —FluMist— was approved by the FDA, which contained a weaker, live strain of the virus. It is administered as a nasal spray. Today is vaccines are much more effective than the early vaccines because a global network of scientists monitor the various strains of the virus. Each year, they determine how they have mutated over the past year, how they are spreading, and try to predict which strains might be most prevalent in the coming year in both hemispheres. They the n announce which influenza subtypes should be targeted by vaccines so medical labs can start working on them. The FDA approves the vaccines by the spring, production begins in the summer and it is available at your pharmacy come fall, aka the start of flu season. Of course, flu vaccines are never 100% effective, but they are the best defense we have today. The good news is that they are also widely available and free with most insurance providers.",2,2,The Weather Channel
406,Let the Little Children Come to ‘Big Church’,0.0,32.67,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/may-june/jen-wilkin-family-worship-covid-childrens-church-together.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"Since last year, COVID-19 has asked all of us to adapt in myriad ways. As we begin to emerge from pandemic precautions, the pull to return to normalcy will be strong. Simultaneously, we will assess what we have learned: What practices do we want to maintain? For young Christian families, one pandemic practice in particular promises a huge discipleship yield. Like other families, the Wilkins turned to jigsaw puzzles to fill our unexpected hours of togetherness. In March 2020, it was not just toilet paper that ran scarce. There was also a shortage of—of all things—1,000-piece puzzles. With puzzle-hoarding running rampant on Amazon, I finally committed to ordering one from a print-on-demand website. When it arrived, it was indeed a 1,000-piece puzzle … but each piece was about the size of a dime. You know what you need in lockdown? More ways to be short-tempered and frustrated. That being said, one habit I hope our family will preserve post-pandemic is working on (normal-sized) puzzles together. With regard to the continuous puzzle that is discipling our children, COVID-19 delivered a full-sized, clear picture of a key way to do so, through the unexpected means of Sunday services streamed into our living rooms. For many young families, the coronavirus lock down was their first time to worship together consistently through all elements of “big church,” rather than follow a common pattern of kids attending children is programing while adults attend the weekly gathering. At my own church, as soon as we began streaming services, kids began asking about baptism and the Lord is Supper at unprecedented rates. Many had never seen them. In living rooms everywhere, children prayed communal prayers, listened to the Word proclaimed, heard testimonies, and joined their voices in song—. Like my tiny jigsaw puzzle, these family worship gatherings were not without frustration. Children may have squirmed, consumed copious snacks, or run circles around the living room, but something priceless was happening: Families were living out the words of Psalm 34:3: “Glorify the Lord; let us exalt his nametogether” (emphasis added). Observant parents who might have assumed “My child will not really get anything out of the service” learned this was, in fact, profoundly not true. Because there is no replacement for children watching their parents model worship. Because children have a right to witness and learn from the ordinances of the church. Because children are not the church of tomorrow; they are the church of today. I am a big fan of children is ministry. I think it is invaluable. I am paid by my church to think about it in good ways. But let me be clear: While children is church is a wonderful supplement to big church, it is a terrible substitute. A child old enough for kindergarten can be welcomed into big church with a little loving guidance from a parent determined to disciple. If it is true that “more is caught than taught,” parents should value modeling worship for their children more than any lesson taught by a children is church leader. In one sense, COVID-19 invited the smaller members of the church of today to worship exactly where they belong: with the rest of the church. I seem to recall someone else doing a similar thing, to the confusion of his disciples. On the other side of the pandemic, I hope never again to find the shelves bare of toilet paper. Or puzzles. Or Extra Toasty Cheez-Its, as long as we are making a list. But I hope the puzzle pieces that fell into place around shared family worship will be saved and deepened. In returning to normal, I hope we will not preserve a pre-COVID practice that perhaps was not as great as it seemed. I hope more families will bring school-aged kids to the gathering that is big church, in addition to sending them to the blessing that is children is church. For families, the “with me” of worship matters. Let the little children come—even if they wiggle and whisper. They are the missing pieces that complete the picture of the church as God is family. Let them be formed in the house of the Lord.[ This article is also available inPortuguêsandFrançais. ]Have something to add about this? See something we missed?

Columbus police released body cam footage a few hours after the incident. Here is everything you need to know about the case. At ane ws conference on Tuesday night, officials said Columbus police received a 911 call at 4:35 p.m. about an attempted stabbing in southeastern Columbus. The caller said a female was trying to stab them before hanging up, according to. Shortly after the shooting, a 12-person jury announced a verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was found guilty of all charges: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. During a Tuesday night news conference, Columbus police released body camera footage from the first officer to arrive on the scene, according toWKYC Channel 3. Michael Woods, the interim police chief, said it is unprecedented for body camera footage to be released so quickly after a shooting, but that he “wanted to get that out as soon as possible” in the interest of transparency. The video shows an officer approaching a driveway where a group of young people are gathered. One of the teenagers appears to lunge at another with what appears to be a knife. The police officer the n approaches the group and shouts “get down,” before firing several shots—four can be heard in the video—fatally shooting Bryant. She collapses to the ground next to a car in the driveway. Bryant was taken to Mount Carmel East, where she was later pronounced dead. A spokeswoman for Franklin County Children is Services, an organization that helps place children in foster care, identified the teen who was killed as 16-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant, according to. Hazel Bryant, who told that she is Ma’Khia Bryant is aunt, said the girl lived in a foster home and “got into an altercation with someone else at the home.” Bryant said her niece had a knife but dropped it before she was shot. Paula Bryant, Ma’Khia Bryant is mother, spoke with local news stationWBNSabout her daughter. “This never should have happened. She is a loving girl,” Bryant told the station. “I am very upset, I am hurt. I want answers.”Ned Pettus, Jr., the public safety director for the city of Columbus, said onTwitter:“No matter what the circumstances, that family is in agony and they are in my prayers... They deserve answers. Our city deserves answers.”The name of the officer who shot Bryant has not released, but he has been “taken off the street while the shooting is investigated,” according toThe Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation will conduct an independent inquiry, the outlet reports. Demonstrators gathered outside the Columbus Division of Police is headquarters downtown on Tuesday holding signs that read “Enough is enough” and “Black kids matter.” They chanted: “Say her name, Ma’Khia Bryant!”Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther urged residents to keep the peace in aTwitter thread, writing, “This afternoon a young woman tragically lost her life. We do not know all of the details. There is body-worn camera footage of the incident. We are working to review it as soon as possible. BCI is on the scene conducting an independent investigation...as they do with all CPD-involved shootings. We will share information that we can as soon as it becomes available. I am asking for residents to remain calm and allow BCI to gather the facts.”A video from Bryant isTikTok channel went viral late on Tuesday night.

408,We can escape ideological madness by convicting Trump,4.67,34.67,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/01/24/republicans-can-escape-ideological-madness-by-convicting-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-24,25,"The Republicans in the winter of 1860-1861, even more than Democrats to day, were terrified that their victory in the presidential election might be overthrown by a lawless attack on the nation is capital. Abraham Lincoln had won the election with just 40% of the popular vote. Very few major party candidates in American history have ever lost a presidential election with such a low percentage of the vote. Southerners hotly announced their refusal to accept the results of the election. Organized resistance quickly acquired a revolutionary intensity that shocked everyone, even those who created it. Rumors of an impending coup swirled through Washington. When William Henry Seward, Lincoln is choice for secretary of state, arrived in December of 1860, he discovered that not a single American flag could be found among the private businesses, homes and hotels in the district. Some residents had removed their flags out of hostility toward their government, others merely out of prudence.“It is revolutionary times here,” Seward wrote privately. “[A] plot is forming to seize the capital on or before the 4th March,” the day of Lincoln is inauguration. (Inauguration Day was not moved to January until 1937). Get smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about. Until the official transfer of power, Republicans in Washington were essentially helpless against the threatened onslaught against them. They could only hold their breath and pray that their enemies would not successfully disrupt the national government before they assumed control of it. As the Republicans recognized, the most vulnerable moment in the political transition from one administration to the next was an obscure ceremony with which we have lately become familiar — a joint session of Congress in which the results of the Electoral College are officially counted and certified.“If the two houses refuse to meet, or meet without a quorum,” the president-elect asked privately, “where shall we be?”Lincoln had good reason to worry. Democrats controlled the Senate. Under the Constitution, the incumbent vice president opens and counts the electoral certificates and announces the results of the election, sanctioning the legitimacy of the incoming administration. And that incumbent, John Breckenridge, would soon become a high-ranking member of the Confederacy. Even as Breckenridge prepared to perform his constitutional duties, he openly avowed his rebel sympathies.“I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election;” Lincoln fretted, “but how are we to proceed in the absence of it?”The fateful day, the second Wednesday in February, was tense with the most terrible apprehensions. Republicans feared that partisans would thwart the electoral count within the US Capitol as Southern militia attacked from without. Governor Henry Wise of Virginia, it was rumored, was preparing to march on the capitol with 25,000 militia as his allies disrupted the vote count, destroying the national government “by fire and sword.”In fact, however, not even the mildest concerns about the electoral count were realized. “The votes have been counted and the capital is not attacked,” Seward wrote privately. “The capital was full, but quiet, and the ceremony was quiet but tedious.”At the conclusion of the count, in a calm, sonorous voice, Vice President Breckinridge announced, “Abraham Lincoln has been duly elected president of the USs.”In retrospect, the sighs of relief that followed proved darkly ironic. But we today are no longer in a position to pity our ancestors, either for their misplaced alarm or for their even more misplaced relief. Both the contrasts and comparisons between the crisis of 1860-61 and the final days of Donald Trump is presidency are instructive. Nothing like the catastrophe that befell the country in 1861 is in our immediate future. In the Civil War, 750,000 soldiers died; as a percentage of the population, that is equivalent to about 10 million deaths today. Everything about that era was incomparably worse than our own. And yet the crime Lincoln and other Republicans most feared — an illegal attempt to disrupt the electoral count — was one Southerners dismissed as beneath their dignity. Breckinridge and other Southern senators went on to wage war against the USs. Their constitutional arguments justifying secession were motivated by a sinister devotion to slavery, but the arguments the mselves were marked by serious legal and historical reasoning. For all their crimes, they respected the republic, even in their efforts to destroy it. Today we have the opposite problem. Cynical politicians have theatrically attacked the foundations of our democracy, not because they wish to overthrow the government but because they take its invincibility for granted. Their efforts are too absurd and spineless to qualify as a rebellion. Only one side of our political divide was responsible for the riot at the Capitol. But that was just the latest outbreak of a bipartisan disease. America today is in the unfortunate position of a child caught in the middle of a bitter divorce. Both parents, the right and the left, are too blinded by their own grievances and hatreds to see their own role in wounding what they sincerely profess to love. Democrats today righteously denounce the hypocrisy of law-and-order Republicans who summoned a mob that killed a police officer. And no honest Republican can deny they deserve it. But the situation calls for a little self-awareness among Democrats. A little more than six months ago, during a summer of many peaceful protests, Washington, DC, and other American cities were attacked by another mob. And that mob may have felt encouragement from the hyperbolic, dishonest accusations of some Democratic leaders against the vital political authorities under attack. Their defense the n is Trump is now. They did not endorse illegality and violence, only the protests. But those protests created the opportunity for some to engage in illegality and violence. On the left, no important political leader has committed offenses equivalent to Trump is since his election. Hillary Clinton may have tacitly endorsed attacks on the legitimacy of her defeat four years ago, but she did not lead “the resistance.” At the same time, there is no equivalent, on the right, to the immense, irresponsible power wielded by the left in academia, journalism, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and other prestigious cultural institutions. Perhaps the Republicans will seize this opportunity to escape from the dangerous pattern of escalating ideological madness. Perhaps enough Republican senators will convict Trump of the impeachment charges of which he is manifestly guilty. Perhaps they will even acknowledge their own complicity in what they have wrought, instead of fixating on all the ways their adversaries contributed to the same ungodly mess. And perhaps an honest display of patriotism will inspire Democrats to take similar steps toward contrition and conciliation. That path requires wisdom and courage. It will be far easier for the Republicans, like the Democrats immediately before the m, to await their own opportunity to be outraged at the destructive excesses their own conduct has licensed. That path requires nothing but timidity and time. It amounts to just one more turn around the widening gyre, as political dysfunction eventually begets a catastrophe we cannot yet even dimly imagine.“One may do a little time-serving,” Cicero once wrote. “But when one is hour has come, one must not miss it.” For my part, I hope the Senate Republicans see this moment for what it is, and seize it.

The US has distributed 60 million vaccine doses to other nations in the past month and is planning to buy 500 million doses “to make sure we are doing everything we can to win this race against variants”, Blinken said. The Secretary of State is warning comes as local communities in the US are starting to see deadly surges of COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant that are infecting more young people and even affecting people who have been vaccinated. Israel announced on July 22 it was renewing coronavirus restrictions because of the Delta variant. The Delta variant was first detected in India and has acquired the spike protein mutation, called K417N, which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.“The Delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains,” Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters at a White House briefing on July 22.“It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of, and that I have seen in my 20-year career,” Walensky said, urging Americans who have not been vaccinated to get the jab. The US has vaccinated 162 million people and 97 percent of new COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths are among the unvaccinated, Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator said.“It is clear, that we are experiencing what many other countries are experiencing – increased case counts driven by the more transmissible Delta variant,” Zients told reporters at the White House. Concerns the spread of the Delta variant will slow the US economic recovery prompted a sell-offon Wall Street for the first time since mid-2020 with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking 726 points, or 2.1 percent, on July 19. In the US Congress, Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise, the No 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, got a first dose of the vaccine after resisting for months.“With the Delta variant becoming a lot more aggressive and seeing another spike, it was a good time to do it,” Scalise told the New Orleans Times-Picayune news outlet. Raising more alarms in official Washington, DC, two aides to President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who had previously been fully vaccinated became infected with COVID-19. Hospitals in hot spots around the US are reaching their capacity limits as cases of COVID-19 continue to surge. Summer camps across Texas have closed and sent children home as the Delta variant spreads. In Galveston, Texas, more than 150 cases of COVID-19 were tied to an outbreak in early July at a church-affiliated youth camp, health officials told local media. Of those, 20 cases were breakthrough cases, meaning the infected individuals had been vaccinated. In Alabama, a state where vaccination rates are among the lowest in the US, Governor Kay Ivey lashed out at people who refuse to get vaccinated, according to local news outlets. Hospitalisations have surged 216 percent in Alabama since July 1, according to CDC data.“Folks are supposed to have common sense,” said Ivey, a Republican who has refused to mandate masks. “It is time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It is the unvaccinated that are letting us down.”Cases of COVID-19 have increased in Sweden is main cities with the more contagious Delta emerging as the dominant variant in Europe, health authorities said on Friday, though they added infection levels nationally remained low, Reuters news service reported.

410,The Unlikely Rebound of Mainline Protestantism,-1.67,44.0,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-unlikely-rebound-of-mainline-protestantism,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Since we are at a delicate moment in our democracy—featuring a Presidential candidate who lost the Electoral Collegeby just 42,918 vote sand responded by urging his followers to at tack the Capitol—we should be grateful for signs of certain kinds of moderation returning to our national life. A new Gallup poll reports that, as vaccinations spread and unemployment drops, more Americans say that they are “thriving” than at any time in the past dozen years, which surely means that at least some of the anger in the country might wane. And, last Thursday, the Public Religion Research Institutereportedsome interesting numbers about faith in America, which may indicate something similar. Most of the news coverage of the PR RI study has focussed on the fact that it shows a dramatic drop in the number of white Americans who identify as evangelical Christians, from twenty-three per cent of the population in 2006 to fourteen per cent in 2020. There has also been a slight drop in the number of “nones”—the religiously unaffiliated—from twenty-six per cent in 2018 to twenty-three per cent in 2020. But what I found most unexpected was the reported up tick in the number of white mainline Protestants. According to the study, they represent 16.4 per cent of the population (up from thirteen per cent in 2016), which means that they now outnumber white evangelicals, some of whom may have defected to the traditional denominations. Though the methodology is a little unclear—this “2020 Census of American Religion” categorizes all self-identifying white Christians who said that they were not evangelical or born again as “white mainline Protestants”—the news seems as profound as it is unexpected. For several decades, a prevailing narrative of white American Christian life has been about the decline of Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Lutherans, and other once-dominant Protestant sects. In this telling, the “mainline” became the “sideline,” as congregations fled the moral relativism of out-of-touch pastors, who replaced God is word with liberal politics. Having been baptized a Presbyterian, grown up as a Congregationalist, and spent my adult life as a Methodist, I watched this decline close up. Churches closed, congregations aged, and the image of Christianity in the popular mind came to be one of sexism, libertarian capitalism, and a pervasive individualism—the idea of God as, above all, a “personal savior.”The fade of that brand of evangelicalism in America—the PR RI report shows that its cultural hegemony is increasingly confined to the Southeast—is not a great shock. As early as 2007, researchers were picking up strong signals that young peoplewere not as inclined to follow those churches on key cultural issues: eighty per cent of even young churchgoersreported, critically, that their strongest perception was that Christianity was “anti-homosexual”—not an illogical conclusion given the amount of time that evangelicals spent on the issue (oddly, since the Gospels never mention it). Eventually, most white evangelical congregants tied the mselves toDonald Trump—in 2016, eighty-one per cent of white evangelical voters chose him and, according to aPR RI poll from 2018, he had a seventy-two-per-cent approval rating among the m—despite the fact that he showed not the slightest sign of Christian understanding or behavior. As a result, at least in part, some prominent evangelicals started to leave their churches. (And, certainly, some evangelicals never supported Trumpism.) New recruits are not flooding in to replace those who have left: white evangelicals, according to the PR RI report, are now the oldest of religious Americans, with an average age of fifty-six. The reported rise in the number of mainline Protestants, though, is surprising. Diana Butler Bass, an unflagging chronicler of American Protestantism who, having gone in her personal life from the mainline to the evangelical and back again, was ahead of her time,points outthat, for decades, the media paid no attention to these declining (and demure) denominations, concentrating instead on the provocative Falwells, Swaggarts, and Robertsons. “If one was born after 1980, it was hard to know that mainline Protestantism even existed,” she writes. The new numbers, of course, do not mark anything like a return to the previous status quo, when mainline Protestantism ruled American spiritual life. Take 1958 as a high-water mark: that year, as Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the Interchurch Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the religion researchers Mark Silk and James Hudnut-Beumler report that fifty-two per cent of Americans, many of whom were moving to the new suburbs, were affiliated with one of the mainline denominations that are members of the National Council of the Churches of Christ, which was headquartered in that building. (It is sometimes called the Protestant Kremlin—or the God Box.) Without this “firm foundation, national morality could not be maintained,” the President intoned. (Ike himself, raised in the Mennonite tradition, was baptized a Presbyterian less than two weeks after taking office.)But the very broadness of the church is reach was its weakness: attendance was, as many pointed out, often more a cultural expectation than an active commitment. As the nineteen-sixties and seventies wore on, and the liberal denominations started making significant commitments around racial justice and peace, many of their adherents did fall away. For others, though, the churches did not go far enough, with many wavering for decades about the idea, for example, that gay congregants should be full participants in church life. Being in the middle seemed a recipe for irrelevance. Yet perhaps the Trump years have taught us a little bit about the virtues of a kind of modest center—even now, according to the PR R. I survey, thirty-five per cent of white mainline Protestants identify as Democrats, thirty-three per cent as Republicans, and thirty per cent as independents. (TheBidenyears may prove instructive, too, as the Catholic bishops—who have made common cause with right-wing evangelicals for years—threaten to de ny the President communion.) In any event, these mainline churches are not the same as those of the suburban heyday of the sixties. Like surviving local independent bookstores responding to modern readers, they have had to become more responsive to the emotional needs of spiritual seekers, channelling the desire for connection into the arts and a wide array of service projects. Butler Bass writes a newsletter, in which, after the PR RI poll came out, shed escribe dhow a declining Episcopalian church in Santa Barbara, California, that she once attended managed to rebound: “They married gay members before marriage equality was legal in California. They went to protest marches. They innovated liturgy. They read liberal theology books, studied feminist and liberation the ology, embraced contemporary biblical criticism. They followed no plan—except for believing that Christianity was an adventure and that Christian community could be transformative, challenging, and deeply spiritual in and for the world.” Today, when activists fight pipelines or police brutality, they often lean on support from the clergy of such places of worship, who tend to skew more liberal than their congregants in the pews. Butler Bass and other church progressives may now compete with evangelical me ga church pastors as unofficial spokes people for their faith, complicating the public image of what white Protestants in America believe and how they act. “A really important moment is here,” she wrote last week. “The story of an old religious tradition has not ended the way critics once thought. Paraphrasing the words of the old Monty Python sketch, ‘We are not dead yet.’ We have just been awaiting resurrection.”",2,1,The New Yorker

In a short statement on the House floor on Monday, Pelosi took the opportunity to bash President Trump as she discussed the new relief checks.""I would like them bigger, but they are significant, and they will be going out soon,"" Pelosi said. ""The president may insist on having his name on the check. But make no mistake, those checks are from the American people. The American people is name should be on that check, no individual. Pelosi, it is worth noting, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with a net worth estimate dat more than $100 million (she makes $223,000 a year in salary). And for the record, when Trump signed into law tax cuts that prompted numerous businesses to give $1,000-$2,5000 bonuses to millions of workers, Pelosi called that amount ""crumbs.""When the first stimulus bill passed, the payments began about two weeks after the legislation was approved. More than 81 million payments totaling more than $147 billion were disbursed within weeks, all through electronic transfers to recipients' bank accounts, according to the Government Accountability Office. In August, as lawmakers continued to debate more direct payments to Americans, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the federal government could roll out new checks the week after Congress passed a bill. ""We did it the first time — I can get out 50 million payments really quickly, a lot of it into people is direct accounts,"" Mnuchin told reportersthen. If the new bill follows the first bill, individuals will be eligible for payments up to $600, but that amount declines for those with an adjusted gross income higher than $75,000 a year. The $600 payment would drop by 5% of every dollar above $75,000, or $50 for every $1,000. Social media had a field day with the paltry amount for Americans included in the compromise bill. A Twitter user quipped that the next stimulus round would come in the form of 20% off coupon to Bed Bath & Beyond. Another said: ""What are you going to do with your $600 stimulus check? Pay 1 of your 10 overdue bills - buy barely 2 weeks worth of groceries - pay a quarter of your rent - ???? - use it to wipe your tears.""",1,1,Just the News
412,Are masks effective for kids? Here is what to know before school starts,-1.33,45.67,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/08/25/metro/are-masks-effective-kids-heres-what-know-before-school-starts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-25,25,"Massachusetts public school students and staff member snow will be required to wear a mask when they return for the new school year until at least October 1 under a mandate issued Wednesday. The edict applies to all children ages 5 and older; while students under 5 are not required to, the state strongly recommends the y, too, wear masks. There are exceptions for students and staff who cannot wear a mask for medical reasons and for students who have behavioral concerns. The ruling from state Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley aligns Massachusetts with the prevailing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that children should be masked up in school as the Delta variant of COVID-19 triggers a resurgence of infections around the country. AdvertisementMiddle and high schools that can show at least 80 percent of students and staff are vaccinated by October 1 can lift the mask mandate the n, but only for those who are inoculated. Since vaccines have not been authorized yet for children under age 12, those students would continue to wear masks, meaning most elementary school educators for now would have to keep their masks on as well. Some parent groups have pushed back against masks in schools, arguing face coverings can harm kids. But medical experts say masks are necessary to protect children who do not have an available vaccine, and the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks. The American Academy of Pediatrics— as well as many doctors and scientists — support universal masking policies as the best chance to keep schools safely open. A properly fitted mask that covers the nose and mouth reduces the amount of viral droplets in the air exchanged by people breathing or talking near each other, said Dr. Ibukun Kalu, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Duke University Medical Center. AdvertisementSeveral studies have shown the effectiveness of masks. One of the largest, conducted by the ABC Collaborative with Duke University, analyzed data from North Carolina public schools where masks were required. Researchers found that from March to June, 7,000 children and adults attended school while infectious with COVID, leading to 40,000 “close contacts” being quarantined. Of those, only 363 contracted the virus. That low rate of in-school transmission was due in large part to masks, Kalu said, as most schools did not upgrade ventilation or socially distance students. In contrast, 153 students and 25 staffers were infected at a school in Israel without a mask mandate or social distancing. And recent outbreaks at kids’ summer camps and schools in Georgia and Florida show how fast COVID can spread among unmasked, unvaccinated people, Kalu said.“We saw that masking in the school environment reduced within-school transmission,” Kalu said. The Delta variant adds urgency to masks this year, she said, particularly for children under 12 who are not eligible for vaccination. Even though children are at lower risk of severe disease and death compared toolder people, Kalu said, both still happen: “COVID is still severe enough that if we can do what we can to prevent one case, we should, particularly if it is something as low-impact as masking.”Some teachers, parents, and scientists are concerned about masks interfering with learning or development of social, language, and speech skills, especially for children who are very young or who already struggle. AdvertisementWhile young kids do rely on watching mouths to learn totalk, they receive enough unmasked interaction during meals, playtime, and baths at home to develop language, according to an article published jointly by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.“Most of the interaction that a child is going to have in the language-learning phase is going to be at home with adults who are not wearing masks,” said Diane Paul, clinical director of speech language pathology for the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. After reviewing published scientific studies, the association found no evidence face masks interfere with speech and language development, Paul said. She recommends masked teachers or care givers follow good longstanding communication practices: facing the child and getting their attention before talking; speaking slowly and loudly; using eyes, hands, body language, and changes in to ne; asking the child if they understood; and reducing distractions. Some educators also wear clear masks to help children who are hard of hearing read their lips. Still, there is some disagreement over when it is appropriate for kids to wear masks. The CDCdoes not recommend children younger than 2 do. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization advises against masks for children 5 and under due to their lower susceptibility to COVID, challenges with correct usage, and the possibility that masks could interfere with their learning, socialization, and communication.“The benefits of wearing masks in children for COVID-19 control should be weighed against potential harm associated with wearing masks, including feasibility and discomfort, as well as social and communication concerns,” the WHOsaid. AdvertisementDaniele Lantagne, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University who helped develop the WHO is child-masking guidance, said many young kids like her own have no trouble wearing masks and should just wear them in schools. But some others struggle because they are very young or they have disabilities or developmental delays. They should be allowed to forgo masks with distancing or other measures, she said. The state mandate allows such exceptions in schools. For children ages 6 to 12, the WHO recommends considering local COVID levels and the potential impact of mask wearing on learning and social development. Some countries are focusing school-safety strategies more on testing as they feel masking interferes with teacher-child communication, Lantagne said. Because in part of the WHO guidance,many European countries such as England, Norway, Ireland, and Switzerland are not requiring masks, or in some instances even advising against the m, for elementary-age children. Local and state masking guidance should be reassessed every two to three months amid changes in the COVID picture, Lantagne said.“Right now, we are relatively high-transmission,” Lantagne said. “We need to shy away from, ‘We are just going to put masks on kids for the next five years.’ ... There may be longer-term impacts on speech.”Health experts emphasize the trade-off is worth it to save lives.“The benefits clearly outweigh the downsides in a deadly pandemic where more than 400 children have died,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious diseases and virology expert at the Children is Hospital of Philadelphia. “It is not your civil liberty to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection. It is not a personal choice; it is a choice you make for other people.”AdvertisementExperts disagree on this question. The CDC has advised everyone to wear masks in schools, regardless of vaccination status, citing evidence that vaccinated people can still become infected and probably spread COVID, though they face far lower personal risks of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. But under new rules, the Baker administration has said middle and high schools with more than 80 percent of students and staff vaccinated by October 1 can lift their masking mandates. Lantagne said removing school mask mandates in such instances could be fine in conjunction with other safety measures.“If there are not that many cases in the community and high vaccination rates, you can say, ‘We can reduce the number of layers of protection,’” she said. But Kalu said masking still would be an important way to keep vaccinated students in school learning.“It is reassuring when you live in a community that has high vaccination rates for children and adults,” Kalu said. “However if masking is voluntary, it will likely be much less effective at preventing transmission and much less effective at preventing quarantine, which has also been a huge burden on the K-12 school environment.”Naomi Martin can be reached atnaomi.martin@globe.com.",2,2,Boston Globe

The phones were included on a list of more than 50,000 numbers concentrated in countries known to conduct surveillance on their citizens. The list was shared with news organizations by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based journalism nonprofit, and human rights group Amnesty International.

Rather, he said, he was advocating for parents to have the option of sending their children back to in-person classes.“I think parents ought to have that option,” Ashcroft said. “I have always been someone in political and personal life that thinks that we need to do things to give parents more ability to be in control of their kids’ education and to make the best decisions for their kids.”Ashcroft is Democratic opponent, St. Louis attorney and non-profit executive Yinka Faleti, blasted him in a statement released a statement Wednesday.“It is shocking that Jay Ashcroft would make such an abhorrently callous, insensitive and irresponsible statement, suggesting he is willing to risk the lives of parents, children, teachers and school staff so that children can be sent back to school,” Faleti said in a statement. Citing the risks outlined by the CDC and WHO guidelines, Faleti said the schools issue should be left to health professionals.“He just needs to leave it to the scientists,” Faleti said. “Unless he is an infectious disease expert, I think he is completely out of his lane.”Ashcroft said the school-opening debate has been completely politicized.“I think only in partisan politics does wanting your children to be the best that they can be, to wanting future generations to be more successful than prior generations, does that somehow become controversial,”he said. Ashcroft said people need to consider ways to make attending school in person risk-free, rather than cancelling it altogether. He highlighted the recent election as an example of safe in-person gatherings.“I think we have a real problem of how people are looking at COVID right now,” Ashcroft said. “Because what people are doing is they are saying, what is the risk of doing A And they are saying, oh, the re is a risk to doing ‘A’ we ca not do it...

This comes after decades of decline. For many, this is evidence that we need gun control. Obviously, I disagree and so do a lot of people. However, most of us agree that violent crime, particularly that using a firearm, needs to be addressed. When folks like you or I address gun control, though, we are often asked what should be done to address the issue. That is what editor Jay Caruso wanted to address. One of his suggestions is something I think is workable, even in our current political environment. Second, prosecute straw purchasers with more vigor. That raises a problem. Currently, there are no federal laws addressing straw purchases directly. The ATF and Justice Department are limited to investigating and prosecuting charges related to giving false statements on a federal form. Line 21a of Form 4473 asks, “Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form and any continuation sheet(s) (ATF Form 5300.9A)?” If a person answers affirmatively despite knowing he is going to give the gun over to a friend who could not pass a background check, that is a federal offense. However, it carries minimal punishment. For example, a case of straw purchasing in Virginia netted two people restricted from owning firearms (they were convicted felons) 27 to 48 months in federal prison. The actual straw purchasers received only45daysand home confinement. The lack of stringent penalties minimizes the risk. After all, it is easier to convince someone to steal a pack of gum than to rob a bank. Richard Marianos, a professor at Georgetown University and 27-year veteran of the ATF, including most recently as assistant director in the Office of Public and Governmental Affairs, told the Washington Examinerthere must be more focus on straw purchases and the federally licensed firearms dealers that openly allow straw purchases, or at least look the other way when they know it is going on.“One way would be to allow agents, with reasonable suspicion — not probable cause — to enter a gun shop and ask to see their records,” Marianos said. Marianos outlined three points critical to the investigation and successful prosecution of straw purchasers:“Over 80% of the guns used in violent crimes are attributed to straw purchases,” Marianos said. I’d really love to see Marianos’ data for that claim, but we agree that straw purchases are a problem. Giving the law some teeth and making it possible for the ATF to actually go after those who commit straw buys more vigorously. In addition, I’d add going after those who attempt to purchase a firearm despite being legally unable to do so. What happens in many cases is that when their background check fails, they talk someone else into buying the gun for them. Often, that is the first stage of a straw buy, but trying to buy a gun when you are a felon is a crime in and of itself, though it is rarely prosecuted. Change that and you will start to see criminals having a harder time buying guns. It will not go away, because, despite Marianos’ claim, I am unconvinced that straw buys represent that high a percentage. A large number of criminals have said they buy guns on the black market, after all, but we do know straw buys to also be an issue. Let is start there before we talk about banning weapons, restricting magazines, or any of a thousand other measures. What is more, there should be near-universal support for this. If there is not, particularly from Democrats, the n we will know that it is not about reducing crime in any way, shape, or form.",0,0,Bearing Arms
417,State Department Lawyers Concluded Insufficient Evidence to Prove Genocide in China,0.0,49.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/19/china-uighurs-genocide-us-pompeo-blinken/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,25,"The US State Department is Office of the Legal Advisor concluded earlier this year that China is mass imprisonment and forced labor of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity—but there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide, placing the USs’ top diplomatic lawyers at odds with both the Trump and Biden administrations, according to three former and current US officials. The US State Department is Office of the Legal Advisor concluded earlier this year that China is mass imprisonment and forced labor of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity—but there was insufficient evidence to prove genocide, placing the USs’ top diplomatic lawyers at odds with both the Trump and Biden administrations, according to three former and current US officials. The revelation comes nearly a month after the n-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on January 19, one day before US President Donald Trump is presidency ended, that China was carrying out a genocide against Chinese Muslims, primarily the ethnic Uighur population, in the western region of Xinjiang. The Biden administration has reaffirmed Pompeo is stance and backed off a recent claim Biden is UN envoy pick, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, made in her confirmation hearing that the State Department, under the Biden administration, was conducting a review of the designation. A State Department review during the final weeks of the Trump administration of China is conduct in Xinjiang pitted the department is lawyers against advocates of a genocide determination. Those advocates included Kelley Currie, who the n served as US ambassador at large for global women is issues and is a long-standing critic of China is human rights record, and former Senator Sam Brownback, who served as the department is ambassador at large for international religious freedom. It resulted in a “split” memo from the department that was sent to Pompeo, according to two officials. Beyond the legal debate over the characterization of China is repression of its Muslim population, the genocide designation carries enormous political weight, applying pressure on the USs and other countries to punish a global powerhouse whose trade, environmental, and security activities are entwined with their own. But wielding the g-word without a solid legal basis also carries the risk of politicizing and eroding the power of the designation, which has been invoked in the past century to describe the worst episodes of mass killing, from the murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust to the slaughter of around 800,000 Rwandans during the country is genocide. The cautious conclusions of State Department lawyers do not constitute a judgment that genocide did not occur in Xinjiang but reflects the difficulties of proving genocide, which involves the destruction “in whole or in part” of a group of people based on their national, religious, racial, or ethnic identity, in a court of law. It also points to a disconnect between public perception of the crime of genocide and the legal definition in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which has long been interpreted by State Department lawyers to require intent to bring about the physical and biological destruction of a group.“Genocide is difficult to prove in court,” said Richard Dicker, an expert on international justice at Human Rights Watch. Even the most horrific of crimes—burning of villages, systematic rape, or the execution of large numbers of civilians—can not be considered genocide unless the perpetrators carry out their crimes “with a very specific intent—the intent, of course, being to destroy in whole or in part a population based on their religious, ethnic, or national background,” he said. There is little dispute within the US government that China is treatment of the Uighur population has been horrific and criminal: More than 1 million Uighurs have been detained in reeducation camps, and many have reportedly been subjected to forced labor and sterilization. China has committed numerous crimes listed in the convention as acts of genocide, including the prevention of births and infliction of bodily or mental harm on members of a group and the compulsory separation of children from their communities, according to human rights groups. But there remains questions over whether that conduct meets the extraordinarily high threshold required to prosecute the crime of genocide.“International courts have concluded that, for a crime to come within the definition in the [Genocide] Convention, the perpetrator must intend to destroy the relevant group in a biological or physical sense,” wrote Todd Buchwald, who served as the special coordinator for the State Department is Office of Global Criminal Justice during the Obama administration, and Adam Keith, a former human rights specialist in the National Security Council, in an exhaustive study of US decision-making on genocide. The convention, they noted, excluded the more limited concept of “cultural genocide.”But many international legal experts view that interpretation as too narrow and say there is ample evidence that China has engaged in genocide. The Genocide Convention enumerates five categories of genocide, starting with the killing of members of a protected group but also including acts aimed at preventing a victim is ability to bear children and forcibly separating children from their communities. Critics of the State Department is legal stance have argued that it has focused too heavily on the first category, mass killing, and not enough on the other categories. In the case of China, these critics note, there is little evidence that it is engaging in mass killings of Uighurs and other minorities, many of whom have been subjected to indoctrination and pressed into forced labor. But evidence that it is carrying out other forms of genocide abounds, Beth Van Schaack, a visiting professor at Stanford Law School is Center for Human Rights and International Justice,wrotein a recent post on.“For example, the torture, rape and sexual violence committed against Uyghurs likely constitute genocide ‘by causing serious bodily and mental harm’—the second type of genocide recognized by the Convention,” she wrote. “Likewise, the deplorable living conditions of incarcerated Uyghurs may constitute genocide by ‘deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about [their] physical destruction’—the third form of genocide.”The process of determining whether the US government can and should declare the commission of mass atrocities a genocide has evolved informally since the USs became a party to the convention in 1988. Since the Cold War, the State Department has claimed genocide occurred in at least five cases. In 1993, the Clinton administration accused Bosnian Serbs of carrying out genocide against Bosnian Muslims. A year later, it accused ethnic Hutu extremists of carrying out a genocide in Rwanda. In 1995, it charged the Iraqi government of trying to eliminate the country is Kurdish population. The process became more formal during the George W Bush administration, when the n-Secretary of State Colin Powell established an extensive review process. He deployed a team of investigators called the Atrocities Documentation Team to the Chad-Sudan border to interview refugees in an effort to determine whether genocide had occurred in Darfur, Sudan, where the Sudanese government and a government-backed militia, known as the, unleashed a reign of terror and displacement on several ethnic and tribal groups. Powelldeclaredbefore Congress in 2004 that “genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the jan ja weed bear responsibility—and that genocide may still be occurring.”That formal review served as a model for future efforts to determine whether genocide had occurred. In March 2016, the n-Secretary of State John Kerry determined that the Islamic State had committed genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing against the Yazidis, Christians, and Shiite groups. His successor, Rex Tillerson, confirmed that decision. But the Trump administration never reached a final decision on the question of whether the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar were victims of genocide, and the Biden administration continues to review the situation. Some human rights advocates believe there is a stronger case for designating Myanmar is attacks on the Rohingya genocide than China is conduct in Xinjiang. In the case of China, Pompeo launched a review during his final months in office, a decision that was embraced by China critics in the department as overdue but viewed skeptically by others as a rushed and politicized effort to provide cover for a decision Pompeo had already decided he would make.“I have determined that the People is Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, China, targeting Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups,” Pompeosaidon Twitter on January 19, a day before Biden took office. He accused the Chinese of carrying out “forced sterilizations and abortions on Uyghur women, coerced them to marry non-Uyghurs, and separated Uyghur children from their families.”Currie declined to discuss the internal deliberations on the matter during the Trump administration, adding simply that “the secretary is decision and statement speak for the mselves.”A State Department official declined to comment on the internal deliberations during the Trump administration over the genocide designation but said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is decision to confirm Pompeo is decision was based on his own reading of the convention, not on the department is findings. The official noted that the secretary of state, whether Pompeo or Blinken, wields the ultimate authority to make the final judgment, regardless of recommendations from the department is lawyers. There is no need to initiate a new formal review into the matter, the official said. The Biden team during the campaign reached the conclusion that China had carried out genocide several months before Pompeo is declaration. In August 2020, Biden is presidential campaign issued a statement concluding that China is mass internment of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang amounts to “genocide.” Blinken reiterated that view during his confirmation hearing. Pressed on whether he agreed with Pompeo is assertion that genocide occurred in Xinjiang, Blinken answered, “That would be my judgment as well.”But Thomas-Greenfield, however, appeared to hedge during a subsequent confirmation hearing, saying that while the situation “feels like” genocide, she was awaiting the findings of a State Department review. “I know the State Department is reviewing that as we speak,” she said, before later aligning her position with Blinken is.“Secretary Blinken and I have made clear that genocide has been committed against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang,” she wrote in response to a question from Senator Marco Rubio.was a staff writer at between 2010 and 2022.

They will be ineligible for benefits and will not be paid for their 45-minute lunch breaks. They will be eligible prey for the CTU One of the primary tasks for the lower-tier 1,000 hires will be student supervision, including supervising “students who are learning in person if [the] classroom teacher is teaching remotely.”Of course, this verbiage calls into question myriad issues including what that in-person instruction entails and how that will square with the CTU contract with CPS.“Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Stacy Davis Gates said, “CPS can try to exploit low-wage temporary workers to fill in for staff who are not willing to sacrifice their lives for their livelihoods, when they must instead come to the table and bargain collaboratively to land what we need to return to our school buildings and our students safely – enforceable safety standards and real equity for Black and Brown school communities starved of equity for years before this pandemic.”Prior to the move, CPS mandated mask requirements, social distancing between students’ desks, student temperature sampling, the installation of new air purifiers, upgraded ventilation, and a sea of COVID-based upgrades in line with other major school systems around the USs. CTU blusters about “staff who are not willing to sacrifice their lives for their livelihoods” in the face of a virus that has a 98.18 percent survival rate among those who have been diagnosed with COVID and a 99.905 percent survival rate national, and two vaccines have been deployed against the “dreaded” virus.

WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 20: US President Donald Trump listens to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Photo by Doug Mills/Getty Images)Two senior White House officials and several Hill officials with intimate knowledge of the negotiations fear that Republicans and Democrats are too far apart on wish-list items to realistically move the bill forward. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the ongoing talks, cast a stark sentiment on both sides of the negotiation table. The White House and members ofCongresshave floated potential items for a Phase 4 coronavirus stimulus package for months — including a payroll tax cut, a second tranche of direct payments to taxpayers and increased budgeting for schools to reopen in the fall — but formal negotiations between the administration and Congressional leadership did not kick off until this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy met with Trump at the White House on Monday. The first round of bipartisan negotiations — featuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — followed on Tuesday at the Capitol. Heading into Tuesday is meeting,Meadowssaid that the group was eyeing a tentative July 31 deadline for the package, which happens to be the last day the House is currently scheduled to be in session, butMcConnelltold reporters later in the day that it is unrealistic to expect legislation to be passed within that timeline.“Of course politically it should pass before August recess. Everyone wants to have something they can point to back at home,” one GOP Senate aide told Daily Caller. “But if the last CARES negotiation was any indication of what is to come, I do not see how that time line is feasible. Let is remember Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer derailed the process and critical relief for days back in March because they were clinging to pipe dream proposals that have nothing to do with defeating this virus or helping hardworking Americans overcome this economic crisis.”“I would not hold my breath,” a second Senate staffer said in a statement to Daily Caller. “Given how far apart both sides are right now, I’d be shocked if Congress is able to pass a comprehensive coronavirus response bill by the end of the month. Hopefully, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats will put away their liberal wish list and come to the table.”WASHINGTON, DC – MARCH 27: (L-R) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) US President Donald Trump listen (Photo by Erin Schaff-Pool/Getty Images)McConnell is concerns about the bill is time line do not just involve wooing House Democrats. More than a dozen Senate Republicansreportedlyvoiced serious displeasure with signing off on another $1 trillion package at Tuesday is Conference lunch. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul, a notorious budget hawk, stormed out of the lunch and compared it to a “Bernie Bros” meeting.“Everything they ever said about President Obama they are,” he told reporters. “This is insane, they are ruining the country.”Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee also expressed concern to Daily Caller about the cost of McConnell is package, considering the massive unemployment spike caused by the pandemic seems to have reversed.“With states reopening, it is not clear that we need to borrow another trillion dollars now,” he stated. “If there is a Phase 4, I would like any additional spending delivered directly to families, rather than to politicians or government bureaucracies.”Republican Florida Senator Rick Scottadditionally said Tuesday he would “do everything we can to make sure we are not bailing out states,” including delaying the bill. WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 20: US President Donald Trump talks to reporters (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)Two senior Trump administration officials offered similar sentiments to the Daily Caller to those expressed by their Senate counterparts. One official suggested Mnuchin and Meadows’ time line is indeed too ambitious, and that “if anything happens” it will not be until the first week of August.“We are supposed to be here for two weeks but it looks like it will bleed over into August,” the official offered flatly. “Who knows?”A second administration official even questioned whether or not the president should sign another stimulus package without waiting to see if states currently dealing with a spike in cases opt to re-shutter businesses. The official alluded to Paul is Tuesday statements leaving the Conference lunch and predicted that additional Republican Senators might soon take up that position. Multiple House staffers offered slightly more optimistic projections to the Daily Caller but still questioned whether or not both chambers would vote to pass the bill before recess.“We do not know the state of play just yet for the next relief package. We expect legislative text within the next 24-48 hours, but how that plays within a divided Congress remains to be seen. If Pelosi puts in extraneous measures, you can expect it to delay the process significantly,” one senior GOP aide explained. “The hope is she will put the needs of 51 million unemployed Americans and millions of others hanging by a thread above her own wish to create a progressive utopia and remake America in her image and likeness.”WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 11: US President Donald Trump (2R) argues about border security with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) (R) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) as Vice President Mike Pence sits nearby in the Oval Office on December 11, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Pelosi said during an interview onJuly 14she would “absolutely” work through August to deliver a stimulus package, but a third senior House official told Daily Caller Tuesday that House leadership “will do everything not to have that happen.”The House is currently scheduled to break for district work on July 31, while the Senate has plans to head home on August 10.",1,1,Daily Caller

423,‘Up the Block’: A New Resource Hub for Philadelphians Affected by Gun Violence,-2.0,45.33,https://www.thetrace.org/2021/03/philadelphia-neighborhood-shooting-gun-violence-information/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,16,"True story: In Philadelphia, we have a section of the city referred to as “the Badlands.” Google Maps even plasters the ter mover the parts of North Philadelphia associated with the nickname. It is a reference to the area is crime rate, and to some, a warning to stay away. But those of us who call the neighborhoods home know they are so much more than what you hear about on the local news. My own community, Kensington, is the sound of roosters crowing while you wait for the El at Huntingdon Station. It is the old murals on the sides of homes, vibrant as ever. It is the old men playing checkers in the park, your neighbors free styling on the stoop for hours. It is merengue and maduros at the annual Puerto Rican Parade. When you live somewhere that tends to make headlines for gun violence instead of its positive contributions to local life, you start to realize a few things. The first is that many media outlets are quick to report that there was another shooting on your street, but have little to offer those of us confronting the violence up close. The next is that your neighbors have lots of ideas and questions about keeping their families safe and recovering from traumas, but information that directly meets their needs can be hard to find. Finally, it becomes clear that if such a resource existed, the re is a chance it could help change the path your community is on., a new project from The Trace, will try to do just that. As the community outreach editor in charge of the effort, I have spent the last few months listening to Philadelphians’ urgent concerns regarding gun violence, safety, policing, and justice. Working with local media partners and journalists, we have begun to gather essential information on organizations that address those concerns. The first phase of Up the Block, produced in collaboration with Billy Penn at WHYY, builds on their indispensable list of resources for healing and rebuilding after shootings. Early this summer, we will launch a simple web site that makes such vital info — where to find financial help for the funeral of a gun violence victim, bilingual services for shooting survivors, and much more — radically accessible. As Up the Block gets rolling, we will add information on safe havens and opportunities for young people threatened by gun violence. And we will gather ways that Philadelphians, especially Black and Latinx community members, can make sure their voices are heard by leaders as the city considers new approaches to violence prevention. To spread the word about the resource guides we are compiling, we will seek partnerships with organizations that meet information needs outside of the media, like places of worship, schools, and food hubs. Up the Block will also distribute knowledge offline, through things like mailings, flyers, and community bulletin boards. Throughout the process, I will continue to connect with my neighbors to understand how their perspectives and questions are evolving, using that input to improve the project. I came to The Trace to do this work because as a nonprofit news organization, it is committed to having a positive impact on the communities it covers. Since 2015, The Trace has reported on the extent of the gun violence epidemic in the USs, the uniquely American factors that have allowed it to run rampant, and the people working hard to try to curb the violence. Typically, that reporting has taken the traditional forms: investigations, profiles, policy articles. With Up the Block, we will use journalism to provide a more direct service, creating a hub of information for folks struggling through issues relating to gun violence on a neighborhood level. While our most essential collaborators will be everyday Philadelphians affected by or working to reduce shootings, Up the Block will also draw inspiration from the media organizations already finding creative ways to meet community information needs. Billy Penn, Resolve Philly, The Philadelphia Center for Gun Violence Reporting, and Free Press are pioneers in the kind of service journalism to which we hope to contribute. We are excited to join them in their efforts. Philadelphia had nearly 500homicides in 2020, including an alarming65.3 percent increase in child shootings, and we have already had nearly 300shootings during the first months of 2021. This violence disproportionately kills and injures Black Philadelphians, who make up82 percent of shooting victims, but just43.6 percent of the population. Throughout my conversations with Philadelphians, I have heard how heavily gun violence weighs on many of us. I have spoken with Black mothers who want to know how to keep their children safe when they are out playing, and young Black men looking for guidance on building a life after incarceration on gun charges. On local radio shows like G-Town Radio, I have listened to lifelong Philadelphians asking how they can get involved in local politics to influence gun violence solutions. We are building Up the Block to try to provide those answers and fill other information gaps that people share with us in the months ahead. So if you are reading this as a fellow Philadelphian: Let is talk. Do you have questions about recovering from, avoiding, or preventing gun violence in your city? Are you a journalist, storyteller, or media organization interested in working together?

424,So That is What a Normal President Sounds Like,-11.33,35.33,https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdqpn/so-thats-what-a-normal-president-sounds-like,https://adfontesmedia.com/vice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,21,"So that is what a normal presidential speech sounds like. President Joe Biden took the oath of office Wednesday and delivered a standard political speech filled with platitudes about truth, justice, and the American way that have taken on renewed resonance in the wake of Donald Trump is four-year assault on democracy that culminated in a physical attack on the US Capitol itself.“Democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,” Biden declared. “So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol is very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power.”It was a stark tonal shift from former President Trump, whose inaugural speech promised to end an era of “American carnage”—and whose four years in the White House delivered just the opposite. Biden is speech was practically the only normal thing about this Inauguration Day. The inauguration ceremony was held on the very steps where an angry pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol just two weeks ago. For the first time in a century and a half, the outgoing president refused to attend. The coronavirus and heightened threats of violence meant there was no crowd of average Americans spread across the National Mall. The dignitaries present were masked and spread out at socially distanced seats to keep the inauguration from becoming a super spreader event. Almost 25,000 troops were on hand to ensure a “peaceful transition” of power. National Guard troops were activated around the country to ensure against right-wing extremist attacks.“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs urban, conservative vs liberal”“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural vs urban, conservative vs liberal. We can do this, if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,” Biden said in a plea for unity for a nation divided. Biden faces a tall task. His concrete goal of 100 million COVID-19 vaccines in the first 100 days of his presidency could prove difficult following the Trump administration is disastrous initial distribution rollout. The current COVID rate is near the highest it is been, and the re is evidence that new strains of the coronavirus are leading to a spike in infections. Biden is campaign pledge to “restore the soul” of America could prove an even tougher goal: Three-quarters of Trump is supporters believe his lie that Biden stole the election, and 71 percent of Americans in a recentCBS/YouGov survey said that democracy and the rule of law are threatened. And while Democrats have won control of Washington, their majorities are about as small as can be. The Senate is split 50-50, while Democrats have just a few seats’ cushion in the House. While Biden is address preached unity, he made clear that did not mean appeasing the enemies of democracy. Biden specifically called out white supremacy by name, and drew a direct line between the falsehood-laden right-wing echo chamber that Trump has trumpeted and the January 6 attacks on Congress.“Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies. Lies told for power, and for profit. We need to have a sense of duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution to protect our nation, to defend the truth, to defeat the lies,” he said. With a nation as polarized as it is been in at least a half-century and a large chunk of America believing Trump is lies that Biden stole the election, that may be his toughest challenge.",1,1,Vice

The explosive new communications and internal FBI notes were disclosed in federal court filings today from Sidney Powell, the attorney who heads Michael Flynn is legal defense team.“[W]e all went and purchased professional liability insurance,” one agent text ed on January 10, 2017, the same dayCNN leaked details that the n-President-elect Trump had been briefed by Comey about the bogus Christopher Steele dossier. That briefing of Trump was used as a pretext to legitimize the debunked dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign and compiled by a foreign intelligence officer who was working for a sanctioned Russian oligarch.“Holy crap,” an agent responded. “All the analysts too?”“Yep,” the first agent said. “All the folks at the Agency as well.”“[C]an I ask who are the most likely litigators?” an agent responded. “[A]s far as potentially suing y’all[?]”“[H]aha, who knows…. I think [t]he concern when we got it was that there was a big leak at DOJ and the NYT among others was going to do a piece,” the first agent said. While the names of the agents responsible for the texts are redacted, the legal filing from Powell, quoting communications from the Department of Justice, states that the latest document production included handwritten notes and texts from Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and FBI analysts who worked on the FBI is investigation of Flynn. Agents also said they were worried about how a new attorney general might view the actions taken against Trump during the investigation. Shortly after the n-Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) was confirmed to be Trump is new attorney general, congressional Democrats, media, and Obama holdovers within DOJ immediately moved to force Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the department is investigations against Trump.“[T]he new AG might have some questions….then ya da ya da yada…we all get screwed,” one agent wrote. The FBI agents also discussed how the investigation is leadership was consumed with conspiracy the ories rather than evidence.“I am tel lying [sic] man, if this thing ever gets FOIA’d, there are going to be some tough questions asked,” one agent wrote. “[A]nd a great deal of those will be related to Brian having a scope way outside the boundaries of logic[.]”“[REDACTED] is one of the worst offenders of the rabbit holes and conspiracy the ories,” an agent texted. “This guy traveled with that guy, who put down 3rd guy as his visa sponsor. 3rd guy lives near a navy base, the refore…[.]”Several texts show that the order to close the criminal investigation against Flynn came as early as November 8, 2016, the same day as the 2016 presidential election. It was later re-opened in early January of 2017.“We have some loose ends to tie up, and we all need to meet to discuss what to do with each case (he said shut down Razor),” one agent texted, referring to Crossfire Razor, the FBI is internal code name for the investigation of Flynn.“[S]o glad they are closing Razor,” an agent responded. The new disclosures made by DOJ also show that the FBI used so-called national security letters (NSLs) to spy on Flynn is finances. Unlike traditional subpoenas, which require judicial review and approval before authorities can seize an innocent person is property and information, NSLs are never independently reviewed by courts. One of the agents noted in a text message that the NSLs were just being used as a pretext by FBI leadership to buy time to find dirt on Flynn after the first investigation of him yielded no derogatory information.“[T]he decision to NSL finances for Razor bought him time,” one agent said nearly two weeks after the initial order to shut down the anti-Flynn case. It is not known to whom the agent was referring in that text.“What do we expect to get from an NSL[?]” an agent text ed on December 5, 2016. “We put out traces, trip wires to community and nothing.”“[B]ingo,” another FBI agent responded. “[S]o what is an NSL going to do – no content.”“Hahah this is a nightmare,” an agent said.“If we are working to close down the cases, I am not sure what NSL results would do to help,” one agent wrote.“[E]xactly that makes no sense,” an agent wrote back. The explosive new text messages also show agents believed the investigation was being run by FBI officials who were in the tank for Hillary Clinton.“[D]oing all this election research – I think some of these guys want a [C]linton presidency,” one agent wrote on August 11, shortly after the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation against Trump. In one series of texts sent the same day as the infamous January 5 Oval Office meeting between Obama, Biden, Comey, Sally Yates, and Susan Rice, one agent admits that “Trump was right” when he tweeted that the FBI was delaying his briefings as incoming president so they could cook up evidence against him. As The Federalist first reported last May, that January 5 meeting was the key to understanding the entire anti-Trump operation run out of Obama is FBI.“The ‘Intelligence’ briefing on so-called ‘Russian hacking’ was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case,” Trump tweeted on January 3. “Very strange!”“So razor is going to stay open???” an agent wrote on January 5.“[Y]ep,” another FBI agent responded. “[C]rimes report being drafted.”“F,” the first agent wrote back.“[W]hat is the word on how [Obama is] briefing went?” one agent asked, referring to the January 5 meeting.“Dont know but people here are scrambling for info to support certain things and its a mad house,” an FBI agent responded.“[J]esus,” an agent wrote back. “[T]rump was right. [S]till not put together….why do we do this to ourselves. [W]hat is wrong with these people[?]?A week later, the FBI agents also wrote that they suspected that the illegal leak of top secret information about Flynn is phone calls with Russian ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak to the news media came directly from the White House.“FYI – someone leaked the Flynn calls with Kislyak to the WSJ,” the agent wrote.“I am sorry to hear that,” another FBI agent responded sarcastically. “I will resume my duties as Chief Morale Officer and rectify that.”“Published this morning by Ignatius,” an agent said, referencing the January 12 column from Washington Post writer David Ignatius that included leaked to p-secret information about Flynn is calls with Kislyak.“It is got to be someone on staff,” an agent wrote. “[Presidential Daily Briefing] staff. Or WH seniors.”To date, not a single person has been charged with illegally leaking that information to the Washington Post as a way of damaging Flynn and the incoming Trump administration. Following a review of the federal government is investigation by US Attorney Jeff Jensen, which was ordered by Attorney General William Barr, the government moved to dismiss all charges against Flynnthat had been previously brought by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Documents unearthed during Jensen is review showed that before the FBI was tasked by the Obama White House in early 2017 with re-targeting Flynn, the agency closed a previous investigation against him because there was no proof of any criminal wrongdoing. Jensen is review also uncovered evidence that the FBI is interview of Flynn, which later led to charges that he lied to FBI investigators, had no legal basis and that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe that he had lied. Contrary to claims by Mueller is office that Flynn had lied about discussing financial sanctions against Russia during post-election phone calls with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak, declassified transcripts of those conversations confirmed that Flynn spoke to Kislyak only about expulsions of Russian diplomat sand that the two men never discussed financial sanctions against Russia that had previously been levied by the Obama administration. Jensen is review of Flynn is case file also revealed handwritten notes from the FBI is top counterintelligence official that admit teda primary goal of the FBI is anti-Flynn operation was “to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired.”Despite the overwhelming evidence that Flynn did not lie to agents, the FBI had no legal basis to interview him, that the FBI later hid exculpatory documents from Flynn is defense team, Flynn did not discuss financial sanctions during his phone calls with Kislyak, and the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe he lied, federal trial Judge Emmet G Sullivan has refused to dismiss the case against Flynn. Instead, Sullivanpersonally appointed a left-wing shadow prosecutor, whose partners represent former DOJ official Yates, to smear Flynn and attempt to continue the baseless criminal case against him. At one point last April, Sullivan even tried to order the DOJ to stop producing and publicly filing exculpatory evidence for Flynnor evidence of FBI misbehavior during its investigation of Flynn. Sullivan, who called Flynn a traitor during court proceedings and suggested that Flynn — a decorated Army combat veteran — be charged with treason, has refused to recuse himself from the case despite his obvious personal animosity toward Flynn.",0,0,The Federalist
426,Dr. Anthony Fauci says publicly released email about lab leak is being misconstrued,-2.33,42.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/03/health/anthony-fauci-emails/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,24,"In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that an email he received last year from an executive at the US-based EcoHealth Alliance has been misconstrued and offered a hint of regret about a February 2020 email downplaying the need to wear a mask. Earlier this week,news outlets including CNN,BuzzFeed NewsandThe Washington Postobtained thousands of em ails Fauci sent and received since the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases became a household name early last year. In one email sent to Fauci last April, an executive at EcoHealth Alliance, the global nonprofit that helped fund some research at China is Wuhan Institute of Virology, thanked Fauci for publicly stating that scientific evidence supports a natural origin for the coronavirus and not a lab release. (The origins of the virus remain unclear.)“There are some of your critics who say this shows you have too cozy of a relationship with the people behind the Wuhan lab research,” CNN is John Berman said to Fauci on New Day. “What do you say to that?”Thousands of em ails from and to Fauci during the pandemic is early days were published. Here is what they show about him“That is nonsense,” Fauci responded. “I do not even see how they get that from that email.”Fauci the n emphasized that the email was sent to him, and he noted the origins of the coronavirus are still uncertain.“I have always said, and will say today to you, John, that I still believe the most likely origin is from an animal species to a human, but I keep an absolutely open mind that if there may be other origins of that, there may be another reason, it could have been a lab leak,” Fauci told Berman. “I believe if you look historically, what happens in the animal-human interface, that in fact the more likelihood is that you are dealing with a jump of species. But I keep an open mind all the time. And that is the reason why I have been public that we should continue to look for the origin.“You can misconstrue it however you want – that email was from a person to me saying ‘thank you’ for whatever it is he thought I said, and I said that I think the most likely origin is a jumping of species. I still do think it is, at the same time as I am keeping an open mind that it might be a lab leak.”In another email sent to Fauci on April 16, NIH director Francis Collins wrote “conspiracy theory gains momentum,” a reference to the lab-leak hypothesis. But much of the email is redacted, and Fauci said he did not remember its substance.“They only took about 10,000 em ails from me, of course I remember. I remember all 10,000 of them. Give me a break,” he said. “I do not remember what is in that redacted, but the idea I think is quite farfetched that the Chinese deliberately engineered something so that they could kill the mselves as well as other people. I think that is a bit far out, John.”What Fauci is em ails reveal -- and what they do notBerman also brought up a February 5, 2020, email Fauci sent to Sylvia Burwell, former secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, in which he did not recommend wearing a mask since she was traveling to a low-risk location. The email was sent at a time before coronavirus was declared a pandemic and before theCDC advised the public to wear masks for protection.“A lot has transpired since the n. If you had to go back and do it all over again, would you tell her something different? Do you regret that?” Berman asked Fauci.“Let is get real here – if you look at scientific information as it accumulates, what is going on in January and February, what you know as a fact, as data, guides what you tell people and your policies. If March, April, May occur, you accumulate a lot more information and you modify and adjust your opinion and your recommendation based on the current science and current data,” Fauci told Berman.“So of course, if we knew back the n that a substantial amount of transmission was asymptomatic people. If we knew that the data show that masks outside of a hospital setting actually do work when we did not know it the n. If we realize all of those things back the n, of course,” he said. “You are asking a question, ‘Would you do something different if you know what you know now?’ Of course people would have done that. That is so obvious.”CNN is Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",1,1,CNN

428,Whitmer calls on Michigan legislature to pass law requiring masks,-3.0,50.67,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/11/05/whitmer-covid-michigan-mask-legislature/6175062002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,25,"The day before Michigan expects to record the 200,000th case of the coronavirus in the state, Governor Gretchen Whitmer called on legislators to pass a law requiring residents to w ear masks in indoor places and crowded outdoor areas. The governor said she sent a letter to Republican lawmakers this week asking them to pass a bill. Lawmakers, especially Republicans leading the House and Senate, have asked to have more of a role in the process of tackling the pandemic, Whitmer noted. Now is their time to act.""This is the law under epidemic orders. But we do think it would be helpful to our health, our safety and our economy if it was codified in a bipartisan (manner at) the Legislature, and that is what we have asked for, "" Whitmer said.""We have known for a long time that the single most important weapon that we have against this virus is the simple task of wearing a mask.""State health orders issued in October already require mask wearing in public. Yet case rates continue to rise. While Whitmer said she thinks putting the requirement in law would likely encourage Michiganders to take the precaution more seriously, she knows people are tired and frustrated.""We are all tired of dealing with COVID And yet ignoring the problem is making it worse,"" Whitmer said.""I think fatigue is a part of it, I think the political rhetoric has created a lot of confusion and unnecessary suspicion around the efficacy of masks. However, studies have shown this remains the best tool that we have.""Whitmer said state health and labor officials are also ""increasing scrutiny"" of remote work policies, especially for employers requiring staff to work on-site. The state may cite employers, require changes and issue fines of up to $7,000, Whitmer said. The comments came the same day Michigan recorded its highest number of cases in any day since the start of the pandemic: 5,710. That brings the state is total case count to more than 197,800. The seven-day average daily case rate is above 3,500, much higher than at any point in the pandemic. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, state medical executive, said the percentage of positive tests is averaging 7.5%, though it exceeded 10% on Monday and Tuesday. Hospitalizations are four times higher now than they were at the end of August, and 60% are outside of southeast Michigan. More than 7,400 people have died from the coronavirus. There were more deaths in Michigan in October from the disease than in any month since May About 2,300 people are now hospitalized in Michigan with COVID-19 symptoms, said Dr. Adnan Munkarah, Henry Ford Health System is executive vice president and chief clinical officer.""It is definitely taxing all health care systems and hospitals across the state,"" he said. The Detroit-based health system has re-activated its incident command center to allow it to ""make rapid changes as needed to accommodate the increasing number of patients"" who have COVID-19, Munkarah said. About 18% to 20% of the COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized at Henry Ford need to be admitted to intensive care units, he said, but fewer are in need of ventilator support.""Part of this is because we have learned much more about the disease over the past few months and how to manage it differently where we do not feel that we need to put people on respirators or ventilators so early,"" Munkarah said. For the time being, no elective procedures or medical services are limited at Henry Ford because of the rising coronavirus hospitalizations, but Munkarah said: ""We are going to continue to monitor things very, very closely.""But one of the biggest concerns he has is whether Henry Ford and other hospitals statewide will have enough staff to get through this surge. With so much community spread of the virus, hospital workers are at higher risk of contracting the virus just as everyone else. And if they get sick, Munkarah asked: ""Are we going to have enough staff to take care of patients in the hospital?""“If we do not do anything else, if we do not change our behaviors, we could be seeing 100 deaths per day by the end of December,"" Khaldun said.“We are really at a tipping point right now when it comes to COVID-19. … Our rates are rising exponentially. “What it is like to vote when you have COVID-19Michigan coronavirus cases: Tracking the pandemicIn late October, state health officials announced it would be continuing regulations and restrictions intended to mandate mask wearing while in public, limit crowd sizes at private gatherings and in business, and generally promote actions that will stop the spread of the disease. That included requiring restaurants to keep contact information for patrons, in order to ease any potential contact tracing efforts. The state also limited the number of people who may eat at an establishment together at six, and reduced the number of people allowed at a gathering like a wedding venue that does not have fixed seating. Michigan sets new restrictions on dining, gatherings as COVID-19 cases riseCoronavirus Watch: Where cases are increasingHealth officials hurriedly issued a similar order in early October in response to Michigan Supreme Court rulings. The court, in a split decision, essentially invalidated executive orders put in place by Whitmer. The court determined one law Whitmer had relied upon was unconstitutional, and a second law required Whitmer to obtain approval from the Legislature if she wanted to extend a state of emergency. State health officials issued the restrictions under a completely separate law that was not in any way affected by the court is ruling.""We have to get the politics out of the public health crisis. It is killing us. It is jeopardizing our economy ... to day, the most important tool that we have is a mask. And every one of us has an interest in masking up,"" Whitmer said Thursday. Michigan Supreme Court rules against Whitmer on emergency powers but effect unclearMichigan lawmakers approve extension of unemployment benefits, new nursing home rulesWhile state Republican legislative leaders have groused about Whitmer is decision to issue executive orders, the Legislature has not passed any comprehensive legislation aimed at stopping the spread of the disease. The GOP-led House and Senate have collaborated with the governor on legislation that helped schools open, extend unemployment benefits, give clarity to nursing home operators and new legal protections to some businesses.""Michiganders are tough. We have grit. Take care of each other. We ca not stop now,"" Whitmer said.",2,2,Detroit Free Press
429,Dallas County adds 20 COVID-19 deaths; 183 deaths in 7 days shatters record set only a week ago,0.0,48.0,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2021/01/30/texas-reports-19569-more-covid-19-cases-332-deaths-tarrant-county-adds-1862-cases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-30,25,"Updated 6:15 p.m.:Revised to include data from Dallas County. Dallas County on Saturday reported 1,407 new coronavirus cases and 20 more deaths from COVID-19. This marked the deadliest week of the pandemic so far, with 183 deaths, County Judge Clay Jenkins said. That shatters the previous high of 138 set only the week before. The latest victims — mostly in their 60s or older — included 10 people from Dallas, two each from Farmers Branch, Garland and Irving, and one each from Cedar Hill, DeSoto, Duncanville and Richardson. Nearly all had been hospitalized, and all but one had underlying health conditions. Get the latest coronavirus and public health updates. Jenkins said while COVID-19 hospitalizations have fallen slightly over the last few weeks, county health officials are concerned about the most recent projections from UT Southwestern. Their forecast model predicts between 910 and 1,390 people will be hospitalized in Dallas County by February 9. That is lower than past projections but will still be an “immense strain” on health care systems, the county said in a news release. Of the new cases reported Saturday, 1,170 were confirmed and 237 were probable. The county has reported 256,900 cases overall, including 226,452 confirmed and 30,448 probable. The death toll is 2,179. Health officials use hospitalizations, intensive-care admissions and emergency room visits as key metrics to track the real-time impact of COVID-19 in the county. In the 24-hour period that ended Friday, 989 COVID-19 patients were in acute care in hospitals in the county. During the same period, 512 ER visits were for symptoms of the disease. According to the state is data, 136,028 people in Dallas County have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 30,650 are fully vaccinated. Across the state, 19,569 more COVID-19 cases were reported Saturday, including 18,109 new cases and 1,460 older cases that were recently reported by labs. The state also reported 332 COVID-19 deaths, raising its toll to 36,320. Of the new cases, 14,969 were confirmed and 3,140 were probable. Of the older cases, 1,068 were confirmed and 392 were probable. The state has now reported 2,349,262 cases overall, including 2,049,055 confirmed and 300,207 probable. (The state also removed 335 cases from the total confirmed cases due to a data audit in Hays County.)There are 11,473 COVID-19 patients in Texas hospitals, including 3,173 in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. On Friday, 19% of patients in the hospital region covering the Dallas-Fort Worth area were COVID-19 patients — above the 15% threshold the state has used to define high hospitalizations. The seven-day average positivity rate statewide for molecular tests, based on the date of test specimen collection, was 14.77% as of Friday. For antigen tests, the positivity rate for the same period was 7.93%. A molecular test is considered more accurate and is sometimes also called a PCR test; an antigen test is also called a rapid test. Governor Greg Abbott has said a positivity rate above 10% is cause for concern. Texas is set to receive a significantly higher number of COVID-19 vaccines in the coming week, the state health departmentsaid. Providers will receive 520,425 first doses of the vaccine and 188,225 second doses for people vaccinated a few weeks ago. The additional doses are largely due to a 30% increase in the number of Moderna vaccines being provided by the federal government, the state said. The increase is also due to an additional 126,750 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which were initially set aside for the federalPharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, being returned to the state. The program overestimated how many doses it would need, the state health department said. The state said it is working with providers to ensure they have enough second doses for patients vaccinated a few weeks ago. People should be able to return to the provider that gave them their first dose, the state said. According to the state is data, 1,842,287 people in Texas have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 448,649 are fully vaccinated.

430,"Ron DeSantis’ misleading claim about crime, police funding",-4.33,37.33,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/04/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-misleading-claim-about-crime-police-f/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis lauded a new state law he championed as ""the strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement piece of legislation in the country.""Thenew law increased the criminal penalties for offenses committed ""in furtherance of a riot or an aggravated riot."" It also allows state attorneys or city council members to appeal budget proposals that seek to reduce police operating budgets to the state is Administration Commission. The commission, made up of the governor and Cabinet, has the final say.""This bill actually prevents against local governments de funding law enforcement,""DeSantis sai dafter signing the bill April 19. ""We will be able to stop it at the state level. And if you look at some of these places that have done this, they have already seen crime go up.""DeSantis’ office pointed to news reports about increased crime in six places: New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, DC, Minneapolis and Philadelphia. The types of crimes and time periods used to measure those increases varied per city. Those cities did reduce or redistribute some police funding as they grappled with the coronavirus pandemic andactivists’ calls to spend less on policing and more on mental health services and anti-crime programs. However, criminologists disputed DeSantis’ link between budget cuts and worsened crime. Experts said the limited data and selective time frames disregard key points:Murder and gun violence were already up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. (Some of the six cities are still in the process of shifting money from the police.)Cities that did not cut police budgets also saw murder go up in 2020.""These comparisons of crime increases with reductions in police budget or personnel are strictly anecdotal. In the first instance, they should be compared with crime changes in cities that have not altered policing,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri, St. Louis expert on crime trends. ""Moreover, they are at best correlations between crime changes and policing. They say nothing about whether or how the changes to policing caused the crime changes.""A proper evaluation of budget changes and their impact on crime should control for multiple factors that influence criminal activity, said Charis E Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California, Irvine. Those factors include poverty, joblessness, drugs, gangs, guns, housing insecurity and demographic shifts, she said. AfterGeorge Floyd is killing by a police officer in May 2020,activists protesting racial discrimination and excessive use of force by police called on cities to""defund the police.""While some protesters want to eliminate police departments entirely, others want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroute some police funding toward other services. The six cities flagged by DeSantis did not abolish police departments or cancel their budgets. But they approved less funding for police departments for fiscal 2021. Some responded by transferring police duties to other city departments, eliminating funding earmarked for overtime pay, imposed hiring freezes, among other measures. The cities made budget changes to fiscal years that started as early as July 1, 2020, and as late as January 1, 2021. PolitiFact reached out to each of the six cities to learn more about their budget changes and how significant they were in relation to the overall police budget. We heard back from most, but got limited information. In Philadelphia, a $33 million cut to the police budget represents about 4.5% of the department is adopted general fund budget of $727 million. New York City officials last years aid they agreed to remove $1 billion from the police department is spending. (The Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said the net reduction to the police budget so far has been about $477 million.) The department istotal budget for 2021was $10.2 billion. Los Angeles cut $150 million from the police operating budget. The department is 2021budgetis more than $1.7 billion. Minneapolis officials in Decembersaidthey shifted $7.8 million from the proposed police budget to other city departments. Overall, the city approved$164 million for the police department. (The city is fiscal year runs concurrently with the calendar year.)The Austin American-Statesmanreportedon a $150 million cut to the police budget, which represents about one-third of the police budget. But city spokesperson Jaquarry Wilson disputed the characterization of funds being cut, saying $121.7 million ""was simply moved into two transition funds"" while city staff determines which services can be offered by other city departments. Another $31.5 million was reinvested in other community safety initiatives in other departments, Wilson said. DeSantis’ claim did not take into consideration how crime manifested nationally in 2020. Many cities saw spikes in homicides in 2020, regardless of changes to their police budgets. Crime increases are likely the result of the ""social disorganization"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, said Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Social disorganization involves a weakening of the basic bonds of social control, such as good employment and stable families. Nationwide, murder went up every quarter of 2020 compared with the respective quarters in 2019, according to preliminary FBI data. The number of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses increased 14.8% nationwide in the first half of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data reported to the FBI by more than 12,000 US law enforcement agencies. At the same time, the FBI said there were overall declines in the number of violent crimes and property crimes.""The complicated drivers of 2020 is large murder increase were clearly already well established before budget cuts for 2021 were passed,"" said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. Some of the local news reports offered by DeSantis’ office also compared homicides in 2021 with 2020. One report focused on New York City murders over the first 10 days of 2021 versus the first 10 days of 2020;anotherlooked at Philadelphia homicides from the beginning of 2021 through mid-March, compared with the same period in 2020. Short-term homicide data can be ""notoriously unreliable,"" said Michael Campbell, a criminologist at the University of Denver. Homicides are relatively rare compared with other crimes, leading to large fluctuations in the homicide rates.""However, everything points to a broad up tick in homicide, domestic violence, gun crimes and other serious offenses,"" Campbell said. ""Things are bad everywhere and it is easy to point at these big cities but it is impossible to determine any clear relationship and I’d be surprised if one ever emerges.""Cuts in police funding do not automatically mean the department will make a decision that puts public safety at risk. When police departments have a reduced budget, they try to make adjustments that spare services for citizens or affect their perception of safety, said Kevin Robinson, a lecturer at Arizona State University is School of Criminology & Criminal Justice.

DeSantis said, ""If you look at some of these places that (cut police funding), they have already seen crime go up.""An element of truth in DeSantis’ claim is that crime went up in six major cities. But he said it was because of budget cuts, when murder and gun violence were already trending up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. None of the budget changes have been in place for a whole year, so it is too early to tell the extent of their impact on crime, if any. A proper assessment would control for many factors that influence criminal activity, experts said. We rate DeSantis’ claim Mostly False.",1,2,Politifact

Who knows? | Commentary,-1.0,46.33,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/scott-maxwell-commentary/os-op-florida-school-opening-nonsense-covid-scott-maxwell-20200729-xbt6p23invhq7jav2xbk6twhbq-story.html#rt=chartbeat-flt,https://adfontesmedia.com/orlando-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"Associated PressRichard Corcoran, the Florida Education Commissioner appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis, ordered all school districts to provide face-to-face classes - ""barring a state or local health directive to the contrary.""Stephen M Dowell/Orlando SentinelDr. Raul Pino, the state health department is officer in Orange County, speaks during a press conference in Orlando on Thursday, June 18, 2020. Want to hear a bunch on unintelligible nonsense?(Yes, beyond what you normally find in this column.)Ask any state official in Florida to explain who is personally responsible for deciding whether it is safe for schools to offer in-person classes this fall. You will hear a steady of stream of words that do not answer the question or sometimes even form cohesive thoughts. It is like trying to divine quantum physics from a babbling baby. And it all seems designed to ensure that none of the people demanding open schools bear any responsibility if things go wrong. But do not take it from me. In fact, to day, we are going to do something different:Youget to be the journalist. I am going to give you the verbatim transcripts of what these people say, and you decide whether it makes sense. My quest for direct answers began after I read several stories out of South Florida where school leaders alleged that state health officials had been muzzled. School officials there said they could not get the health officials to provide straight answers about whether it was safe to open. The Palm Beach County School Board chair claimed the state is top health official there had been “politically silenced by Tallahassee” and “told to keep her mouth shut.”Now, I know politicians can be gross. But this seemed beyond the pale. So I sought straight answers myself. I started with Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran is schools-must-open order. He issued it the same day President Trump tweeted: “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!”Corcoran is order demanded in-person classes in every district but claimed to allow an exception for any district that received “a state or local health directive to the contrary.”Well, that seems simple enough, right? It sounded like a county health director would be the obvious person to provide a “local health directive.”Maybe, I thought, there was just confusion in Palm Beach. Certainly Orange County is chief health officer would speak up. However, Orange School Board members reported no such luck with Dr. Raul Pino. “We did not get a direct answer,” board member Pam Gould told the Sentinel. That seemed strange. But I knew Dr. Pino was respected. So I wanted to hear it straight from him. And I was not alone. At a press conference last Friday, a TV reporter asked Pino the same straightforward question: “Who has the authority to open or keep the schools closed?”Here was his response:“So the interesting thing about the orders is that Iworkfor the Florida Department of Health. But I am not the Florida Department of Health.”He went on to say: “I am an employee of the state Health Department who is assigned in Orange County to work for Orange County and the Orange County government. But the reality is the state health department and the head of the health department is the state surgeon general, not me.”Um, OK So maybe the state surgeon general? Except we have not heard much from him. In fact, the governor is staff actually yanked Surgeon General Scott Rivkees from a press briefing in April when Rivkees went off script and started warning Floridians to stay away from each other. (See the Newsweek piece: “Florida Surgeon General Removed from Governor DeSantis’ Coronavirus Briefing After Saying Social Distancing Necessary Until There is A Vaccine.”)Also, Orange school officials said they asked Tallahassee for a waiver and have not received a response. Most importantly, the surgeon general is not a “local” official. And Corcoan is order said a “local” health directive was one of the only ways a school district could avoid his mandate to open. So I went back to Corcoran to ask him if he could explain his own order: Whospecificallyshould provide the “local health directive”?Corcoran did not respond. But a member of his communications team did. Here is what she said:(It is slightly pared down, but still long because I wanted you to see what I saw.)“Florida Department of Education Order 2020-EO-06gives ultimate authority to determine when and how to open schools to local school boards and governing boards. The Department of Health, through the county health departments, serves as a resource to the school districts on how to open schools in the safest manner and what mitigation strategies to employ at the time and in the manner determined by the local school districts. … The county health department works collaboratively with the local superintendent, school district and school board to provide county data and trends and educate on mitigation strategies to make the school environment as safe as possible.…Section 154.01, Florida Statutes,lays out the county health department delivery system, which intends for the Department of Health to aid counties in the promotion of public health and control of preventable diseases. The same section provides that counties may enter into cooperative contracts with DOH, and that DOH shall enter the same. 154.01(1) and (3), Florida Statutes.”Remember, the question was simply: Whichspecificlocal health official is empowered to make the call?I wondered if maybe I was no longer capable of processing basic information. So I shared her response with my editor and asked if he saw an answer to my question anywhere in that mountain of words.“Hmmm,” he responded. “I think what they are trying to say is pjljaghsodsljfan08mvo.”I concurred. My take-away is that Governor Ron DeSantis and his education commissioner wanted to issue a sweeping schools-must-open order like Trump wanted, but they also know there are safety risks. So they included an out, giving some theoretical “local” health expert the chance to object, but empowering no one to actually do so. Suddenly, no one is really accountable. But hey, maybe you disagree. Maybe after hearing the state say school boards should work with “county health departments” — who say they are not the ones who should make that call — it all makes perfect sense to you. Maybe it is clear as pjljaghsodsljfan08mvo.smaxwell@orlandosentinel.com",2,2,Orlando Sentinel

435,Member of CIA chief is team reported Havana syndrome symptoms on recent trip to India,0.0,45.0,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/politics/cia-director-havana-syndrome-india-trip/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-20,24,"When CIA Director Bill Burns traveled to India earlier this month a member of his team reported symptoms consistent with Havana syndrome and had to receive medical attention, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The incident set off alarm bells within the US government and left Burns “fuming” with anger, one source explained. Some officials at the CIA viewed the chilling episode as a direct message to Burns that no one is safe, including those working directly for the nation is top spy, two sources said. The event marks the second time in less than a month that reported cases of the mysterious illness have impacted the international travel of top Biden administration officials. Last month Vice President Kamala Harris is visit to Vietnam was slightly delayed when multiple US personnel reported symptoms consistent with the syndrome just ahead of her visit, and at least two of them had to be medevaced. Under Burns and the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, the intelligence community has undertaken a wide-ranging investigation into the mysterious attacks, including a 100-day probe into the potential causes that began earlier this summer. While that investigation is expected to be concluded before the end of the year the time frame could be somewhat adjusted and there is no public report planned, two sources said.“We do not comment on specific incidents or officers. We have protocols in place for when individuals report possible anomalous health incidents that include receiving appropriate medical treatment,” a CIA spokesperson said. “We will keep doing everything we can to protect our officers.”The situation in India could have dramatic implications: the CIA director is schedule is tightly held and there are deep concerns among US officials about how the perpetrator would have known about the visit and been able to plan for such an aggression. The person traveling with Burns who experienced the symptoms in India received immediate medical attention when they returned to the US, sources said. US investigators have struggled to determine what or who is causing the mysterious symptoms, and how exactly they are doing it. Incidents of Havana syndrome began in late 2016 in Cuba and there have since been cases reported in Russia, China, Austria and other countries across the globe. CNN has previously reported that incidents also took place on US soil, including two staff members of the n-President Donald Trump is national security council who were struck near entrance points to the White House. The ongoing incidents have put US diplomats and intelligence officials on edge leading up to the UN General Assembly in New York this week where diplomats from around the world – including many US diplomats – will convene in close quarters. Only a handful of the total reported incidents have occurred on US soil, but the gathering in New York is always viewed as a target-rich environment for espionage. President Joe Biden was recently updated on the overall situation – including the fact that there are more than 300 possible cases, the kind of medical support being provided to those impacted, and the investigation into the matter that is led by the intelligence community. Over the summer the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, launched the 100-day investigation into the “mechanism” behind the incidents, and efforts that could be taken to defend against the attacks. Putting a time frame on it was part of an effort to drum up the intensity of the investigative effort, but the deadline could be extended if that is needed, sources said. There are also other ongoing investigations by the US intelligence community focused on the question of the perpetrator behind the incidents, which the US government calls anomalous health incidents or AHIs, and what the US can do to defend against these incidents. The US government is “pursuing multiple lines of effort” to investigate the Havana syndrome, a CIA spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that one of those efforts is led by ODNI and CIA officers as well as the outside scientific community to “to work collectively to increase our understanding of the possible mechanisms that could be causing AHIs.”Since Biden took office his national security team has been keenly focused on probing the mysterious incidents and getting impacted US personnel the assistance they need. Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke with US diplomats affected by the Havana syndrome earlier this month which marked his first meeting with those impacted, according to a State Department Spokesperson. The conversation came after CNNreported of frustration among rank-and-file staffers about how the department had handled the mysterious incidents. Lawmakers were initially critical of the Biden administration for not sharing regular updates on the mysterious incidents. But in recent months the administration, in an effort led by Burns, have made changes to the processes and support for those impacted and personnel working on those efforts.“We have strengthened efforts to determine the origins of the incidents, including assembling a team of our very best experts – bringing an intensity and expertise to this issue akin to our efforts to find bin Laden,” a CIA spokesperson said. “The senior officer who leads the team spent more than a decade on counterterrorism issues and was a driving force in CIA is analytic and targeting work that led us to find bin Laden.”Still, the incidents have continued to occur, leaving US diplomats and US intelligence officers on edge as they take on new assignments overseas.",2,1,CNN
436,The corporate conflicts of Trump is new coronavirus advisor,-12.25,39.25,https://popular.info/p/the-corporate-conflicts-of-trumps,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-01,18,"Anthony Fauci, one of the nation is leading experts on infectious diseases, has been sidelined. Fauci has not appeared with Trump at a coronavirus briefing since April 22. Instead, Fauci has attempted to communicate accurate scientific information through media appearances — while Trump undermines Fauci is message via Twitter. Trump has installed Scott Atlas, a frequent guest on Fox News, to effectively replace Fauci. Although Atlas is a doctor, he is wildly unqualified for the role. Atlas is not an infectious disease expert or epidemiologist. He i sa radiologist. His159-page CVcontains no references to ""epidemiology,"" ""epidemic,"" ""virus,"" or ""viral.""Atlas' primary qualification is that het ells Trump what he wants to hear. Atlas has called for the reopening of schools, raised doubts about the efficacy of masks, criticized lockdowns, and downplayed the importance of testing. These positions are not supported by reliable scientific evidence. And they are rejected by subject-matter experts. But those positions, because they are favored by Trump, have put Atlas at the center of the federal government response to the pandemic. Atlas,according to Politico, is ""part of a tiny group of advisers who meet every morning to chart the daily response to Covid-19."" The group also includes Jared Kushner and Steven Miller, two other people with no qualifications to be involved in such an effort. On Monday, the Washington Postreportedthat Atlas is using his new influence to push Trump toward a ""herd immunity"" strategy. That involves allowing the virus to quickly spread through the population, while protecting some vulnerable groups, to allow most people to build immunity to the coronavirus. It has been pursued in Sweden with disastrous results. Achieving herd immunity would require 65 to 70 percent of the American population to contract COVID-19. Assuming a 1% fatality rate, that would mean2.13 million deaths. The stark numbers have not dissuaded Atlas. While promoting the reopening of schools in Florida on Monday, Atlas described the potential for children to spread the virus to adults as ""icing on the cake.""But Atlas' issues extend beyond his lack of qualifications and dangerous policy prescriptions. He also holds numerous positions in the corporate world that create conflicts of interest. While playing a central role in the federal government is multi-trillion dollar coronavirus response, Atlas holds leadership and advisory positions with pharmaceutical companies, a healthcare diagnostic company, and a medical venture capital firm. Atlas is currently an ""international advisor"" and board member for TechTools, a medical venture capital firm based in Brazil. The company ""primarily invests in health technology and innovation."" Atlas' position at the center of the White House is pandemic response gives him valuable insight into what types of investments in the healthcare field are likely to be profitable. Atlas is also theChairman of the Boardof AlzecoBio, a ""healthcare diagnostic company."" The company is ""focused on developing novel MRI-based targeted imaging agents for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer is disease and other neurodegenerative disorders."" While this seems unrelated to the pandemic, the company is also a startup that has been actively raising money to fund its operations. Atlas' powerful role in the White House — and his influence over billions in pandemic response funds — could give him access to the investors he needs to grow the company. In preparation for Congressional testimony last December, Atlas submitted his CV, dated September 1, 2019. Atlas' CV includes a list of ""Scientific and Medical Advisory Boards, and Corporate Boards, Current and Past.""That list reveals Atlas' ties to several pharmaceutical advisory boards. Specifically, Atlas is or was a member of advisory boards for Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. While it is not known if Atlas is paid for his work, these ""positions typically pay well.""Sanofi is actively developing a vaccine candidate and has already secured a $2.1 billion grant from the federal government for Project Warp Speed. Atlas may be holding an influential role in the White House is coronavirus response while simultaneously working with Sanofi. Atlas also reported a similar role with Bristol Myers Squibb. Thatcompany""has a proof-of-concept clinical trial in progress to assess the safety and efficacy of ORENCIA® (abatacept) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."" It is also ""one of 15 companies participating in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to identify concrete actions to accelerate treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics in the field.""Do Atlas' positions with pharmaceutical companies influence his views? He has consistently advocated policy positions that benefit the industry. For example, in a2018 column published on CNN, Atlas defended the drug industry is practice of charging Americans higher prices than the rest of the world. Not surprisingly, prices and profit margins for prescription drugs in the USs dwarf those in foreign markets. It is obvious that economics represent a key incentive for the constant innovation and first access to life-saving drugs that Americans enjoy. Indeed, that is the conundrum: The same policies that are associated with the lower prices seen in other countries -- price regulation and weaker patent rights -- are also those that are typically associated with delayed launches and reduced access to drugs. He wrote similar pieces, promoting positions favored by the pharmaceutical industry, in2017,2019, and2020.""The Trump Administration has serious credibility problems right now when it comes to all things science and public health. Elevating the voice of someone with such close ties to the pharmaceutical industry and such dangerous views on how we should be responding to COVID-19 is absolutely the wrong direction for them to be moving if they want to restore the public is trust,"" Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for the watchdog group Accountable Pharma, said. There is a lot we do not know about Atlas' financial conflicts. The White House has even ""declined to say whether Atlas was receiving a taxpayer-funded salary.""It is part of a pattern of shielding the people involved in the pandemic response from government rules around disclosure and conflicts of interest. Moncef Slaoui, who is heading up the White House is $10 billion vaccine development program, was hired as an ""outside contractor."" This allows him to lead the project while continuing ""to invest in pharmaceutical companies."" The arrangement also allows Slaoui ""to avoid disclosing potential conflicts of interest."" The White House has hired ""several other consultants"" with ties to the drug industry with the same arrangement. Atlas' arrangement is even more opaque. There is no indication he was required to step down from any of his corporate positions as a condition of accepting the role.

437,Popularity of Bail Funds Continue Protests’ Momentum,-11.33,48.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/popularity-of-bail-funds-continue-protests-momentum,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"ATLANTA—On June 1, police officers had 20-year-old William Lefforge, and about 50 other protesters, boxed in on the sidewalk near Atlanta City Hall. The officers warned the protesters they had three minutes to leave, but according to Lefforge, the group could not get by the police. The police arrested them and transported Lefforge and his group to the Atlanta Detention Center. Lefforge estimated his arrest happened around 4 p.m., well before the 9 p.m. curfew that Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has since lifted.:Lefforge called his mother, Jen, who in turn reached out to the Atlanta Solidarity Fund. Thanks to the fund, Lefforge walked out of the detention center a little before midnight. He had only his release papers, which cited “pedestrian in the roadway” as his charge. Organizers were waiting in the parking lot across from the detention center to make sure protesters reached their homes. On June 4, Lefforge was at another protest. As historic protests against police brutality toward Black Americans sweep the USs, social media is littered with calls for donations to local bail funds. Those unable to join the front lines of protests are giving material support by donating, according to protesters and organizers. The Atlanta Police Department reported it made298 arrest sin the first weekend of protests alone. An organizer with the Atlanta Solidarity Fund who asked to be identified only by his first name, Marlon, said protesters have been arrested for curfew violations, disorderly conduct, and even felony incitement to riot. With a felony charge, judges are more likely to set a higher bail—or deny it entirely. Keeping protesters in jail is the point, according to Marlon. He said, “Not just in Atlanta, but around the country, police forces are waging a kind of war of attrition. Eventually people is wallets will run out. Their safety nets will run out and they will have no choice but to stop protesting. When we support bail funds, we make sure [protesters] have that backing that they need to stay on the streets as long as they need.”Even before the protests, bail was a costly system. A2017 report from UCLA is Million Dollar Hoods research team found that “the money bail system is a multi-billion dollar toll that demands tens of millions of dollars annually in cash and assets from some of LA is most economically vulnerable persons, families, and communities,” all before anyone has been found guilty. One factor driving up that total cost is the fact that judges frequently set higher bail for Black and Hispanicdefendants than for white defendants with the same charge. Albert Corado, 31, is an organizer and police abolitionist with People is City Council in Los Angeles. Corado said People is City Council emerged after the city government is lack of action in the face of the novel coronavirus’ spread. “There was no rent relief, no tangible plan to help people. We were frustrated with city council and the mayor is response,” he said. So the People is City Council called for rent suspension and commandeering hotels for Los Angeles’ unhoused population. It also supportedPeople is Budget LA, which is focused on getting more funding to social services like improved mental health services and public education, instead of funding the police. People is City Council is demand to de fund the police is now being echoed across the US City councils arevotingtoslashpolice budgets and even heedingprotesters’ calls to defund. After the police killing of George Floyd, People is City Council is agenda expanded. Corado and nine other organizers started a GoFundMe to cover legal and medical costs for protesters, direct support to Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, and supplies for protest organizers. The group raised over$2 million. Corado said it is a huge sum of money for a few organizers to make decisions about, but they are committed to channeling the money to supporting protests against police brutality. Corado also has a personal connection to recent appeals for de funding police. The LAPD killed Corado is sister, Melyda, in 2018. He added, “Having lost my sister to police violence, it feels amazing. It is a big fuck you.”Similarly, the Minnesota Freedom Fund was one of the first bail funds to gain national attention. The nonprofit raised$20 million in only four days but struggled to spend the donations on bail, using only$200,000. Board member Jared Mollenkoftold local media the nonprofit would be undergoing a massive scaling-up and remains committed to ending cash bail. Sarah Abdel-Motaleb, a law student in Dallas, Texas, donated to her local bail fund as a form of solidarity with the protesters. Abdel-Motaleb added, “Even if [a donation] is just a little bit, it is going into a larger fund that will make an impact on people is lives.”She also brought up the safety concerns of jailing protesters while the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Health experts warn the virus is able to spread quickly in jails. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides bail assistance to low-income individuals charged with a crime. The nonprofit has helped release over 11,000 people from pre-trial detention, according to CEO Robin Steinberg. Steinberg called cash bail “a driver of injustice,” citing the disproportionate cost to Black families. When someone who has not been convicted of a crime is able to await their trail outside of jail, Steinberg said, “The impact is felt not just by the individual but also allows that person to reconnect to family and employment and their community.”In light of the protests, The Bail Project started operating a 24-hour assistance line to help arrested protesters and concerned friends and family. The line has received 300 calls, according to The Bail Project. She said it makes sense why people have flocked to bail funds as a way to show support for protesters, adding, “Paying [someone is] bail is a way to have an immediate disruptive impact on the way [the legal] system operates.”Ultimately, Steinberg said bail funds are “not the answer,” but are a “powerful tool.” The Bail Project is dedicated to ending the norm of mass incarceration. She said, “The ordinary is that we are ensnaring Black and Brown people in our legal system.”",2,1,Real News Network

But it was also a vivid demonstration of what the criminal justice system could be if prosecutors went after all ""bad cops"" with the same gusto, legal observers said. During the 42-day trial, jurors heard from 45 witnesses and listened to hours of technical testimony about whether Chauvin, who pinned George Floyd to the ground under his knee for 9 1/2 minutes, actually caused his death. In the end, jurors unanimously agreed, he did. They convicted Chauvin on all three counts: second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But that does little to assuage longstanding problems with how people of color are treated by the criminal justice system. Nor does it necessarily impact how other cases like the police shooting of Daunte Wrightin nearby Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, will be handled. That is because of the entrenched culture of policing and prosecuting, experts said, but also because of the unique aspects of this case.""What the verdict (says) is when you have such an egregious act that shocks the conscience of the usually oblivious and unconcerned white mainstream, the n prosecutors and policing culture will come to the bar of justice and do the right thing –which is testify against this officer,"" said Connie Rice, a prominent civil rights attorney and former member of President Obama is Task Force on 21st Century Policing.""But,"" she said, ""a victory in this trial is a confirmation of the massive failure of our broad system.""Jurors concluded that Chauvin had intentionally committed third-degree assault on Floyd when he pinned him to the ground, handcuffed, and pressed his knee into his neck. And, they concluded, the assault resulted in Floyd is murder, even though Chauvin may not have meant to kill him. Chauvin faces a recommended 12 1/2 years in prison under sentencing guidelines for first-time offenders, but the prosecution wants a longer sentence — up to 30 years — due to aggravating factors. The decision is up to Cahill.""I would not call to day is verdict, justice ... because justice implies true restoration,"" said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office handled the prosecution. ""But it is accountability, which is the first step towards justice. And now the cause of justice is in your hands. And when I say your hands, I mean the hands of the people of the USs.""The sequestered jury provided their verdict a day after closing statements, and hours after President Joe Biden said he believed the evidence overwhelmingly supported a guilty verdict in the trial. It is rare for a police officer to be convicted for killing someone on duty, ""but this whole thing is rare,"" said retired Redlands, California, police Chief Jim Bueermann, the former president of the National Police Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. He said he was not sure there would be any impact on policing in the US, especially because ""most cops believe American policing is under attack.""""Obviously, there are lots of police fatal uses of force,"" Bueermann said, noting that the number hovers around 1,000 people per year. ""But taken in its totality, this case is unprecedented in many ways.""Those unique factors include the manner in which Chauvin killed Floyd, that he did it for so long even as bystanders recorded video and begged him to stop, and that he did not relent even after at least one other officer suggested they reposition Floyd. The circumstances of Floyd is death meant lead defense attorney Eric Nelson was not able toutilize the usual ""split-second"" argument used when officers shoot someone. Attorney John Burris represented Rodney King, a Black man who was beaten by white Los Angeles police officers 30 years ago while a neighbor recorded it. The four officers were acquitted of criminal charges; within hours, five days of rioting in Los Angeles began. Burris said it was easier for jurors to convict Chauvin if they saw him as ""a cold, ruthless person – unkind, unfeeling."" Chauvin, wearing a surgical mask, showed little emotion during the case and when the jury read its verdict.""This trial is unique,"" Rice said, in part because it was a ""lynching"" in which Chauvin showed bystanders he could do what he wanted, for 9 1/2 minutes, and they were powerless to stop it. The verdict ""will do nothing to change the physics of urban policing,"" Rice said. She said the circumstances of this case probably will not be repeated, ""where you see the code of silence broken, you see the blue wall of impunity pierced. You see prosecutors going after a police officer at a level that they go after criminals daily.""In his closing argument, prosecutor Steve Schleicher said this was a ""pro-police"" case.“The defendant is not on trial for being a police officer, he is not on trial for who he was, he is on trial for what he did,” he told jurors. Legal experts who watched the trial praised prosecutors' performance and said they presented overwhelming evidence against Chauvin.""The prosecution presented an incredibly strong case,"" said Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in neighboring St. Paul. ""The defense lawyers were totally overmatched.""Legal observers said the totality of the prosecution is testimony was insurmountable as Minneapolis police officials and policing experts denounced Chauvin is actions as excessive, unreasonable and out of policy. Several key witnesses were particularly powerful, said Mary Moriarty, the former chief public defender for Hennepin County: bystanders like Darnella Frazier, who recorded the viral video; Dr. Martin Tobin, a medical expert; and Minneapolis police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who told jurors Chauvin violated the department is policies and his actions did not reflect “our ethics or our values.”In his closing statement, prosecutor Steve Schleicher described bystanders as ""random members of the community, all converged by fate at one single moment in time to witness"" what happened –– and the n to bring their testimony to jurors.""We got to meet them all as human beings,"" Moriarty said, noting that Frazier was a minor at the time. When Nelson asked Frazier if recording the video changed her life, that allowed prosecutors to ask her to elaborate.""When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles,"" Frazier said, her voice cracking. She said she stayed up late some nights ""apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.""But, she said, ""it is not what I should have done. It is what he (Chauvin) should have done.""Moriarty said Tobin, a pul monologist who cares for critical care patients, ""was one of the best expert witnesses I have ever seen."" He ""gave all of us a clinic in plain English"" on the pulmonary system, counted Floyd is breaths on a video, had jurors feeling their own necks as he described the human airway, and showed viewers the moment in the video when Floyd went unconscious and suffered an anoxic seizure.""He had a bedside manner in court,"" said Joe Daly, an emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. ""He could explain everything, and he had this very pleasing Irish lilt. He had a very pleasing personality and the way he testified, you trusted him. About halfway through his testimony I thought, I'd love this guy to be my doctor.""Moriarty said she did not think Nelson had enough of a grasp of the medical knowledge to cross-examine the state is experts. Tobin would have been hard for most attorneys to cross-examine, she said.""I understand the strategy is wanting to make it look like it is you and Chauvin against the power of the state and all their experts,"" Moriarty said. ""I do not know if that was particularly effective.""For all of the explanations provided by the defense for Floyd is death, Nelson never adequately explained why Chauvin held Floyd down for 2 1/2 minutes even after he had no pulse. The only explanation provided was that Chauvin was maintaining his position until an ambulance arrived in the face of an angry crowd that made the area unsafe. The fact that Chauvin continued to press on Floyd is neck even after he had no pulse ""is hard to get away from, and I do not think it was dealt with,"" Daly said. ""Nobody looked too threatening, if you asked me.""Sarah Davis, executive director of the Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis, said the defense is attempts to construct a narrative of the events felt disingenuous, and Nelson failed to gain the trust of jurors through his arguments.""If you watched the closings, you heard the state call out the defense for what they called 'nonsense,' really calling out those disingenuous arguments,"" she said. A conviction on all three charges means the state succeeded, but also ""the defense just really was not able to sell their version and their narrative.""Nelson argued that Floyd is drug use and his underlying health issues caused his death while he struggled with police. But he never called what happened to Floyd ""tragic"" until his closing argument.""He waited until two hours into his closing to even utter the word 'tragic,'"" Davis said. ""The thing is, he did not have a coherent narrative and I think you saw that right at the beginning of his closing. If you have a coherent narrative, you tell that story right at the beginning of closing when you have the jury is attention.""The state did exactly that, starting its closing with a short biography of Floyd and who he was as a person. Prosecutors pushed a consistent theory throughout the case, Davis said. The state won key concessions from the defense is two expert witnesses and undermined their credibility during their cross examinations. Dr. David Fowler testified that Floyd likely died of a ""sudden cardiac arrhythmia"" due to his hypertensive heart disease, plus the methamphetamine and fentanyl in his system, while he was being restrained and subdued by police. Because of the many factors, Fowler concluded the manner of Floyd is death was ""undetermined"" rather than a homicide.""Undetermined –– that is not a strong opinion,"" Moriarty said. It was especially problematic for the defense when compared to the state is strong expert witnesses.""You would rather have your own narrative about what happened,"" Moriarty said, ""rather than say you ca not prove it, (so) it is reasonable doubt. That is not a very strong position to find yourself in.""Fowler conceded that Chauvin and the other officers should have immediately offered CPR and chest compressions to Floyd when he was clearly in medical distress and when they learned he had no pulse. Moriarty said she felt the jury was ""offended"" by some of the characterizations Nelson reverted to during the trial, including his attempt to goad Donald Williams, the mixed martial arts fighter who told Chauvin he was putting Floyd in a ""blood choke,"" into ""coming across as some angry Black man."" Nelson characterized the crowd, which included a 9-year-old girl, other minors and an off-duty firefighter, as an angry mob.""They were all people who were trying to help"" and followed police directions, Moriarty said. She noted that a use-of-force expert for the defense acknowledged that simply stopping the restraint would have de-escalated the situation.""You cannot ignore the racism and the racist ideas inherent in the defense is presentation of its case,"" Davis said. Chauvin chose not to testify, opting to exercise his the Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. He wore a surgical mask throughout the trial, sitting ramrod straight in his chair, and taking notes on a yellow notepad. He rarely looked at the jury or made any expressions of emotion.""All we have is that look of him on his face on George Floyd is back and neck, and we never got to see anything other than that,"" Davis said. ""He did not react in court to any of the really emotional testimony from what we could tell.""The jurors were ordered to stay away from news on the trial, and ultimately all news in general, by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill. Still, it is impossible to believe the jurors could not ""taste the tension"" in Minneapolis, said AL Brown, a criminal defense and civil rights attorney in neighboring St. Paul. The courthouse was surrounded by fencing and razor wire, and National Guard soldiers were stationed outside.""They know the dangers of a not-guilty verdict,"" Brown said. ""It may not drive the outcome, but they are surely aware of it.""Brown said pretending the criminal justice system is fair does not reflect the reality he sees in court.“People will draw from these verdicts what they need,” he said. “There is a portion of our population that will say, ‘See? What is all the whining about? He had a trial. Was found guilty. America works. Stop burning things. Follow the law. Go back to your homes.’”But a guilty verdict across the board — “that is the closest to happiness this case can get you.”",1,2,USA Today

The Associated Press wire service, the liberal-tilting longtime home of Helen Thomas, has a new slogan: “Advancing the Power of Facts.” TheEditor & Publisher websitereports:The Associated Press recently revealed a new brand campaign which, according to a press release, emphasizes the global news organization is “vital role as the provider of”“The main goal is to elevate our position and our mission in the world,” global marketing director Julie Tucker told E&P. “People think they know who we are, but we have not been as bold in saying who we are, why we matter and what our mission is.”When they were putting together the campaign, the the me of neutrality spoke to Tucker, but as they worked to unpack that ideas he said.

441,The Faded Irony About UK Imperialism,-7.67,36.67,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/09/02/the-faded-irony-about-uk-imperialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-09-02,23,"came across this excellent heat map representation of a large opinion poll on support for the monarchy, sampling 22,000 people all across the UK, taken in 2018 by focaldata. Red to nes indicate net disapproval of the monarchy and green to nes indicate net approval. It is worth noting the quite astonishing, and detailed, degree of correlation with this heat map of the Brexit referendum. Annoyingly I cannot find the actual datasets for the focal data survey. Among other things, that rather puts to bed the notion of a significant left-wing Brexit vote. Brexit voters are indeed mostly highly traditional British Nationalists who love the Queen. All of which underlines the obvious point that Scotland has a very different political culture to England. It also ought to cast some doubt on the triangulation methodology so favored by gradualists. I find that speaking to Scottish National Party (SNP) branches is no different from speaking to any other Yes group, in that abolition of the monarchy is overwhelmingly popular, and virtually nobody at meetings is a monarchist. I have never detected any generational difference in this. Scottish Republicanism tends to link in with views on much more radical land reform, which is so desperately needed. A campaign for a Scottish Republic would have majority support. Yet we are told that openly to advocate a Scottish Republic would alienate voters. No, it would not, most people would support, and you are not going to convert a great many diehard monarchists to independence anyway. I strongly suspect that this extends to other areas, particularly foreign policy. I simply do not believe there is a large well of support in Scotland for UK neo-con foreign policy, nor that it is necessary to support UK foreign policy to maximize support for independence. Neither Russia nor China is the enemy of the Scottish people. The problem is, that those with the finances to commission opinion polls have every interest in keeping support for such opinions hidden. I have always found the argument that people will only vote for independence if they think nothing will change rather amusing; if nothing will change, why vote for it?Anyway, while on the subject of British nationalism, I have a unifying solution to the culture wars question of singing “Land of Hope and Glory” and “Rule Britannia” at the Proms. A Promenade concert in the Royal Albert Hall, 2004.(MykReeve, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)“Rule Britannia” has no musical virtues and in my view should never be sung or played anywhere; it is a horrible bit of doggerel laced with ugly baroque frills. “Land of Hope and Glory” however is sung to a genuinely great piece of music. The answer is perhaps something like this:The truly wonderful Patrick Fyffe is no longer with us, but George Logan is and for £20 I will slip on a frock and do it myself. In childhood we always watched the Last Night of the Proms with my mother, and enjoyed it greatly. In those days there was no doubt at all that the patriotic singing was taken with a huge dose of irony. Britain had decolonized almost entirely in a remarkably swift quarter century, and there was a presumption the process would be completed. The state was properly social democratic; all utilities were in public ownership as were all the largest industries. All public provision really was provided by the state, not through profit making private agencies. You could not only go to university for nothing, you were paid to go. Post Suez Crisis, the idea the UK would ever invade anywhere else again seemed wildly improbable, and more importantly, nobody wanted to invade anywhere. There were still American dictated blights, like theChagos Islands, but very few were conscious of it. Public discourse was left wing. TV had A J P Taylor, not David Starkey, and Bertrand Russell popped up regularly. The BBC showed Ken Loach and the play “The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil.”In these circumstances, some singing of “Wider still and wider Shall thy bounds be set” seemed harmless, given that the exact opposite had plainly been in full train. The promenaders were determinedly silly. One year there was a large banner saying “Eat prunes they make you go,” which we children thought hilarious and became a joke in our house. HMS Cardiff anchored outside Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, at the end of hostilities in 1982.(Griffiths911, CC BY-SA 3.0, Wikimedia Commons)I suppose that it was former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Falklands War that changed all that, and made British nationalism start to be sinister again, even though most of the promenaders the mselves remained the same knowing skeptics. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair the n took it to another level, with his promotion of “liberal interventionism,” the doctrine that bombing BAME people (black, Asian and minority ethnic) is good for them. That was and is a direct and unreconstructed revival of “liberal imperialism” of a kind that composer Edward Elgar would recognize and support. Suddenly the Last Night of the Proms went down another notch in the irony scale and up another notch on the jingoism scale, as Blair started to invade countries left, right and center. Now with Brexit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage there seems to be a point of no return where British nationalism is too toxic to be adopted ironically. I am not sure the Last Night of the Proms will survive Scottish independence. Would they still mark the imperial nostalgia with the old butcher is apron from imperial days? I think it is probably time, absent Patrick Fyffe, or me in a frock, to put this grand old lady to rest. CraigMurray.org.uk.toConsortium News’25th Anniversary Fall Fund Drive",1,0,Consortium News

A budget amendment by Amherst Democrat Representative Mindy Domb — backed by a handful of members from the liberal side of the delegation — would have changed the way vacancies are filled. It would require successors from “the same political party as the person vacating the office” until a special election is held, 145-160 days after the vacancy occurs. Domb is reasoning for the amendment, she said, is to “keep the voters’ faith” and protect the tight “balance of power in the US Senate.”“I do not think it should have to be part of President-elect (Joe) Biden is calculus in creating the most effective administration he can assemble. The MA Congressional delegation is filled with rock stars. They all happen to be Democrats. So I guess in that way it protects our delegation and the choices that the commonwealth is voters have made,” Domb told the Herald. Former Warren challenger Republican Geoff Diehl accused Democrats of “playing king of the hill.”Boston University professor and political historian Thomas Whelan said, “This comes down to a raw power grab.”The amendment was the “latest shining example” of rewriting of election laws that have become somewhat of a pastime for Democrats in recent Massachusetts history. Democrats began to tinker with election laws in 2004 — over the n-Governor Mitt Romney is veto — blocking appointment power to stop a potential vacancy from the n-Senator John Kerry who was running for president from falling into Republican hands. Kerry lost his presidential bid, but the rule change endured. It came into play again in 2009 upon the death of Senator Ted Kennedy when Democrats moved to allow the n-Governor Deval Patrick to appoint a temporary senator until a special election could be held 145 to 160 days after the vacancy arose. He tapped former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk. State Republican Party Chairman Jim Lyons was quick to point out the “hypocrisy” in the law changes. Whelan said the flip “spectacularly backfired” on Democrats when Republican Scott Brown beat the n-Attorney General Martha Coakley to finish out Kennedy is turn. Democratic strategist Scott Ferson called the change “needless” this time around.",2,1,Boston Herald

Ulysses Muñoz/Baltimore SunHeavy storms moved through the Baltimore region bringing rain and minor flooding. At Leadenhall Street and W West Street cars were pushed onto the curb by fast moving water. Severe storms moved through Central Maryland late Wednesday afternoon, bringing heavy rains, flooding and damaging winds. More could be on the way Thursday. Floodwaters on Wednesday carried away several vehicles in North Baltimore, forcing at least one passenger to break through the windows and flee to higher ground. Others watched from indoors as their cars floated away. Angela Bowman of the Ednor Gardens-Lakeside neighborhood in Northeast Baltimore said she cut her hand when escaping from her car. At least six other vehicles on the 1700 block of E. 35th St. were lifted from where they had been parked. At the intersection of E. 35th St. and Hillen Road, an MTA bus was stranded in the floodwaters, and all of its passengers had disembark and board another, a Department of Transportation spokesperson said. The street has long suffered from flooding, with neighbors attributing much of the problem to faulty drainage pipes. Cars, basements, living rooms and kitchens have been ravaged by floodwater over the years. Flooding was possible overnight due to runoff from the earlier heavy rain, the National Weather Service said, and was expected to cause creeks and streams to rise. Areas around the Chesapeake Bay and the Patapsco River, including the Inner Harbor, were identified as potentially affected. A flood warning for southeastern Baltimore County and Baltimore City was issued at 6:26 p.m. and was lifted at about 8:15 p.m. Severe thunderstorm and flash flood watches were lifted just after 9 p.m. Doppler radar indicated that 1 to 3 inches of rain had fallen across the warned area.

Showers and thunderstorms are likely Thursday night, the service added, and some of the storms could produce gusty winds and heavy rain. The low temperature should be around 74. A meteorologist discussion on the weather service is web site said the main difference between Wednesday and Thursday “may be less sun in the morning to destabilize the atmosphere, in which case the storms may not be quite as productive. For the same reason, not quite as concerned about high heat indices, so will not issue another heat advisory just yet.”On Friday, the service said, the re is a chance of showers, with thunderstorms also possible after noon. The skies should be partly sunny, with a high near 91. There is a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms before midnight.

The outcome of it resulted inmore than 100women serving in the House of Representatives, a historic number. Throughout this last congressional term, four of the newly elected women have attracted a lot of attention:“The Squad,”a group attacked by the president and the right. Despite the attention — good and bad — they frequently receive, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) are just the nucleus of a burgeoning progressive movement in the House. In addition to nudging the Democratic party to take more progressive positions, they have frequently been the targets of right-wing attacks, whether death threats or misogynistic insults. The president attacked the min the middle of a presidential debate during this campaign, an echo of how he went after them in 2019.“Despite the occupant of the White House is attempts to marginalize us and to silence us, please know that we are more than four people. We ran on a mandate to advocate for and to represent those ignored, left out, and left behind,”Representative Pressley sai data press conference following the president is 2019 attacks. “Our squad is big.

Falwell is departure and the ignomious circumstances that prompted it were met by some evangelicals with protest: Why is the media saying he isguy? What makes Jerry Falwell Jr. an ""evangelical leader""?Ido not follow him. For an outsider looking in on the movement, this may seem like a protest in bad faith. It is not. ""I have been in evangelical circles for 30 years,"" says a representativetweet. ""Falwell is dad certainly was someone who had a vision for Liberty and had a lot of influence, but I have never heard anyone EVER refer to Falwell Jr. as a leader in evangelicalism. I am not trying to be combative, just honest.""Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. I could say exactly the same, and for most, I think this protest is sincere. But I also think it is entirely fair to call Falwell an ""evangelical leader"" because of how leadership is often developed and authority asserted within American evangelicalism. It is a problem that makes the movement prone to exactly the sort of scandal we see with Falwell this week. To understand this problem, you have to know a little bit about church governance. Some denominations, like the Catholic Church, have a strong system of to p-down control. If Pope Francis were caught in an illicit liaison à la Falwell, no Catholic could respond by denying the pope is properly deemed a ""Catholic leader.""Evangelicalism has no comparable hierarchy, and many Christians within it worship in groups that are also light on to p-down authority. There is no Baptist pope, and many evangelicals are in nondenominational congregations whose governance is entirely self-contained. Thus can anyone start their own church — and they do. Anyone can launch a blog or pod cast or YouTube channel and build a digital congregation — and they do that, too. There is a real sense of spiritual entrepreneurship in evangelicalism, as indeed there always has been. There is also a real sense of unaccountability, now made riskier by the sheer reach the internet allows such leaders to garner. Thatis not news to evangelicals. In 2017,(where I am also a columnist) published an article by Tish Harrison Warren, an Anglican priest, titled, ""Who is in charge of the Christian blogosphere?"" Warren focused on the blogger as a ""new kind of Christian celebrity — and authority"" who accrues a ""huge [following] based on a cult of personality and hold[s] extensive power and influence, yet often lack[s] any accountability to formal structures of church governance.""Parsing the raging controversyWarren is argument occasioned, historian Daniel Silliman, who is now aeditor,explained""authority has always been contested and in crisis"" in evangelicalism. ""That is the history,""he wrote. (Other scholars agree and link evangelical debate about theological and ecclesial authority to debates about political and scriptural authority, too.)Liberty sits squarely in this freewheeling milieu: The university has a relationship with the Southern Baptist Convention, but particularly in recent years, Falwell has taken a contentious attitude toward the denomination and insisted he should not be thought of as a pastoral figure. So what makes Falwell an ""evangelical leader""? Simply the fact that he claims the evangelical label and is (or has been) a leader. For better or worse, the re is no more rigorous test. Anyone who becomes famous in an evangelical capacity can be called an evangelical leader, even if the source of that fame is nothing more substantive than personality, wealth, or family connections. In Falwell is case, it was all three.""There is a long history of evangelicalism conflating success, authority, and fandom,"" said a Liberty University faculty member who spoke with me on condition of anonymity. (Liberty professors typicallydo not have tenure, and it is notuncommonforfacultyandstafftorequest anonymity when speaking with the press.) ""That element of 'fandom' is under-discussed,"" the faculty member continued, both in general and where the Falwell family specifically is concerned. Fixation on individual personalities like this happens, my source the orized, because ""evangelicalism has always struggled with a clear identity,"" and people like Falwell combine visibility with a degree of success assumed to be ""entwined with God is will.""The trouble is that a movement which chooses its leaders this way — and ""chooses"" is maybe too strong a word for such ademocratized, organic, and sometimes hereditary process — will end up with a decidedly mixed bag. Someare""good and faithful servants."" Yethuckstersandshameless partisan stake advantage, and the most well-intentioned leaders may become corrupt without institutional and spiritual safeguards. Falwell isis hardly the first scandal of evangelical celebrity. He is not even the first prominent evangelical to be involved in a financial and sexual scandal involving two men, one woman, and an accusation of blackmail. That dishonor,Silliman notes, goes to tel evangelist Jim Bakker, whose downfall coincided with Falwell is first year of work at Liberty. In a bizarre symmetry, Falwell has now left Liberty under allegations of remarkably similarcircumstances. He seems to have learned no lessons from Bakker is disgrace, but the evangelical movement would do well to learn from his.",1,1,The Week
447,The atrocities in China.,8.67,46.33,https://www.readtangle.com/p/joe-biden-atrocities-in-china,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-11,16,"What should Biden do?Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. We are skipping to day is reader question to give some appropriate space to what is happening in China, the biggest foreign policy story of our time. We have also got a fascinating piece about the future of cities, some updates from yesterday is impeachment trial, and a battle over the future of the Numbers section. Plus, a preview of tomorrow is Friday edition () which you are not going to want to miss. Okay, okay! Quite a few readers wrote yesterday to say they did not want to see the old “Numbers” section go. I appreciate the feedback to the feedback. There is only one way to solve this: democracy. Take the poll below to determine the future of Tangle is beloved Numbers section (and please only take it once, you scoundrels!)Vote on Numbers section future!China. More specifically, what Joe Biden is engagement plan is. Last night, President Biden spoke to President Xi Jinping for the first time since the election. The conversation was reportedly frosty, with Biden raising concerns about China is human rights violations. He also offered to “cooperate on global priorities of mutual interest,” according to a summary of the call released by the White House. A quick primer on the biggest issues:This is the most volatile story in China right now. Before former President Trump left office, his administration declared that China had committed genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, a desert and mountainous region in northwest China where many ethnic minorities and Muslims live. For the last several years, reporters across the world have documented the Chinese government is systematic rounding up and detention of Muslims. China insists that these “camps” are “vocational,” and exist to helps tamp out extremism amongst the Uighur population. It has even claimed that detainees were set free. Butsatellite image evidence, firsthand accounts, investigative reporting, and a recent BBC article tell a different story: not only have more than a million Muslims been detained, but many are also being tortured, raped or killed. There have been reports of forced labor, shock therapy, and women being sterilized as well. Since 1997, Hong Kong and China have operated under a “one country, two systems” rule of law. Hong Kong has embraced a democratic political system, capitalism, and has seen its own trade and political system thrive with freedom from the Chinese state. Over the last two years, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Konghave been fighting off mainland China isencroaching power. In June, anew security law was passed without Hong Kong is approval that gave China the authority to crush dissent and curtail freedom of speech. Things have gotten worse recently. An estimate done million Hong Kongers are fleeing the territory (its total population was 7.5 million) to emigrate elsewhere. Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy media tycoon who ran the Apple Daily newspaper, is in jail on trumped-up charges. So is Wu Chi-wai, a politician and former leader of an opposition party. 55 more activists and ex-lawmakers were arrested for “foreign collusion” in January, in one of the most shocking round-ups in Hong Kong yet. China sees Taiwan as a rebellious province that broke away from its central rule. Taiwan is enjoying a form of independence. Like Hong Kong, Taiwan was offered a “one country, two systems rule” arrangement in the 1980s,but rejected it. Since the early 2000s, Taiwanese leaders have taken different approaches to China: some moved toward total independence while others moved toward strengthening economic relations with mainland China. Tsai Ing-wen, the current Taiwanese leader, wants to move toward independence. Taiwan is concerned that what is unfolding in Hong Kong is coming to them next, and has good reason to believe that. Complicating all these issues is the coronavirus, which scientists believe originated in Wuhan. Chinese authorities covered up the dangers of the virus and failed to properly alert global health officials of the threat. Now, outside scientists are still trying to get to the bottom of how coronavirus started — while global leaders want to hold China accountable somehow. There is also trade to consider: the “Made in China” stamp on all those things you own is no insignificant matter. The US has deep economic ties to China, and China is strengthening its ties to our European allies as well. It has also expanded economic relations in southeast Asia and military operations in the South China Sea. Finally, it seems worth noting, 1.39 billion people live in China. Many of them are living normal, familiar lives. And hundreds of thousands of them are American ex pats living, studying and working abroad. While the Chinese government executes its crackdown in places like Hong Kong or continues its detention of Muslims in Xinjiang, it is worth remembering that for many Chinese citizens life is (post-coronavirus) getting back to normal. In sum: the re is a lot going on here. All of which is worth considering as we focus on how the US should handle its relationship with China going forward. Today is main focus, though, is the human rights crisis in Xinjiang. There is quite a bit of common ground on the issue of China. While Republicans are generally considered more “hawkish,” and have made a tough stance on China core to their political philosophy, China is human rights violations have inspired bipartisan condemnation. The right wants Biden to take a hard line on China and is hoping he does not fall into the trap of leaning on international organizations, which have failed in the past. The Washington Examiner editorial board panned Bidenfor returning America to the UN Human Rights Council, saying that the court is chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, has a moral compass that “starts to malfunction as soon as the subject arises of China is genocide against the Uighur peoples of Xinjiang province.”“Bensouda turns a blind eye to the most egregious breaches of international humanitarian law anywhere on Earth and disregards her own precedent to do so,” they wrote. “This was exposed in December, when Bensouda sought to explain her decision not to exert ICC (International Criminal Court) authority over China is abuses of Uighurs. She had claimed in an earlier ruling that the ICC had the authority to investigate Myanmar is mistreatment of its Rohingya ethnic minority, even though Myanmar is not an ICC signatory. This is because, she asserted, elements of Myanmar is criminality occurred in the form of Rohingya refugees on Bangladeshi soil. Because Bangladesh is an ICC signatory, a legal cause of action against Myanmar could be established.“But in December, she responded to a legal petition by Uighurs extirpated from Tajikistan to China,” they wrote. “The filers sought to hold Bensouda to her own precedent, and they should have succeeded, but Bensouda claimed that there was insufficient evidence to investigate China. She is a fraud and a liar. More than 2 million innocent Uighurs have been imprisoned, forcibly sterilized, used as slave labor,sold for rape, murdered, and had their identity systematically shredded. Bensouda refuses to see any of this. In contrast, facing democracies, Bensouda rushes to the ramparts… The Biden administration should not tolerate such outrageous absurdity from the ICC and the UN Human Rights Council. To do so undermines the credibility of serious multilateral ventures and reinforces the idea that America is the dupe of international institutions.”In a January op-ed, Olivia Enos wrote that the “Trump administration took several important steps” like sanctioning Chinese Communist Party leaders and other entities responsible for carrying out human rights violations.“The administration has also prioritized stopping goods produced with forced labor in Xinjiang from entering the US market,” she wrote. “Last week, US Customs and Border Protection expanded its withhold release orders to all cotton and tomatoes produced in Xinjiang, effectively banning them from US markets. Next steps can and should include extending priority-2 refugee status to Uighurs, continuing to combat and upping the ante on efforts to combat forced labor, and identifying additional individuals and entities in the Chinese Communist Party ripe for sanctioning.”The left is also calling for a tough stance against China, though it has more faith in the international institutions to carry out any punishments than the right. The Washington Post editorial board sayst he latest BBC report makes the record of Chinese atrocities in Xinjiang “a lot worse.”“Initial accounts of the prison-like camps in the Xinjiang region where China has detained 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs described how the inmates were forced to renounce Muslim customs, memorize propaganda songs and learn Chinese,” the board wrote. “Then more troubling stories reached the West — of beatings, sterilizations of women and forced labor. Now, the BBC has produced as hocking new report about the systematic rape and torture of women in the camps, based on on-the-record accounts of survivors. The reported atrocities underline the need for a coordinated international response to what the USs has rightly called a campaign of genocide.“International reaction to this attempt to effectively wipe out an ethnic minority has been slowly growing but still falls well short of what it should be,” the board said. “In its final days, the Trump administration declared that the regime of Xi Jinping was committing genocide, and it banned some imports from Xinjiang. The Biden administration is new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that he agrees with the genocide designation. The European Union has offered little more than rhetoric— and some Muslim states have remained silent. They ought to be joining the USs in demanding investigations by the UN of the alleged rapes, torture and other abuses.”In The Los Angeles Times,Minky Worden pointed to the 2022 Winter Olympics— set to be held in Beijing — as an opportunity already under way to force China is hand.“Last week,a resolution was introduced in the US Senatecalling on the IOC to take the 2022 Games away from China unless the country ‘addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights,’” she wrote. “More than 180 human rights organizations have also called for a boycott of the Games, and for the first time since the 1980s, European countries are considering pulling out of an Olympics.“The IOC often says the Olympics are ‘a force for good,’ but in the nearly six years since the Winter Olympics were awarded to China, Chinese officials have only escalated their abuses across the country,” Worden wrote. “The Chinese government has dismantled nascent civil society groups, targeted labor rights activists, deepened repression of Xinjiang and Tibet and taken apart fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong… There is so much more the IOC could be doing if it truly wants to be a ‘force for good’ in China. Although Beijing was awarded the Winter Olympics before the new human rights language was adopted, ‘operational requirements’ included in the host city contract since the n allow the IOC to negotiate for human rights protections and standards with Beijing.“Using this leverage, the IOC should immediately conduct effective due diligence to prevent human rights abuses that may be directly linked to the Olympics, its products or services.”What can we say? A global power is systematically torturing, raping, sterilizing, brainwashing and killing its own citizens for the crime of having a religion. The entire world is watching, and nobody has done anything. The UN’ Human Rights Councilis to othless and hypocritical,carving out time every year to condemn Israel for its treatment of Palestinians but incapable of adopting a single resolution to wield its influence on China. The only conclusion to draw is that the Trump administration was right: China holds far too much power over the global organizations that are supposed to be acting as impartial referees. At the same time, Trump is oscillating praise for Xi, with intermittent tough talk in an effort to land a trade deal, got us nothing. The Trump administration had no consistent diplomacy and after four years of chest thumping on China, look where we are: China has deepened its trade relationships throughout Asia and Europe with two significant trade deals, regained its militarized control over Hong Kong, expanded its reach in the South China sea, and brazenly built concentration camps for over a million of its own citizens. The Trump administration is final months saw the kinds of sanctions and crackdowns we needed more of, but it came after three years of Trump alternately heaping praise and leveling tariffs on China in an effort to land a trade deal he never got. And Biden is historical record is not much better. Lest we forget, Xi came to power in 2013. Biden and Xi were counterparts at the time — both the Number 2 is in their respective countries, and Biden has said he spent more time with Xi than any other world leader. One might think that much time in diplomacy would result in Xi being a more moderate, US-friendly leader. Instead, when Xi took power at the beginning of Obama is second term, he immediately instituted a political crackdown, the n began expanding China is power and its abhorrent human rights violations, continuing to the present day. Now, coming full circle, Biden himself has risen to the presidency and has suddenly become our hope to step back in and fix it. It is tough to put into words how nauseating this whole thing is, primarily because I have no idea how we get out of it. Perhaps our inability to rein China in is proof thatit is the real number one global power already. These are the kinds of issues that make me glad I am not the president. But I do know that — as a moral imperative and given our position as the purported most powerful nation on earth — it is unacceptable to allow what is happening to go on. Yes, we should force the UN is Human Rights Council to do its job. Yes, we should pressure the IOC to pull the Olympics from Beijing (an event that will only enhance its image amidst its worst human rights violations yet). Yes, we should sanction every CCP leader possible. Yes, we should do our best to damage China economically. Short of an actual shooting war, we should throw the kitchen sink at the Chinese government. What other option is there? There is no alternative, from a moral perspective, and there should not be. Biden is diplomats are still figuring out the passwords to their government computers, and the re is a long way to go before we know how his administration will address this. But the re is little doubt it will be the single biggest foreign policy story of the next four years.

Cities across the US are moving to replace their legacy street lights with smart LED bulbs and lamp posts that can monitor air quality, announce an open parking spot or tell you about an incoming rainstorm. Replacing traditional street lights, which use high energy halogen bulbs, has been a major priority for cities going green. The LED bulbs use far less energy and last longer. And now, the opportunity to replace those street lights is also opening the door for futuristic tech that could help revolutionize cities. After years of empty hype around these kinds of innovations, street lights are becoming a go-to target for “smart cities.”Axios is Jennifer Kingson has the story.

As the Washington Post is Dave Weigel put it, “the partisan gap is absolutely insane.” Despite that, Biden is overall approval rating is higher at this point than it was for Trump, and higher than Trump is approval rating was at any time during his presidency, largely because he is doing 21 points better amongst independents.

That is his perspective on the tearing down of statues such as Ulysses S Grant, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. Protesters have vandalized and attempted to topple statues in the weeks since the May 25 death of George Floyd. Lee says peace is a more effective plan than violence, and even introduced a resolution condemning mob violence, which was rejected by the Senate. He joins The Daily Signal Podcast to discuss. We also cover these stories:“The Daily Signal Podcast” is available onRicochet,Apple Podcasts,Pippa,Google Play, andStitcher. All of our pod casts can be found atDailySignal.com/podcasts. If you like what you hear, please leave a review. You can also leave us a message at 202-608-6205 or write us atletters@dailysignal.com. Enjoy the show!Thank you. Well, my message to those trying to tear down any statue anywhere is stop. Mob violence just is not the answer in a civil society, and it certainly should not be in ours. Now, look, if New York City wants to take down a statue of Christopher Columbus on New York City property, or any other statue for that matter, the people of New York have every right to do so, but they should do it peacefully and through the process set up by their system of government, through their elected officials and not through mob violence. That is one of the reasons why I introduced a resolution in the Senate earlier this month condemning mob violence, because some Black Lives Matter rioters shot one of my constituents in Provo, Utah—average ordinary man just driving home, minding his own business, when Black Lives Matter rioters were blocking the street, surrounded his car, and they shot him. This was a problem and it is unacceptable. All I asked was for Senate Democrats to condemn mob violence, and they refused. Well, it needs to be condemned and has not been condemned. One of the reasons why it has not been condemned is that we have got a lot of people in America who seem to be applauding it. Many of those same people are being funded by our government. That is why I think we need to start de funding those who hate America because they are hating America on America is dime. Colleges that punish free speech and discriminate against conservative viewpoints and religious students should not get federal funding. City councils who de fund their police departments and who refuse to protect public safety should not get federal grants. School districts that embrace the ahistorical nonsense of the 1619 Project should not get federal education spending. None of these organizations should get a single dime of taxpayer dollars while they are effectively backing some of these things. It is a problem. Well, every city that is given into the demands of the Black Lives Matter movement has seen violence go up in their city. Murders are up in New York City. Murders are up in Minneapolis. Murders are up in Atlanta and in Seattle. You ca not improve public safety by de funding the police. We need the police. The police stop crime. The tragic part is that the poorest communities, those that suffer the most from the violence caused by the Black Lives Matter movement, those are the people in the communities who need the police the most. Now, that does not mean that there are not problems that need to be addressed. There certainly are, but it does mean that the answer cannot be and certainly is not simply getting rid of the police. That does not make any sense. You know, there are a lot of explanations for that. There are a lot of reasons that have contributed to that. I think you can point to a breakdown of the family as the fundamental unit of society. I think you can point to sometimes difficult to follow and difficult to trace lines of accountability. Law enforcement used to be primarily, if not exclusively, the domain of local officers who reported to local elected officials, and the more we have mixed state, local, and federal law enforcement funding, the blurrier those lines have become. As a result of that, we have seen a proliferation of laws and we have seen different law enforcement styles that sometimes have aggravated the problem. The introduction of drugs and the acceptance of drug culture certainly has not helped in any of this, but we are in the situation in which we now find ourselves. We have to address it. There are a number of ways that we can handle it. I think all of those approaches need to take into account: efforts to strengthen, not weaken, families; to strengthen, not weaken, the role [of] parents; to strengthen, not weaken, the resources available to police; while at the same time reforming standards of law enforcement personnel to make sure that officers who do go rogue are held accountable. One of the things that is so unfortunate about what happened to George Floyd is that the officer who killed him had been subject to 17 formal misconduct complaints against him, and yet he was never held accountable for any of those. Had he been formally disciplined for any one of those complaints, George Floyd would probably be alive today. That is truly tragic, and I think that is one of the reasons why we need a wake-up call for making sure that we do not have police and other public employee unions effectively insulating police officers who have engaged in repeated acts of misconduct from any kind of disciplinary action. There certainly has been some private property damage. There have been people who have felt like they ca not go outside, who have felt like they have become prisoners in their own homes. You have had people whose automobiles have been vandalized or in some cases even destroyed. Now, we are fortunate in my state. We have not had it nearly the same level that you have seen it in some other cities, including places like Minneapolis, and like Seattle, and like Portland, but you have seen a lot of people feeling like they have lost their sense of community and their sense of hope and faith in their community to operate in a place where mutual respect, and peace, and tolerance, and acceptance can pervade each community from one end to the other. That really is a tragic loss, and it is something that people feel very deeply. I think Congress most of the time is not the owner of the statue. As I have said in the past, look, if someone owns a statue, if it is their own personal private property, that person has the right to do anything with this statue they want. Most of the time they are not going to decide to destroy it, but if they want to, they can certainly do that. But it is not up to a third party to make that decision for them. By the same token, if it is owned by a corporation, a corporate governance structure is going to decide who has the decision-making power over that statue. If, on the other hand, the statue was owned by the public, the n whatever government owns it has the power to make and dispose of that. Most of the statues in this country, in so far as they are publicly owned, are probably owned by state and municipal governments and not by the federal government. Those statues that are federally owned ultimately are subject to disposal or disposition only insofar as an act of Congress authorizes that, where only insofar as a previous act of Congress has authorized particular executive branch officials. I think there will continue to be reviews from time to time within Congress of what the policies should be and who should have the decision-making power, but in no circumstance should we just hand this over to whatever group of people decides to engage in lawless activity on a particular day and say, “If you feel strongly about something, you can take a statue that belongs to the American people and destroy it on your own initiative based on your own rage at the moment.” That is never acceptable. Absolutely. Look, I wrote a book a few years ago that touches on some of these points. It is called “Written Out of History.” It explains the dynamic that occurs when we see history being written by the victors, and it almost always is. Our history books reflect the world view of those who won certain conflicts. For example, our look back on the American Revolution tends overall to take the view that it was a good thing that we defeated England in the Revolutionary War, and other viewpoints sometimes get suppressed in the process. It is important, just the same, to go back and review historical texts on any to pic, on any significant decision, and make sure that we understand both viewpoints. So, as it relates to your specific question and statues, if we tear down every statue of every person whose viewpoints and whose behavior was not always ideal, was not always perfect, or was not always acceptable according to our modern worldview, we are going to have very few statues to begin with, but we are also not going to know about many of the historical figures who, for better or for worse, shaped who we are and how we got here. I think it is a good idea, generally speaking, to have more of a knowledge of more historical figures in our country than it is to have less. I think the single most upsetting aspect of it, other than what I think everyone would agree is the most upsetting part of that, is the loss of human life and the danger to life and limb, once you take it beyond that aspect of this violence, which is the most obvious and widely agreed upon consequence. If you are looking at the most troubling secondary feature, I would probably say it is that you have got people who consider the mselves and are considered by society to be part of polite society, polite, educated society, the educational and corporate establishment of the USs and many government officials who seem to be just fine with this violence and in many cases are defending it, in many cases are applauding it, at least to the degree that they are saying, “These people make some really good points, and I applaud them for showing how strongly they feel.”Now, look, it is fine to accept the fact that there are legitimate viewpoints at play, and it is fine to say that those people who are rioting have a right peaceably to demonstrate, but insofar as anyone in polite society is suggesting that the mob violence is in any way, shape, or form acceptable is what I find so incredibly disturbing and disheartening. We need to have a series of conversations as Americans not just in halls of government, in seats of power, but around the family dinner table, with our friends, our family, our co-workers, our neighbors, even those that we do not know as well, and we need to start coming together around the fact that regardless of where we might disagree, we should all agree on the fact that mob violence is never acceptable. It is one of the reasons why I have found the rejection of my resolution two weeks ago so incredibly disturbing. My message to those who still would like to tear down monuments and engage in mob violence is that we today live in the greatest civilization the world has ever known. We live in a country that while imperfect, because it consists of human beings, has done more to elevate the human condition, has brought more people out of poverty, has educated more people than any other civilization that I know much about. It is a country that, while imperfect, has a form of government that was put in place in the Age of Enlightenment and based on principles that, while not universally consistently followed, are the mselves inspiring. The idea upon which America is founded was and is good. Insofar as we can unite behind those principles and respect each other is decency, and dignity, and right to live and exist, we will be much better off. Peace is a much better path than violence. Accept peace and let is move forward. Thank you very much.",1,0,Daily Signal
449,Meharry students eligible for scholarship of up to $100K funded by $34M Bloomberg donation,-7.67,45.0,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/09/03/bloomberg-scholarships-black-students-meharry-nashville/5701314002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tennessean-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,20,"Bloomberg Philanthropies will donate $34 million to fund scholarships of up to $100,000 for most Blacks student at Meharry Medical College as part of a nationwide effort to bolster the ranks of Black doctors in America. The scholarships should be enough to wipe out about one third to half of the debt for the average Meharry student, said college President Dr. James Hildreth. Hildreth revealed the scholarships during a Thursday morning video conference with Meharry students, describing the donation as a rare reward in the often-underappreciated mission of minority health. The announcement was met with cheers and dumbstruck applause.""Most days we know the odds of realizing systemic change in health care, which favors the wealthy over the poor, are long and yet we labor on battling those odds,"" Hildreth said. ""But to day, Meharrians, is not one of those days.""Meharry initially announced the scholarships would be available to all students, but officials quickly rolled back this statement. Because the Bloomberg Philanthropies donation is intended to foster Black doctors, the scholarships will be exclusive to Black students, Hildreth said. The scholarships are also only available to students who have been deemed in financial need and are already receiving monetary aid. Most, but not all, Meharry students will qualify. The donation, the largest in Meharry is history, is part of $100 million given to historically Black medical colleges and universities Bloomberg Philanthropies,the charitable organization of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York and presidential candidate. Donations were also made to Howard University, Morehouse School of Medicine and Charles R Drew University. Bloomberg addressed Meharry students Thursday morning in a brief video statement, saying “more Black doctors will mean more Black lives saved.”The donations are intended to combat a systemic inequality in American health. Research shows Black people generally have better health outcomes when treated by Black doctors, who are also more likely to practice in under served communities, according to a news release from Bloomberg Philanthropies. And yet, Black doctors are in short supply: Black people account for about 13% of the USs population, but only 7% of percent of medical school graduates are black. Black babies are more likely to survive when cared for by Black doctorsHildreth said the college would spend the next few weeks setting up a process for assessing the level of need of Meharry students to determine how much funding they qualify to receive. Most students should be eligible for the full amount of $100,000, and the money will be paid directly to their lenders to reduce their debt, he said. Students do not need to take any action at this time. Meharry, founded in Nashville in 1876, is one the largest and few historically Black medical schools in the nation. The college prides itself on educating medical professionals who go on to care for under served minority communities.“As far as I am concerned, today is the dawn of a new day for the future of minority health,” Hildreth said during the announcement.",2,2,Tennessean

Thebill,a draft of which the House Ways and Means Committee released Monday, would fully subsidize ObamaCare subsidies for people earning up to 150% of the federal poverty level and unemployed individuals. The measure would also make Americans earning more than 400% of the poverty level — about $51,000 for one person, and $106,000 for a family of four — eligible for subsidies for the first time and would cap their premium costs at 8.5%. The subsidy boosts, which Democrats have sought for years, would only last for two years, through 2022.

Still, Levitt noted this is ""not a permanent solution"" since the subsidies last for just two years, and said that ""many people will still find premiums and deductibles unaffordable, likely leaving tens of millions uninsured.""The provisions are part of a broader relief bill that is expected to cost around $2 trillion and includes a third $1,400 stimulus check, expanded unemployment benefits at $400 a week and $160 billion for vaccine distribution. House Democrats plan to pass the bill using a procedural tool known as budget reconciliation, which will allow them to approve it with their slimmest-possible Senate majority. Senate Democrats have not released their version of the bill yet. Lawmakers are eyeing a March 14 deadline to approve the package, because that is when supplemental unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans. ",2,1,Fox Business
451,Progressive Democrats See Opportunities in GOP-Held Districts,-5.0,45.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/progressive-democrats-see-opportunities-in-gop-held-districts/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,17,"Progressive Democrats in Congress are optimistic that the handful of allied candidates running competitively in Republican-held districts can help advance their legislative agenda next year. A favorable national political environment may push them to victory and expand the party is House majority. But progressives see their potential success in swing districts as an indication that liberal policies can gain momentum among the mainstream. Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-ChairPramila Jayapal(D-Wash.), who also co-chairs the group is political arm, said voters can see the appeal of progressive ideas because they are seeking change from the status quo.“Donald Trump in many ways highlighted all the things that were wrong before by taking some things to a whole new level,” she said. “And the n COVID really highlighted how unequal we were to start with.”In 2018, as more liberal candidates such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez(D-NY) won safe seats, moderates helped Democrats take control of the House. Many have since distanced the mselves from their progressive colleagues. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden publicly rejected progressive-backed proposals including “Medicare for All” and the Green New Deal. But progressives say despite the conventional wisdom, embracing such policies are not a death knell among independent voters. Dana Balter, the Democrat challenging Representative John Katko(R) in New York is 24th District, said voters are realizing the issues they care about are the same ones progressives champion.“We are running against candidates who are trying to paint us as out of touch with the mainstream, but nothing could be further from the truth,” Balter said at a recent virtual event hosted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.“The most effective way to get voters out to is re-frame the conversation to remind them that our priorities are their priorities,” she added. Progressive candidates running in races rated as Toss-ups by the Cook Political Report include Balter, Candace Valenzuela in Texas’ open 24th District, and Kara Eastman, who is challenging Representative Don Bacon(R) in Nebraska is 2nd District. Republicans are highlighting their support for liberal proposals, accusing them of glossing over those issues, and contrasting them with the more moderate Biden. Recent Republican ads tag Eastman as a “socialist” and say “she is hiding from her support for socialist policies, like AOC is radical Green New Deal.” Aspotairing against Balter says “we ca not afford her costly liberal agenda.”Other notable progressive candidates are Jon Hoadley in Michigan is 6th District and Mike Siegel in Texas’ 10th, whose races are rated Lean Republican, as well as Pam Keith in Florida is 18th and Julie Oliver in Texas’ 25th. Six of the progressive candidates backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus’ PAC are being supported by the House Democratic campaign arm. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ChairCheri Bustos(D-Ill.) said regardless of ideology, all Democratic candidates tout the importance of health care, an issue that is done well with voters in previous elections.“The common the me is Democrats are the party of health care,” Bustos said. “I would say that is why you can be a progressive candidate in a district that is a tough district or a swing district.”Progressive lawmakers said their legislative agenda has been held back by fears that it could cost Democrats crucial swing seats. That may not change in 2021 if Democrats control Congress and the White House — the president is party historically loses seats in midterms. And Medicare for All and other progressive issues for now lack support among both their more moderate House colleagues and enough Senate Republicans to move legislation through that chamber. But if progressives also came from swing districts, that would give their initiatives more leverage, said Representative Jamie Raskin(D-Md.).“Often times we hear, ‘We ca not do’ you fill in the blank — it might be a $15 minimum wage, it might be strong anti-trust legislation — because of Democrats who are in the most vulnerable swing districts,” he said. If more progressive lawmakers are elected in those districts, Raskin said they will be able to say, “On the contrary, it is precisely because of those people that we have to act forcefully so they can keep their promises.”To contact the reporter on this story:Emily Wilkinsin Washington atewilkins@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Kyle Trygstadatktrygstad@bgov.com;Bennett Rothatbroth@bgov.com",2,2,Bloomberg Government
452,Eugene Cho Named President of Hunger Advocacy Org,6.33,49.67,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/march/eugene-cho-bread-for-world-president-evangelicals-hunger.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-09,25,"Bread for the World, a prominent Christian advocacy group dedicated to ending hunger, has elected Seattle pastor and author Eugene Cho as its new president. It is a dramatic change for Bread, which is well known in Washington for galvanizing religious groups to protect federal policies that help the impoverished. Recent years have seen the group fight to stop proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, and push for more flexibility allowing the government to provide aid for nations in need. Cho will be replacing David Beckmann, a Lutheran minister who is retiring from his post after shepherding the organization since 1991. John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University and chair of Bread is board, described Beckmann as “one of the preeminent Christian leaders of our generation,” but insisted Cho is a new leader for a new era.“(Cho) is a powerful voice in a humble package,” said Carr, who also described Cho as a bridge-builder. “It is a new generation and different set of experiences: A pastor, a builder, somebody who is from the West Coast, and somebody who is not anchored in the traditional network of denominations. He emerged as the right leader for Bread at the right time.”Cho, who is ordained within the Evangelical Covenant Church, achieved acclaim after he and his wife, Minhee, founded Quest Church in Seattle in 2001. He served there for 18 years before stepping down in 2018and also founded One Day is Wages, a nonprofit organization dedicated to alleviating extreme global poverty.“If the re is something that is concerned me about how the larger umbrella of evangelicalism engages justice work, (it is) that they see it as a competitor to evangelism … that is really concerned me,” Cho said. “The great commission is not a competitor to the great commandment.”Cho said he also plans to draw upon his experience as an immigrant in his new role. Born in Seoul, South Korea, he grew up listening to his parents tell stories of hardships they endured while living in what is now North Korea.“Every now and the n my father shares some stories that it is hard for me to believe—stories like having to pull up grass from the ground to satisfy hunger pains,” he told RNS Cho also has had first-hand encounters with policies that help those who have fallen on hard times. When he found himself unemployed 20 years ago, it was Washington is Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program—a state initiative similar to the federal SNAP program—that helped his family stay afloat.“We have experienced it on a personal level and want to make sure we are advocating for the programs within our government—both at the local and national level—that can really come alongside those who are vulnerable,” he said. Carr said Cho is experiences are different from Beckmann is but in ways he believes will prove helpful as Bread strives to maintain its status as a bipartisan organization.“This is somebody who is built a local church and served people in a pastoral way,” said Carr. “He is not your typical church bureaucrat—and I can say that, because I am a former church bureaucrat.”Cho insists he is not blind to the challenges of working to influence lawmakers on Capitol Hill, particularly in an era marked by partisan rift. He pointed to his new book,, as evidence of his belief in the importance of bipartisan work—even if some dismiss him as “naive.”As a Christian organization, he said, Bread is religious roots are “one of the unique things” it brings to the work of political bridge-building, including the “importance of prayer and of spiritual intervention.“We want to pray for our leaders that we might disagree with, that might have views that are contrary to the things that we believe are so important,” he said. “We are living in these incredibly divisive times, and maybe in the most minute way I would love for Bread for the World—and even in a more minute way, my work—to be a small little brick among the many, many bricks that need to be built in the coming years and decades that turn the tide of the toxic politics.”",2,1,Christianity Today

The journey is often risky, and birds undergo harsh weather patterns—from storms that can throw them off course to dry arid landscapes that provide little to no food resources. A new study published this week infound tens of millions of birds depend on the river and wetland habitats weaved within the Colorado River Delta and California is Central Valley while they make their journey across the dry western landscapes, reports Corryn Wetzel forAudubon. These two regions were suspected as essential stopover sites by ornithologists in the past. But not enough evidence supported this idea until data collected from the community science appeBirdshowed otherwise. eBird is an app where anyone from seasoned birders to casual novices can note when and where they saw a bird species. Scientists use the data collected from eBird to track species populations, spot trends, and trace habitat use. Using eBird along with a mathematical model created byPartners in Flight, the researchers determined that more than 65 million birds travel through California is Central Valley during the spring migration and 48 million during the fall, reports. About 17 million birds pass through the Colorado River Delta, an area approximately the size of Hawai’i, during the spring, and 14 million birds pass through during fall migration. The eBird data was narrowed down to 112 species of birds that researchers knew used the regions knew used the regions during migration. A significant portion of a bird species’ entire population flies through these Western regions. The data found that in the spring, more than 27 percent of North America is tree swallows migrate through the Colorado River Delta, and an astonishing 80 percent of Lawrence is goldfinches migrate through the Central Valley, according to aNational Audubon Societystatement. In fall, nearly 40 percent of Anna is hummingbirds migrate through the Central Valley.“If more than one percent of the species population uses that site, the n we know that that site is really important to that species at the population level,” says Williams DeLuca, a migration ecologist and lead author of the study, to. The Delta and Valley, while crucial to various species of birds, has been altered in the past by human development, agricultural expansion, and diverted river flow. The changes in the ecosystem have birds under extra strain from the already challenging journey, but the data shows that despite the alterations, the birds continue to depend on these landscapes’ reports,.“These migratory pathways are ingrained in birds, and they are sort of still following them even though the re is a fraction of the landscape available that used to be the re,” Andrea Jones, director of bird conservation for Audubon California and co-author of the study, tells. Deluca and his team hope that the data will inspire conservation efforts for these habitats before the bird species are pushed to their limits.

454,Minnesota Law School Students Aim to ‘Cancel’ Alumna Representative Fischbach,7.0,42.0,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/01/14/minnesota-law-school-students-aim-to-cancel-alumna-rep-fischbach/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,25,"Some students at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, are asking the school is administration to ban an alumna and newly elected congresswoman because of her stance on voter fraud and support for President Donald Trump.“Representative Michelle Fischbach (MN-8), an alumna of one of Mitchell Hamline is predecessor institutions, directly contributed to the fomentation that led to the siege of the Capitol. First and foremost, by claiming on Fox News, without evidence, that the Democratic Party manufactured votes,” reads the petition, addressed to the school is president and dean, Anthony Niedwiecki. The petition incorrectly placed Fischbach in Minnesota is 8th Congressional District. She actually represents the 7th District. Fischbach graduated from what is now the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in2011and for a short time was the state is lieutenant governor before being elected to Congress on November 3. She defeated 15-term Democratic Representative Collin Peterson and took office on January 3. The students’ letter also says that Fischbach “has still refused to acknowledge that the [president], his supporters, white supremacists, and the Republican [Party] provoked these seditious acts through their lies about the election.”It also faults Fischbach for not speaking out against the breaching of the Capitol on January 6, adding, “Furthermore, Representative Fischbach has not even acknowledged that the [president is] supporters were involved in the attack.”In a statement provided to The Daily Signal, Fischbach said, “This is nothing more than a partisan distraction, from Democrats trying to ‘cancel’ every person with whom they disagree.”She added that “my only focus right now is representing the people of Minnesota is 7th Congressional District—the job I was elected to do.”The petition to punish Fischbach, dated January 10, which Mitchell Hamline student Ben Mueller shared with The Daily Signal, had received 35 signatures as of Wednesday. On its website, the school says it has “more than 1,100 students pursuing a [law degree].”Mueller opposes the anti-Fischbach campaign. The petition is asking that the school “publicly condemn Representative Fischbach is continued lies about the election that fomented this insurrection.” It also urges the school to “remove any references to Representative Fischbach from the Mitchell Hamline web site … [and] permanently ban Representative Fischbach from our campus and any school-sponsored event.”Mueller said he finds the campaign to censor Fischbach and to airbrush her out of the school is history disturbing.“I was concerned, because with everything that is been going on with the censoring, with Twitter … banning the president is account in reality, and Facebook and Instagram doing the same, it is just concerning, because I feel like we have seen cancel culture come to its culmination, or at least it looks that way, to the point where … even the president of the USs can be canceled,” he said.",1,0,Daily Signal
455,This is the age group most affected by the COVID crisis,-0.25,49.5,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-age-group-most-affected-by-the-covid-crisis-2020-07-28,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,25,"The coronavirus crisis is affecting all age groups, but one in particular is suffering from all aspects of life. Their health and leisure have not been safe, and neither have their jobs. Workers 65 and older saw a steep rise in unemployment claims — from 3% in January to 11% in June, according to a report from United Income, an automated investment service owned by Capital One. The firm analyzed the Current Population Survey, a monthly survey from the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the senior population represents only 7% of the overall workforce, any job loss could drastically alter their nest egg and retirement security if they are not otherwise prepared. Unemployment is just one of the many ways in which the coronavirus has upended the comfort of older Americans. This age group has been warned since the beginning of the pandemic that they are most at risk of complications if they contract the coronavirus, and they have seen their demographic make up a significant portion ofCOVID-related deaths across the country. Much of their entertainment and leisure has also been curtailed. Some have been cutoff entirely from visits with their loved ones. Be on the lookout for COVID-19 is hidden cost toolder peopleSome seniors have been harder hit by the crisis than others. Unemployment claims for workers 65 and older with lower earnings (defined as less than $50,000 a year) jumped from 8% in January to 17% in June. Comparatively, seniors who earned $100,000 or more a year saw an increase of only 4 percentage points, from 1% to 5% during the same time frame. The percentage of senior workers in each sector of the economy is relatively consistent, the report found. Across the 10 supersectors, including education and trade, the number of workers in retirement age is roughly between 5% and 15%, according to the report. The number of layoffs in these sectors, however, has been inconsistent. The leisure and hospitality sector had the largest spike in unemployment — 21 percentage points. Construction held strong during the crisis, with only an increase of 1 percentage point. In this COVID climate, should I just retire?Seniors without a college degree also saw a disproportionate disadvantage. These workers had unemployment rise from 3% in January to 12% in June. Alternatively, seniors with a college degree saw a slightly lower uptick, from 3% to 9%. The somewhat good news: workers between the ages of 55 and 64 years old have seen the smallest climb in unemployment between January to June, from 3% to 9%. The overall bad news: the state of additional unemployment benefits is uncertain after July. As part of the CARES Act, workers affected by the crisis were eligible for an additional $600 a week in unemployment benefits, set to expire July 31. Congress is currently discussing a second stimulus package, but Democrats and Republicans do not agree on how this benefit should be handled. Democrats say the extra $600 a week should be extended until January, while Republicans argue it should be lowered.",2,2,MarketWatch
456,Amazon generates millions of pounds of plastic waste,-3.33,38.0,https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,25,"Amazon is plastic pollution is under scrutiny today with the publication of a new report by the nonprofit ocean advocacy organization Oceana. That report estimates that Amazon was responsible for 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste last year. Amazon says that figure is overblown — by over 350 percent. Amazon claims that it uses about a quarter of Oceana is estimate, according to an email from the company to. If that is the case, the n Amazon still used more than 116 million pounds of plastic packaging in 2019. Amazon did not share what its total plastic footprint was either through a spokesperson or in its most recent sustain ability report published lastSeptember.“Enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows”Oceana still stands by the figures in its report, despite Amazon is objections. “[Amazon] continues to, in response to questions about plastic use, offer anecdotes about packaging weight rather than transparency,” a spokesperson for the organization said in an email to. “Even the low number claimed by the company for its plastic packaging footprint would still be an enormous amount of plastic waste — enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows and to cause very large problems for the oceans.”The characteristic that makes plastic a sought-after packaging material for companies like Amazon happens to also make ita big problem for the world is oceans— it is easy to move because it is so light-weight. That makes it a great material for Amazon is air pillows. It also means that it only takes a ride down a storm drain or a strong gust of wind to push plastic debris into the sea. Once the plastic is at sea, it adds to floating mountains of garbage and frequently winds up in animals’ bellies. In 2019, a whale off the shores of the Philippines was found with88 pounds of plastic in its stomach. And when humans eat fish that have ingestedmicroplasticsleft over from our trash, that plastic can end up in our bellies, too. Oceana is concerned that as more people shop online, a greater share of leftover packaging will end up in the ocean. Since Amazon has not publicly released numbers on its plastic pollution, Oceana tried to track it down itself. “What you do not measure you cannot manage. So we had to estimate this,” says Anne Schroeer, a director of strategic initiatives at Oceana. “Obviously, it would be much better if Amazon would publish their plastic footprint.”“What you do not measure you cannot manage”Oceana used a roundabout way to try to figure out how much plastic waste Amazon creates — which is why the re is such a big discrepancy between its figures and how much plastic Amazon says it actually used. To reach its 465 million pound estimate, the nonprofit gathered data from packaging industry analysts on the amount of plastic packaging used around the world. They the n assumed that Amazon is share of that plastic waste matched its share of the e-commerce market. Using that assumption, Oceana estimated that up to 22 million pounds of Amazon is plastic packaging waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems across the world last year. It based projection on a study published earlier this year that estimated that 11 percent of global plastic waste wound up in aquatic ecosystems. That study, however, is not limited to packaging waste, which makes it difficult to use its data as a way to pinpoint how much plastic pollution Amazon sent to oceans, rivers, and lakes.“We share Oceana is ambition to protect and restore the world is oceans, and we support the reduced use of plastics. However, Oceana has dramatically miscalculated Amazon is use of plastic,” a spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement.“We support the reduced use of plastics”Amazon has taken measures to cut down on how much trash comes from its packages such as sending items in their original packaging rather than boxing them up with more plastic andcardboard. The company says that it is cut more than 900,000 to ns of packaging material since 2015. It also developed a padded paper mailer in 2019 as a recyclable alternative to the plastic packaging the company uses. Although bags and envelopes made out of plastic film can technically be recycled, in reality, a lot of it is probably to ssed away. In most cities, curbside recycling programs do not accept plastic film. Most Amazon customers would need to bring it to a nearby drop-off location that does accept that type of plastic. Oceana surveyed 600 Amazon Prime customers in the US in May, of which less than two percent of shoppers said they made the trek to drop off their used plastic packaging. Historically, only nine percent of the entire world is plastic waste has ever been recycled, according to a2017 study. Oceana believes Amazon can do more to slash its packaging waste, and sees the changes it is made in India as a good example. This June, Amazon India announced that it eliminated single-use plastics in its packaging at its fulfillment centers. The move followed India is goal of phasing out single use plastics by 2022. Amazon also offers “packaging-free” delivery in more than100 Indian cities— items are delivered in original packaging from the manufacturer and orders with multiple items are delivered in reusable to tes. Schroeer is organization is pushing Amazon to bring reusable packaging to more places around the world. “[Amazon has] shown in India how fast they can really take action,” Schroeer says. “We are really confident that they can change quickly.”",1,2,The Verge

458,A Postal Worker Begged for Stronger COVID-19 Protections. She Ended Up Spending Six Weeks in the Hospital.,-0.33,45.33,https://www.propublica.org/article/a-postal-worker-begged-for-stronger-covid-19-protections-she-ended-up-spending-six-weeks-in-the-hospital,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they are published. Last November, just as Minnesota was suffering through a punishing wave of COVID-19, managers at a St. Paul US Postal Service distribution center allowed employees to hold a going-away party in the building. Alejandra Hernandez, a mail handler at that center, was shocked when she saw the gathering: Almost everything about it seemed to violate pandemic safety policies. More than 15 of her colleagues were together in a break room meant for six, chatting, eating and not wearing masks. That day, she filed her second of three complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. “I hoped that someone would come and make them take this seriously,” Hernandez recalled. She was not the only one complaining about problems at the facility — another employee had filed a complaint in July, alleging that workers were not being alerted of potential exposures and the building did not have proper ventilation. Others filed three more complaints in September alleging that the site is sanitation practices, personal protective equipment and quarantine measures were insufficient. The limited response to Hernandez and her colleagues’ appeals for help provides a window into the failures of the Postal Service, one of the country is largest employers, and OSHA, which is supposed to protect workers, in responding to the pandemic. Approximately 55,600 postal workers have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide, and at least 197 have died. In response to the complaints, OSHA conducted two remote inspections, done via phone calls and emails. It found “incidental deficiencies” that did not merit any fines or corrective action. Its report mentioned in passing a problem that was far from incidental for Hernandez and others: Managers were not always notifying workers about possible exposure. According to the USPS’ official count, about 200 of the St. Paul facility is 1,500 employees have fallen sick with COVID-19. But state health department records obtained by ProPublica show that the Postal Service often missed or did not disclose cases. The state tracked clusters of cases linked to the St. Paul building, many of which do not show up in the USPS is count. Hernandez herself became one of those cases in March, when she got COVID-19 and spent six weeks in the hospital. She still struggles to keep her oxygen levels up, and her doctor has instructed her not to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. She reported her illness to management, but no COVID-19 cases show up in daily case counts sent by management to union officials anytime near the day she got sick. The USPS did not respond to a question about the discrepancy. That same month, one of Hernandez is colleagues at the plant died from the virus. Mary Ellen Moore, 62, had worked at the St. Paul plant for 35 years. According to her family, the USPS had not informed her of any possible exposures at work, and she was not aware of any cases in the building. But according to state health department records, there was a cluster of at least 11 cases on her side of the building when she got sick. Only three cases appear in the USPS’ case report to unions. In response to detailed questions from ProPublica, the Postal Service said it put comprehensive policies and practices in place at the start of the pandemic that help ensure the health and well-being of its employees. “We continue to follow the strategies and measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health departments,” spokesperson David Partenheimer wrote in an email. Postal workers have routinely sought help from OSHA during the pandemic, but their complaints have had little effect. Since February of last year, USPS employees across the country have filed more than 1,000 complaints alleging COVID-19-related hazards. Following those complaints, OSHA issued citations for four violations, all of which the Postal Service has contested. The USPS has not been obligated to make changes or pay penalties for any of the reported safety hazards. Postal workers were not alone in seeking help that never came. OSHA has often been absent during the pandemic. The Wall Street Journalidentifiedmore than 500 COVID-19 outbreaks in work places where workers had already warned OSHA of unsafe conditions. A report earlier this year by the Department of Labor is inspector generalcriticizedOSHA is handling of complaints during the pandemic. The watchdog specifically flagged concerns about remote inspections — the kind the government did at the St. Paul distribution center — in which problems “may go unidentified and unabated longer, with employees being more vulnerable to hazardous risk exposure.”OSHA is still investigating possible COVID-19 safety lapses at the USPS in 20 open cases, an agency spokesperson said, and it is possible that it will identify more violations. OSHA has also updated its pandemic enforcement plan to prioritize in-person inspections. “Our goal is to investigate every complaint we receive thoroughly, and our updated enforcement approach better ensures that we are doing that,” the agency said. Hernandez had access to protections and privileges that many US workers do not: She is a union member, a citizen and a federal employee with access to paid sick leave, and she knows she has a legal right to a safe workplace. She and other colleagues used all the channels available to them. But by the time she got sick, she said, she had stopped trying.“The more I kept fighting it, the more it felt like I was just beating a brick wall,” Hernandez said. In high school, Hernandez was suspended for getting in the middle of fights, trying to help other kids who got picked on. “I am not going to sit there and watch kids get beat up,” she said. Now she is 35, with three kids, and she still ca not sit back and not say anything. Hernandez clung to the pandemic guidelines developed by the CDC They were the closest thing she had to instructions on how to survive a pandemic while working alongside 1,500 colleagues. She was especially afraid that she might take the illness home — her sister had just had open heart surgery, her other sister has asthma, her mother is diabetic. On March 19, while she was still waiting to hear back from OSHA about her November and December complaints, she took her son to the doctor for an ear infection. The nurse noticed red patches on his skin that Hernandez thought were an eczema flare-up, but that can actually be a symptom of COVID-19 in children. Hernandez felt like she had a cold. The county health department called the next day — both she and her son had tested positive. She does not know how she contracted the virus, but said that, besides her children, no one she spent time with outside of work tested positive. Hernandez called in sick. That weekend, she started hallucinating, a symptom of her fever and lowered oxygen levels. She has no memories of the next few days, but her kids say she was trying totalk to people who were not actually there. Soon, she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. She woke up in diapers, hooked up to an oxygen machine. Though she called in to the USPS’ absence reporting line the day she got her diagnosis, her case does not appear in daily case totals that district management sends to local union leaders. As ProPublica has previously detailed, the USPShas not consistently told workers when they have been exposed to sick colleagues, or how many cases have been reported in the buildings where they work. Six weeks passed before Hernandez was released. While she was fighting off COVID-19, her 16-year-old daughter and extended family took over caring for Hernandez is 1- and 4-year-old kids. By the time her doctor cleared her for release, she could barely walk half a block without losing her breath. On May 6, days after she came home, OSHA sent her a letter. The agency was responding to the complaint she filed five months earlier, when she reported that the USPS was not always following proper quarantine procedures — someone on her shift who had been sick came back to work even though they were still symptomatic. For the second time, OSHA did a remote inspection and concluded that there was not a problem; the USPS had policies that lined up with CDC guidelines. OSHA did not do inspections following her complaints about mask less parties. Though OSHA has issued safety guidelines pertaining to COVID-19 in the workplace,the recommendationsdo not have the force of law. President Joe Biden promised to issue an emergency standard that would give OSHA more power to enforce COVID-19-specific measures. When the standard came into effect in June, it applied only to health care workers, leaving out other hard-hit industries. When Hernandez came back to work in late May, her colleagues did not know she’d been sick. Rumors had spread that she’d gone on maternity leave. “They actually asked me if I had a baby,” Hernandez said. When she first reported her illness to the USPS, she named five colleagues she’d had contact with to the agency nurse, so that they could be notified and quarantined. When she later checked with her colleagues, the USPS had only contacted and quarantined one of the m, she said. (The USPS said it would not comment on individual cases.)AsProPublicaand the USPS inspector general laterdetailed, the USPS does not have enough health care staff to identify and quarantine every exposed worker. The inspector general also reported that the agency had no strategy to fill those roles. At the time, 21% of the USPS’ nurse positions were vacant. The nurses are responsible for interviewing sick workers, doing contact tracing to identify exposed workers and clearing people to come back to work. On the other side of the building from Hernandez is work area, Moore, a mail clerk, had started feeling sick in early February, a few weeks before Hernandez. Moore told her family she thought it was just the sinus infection and allergies she usually got around this time of yearBut a few days later when she visited her doctor, her breathing was so labored that the doctor had her sent to the hospital in an ambulance. At first, it did not seem like she would be there for long. She and her family stayed in touch with video calls and texts. When her grandson won student of the month for his grades, she celebrated with him over the phone. But her condition worsened. On February 19, she was transferred to the intensive care unit and put on a ventilator soon afterward. As the days went by, Moore used up her sick leave, the n her vacation days. After those ran out, she had to take leave without pay. Once Moore could no longer speak, her older daughter took over calling her USPS supervisor to tell her how to allocate Moore is leave.“My mom literally, up until she could no longer talk, was text ing her supervisor, making sure how to do her time,” said Vanessa Vasquez, Moore is daughter. “She was so worried about me talking to her supervisor, and how to divide her annual and sick leave and no pay.”On March 12, Moore is lungs collapsed. While she was on the ventilator, her two daughters, her grandchildren and her partner of 30 years visited to say goodbye.“We were best friends,” Vasquez said. “We were only 20 years apart. Everybody had different bonds with her.” In an interview over Zoom, Vasquez is 12-year-old son Tony sat with his head in his hands. “She was everything,” he said, before his voice broke. Read MoreThe family tried hard to limit their exposure to COVID-19, avoiding grocery store visits and contact with anyone outside of the family. They were worried about infecting Moore is 87-year-old mother. No one in the family tested positive other than Moore is partner, who did not show symptoms. He works for a PPE engineering company and said his employers always sent alerts when there were COVID-19 cases among workers. There had not been any alerts recently.“I think that if they would have told her she’d been exposed, she would have gotten tested and maybe her outcome would have been different,” her daughter said. “We do not know that, and we will never know that.“Have You Been Injured Working for the US Postal Service?Tell us why postal workers are getting hurt on the job.

Many point out that while politicians and the establishment media was consumed by the impeachment story of President Trump in January, those involved with “War Room: Pandemic” were a leading alarm bell concerning the dangers of the Chinese Coronavirus and the attempted cover up by the Chinese Communist Party.

462,Portland commissioner who wants to defund police gloats after riot squad resigns,3.0,41.0,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9702097/Portland-commissioner-wants-defund-police-gloats-riot-squad-resigns.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-mail-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,25,"APortlandcommissioner who has led efforts to de fund the police - despite calling the cops on a Lyft driver last year - has branded theOregoncity is 50-person riot squad that resigned in protest this week a 'rogue paramilitary organization' and called for the team to be formally disbanded. City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty gloated in a statement on Thursday that the- resignations are a sign that 'the good old boy network is crumbling and we can either be a part of the change or part of the status quo – but the arc of justice is bending quickly and it is imperative that the Portland City Council lands on the right side of history.'All the members of the Portland Police Department is Rapid Response Team, who are tasked with crowd control amid the city is ongoing, often violent protests, abruptly quit on Wednesday in solidarity with a colleague who was indicted on criminal charges for allegedly striking a photographer who was dubbed a protester. Hardesty, who proposed doing away with the crowd-control unit last fall, said her statement that the en masse resignations 'are yet another example of a rogue paramilitary organization that is unaccountable to the elected officials and residents of Portland.'She continued: 'earlier this week, for the first time in Portland is history, an officer from PPB is Rapid Response Team was charged with a misdemeanor for assaulting a photojournalist during a protest last summer. Scroll down for videoPortland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty has called for the police department is Rapid Response Team to be formally disbanded after all its members resigned in protestAll 50 members of the team quit after Officer Corey Budworth was indicted for allegedly striking a photographer during a protest in August 2020. Cops are pictured tackling a rioter in Portland on the same night'Ironically, we now see some PPB officers engaging in the act they showed so much disdain for last summer by staging their own protest.'What to day is action says is that some Portland Police officers believe they are above the law. Hardesty argued that these resignations present an opportunity to show what crowd control looks like without the specialized unit, which she still would like to see formally disbanded by the City Council.'Instead of scrambling to patch up the status quo, I hope Mayor Wheeler and my Council colleagues will see the opportunity I see in front of us to fundamentally rethink community safety for all, including how we respond to protests in the future,' Hardesty wrote. 'Clearly the model of policing we have does not work.'Hardesty sparked a widespread backlash last fall, when amid her efforts to de fund the police she called 911 to report that a ride-share driver had dropped her off at a gas station she claim was closed for the night. Hardesty was returning from a casino in November 2020 when she got into an argument with her Lyft driver over open windows in the car. Portland is entire riot squad has resigned after Officer Corey Budworth (left) was filmed hitting protester Teri Jacobs (right) with a baton last AugustThe driver, Richmond Frost, refused to close the windows due to COVID-19 concerns, cancelled the ride and told Hardesty to get out at a gas station. Hardesty repeatedly claimed the Chevron gas station was closed, but dispatch records later showed it was still open when she called 911. After being branded a hypocrite by some, Hardesty published an open letter to address the incident, in which she continued to insist that the gas station was closed, and that as a well-known black woman who had been receiving death threats, she was afraid for her safety.''That evening I was faced with several threats: a Lyft driver threatening to call 911 on me, and the potential of being stranded alone, late at night by the side of the highway at a closed gas station,' she wrote at the time. 'The possible outcomes of both those situations were not only terrifying, but possibly deadly.'Hardesty, who is the head of Portland is emergency dispatch bureau, previously stated that most 911 calls are unnecessary, and was one of the city is main advocates of a $18million cut to the Portland Police Department. Hardesty, who has been a vocal proponent of police budget cuts, caused a backlash last year after calling 911 on her Lyft driverThe resignations of the Rapid Response Team came a day after the indictment on Tuesday of Officer Corey Budworth for assault during an incident in which he allegedly struck photographer Teri Jacobs in the head with a baton during a riot last August.'Unfortunately, this decorated public servant has been caught in the crossfire of agenda-driven city leaders and a politicized criminal justice system,' the Portland Police Association said in a statement Tuesday. Officers, detectives and sergeants on team voted to resign effective immediately because of a perceived lack of support from City Hall and from the district attorney over the past year, according to the mayor is office and officers.'I do not think it is just an indictment that caused this to happen, I think it is a very long complicated history of things that have gone on over the last 14 months,' Acting Portland Police Chief Chris Davis said. The specialized unit responds to natural or man-made disasters, large-scale searches and, most recently, public order policing or riots. Members of the team are trained in advanced skills related to crowd management, crowd psychology and behavior, team formations and movements, the use of enhanced personal protective equipment, use of force, and de-escalation and arrests. Last summer, when Portland became the epicenter of Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd, the team was on the front lines. Video of the incident involving Jacobs was shared on social media, in which Budworth appears to push the photographer and activist, and the n striking her in the head with his baton. Jacobs says she was attacked despite carrying a press card. She was not charged with any crime, and received a $50,000 settlement from the City of Portland as a result of the baton strike. Cops have continued to insist she was part of a riot which set a government building alight with a petrol bomb. The officers from the Rapid Response Team, which is equipped to handle riots, will remain employed in the Portland Police Department, the PPB said, but would no longer be a part of the team. It is not clear how the resignations would affect the department is effectiveness during riots, with the Oregon city experiencing nightly unrest in its downtown district for the last year.'Under the cover of darkness, a group of 200 demonstrators, many equipped with tactical helmets, faces covered, and armed with a variety of weapons, sparked a night of violence. Multiple dumps ters were set on fire, buildings were defaced, and windows were broken.' the Portland Police Association said, giving its version of the events of August 18 when the assault allegedly occurred. Eventually, the event escalated and was declared a riot. Corey Budworth (second row from front, far left) is pictured with the Portland Police in 2020'After nearly 75 consecutive nights of violence, destruction, and mayhem, a small group of RRT (Rapid Response Team) officers—including Officer Budworth—were again tasked with dealing with the riot,' the description continued. 'Per PPB Command Staff orders, RRT officers cleared the rioters from the area to allow the Fire Bureau to extinguish the blaze. But the rioters were not satisfied.''RRT was again deployed to disperse the crowd and prevent any further violence and criminal activity. A confrontation the n ensued. As RRT officers worked to clear the rioting crowd, Officer Budworth was forcefully knocked to the ground. The crowd grew even more aggressive, prompting other RRT officers to deploy pepper spray and less lethal munitions to try and break up the riot.'The union said an officer the n attempted to arrest one of the rioters, when others began to interfere.'Per his training and in response to the active aggression of a rioter interfering with a lawful arrest, Officer Budworth used baton pushes to move a rioter, now known to be Teri Jacobs, out of the area. As Officer Budworth cleared Ms. Jacobs from the area to stop her criminal activity, Ms. Jacobs fell to the ground,' the union continued.'Reasonably believing that she was getting back up to re-engage in her unlawful activities, Officer Budworth employed one last baton push to try and keep her on the ground, which accidentally struck Ms. Jacobs in the head.'The PPA said Budworth is indictment by Multnomah District Attorney Mike Schmidt ignored the reality of the chaotic situation.'We ask our community to wait for all the facts before passing judgment. We trust in our criminal justice system when the system fairly and objectively applies the rule of law,' the statement continued. 'Once the full picture is revealed, we are confident that justice will prevail, and Officer Budworth will be exonerated of all charges.'Schmidt is office released a statement on Thursday in response to the resignations.'Management and staffing of the Rapid Response Team falls within the purview of the leadership of the Portland Police Bureau. I have confidence that the Bureau will continue their mission to maintain public safety. In the meantime, my office will continue to focus on the fair and just prosecution of criminal matters. We cannot expect the community to trust law enforcement if we hold ourselves to a lower standard.'In addition to the criminal charge against Budworth, Jacobs sued Budworth in September for excessive force, claiming that he,  iswung his truncheon like a baseball bat at Ms. Jacobs, striking her several times,' according to a copy of the suit obtained by theWilamette Week.'As Ms. Jacobs was knocked to the ground, she was terrified that the officer was going to continue to attack her, and she feared that she might never get up again if he continued with his violent attack,' the complaint continued. The city reached a $50,000 settlement, with Jacobs in February, in addition to $11,000 in attorney fees. Schmidt is office said it had learned of Jacob is identity when she filed the suit. Sharing her version of events with KATU in April, Jacobs said: 'I am doing my very best to get to the sidewalk, and it feels like it does not matter where I am, what I do, these police officers are going to run me over, ram into me.'I really was not aware of what was happening or the pain that I was in until I was on the sidewalk, and the n I realized like, whoa, my back, my head, like what just happened there.'She said she was trying to help a friend lying on the road when she was struck, and added that her camera was smashed during the incident. Jacobs Facebook profile includes a photo of a group of black-clad people giving the finger to a passing vehicle that is blurred, in front of a boarded up building. She also shared photos of herself protesting on her Instagram page, captioning one snap: 'This is America. Stop attacking your own people and leave Portland. Remember the oath you to ok, to support and defend the constitution of the USs of America. Feds, go home!'The incident occurred amid sustained protests in the city following the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd. From June through July there were protests virtually every day in the city, with tens of thousands of demonstrators, some of whom identified the mselves as members of ANTIFA More recently, in February around 150 suspected members of the violent anti-fascist group took part in a protest against President Joe Biden is immigration policies, vandalizing several businesses including a Starbucks, Chipotle, Umpqua Bank and Urban Pantry. Last month two groups of radical protesters, who have throughout the past year represented Antifa and other far-left causes, were armed with weapons, body armor, shields and flares and marched throughout parts of the city. The riots came as violent skirmishes occurred worldwide during so-called 'May Day' protests in favor of worker is rights - but that descended into anarchist free-for-alls",1,1,Daily Mail

464,"Tears, politics and money: School boards become battle zones",-2.67,45.0,https://apnews.com/article/health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-school-boards-e41350b7d9e3662d279c2dad287f7009,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"RAPID CITY, SD (AP) — Local school boards around the country are increasingly becoming cauldrons of anger and political division, boiling with disputes over such issues as COVID-19 mask rules, the treatment of transgender students and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America. Meetings that were once orderly, even boring, have turned ugly. School board elections that were once uncontested have drawn slates of candidates galvanized by one issue or another. A June school board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, that dealt with transgender students and the teaching of “critical race theory”became so unruly that one person was arrested for disorderly conduct and another was cited for trespassing. In Rapid City, South Dakota, and Kalispell, Montana, nonpartisan school board races devolved into political warfare as conservative candidates, angered over requirements to wear masks in schools, sought to seize control. In Pennsylvania, a Republican donor is planning to pour $500,000 into school board races.“We are in a culture war,” said Jeff Holbrook, head of Rapid City is Pennington County GOP In South Carolina is Lexington-Richland school system, a new majority of board members upset over pandemic restrictions forced out the superintendent, Christina Melton, who had pushed to keep a mask requirement in place through the end of the academic year. She had been honored just weeks earlier as the state is superintendent of the year. Melton broke into tears at a meeting in June as she offered her resignation. A board member also quit that day, complaining the body decided behind closed doors to force Melton out and avoid a public vote. The board censured the departed member at its next meeting.“Now we are known as the district with the crazy school board,” said Tifani Moore, a mother with three children and a husband who teaches in the district. Moore is running for the empty board seat and promises to tamp down the political split, which she worries has crippled the board.“It is so thick, even the kids feel it,” she said. School boards are typically composed of former educators and parents whose job, at least until recently, mostly consisted of ironing out budgets, discussing the lunch menu or hiring superintendents. But online meetings during the pandemic made it easier for parents to tune in. And the crisis gave new gravity to school board decisions. Parents worried their children were falling behind because of remote learning or clashed over how serious the health risks were.“I saw over and over again frustrated parents, thousands of parents, calling into their board meetings, writing letters and getting no response,” said Clarice Schillinger, a Pennsylvania parent who formed a group called Keeping Kids in School. She recruited nearly 100 parents to run in November for school boards across Pennsylvania. While the group coalesced around pushing for schools to fully open, its candidates have also sought to bar the teaching of critical race theory, which among other things holds that racism is embedded in America is laws and institutionsSchillinger said the group is split 70-30 between Republicans and Democrats. But its priorities are unmistakably conservative. She said it is trying to counter the sway teachers unions have over school boards: “It is really less government — that is what this comes down to.”Paul Martino, a venture capitalist who donates to Republican candidates and pledged a half-million dollars to the movement and the creation of a statewide political action committee, said the new PAC will support candidates committed to keeping schools open no matter what, “even if there is the dreaded fall COVID surge.”Conservative slates of candidates elsewhere across the country have also set their sights on school boards. In Rapid City, four recently elected school board members will hold a controlling vote on the seven-member body, which oversees the education of roughly 14,000 students. In an area where Trump flags still fly, the four candidates for the usually nonpartisan board secured an endorsement in the June election from the local GOP In previous elections, seats on the board were often filled in uncontested elections. But this year, the campaigns turned into political battles, complete with personal attacks. Critical race theory is not a part of the Rapid City school curriculum. But that did not stop candidates from making it a central issue of the campaign.“I believe with all my heart this is how they are going to slip socialism and Marxism into our schools,” newly elected member Deb Baker said at a campaign event. Curt Pochardt, who was unseated as the school board president in the election, said he worries the new partisan dynamic will hurt students’ education.“It does not help kids when the re is tension on a school board,” he said. Education experts warn that school boards are squandering time that could be spent tackling issues such as recruiting teachers, ensuring students have internet access at home or improving opportunities for youngsters with disabilities.“Every time we are not talking about those issues and we are talking about something else that is divisive and it may not be happening at all — or at least not to the level it is being portrayed — is lost opportunity for what we really need to be focused on,” said Chip Slaven, chief advocacy officer for the National School Boards Association. In Kalispell, one losing school board candidate who campaigned against mask mandates made it clear he is not finished.“I am the barbed spine of the jumping cholla cactus,” Sean Pandina told the board in May “I am the cholla in your flesh that you cannot remove. I am comfortable with losing the election because I have latched on and am not going away.”Associated Press reporters Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina and Iris Samuels in Helena, Montana contributed.

465,The Risk of War Between America and China,4.8,49.6,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-13/coming-storms,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-13,17,"Since the closing days of the Cold War, US policymakers, pundits, international relations scholars, and policy analysts have argued that great-power war is a relic of a bygone age. In 1986, the historian John Lewis Gaddis termed the post–World War II era a “Long Peace” because the Soviet Union and the USs had not come to blows. A few years later, the political scientist John Mueller suggested that changing norms had made great-power conflict obsolete. By 2011, the psychologist Steven Pinker was arguing that the Long Peace had morph ed into a “New Peace,” marked by a generalized decrease of violence in human affairs. Of course, as evidenced by ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen, to name a few, there is currently no shortage of organized armed violence involving smaller countries. Still, given the blood-drenched course of politics since the start of the modern international system in the sixteenth century, the absence of war among great powers since 1945 is striking. That does not mean, however, that these kinds of conflicts are off the table. In fact, despite attempts by academics and politicians to write off great-power war as a real threat, the conditions that make it possible still exist. Tensions persist among to day is great powers—above all the USs and China—and any number of flash points could trigger a conflict between them. These two countries are on a collision course fueled by the dynamics of a power transition and their competition for status and prestige, and without a change in direction, war between them in the coming decades is not only possible but probable. Even as geopolitical competition between the USs and China intensifies, most Americans who think seriously about foreign policy and grand strategy refuse to believe that war is likely. This optimism is primarily rooted in several prominent the ories of state behavior. The first is that a high level of economic interdependence between two countries reduces the risk of violent conflict. But history provides many examples to counter this hypothesis. The countries of Europe were never more interdependent—both economically and culturally—than they were just before the outbreak of World War I, and the economies of two of that conflict is main belligerents, the United Kingdom and Germany, were closely linked. And even if the interdependence of the USs and China might theoretically reduce the risk of war between the m, their economic ties have begun to unravel in recent years, as each begins to de couple from the other is economy. Skepticism about the prospect of a great-power war also stems from faith in the strength of nuclear deterrence. The risk of mutual assured destruction from a nuclear war surely played a role in preventing the Cold War from turning hot. In recent decades, however, technological advances have weakened this deterrent. The combination of miniaturized,low-yield nuclear warheads and highly accurate delivery systems has made thinkable what once was unthinkable: a “limited” nuclear war, which would not result in apocalyptic destruction. Finally, other scholars have argued that the so-called liberal international order will preserve peace. In this view, US leadership—through multilateral institutions such as the UN, the World Trade Organization, and the International Monetary Fund—and the spread of the principles of peaceful cooperation now provide regularity and predictability in international conduct. Some, such as the political scientist G John Ikenberry,optimistically forecast that this order can survive for many decades into the future, notwithstanding China is rise and the eventual end of US predominance. This assumption, however, is problematic. The order is being challenged not only by changing international dynamics but also by political developments in the countries that have traditionally defended it. In the USs and Europe, the rise of populism and illiberal democracy is a backlash against the current order and the elites who champion and profit from it. As domestic support for the order decreases and the balance of power shifts toward other countries, the system will inevitably become less effective at mediating conflict. Rising powers may also see an opening to revise the structure entirely, raising the likelihood of war. Beyond theory, history also demonstrates that the constraints on great-power war are weaker than they often appear. In particular, the course of the British-German rivalry that culminated in war in 1914 shows how two great powers can be drawn inexorably toward a conflict that seemed highly unlikely—right up until the moment it began. And the parallels to to day is contest between the USs and China could hardly be clearer. In the early years of the twentieth century, imperial Germany is fast-growing economic, technological, and naval power began to pose a challenge to the existingBritish-led international order. Despite close trade ties between the two countries, British elites began to see Germany is growing economic power as a menace. Moreover, they resented Germany is economic success because it was the result of trade and industrial policies they deemed unfair: German prosperity, they felt, derived from state intervention rather than the liberal, laissez-faire approach that governed the United Kingdom is political economy. British elites also harbored a deep antipathy toward Germany because they saw its political culture—which privileged the military and its values—as fundamentally antithetical to liberal values. Simply put, they believed Germany was an irredeemably bad actor. It is no wonder that once war began, the British quickly came to understand the conflict as an ideological crusade pitting liberalism against Prussian autocracy and militarism. The British and the Germans were competing for prestige as well as power. Germany isWeltpolitikstrategy—building a big navy and seeking colonies—provoked the United Kingdom, which, as a trading nation with a sprawling overseas empire, could not ignore the emergence of a rival naval power just across the North Sea. In reality, however, Germany is battleship-building program was driven less by economic or military considerations than by a hunger for status. Germany is goal was not necessarily to challenge the United Kingdom but to be acknowledged as its great-power equal. Despite these sources of potential conflict, the outbreak of war between the two states in August 1914 hardly was inevitable. As the historians Zara Steiner and Keith Neilson pointed out, “there was no direct clash over territory, thrones, or borders” between the two. In fact, there were important factors that might have fostered peace: trade, cultural bonds, and interconnected elites and royal families, to name a few. So why did they go to war? The historian Margaret MacMillan is answer is that the conflict was “the result of the clash between a major global power feeling its advantage slip away and a rising challenger.” As she writes:Such transitions are rarely managed peacefully. The established power is too often arrogant, lecturing the rest of the world about how to manage its affairs, and too often insensitive to the fears and concerns of lesser powers. Such a power, as Britain was the n, and the USs is to day, inevitably resists its own intimations of mortality and the rising one is impatient to get its fair share of whatever is on offer, whether colonies, trade, resources or influence. The parallels between the pre-1914 British-German antagonism and contemporary US-Chinese relations are both striking and cautionary. The USs finds itself in the place of the United Kingdom, an incumbent hegemon whose relative power is gradually waning. Washington, like London before it, resents its adversary is rise, which it attributes to unfair trade and economic policies, and views its rival as a bad actor whose values are antithetical to liberalism. For its part, like Germany prior to World War I, to day is fast-rising China wants to be acknowledged as an equal on the international stage and seeks hegemony in its own region. The United Kingdom is inability to adjust peacefully to Germany is rise helped lead to World War I Whether the USs follows that British precedent will determine whether US-Chinese competition ends in war. For Chinese leaders, their own country is history provides a cautionary tale about what happens to major countries that fail to make the jump to great-power status. As scholars have noted, China is defeat by the British and the French in the twoOpium Warsin the mid-nineteenth century stemmed from its inability to adapt to the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Because of a weak response on the part of Chinese leaders, stronger imperialist powers were able to dominate the country is affairs; the Chinese refer to the subsequent era, in which Western powers and Japan kept China down, as “the century of humiliation.”China is current rise is driven by a desire to avenge the humiliation it suffered and to restore its pre-nineteenth-century status as East Asia is dominant power. Deng Xiaoping is “reform and opening” program was the first step in this process. To spur its economic growth and modernization, China integrated into the US-led world order. As Deng himself put it in 1992, “Those who are backward get beaten.” Beijing is long-term goal was not simply to get rich. It aimed to become wealthy enough to acquire the military and technological capabilities needed to wrest regional hegemony in East Asia away from the USs. China joined the system not to help preserve it but to challenge it from within. That strategy has succeeded. China is rapidly approaching the USs on every important measure of power. In 2014, the International Monetary Fund announced that, when measured in terms of purchasing power parity, Chinahad passed the USsas the world is largest economy. Measured by market exchange rate, China is GDP is now nearly 70 percent of the USs’. And as China continues to recover rapidly from the pandemic-induced economic downturn, it will likely pass the USs as the world is number one economy by any measure before the end of this decade. In military terms, the story is similar. In 2015, a study by the RAND Corporation,The US-China MilitaryScorecard, noted that the gap between US and Chinese military power in East Asia was closing rapidly. The US fleet and US bases in the region were now under threat from improved Chinese capabilities. The study is authors the mselves expressed surprise at this shift. “Even for many of the contributors to this report, who track developments in the Asian military situation on an ongoing basis, the speed of change . . . was striking,” they noted. A naval parade in Qingdao, China, April 2019Jason Lee / ReutersUS policymakers increasingly see the US-Chinese rivalry not as a traditional great-power competition but as a struggle pitting democracy against communism. In July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeodelivered a speech whose main purpose was to cast US-Chinese hostility in ideological terms. “We have to keep in mind that the [Chinese Communist Party] regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime,” he said. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology . . . that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them. Such rhetoric aims to lay the groundwork for a more intense phase of US-Chinese friction by echoing Cold War depictions of the Soviet Union as an “evil empire,” de legitimizing China is government in the eyes of the American public, and portraying China as a bad actor in international politics. It is not only hawks such as Pompeo who have come to view China through an ideological prism. A wide swath of establishment figures in Washington have come to believe that the real threat to the USs is not China is growing military and economic power but Beijing is challenge to the US model of political and economic development. As Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivanwrote in these page sin 2019, “China may ultimately present a stronger ideological challenge than the Soviet Union did”; its “rise to superpower status will exert a pull toward autocracy.”This ideological turn in US China policy is unwise. It creates a febrile mood in Washington and makes war more likely. The USs would be better advised to take ideology out of the equation and conduct its relationship with China as a traditional great-power rivalry, in which diplomacy aims to manage competition through compromise, conciliation, and the search for common ground. Ideological contests, on the other hand, are zero-sum in nature. If your rival is evil, compromise—indeed, negotiation itself—becomes appeasement. Today, the US-Chinese relationship is in free fall. Economic relations are on the rocks due to the Trump administration is trade war, and US technology policy aims to put Chinese firms such as Huawei out of business. It is easy to see how any number of flash points could trigger a war in the coming years. Events on the Korean Peninsula could draw in the USs and China, and both countries’ military maneuvers have raised tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Washington is also challenging long-established understandings about Taiwan is status by edging closer to recognizing the island is independence from China and openly acknowledging the USs’ military commitment to defend Taiwan. The USs has also reacted strongly to Beijing is repression of China is Uighur Muslim minority and to its imposition of a harsh new security law on Hong Kong. In both cases, a bipartisan array of US officials have condemned China, and both Congress and the Trump administration have imposed retaliatory sanctions. Despite such pushback, however, China is unlikely to abandon its goal of becoming a regional hegemon in East Asia. Beijing will also continue pressing the USs to accord it respect as a great-power equal. Avoiding war by accommodating China is desires would require the USs to retract its security guarantee to Taiwan and recognize Beijing is claims on the island. Washington would also need to accept the reality that its liberal values are not universal and thus stop interfering in China is internal affairs by condemning Beijing is policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and issuing thinly veiled calls for regime change. There is little chance that the USs will take those steps. Doing so would mean acknowledging the end of US primacy. This makes the prospect of a hot war ever more likely. Unlike during the Cold War, when the USs and the Soviet Union generally accepted each other is European spheres of influence, to day, Washington and Beijing have starkly different views of who should enjoy preeminence in the East China and South China Seas and Taiwan. US public opinion is also unlikely to act as a check on this potential march to war. Historically, the country is foreign policy establishment has not been particularly responsive to public opinion, and many American voters know little about US overseas military commitments and their implications. In the event of a Chinese attack, especially on Taiwan, the “rally around the flag” effect and the US government is ability to manipulate public opinion would likely neuter public opposition to war. US leaders would condemn Beijing as a ruthless, aggressive, and expansionist communist dictatorship aiming to suppress the freedom-loving people of a democratic territory. The US public would be told that war was necessary to uphold the USs’ universal values. Of course, as was the case with World War I, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq war, public disillusionment would set in if the war went badly. By the n, however, it would be too late. Over the past few years, multiple observers—including leading China analysts in the USs, such as Robert Kagan and Evan Osnos—have suggested that the USs and China might be, like the United Kingdom and Germany in 1914, “sleepwalking” into war. Although the march toward conflict continues, everyone is eyes are now wide open. The trouble is that although supporters of increased confrontation are making their case loudly and clearly, opposition to such policies has been surprisingly muted within the foreign policy establishment. One reason is that many who typically advocate policies of strategic self-discipline and restraint in US foreign policy have, in recent years, become far more hawkish when it comes to China. Among scholars and analysts who generally agree that the USs should disengage from the Middle East (and, some say, even from Europe),few support similar strategic adjustments in East Asia. Instead, some in this camp—notably the distinguished realist scholar John Mearsheimer—now claim that the USs must oppose China is drive for regional hegemony. But this argument is based on the geopolitical nightmare that obsessed the British strategic thinker Sir Halford Mackinder at the beginning of the twentieth century: if a single power dominated the Eurasian heartland, it could attain global hegemony. Mackinder is argument has many weaknesses. It is the product of an era that equated military power with population size and coal and steel production. The Eurasian threat was over hyped in Mackinder is day, and it still is. Chinese regional hegemony is not something worth going to war over. Whether the USs can, or will, peacefully cede its dominance in East Asia and acknowledge China is standing as its great-power equal is an open question. If Washington does not do so, however, it is on the fast track to war—one that might make the military disasters of Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq pale in comparison.",2,2,Foreign Affairs

Daniel Friend ofThe Texanreportedthat “By early 2020, commissioners in over 60 counties— often with the support of the county sheriff — had passed some sort of Second Amendment sanctuary resolution.”Two elected officials have filed different versions of the Texas Firearm Protection Act, which Greg Abbott pushed back in 2013 when he was Attorney General. The TFPA is a piece of legislation that would ban law enforcement from enforcing federal gun control schemes “that purports to regulate a firearm, a firearm accessory, or firearm ammunition if the statute, order, rule, or regulation imposes a prohibition, restriction, or other regulation, such as a capacity or size limitation, a registration requirement, or a background check, that does not exist under the laws of this state.”State Representative Steve Toth introducedHouse Bill (HB) 112and State Representative Ben Leman introducedHB 919— both of 2021 is version of the TFPA At a Texas Public Policy Foundation event, Abbott emphasized his pro-Tenth Amendment credentials by stating that “I still hold a record that will never be broken by anybody. I hold the record for the most lawsuits filed against Barack Obama — 31 legal actions against him.”The Texas Governor added, “We had to because the actions he was taking trampled upon Texas’ liberties based upon the Tenth Amendment. We need to go back to the fundamentals of the Tenth Amendment and reassert that against any potential encroachments that we see under the Biden administration.”Thesanctuary movement is arguably one of the brightest spots for the right heading into the Biden era. Despite Democrat control at the federal level, there will be more paths for reform available at the state and local level. This should make Second Amendment operatives realize that not all politics is federal. Plus, gaining in power in DC necessitates having strong local political machines. Fighting Second Amendment battles at the state and local level is a good way to build a power base. As cliche as it may sound, all politics is still local. Share:",1,0,Big League Politics

Instead, hes aid at a news conference that House Republicans will conduct their own investigation of an attempt to reject last November is election results that most of them supported and that was instigated by the leader of their party.“We will run our own investigation,” McCarthy said, adding later that “no committee in Congress will work if one person is picking all who can serve.”Kevin McCarthy says that Republicans will run their own investigation into the insurrection instigated by the leader of their partypic.twitter.com/SkclfTS3hgMcCarthy is news conference came hours after Pelosi rejected the nomination to the committee of two of McCarthy is five proposed Republicans: Reps. Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, who both voted in January against certifying two states’ results which contributed to President Joe Biden is victory over Donald Trump. Instead of nominating more suitable Republicans to the committee, McCarthy opted to try to blow the whole thing up. And while McCarthy accused Pelosi of “playing politics” by rejecting Jordan and Banks, the irony is it is his party that has an electoral interest in maintaining a fog of confusion around an insurrection that will be a major issue heading into next year is midterms and the 2024 presidential election. In May, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee — Reps. Bernie Thompson (MS) and John Katko (NY), respectively — hammered out a deal for a January 6 committee that had the features McCarthy now says he wants: equal representation of Democrats and Republicans, and Republican veto power over subpoenas. But McCarthy torpedoed that deal because the scope of the committee is work would not include an investigation into “interrelated political violence” purportedly perpetrated by leftist groups like Black Lives Matter and antifa.“Given the Speaker is shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation,” a statement from his office concluded, in a talking point that McCarthy also raised on Wednesday. Kevin McCarthy says he opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6 -- the thing he says he wants now -- because Pelosi would not empower it to study ""what built up to"" the insurrection (in other words turn it into a forum to bash antifa)pic.twitter.com/JO5rwE4jyiDespite McCarthy is opposition to the Thompson-Katko deal, legislation to set up an independent commission passed the House with 35 Republicans voting in favor, but was blocked by Senate Republicans in their first filibuster of the Biden era. Pelosi responded by creating a commission with eight Democratic appointees and five Republican ones, with Pelosi having veto power over the members McCarthy appointed. One of the Pelosi appointees is Republican Representative Liz Cheney (WY). McCarthy is move to appoint Jordan and Banks to the commission, meanwhile, signaled how disinterested he is in an independent January 6 investigation. Not only did Jordan and Banks vote against certifying parts of Trump is loss, but as recently as two months ago, Banks was still unable to say Biden is win was “legitimate” (despite Trump is own officials repeatedly stating there is no evidence of widespread fraud) and was defending his vote against accepting the election results. CHRIS WALLACE: Is Joe Biden the legitimate POTUS?JIM BANKS: Yes, Joe Biden was elected. He was inaugurated.

He was part of a group of House Republicans who publicly worked with the Trump White Houselast December to scheme about ways to overturn the election results on January 6. Beyond trying to protect Trump and his party from an investigation that is likely to result in a damaging report issued just before next year is midterm elections, McCarthy has self-interested reasons to try to kneecap a January 6 committee. He is just as guilty as anyone for pushing lies about the 2020 election that persuaded Trump supporters the presidency was stolen and motivated them to storm the Capitol. Just days after the election, for instance, McCarthy went on Fox News and proclaimed, “President Trump won this election, so everyone who is listening, do not be quiet. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes ... join together and let is stop this.”.@GOPLeaderKevin McCarthy was laying the groundwork for the attack on the Capitol for months. 11/5/2020:“President Trump won this election, so everyone who is listening, do not be quiet. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes... join together and let is stop this.”pic.twitter.com/9Ys6elhUlnTwo months later, McCarthy joined Banks and Jordan in voting against accepting the election results from Arizona and Pennsylvania (he is since tried to claim he never supported efforts to overturn the election results wholesale). McCarthy might not have been in favor of the storming of the Capitol itself — as Trump supporters rioted inside the Capitol on January 6, McCarthy had a phone call with Trump that remains shrouded in mystery, but during which McCarthyreportedlyconfronted Trump about why he was not doing more to quell the unrest. But he also does not seem in favor of interrogating why that unrest happened or what role his party and the former president could have played in prompting it: Asked about that call during Wednesday is news conference, McCarthy quickly pivoted to law enforcement failures on January 6 — a topic he made clear will be a focus of the Republican investigation. Asked about his mysterious phone call with Trump while the insurrection was ongoing, McCarthy quickly changes the topic to law enforcement failurespic.twitter.com/uYxjU1Un00In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, McCarthy gave a speech on the House floor in which he acknowledged that Trump “bears responsibility” for the events of January 6 — but in a remarkable turnaround, during a July 1 news conference here fused to acknowledgeTrump bears responsibility for January 6. Shortly before Pelosi announced she would not accept Banks and Jordan on the January 6 commission, Banks released a statement in which he indicated he intended to turn the committee into a circus.“Make no mistake, Nancy Pelosi created this committee solely to malign conservatives and to justify the Left is authoritarian agenda,” Bankssaid. Pelosi on Thursday cited statements of that sort as a reason she rejected Banks and Jordan.“They had made statements and taken actions that I think would impact the integrity of the committee,” Pelosi said during a news conference. “It is my responsibility as Speaker of the House to make sure we get to the truth on this. We will not let their antics stand in the way of that.”Pelosi on rejecting Jordan & Banks for Jan 6 committee: ""They had made statements & taken actions that I think would impact the integrity of the committee ... it is my responsibility [to] make sure we get to the truth on this.

Republican Representative Cheney already agreed to serve on it, and on Wednesday she criticized McCarthy for “at every opportunity attempt[ing] to prevent the American people from understanding what happened.”“We must have this select committee investigation,” Cheney told reporters. “We cannot allow those voices who are attempting to prevent the American people from getting the truth to prevail.”Republicans, predictably, have responded bysuggestingCheney is not really a Republican.

The bridge was pulled up one year ago to be rebuilt but rotted wooden pilings failed leaving a substandard substructure which sent the bridge back for redesign. Consulting engineers presented the new plans and price tag to commissioners who baulked at moving forward. Mayor Marco McClendon ultimately urged commissioner to wait for the bridge to get re-scheduled for an 80/20 matching state grant for the $750,000 bridge rather than dipping city cash reserves to foot the entire cost.“We have got to be patient,” said McClendon.“We ca not do it all in one year or we will drain our funds.”Councilman Wayne Croom pointed to the public works deficit and expected borrowing for new residential trash bins and a $600,000 fire truck later in the year and wondered aloud why an existing unfinished project would have to take a back seat to upcoming planned spending. He said school traffic dictated the need for the bridge replacement now rather than sit out the state project waiting list. The traffic count before the bridge demolition was 200 vehicles per day. Bragg moved from facing Barton Street to facing Redding. Croom felt traffic counts would climb because of school commuters once the bridge was replaced.“If that bridge was there and with the school it would be a main channel for traffic the re, instead of lining up on Ross.” said Croom. Later in the day the same bridge came up for discussion in a budget session. Councilman Charles Wheeless said residents in his ward were calling him about getting the bridge finished. Consultants presented the bridge redesign. Instead of being built on pilings like the first bridge they planned five box culverts to form the bridge support. Jim Smith of Sorrell -Smith Engineering provided a time line for the Redding bridge replacement.“This is a precast box unit and we did one similar for Southland on their frontage road,” said Smith. “Southland had a time line to get it done quickly. There is was only a four barrel. This a five barrel. Realistically you could get it done in five months, weather permitting.”“If Southland had a timeline, why cant we,” asked Councilwoman Lorraine Mohammed.“Anytime you set a time line the n the contractor will put that extra cost in there for all that,” said Smith.

They have not reduced crime. The prison populations have nothing to do with the levels of crime because crime rose, crime fell, the prison population massively expanded. And so what we know is that policing has not made our community safer. Jaisal Noor: On June 12th, activists painted ‘defund police’ in front of Baltimore City Hall, head of a committee hearing on the Baltimore Police Departments proposed a $509 million budget. Speaker 1: The City Council is voting on a $509 million investment into police at the expense of resources that are necessary to communities. And so we want the Baltimore City Police Department to cut the police budget by $270 million and take that money and invest it in community-based solutions. Speaker 3: The process to abolition is actually a process that is not going to happen overnight. I know that removing the police in their footprint in our city and redefining public safety is going to be a long process. I am willing to work with anyone who understands that, who actually wants to improve the city. Jaisal Noor: Baltimore spends more per capita on its police than any other large city, more than it allocates for housing, health, civil rights, and its contribution to its local school system combined. Activists with Organizing Black, say they want officials to spend half that money, over $270 million on social programs. Speaker 1: What has made our community safer are mental health counselors in schools, ensuring people have… youth have well-funded youth programs, that youth have summer jobs, that communities feel connected. And there is space for communities to build together and be accountable together. Jaisal Noor: The Baltimore City Council is scheduled to vote on its budget on June 15th. Activists who target Appropriations and Budget Committee Chair Councilman Eric Costello, with an early morning car caravan on Friday, say they will maintain pressure on elected officials. Speaker 3: I know the Councilors have gotten thousands upon thousands of emails. I know some Councilors that got visited at their house this morning, Councilor Costello was real upset. I would tell him that if he did his job, hearing from your constituents is not bullying. So if you do it, the n get your constituents want, you probably would get left alone.

470,11. I never imagined how the world would change.,-10.67,39.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/911-anniversary-world-trade-center.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-07,25,"On Sept. 11, 2001, I was in my seventh year as the Boston Globe is New York bureau chief, spending much of my time writing fun features and profiles, a welcome respite after three years as the paper is Moscow correspondent and, before that, a decade as its military affairs reporter. Those seven years were my own variation on the“holiday from history”that much of the nation was enjoying. At 8:50 a.m., my editor phoned, telling me that an airplane had crashed into one of the twin towers. I got dressed and turned on the TV in time to watch the second plane hit the other tower. This was no sightseeing pilot is accident—my initial assumption—but a plot, an attack. I dashed to the subway. On the ride from Brooklyn into Manhattan, I could see black smoke billowing from the buildings, streaking the clear blue sky like an oil spill. It looked like a Hollywood special effect. I arrived at the World Trade Center station, one of the last people to cross its turnstiles for many months to come, and ran up the steps. A large crowd had gathered to watch the towers burning. I found myself standing next to a reporter friend, and we wondered how long it would be before anyone would go back into those buildings. Then, at 10 a.m., came the rumbling, which sounded and felt like an earthquake. The first tower began to collapse, and everyone ran, including me. Odd calculations raced through my mind: The tower was a little more than a quarter-mile high. I was a little less than a quarter-mile away. Should I run straight and hope to outrace the building is fall, or should I dart down some side street to dodge its trajectory? It did not matter. I glanced back to see the tower crumble where it stood, like a sand castle in the tide. Everyone was in a state of horror. I talked with several people walking away from the disaster, some coated with ash. One man, a Xerox executive who worked a block from the towers, told me he’d seen “pieces of fuselage and body parts falling from the sky” and “strewn all over the street.” This was the first moment I realized that the weapons in the sky had not been small prop engine planes, perhaps rented by saboteurs; they were passenger jetliners, hijacked by terrorists. The subways were closed down. Cellular networks were mangled. I walked uptown toward the apartment of my Globe colleague Elizabeth Neuffer (a tenacious reporter who would die two years later in Iraq). The streets were empty and quiet, except for the sound of news broadcasts blaring from car radios and bars. At each one, and there were several on every block, dozens of people gathered around to hear the latest. Rumors were rife that planes had also attacked the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Capitol. (One of those reports was true.)Over the next few days, the city was transformed. Popular depictions of New Yorkers as rude and rowdy had always been exaggerated, but the civility, courtesy, and mindfulness that washed over nearly everyone was astonishing. I have a vivid memory of walking across Third Avenue at East 33rdStreet three days after the attack. A man in front of me sneezed. A cop, who was guiding traffic at the intersection, looked him in the eye and said, “Bless you.” The pedestrian looked the cop in the eye and replied, “Thank you.”That afternoon, a friend in Tribeca approached a police officer on the sidewalk and asked, “How are you?” (Many were asking strangers this question with genuine concern.) The officer broke down in tears. To be a New Yorker in those days was to be stamped—proudly—with a special identity. One lunch hour, I wandered around Bryant Park, the small midtown cloister near the public library, to ask people if they were thinking about leaving the city. They all insisted that they were not. One young man with a Bronx accent replied, “What am I gonna do—move to Lincoln, Nebraska? That is what the terrorists me to do.”All over the city, mimeographed sheets were taped or stapled on every available surface, especially subway station walls—photographs of the missing, with their names, their descriptions, and phone numbers to call if anyone saw them. People gathered to look at the photos, study the m, read them carefully, as if they were memorizing their details. It was clear by this time that none of the missing would be found, not alive anyway. Yet people kept looking, out of respect—for the dead and for their loved ones who had posted the photos. The act was observed as a social obligation, a civic ritual: a moment of immersion into shared grief, a way to feel and affirm a sense of community and humanity that the attack had sundered but that its aftermath had strangely strengthened. For a while, anyway. It gradually became clear that the fresh breeze of unity—the notion that 9/11 brought us all together—did not extend to everyone. Two months after 9/11, an airplane crashed in Far Rockaway, a beachside community in Queens. Everyone feared—or just assumed—that it was another terrorist attack. (It turned out to be “just” an airplane crash, the product of wake turbulence and pilot error as a passenger plane pulled up and away out of the nearby JFK International Airport.) I took the long subway ride to the crash site to interview authorities and witnesses. A Globe colleague who happened to be in New York rode with me. The reporter was of South Asian descent. Not long after we divvied up the territory, he approached me to say he was very uncomfortable with the way people were looking at him—as if he were a terrorist, as if he’d had something to do with the plane crash. He feared for his safety. (We agreed he should leave.)Sometime before 9/11, I’d written a story about the soaring number of Pakistani immigrants in New York. They’d leased or bought wide swaths of business properties along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn; the area is councilman, also Pakistani, was emerging as a real political force. After 9/11, many of the neighborhood is residents left town; many of the businesses shuttered; the politician, a charismatic community leader, lowered his profile. President George W Bush and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to their credit, urged people not to take out their anger on American Muslims. But as more was learned about the attackers, and as we wreaked revenge on the attack is planners, the feelings—and a broad emerging hawkishness—were hard to control.“September 11 warped American culture,”Edward Luce, a Financial Times columnist, wrote in a recent reminiscence. “I had lived in the US until a few weeks before the attacks and returned five years later to a more paranoid, xenophobic and martial society.”Spencer Ackerman, in hisn ew book,,argues that“the 9/11 era destabilized America and produced Trump” (as the book is subtitle puts it). Donald Trump was hardly the first president to exploit the xenophobic streak in American culture, and 9/11 did not mark the first time a foreign attack sparked rampant fear of foreigners in the USs. (See, for instance, the Japanese internment camps during World War II.) But the spark this time was different; the threat was both more amorphous (a handful of hijackers with box knives) and more real (not even imperial Japan had attacked an American city)—and, as a result, more unnerving. The next attack could come anytime, anywhere, without notice; and the attacker would not be an army, navy, or air force; it might be that strange-looking man carrying a suspicious-looking object while walking down the street. In that sense, al-Qaida turned America into a more skittish country; if the goal of terror is to terrorize, the 9/11 attacks were a success. Within a few months, of course, US forces fought back, toppling the Taliban, decimating al-Qaida is ranks, and eventually killing bin Laden himself. But as recent events have shown, this triumph too was short-lived. In the 20-year interim, the nation—some of its leaders, nearly all of its legislators, and a majority of its citizens—took on an overly blunt view of “national security,” seeing myriad terrorist groups as a monolithic threat, when they were not monolithic (a shrewder strategy would have been to play some off the others) and most were not threats, not to our security anyway. The 9/11 attacks provided the legal basis and the political selling point for several military adventures—not least the invasion of Iraq, the most serious foreign blunder in US history. They also distracted everyone is attention from other looming threats—strategic, political, economic, and especially ecological—that may in the end do us more profound harm than that which was wrought by the terrorists on two airplanes. In one sense, 9/11 may have been less pivotal geopolitically than 11/9—i.e., November 9, 1989, the date when the Berlin Wall fell, which led to the unraveling of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The Cold War was a horrific era, but it was also a system of international security, and its end spawned not only the spread of democracy (in places, for a while) but also the dispersion of power, the crumbling of political blocs, the weakening of central authority in already-weak states, and the loosening of historically dubious borders. If the two superpowers had held a grip on their respective spheres of the world for another decade, it is likely that one of the m, or both, would have crushed or at least contained an outfit like al-Qaida before it swelled in strength and ambition. But 9/11 did mark a shift in our about the world—about the likelihood, and randomness, of peril that it poses. The nature of this shift—and the degree of anxiety about the randomness—have been shaped and modulated by other political currents coursing through these long two decades. Even in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, at a time when America is politics could still funnel disputes in relative calm and good order, the common new threat in our midst served as a unifying force only up to a point. Now that the elasticity of our politics has snapped, as myriad chasms—of race, party, class, and geography—seem increasingly unbridgeable, threats from outside (real or exaggerated) have intensified our disagreements, made consensus on even basic understandings harder to form. Twenty years ago, citizens all over the country embraced New York in its hour of need and hung flags in a display of national unity. Would so many citizens do so today? Many among us have turned a pandemic—the classic case of a common threat from a faceless enemy—into ap artisan battlefield. They’d likely respond in the same way to another terrorist attack. Trumpism may have deepened this erosion of civil society. Yet the rise of Trumpism is, in part, a product of the 9/11 era. As Edward Luce put it in his FT reminiscence, “It is hard to imagine Donald Trump without Iraq, nor Iraq without September 11.” The compounding effects of these events and phenomena—the increasingly grating dissonances that they have etched on our collective consciousness—may be the most deeply consequential legacy of that day 20 yearsago.",1,1,Slate

Subscribe to our print edition today. Review of by Marcia Chatelain (Livewright, 2020)As Darnella Frazier is video of George Floyd is murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin circulated, hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding an end to racist state violence flooded the streets in cities all across the US They we remet withviolent, retaliatory cops tear gassing and shooting them with “rubber” bullets. For the first time in a mass protest against police brutality, corporations from Starbucks to BlackRock released statements supporting “Black Lives Matter,” pledging to promote racial equity. Local businesses posted signs in their windows reading “black-owned” and “buy black,” protecting the mselves from the fray in a symbolic gesture of support with protesters. Meanwhile protesters in Minneapolis burned down a police precinct and the Wendy is where another black man,Rayshard Brooks, was killed by a police officer, and they occupied city squares all across the country. After the summer of uprisings waned into fall and the Coronavirus pandemic continued ravaging poor and working-class communities, slogans such as “buy black” and diversity trainings held at JPMorgan Chase served as a reminder that superficial market solutions have long been recommended by capital and the state in response to demands for wide-ranging, structural change in society — while those same forces have simultaneously disinvest ed in the social welfare of these communities. Historian Marcia Chatelain writes about the co-optation of black radical protest against state violence and economic disenfranchisement into the “struggle for silver rights,” defined by inclusion of black people in the institutions of the free market, inFranchise: The Golden Arches in Black America. This wildly entertaining and instructive book covers four decades of the civil rights movement — beginning in the late 1960s, when black protest was militant, anti-capitalist, and frequent, to the early 1990s, when, in the absence of meaningful state investment, the movement had been trampled by a violent, reactionary government and the logic of black capitalism. At the center of is engrossing storytelling is the history of McDonald is, one of the first fast food franchises to open its doors to black franchisees. As Chatelain tells it, McDonald is has long been the site of civil rights protest, black capitalist opportunity, and economic uplift in black America. If the “constrained choices” of poor and working-class black neighborhoods are shaped by racism and government disinvestment in social welfare, the n McDonald is has portrayed itself as a beacon of potential in black communities. The chain offers cheap, easy, and arguably delicious food, as well as low-wage jobs and the prospect of black ownership. The rise of McDonald is in black America is in large part because of shrewd marketing and the high profits that black consumers bring to this corporation. By the 1970s, “black stores” were grossing 25 percent more than “white stores.”Chatelain marks Martin Luther King is murder as catalyzing a shift from the militant civil rights movement demanding an end to racist state violence to the campaign for black business. King, a staunch anticapitalist leading a movement guided by the needs of the poor, was murdered in 1968 a day after defending the sanitation workers’ strike in Memphis, igniting weeks of violent uprisings all over the country. The black rebellion referred to as the “Holy Week Uprising” led to an exodus of white-owned businesses in black communities already gutted of decent housing options, access to good schools, healthy food options, and employment opportunities. The federal government soon attempted to extinguish the fires of protest. President Lyndon B Johnson is administration proposed more black-owned businesses as a solution to dispossession and blight; his successor Richard Nixon perfected this plan: “President Nixon, who preferred racial dog whistles and oversaw the covert destruction of the Black Power organizations, was black capitalism is goodwill ambassador and benefactor … promot[ing] legislation that provided business loans, economic development grants, and affirmative action provisions on federally contracted projects as a means of suppressing black rage and securing black endorsement.” McDonald is benefited from this opportunity, opening its doors to black franchisees in inner cities as other businesses fled post-uprisings. But the company is expansion in black communities did not come without a cost. Franchising for black owners consisted of higher overhead costs, higher insurance costs, and higher crime than white franchisees in the suburbs. Often black franchisees had to depend on white investors with capital and dealt with racial discrimination from the parent company. Still, hucksters and honest, hard-working African Americans alike were drawn to the economic possibilities that franchising promised. Former Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee member and Georgia state legislator Julian Bond tried to franchise a Dairy Queen but failed. Serial entrepreneur La-Van Hawkins, a franchisee mogul of Burger King and other chains and founder of the La-Van Hawkins Inner City Foods company, would swindle his way into investment capital to extract from the black poor, not paying his black employees and not paying off his debts before eventually being arrested for fraud. Chatelain argues that civil rights leaders and black nationalists saw opportunity in McDonald is during eras of both legal and de facto segregation. McDonald is was a restaurant open to black people with few options in a white-supremacist America. But the shift from militant civil rights struggle to the campaign for the liberal individualism of black franchising was not without protest. In cities all over America, including Chicago, Portland, and Cleveland, McDonald is was the site of boycotts and picketing, as black community members demanded the fast food company put money back into the community from which it was extracting capital. By the 1970s, with the rise of black nationalism, The Black Panther Party in Albina — a poor, black community in Portland with a high unemployment rate — waged a successful “redistributive program” that demanded local businesses reinvest in the community. With support from many businesses, volunteers, and even the University of Oregon is Dental School, the Albina BPP ran the Malcolm X Dental Clinic, the Fred Hampton is People is Clinic, and a free hot breakfast program for children in schools. When McDonald is refused to donate money to their free breakfast program, the BPP launched a boycott and picketed McDonald is, demanding that they redistribute supplies into the neighborhood and change their unfair labor practices that fired and exploited black employees. They also blamed McDonald is for bringing cops into the neighborhood as its parking lot became a “base area for PIG attacks,” according to a Panther. After a mysterious firebombing of the restaurant, McDonald is complied with the Panthers, donating hundreds of hamburgers and cups to the BPP is various community projects. Black communities’ varied relationships to black capitalism reflects a significant break in black politics. The proponents for silver rights, black capitalism, and black political elites argue that the civil rights movement of the 1960s had to “grow up.” They claim that black people needed to start running for office and owning businesses. Chatelain argues, “The option of bartering civil rights for economic opportunity had been presented to African Americans for centuries.” Liberal black politicians and the NAACP were ready to barter. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the NAACP, known for waging legal battles against redlining and school segregation, had launched campaigns in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles to demand that McDonald is and other franchises recruit more black franchisees. Instead of fighting for minimum wage increases and the right to unionize, NAACP used the franchise to fight for affirmative action quotas in restaurant ownership. Since 2008, black franchisee numbers for McDonald is have decreased. Meanwhile black cultural production, from hip hop to double dutch, has been used to sell McDonald is products. McDonald is invested in black communities because that is where they collected their highest profits. The company offered college scholarships and low-wage labor to black youth, and was one of the first corporations to publicly celebrate Martin Luther King day when it was still considered controversial by many on the Right. In the early 1980s, for their traveling civil rights exhibit in honor of King, the company co-opted King is image from the “radical Communist threat” fever dreams of the Right into a man who simply wanted everybody to get along. Chatelain at times argues that the role of black business in the movement for racial justice and economic access is complicated, yet she consistently returns to the essential role capitalism plays in reenforcing racial inequality and injustice; capitalism will never deliver expanded rights for black people, and black business is good for a few but not the many. Whether it is called black capitalism or empowerment, the politics of black business can serve many interests, except for those blacks most susceptible to the extremes of racism and capitalism. …The label black owned obscures the multiple systems that are not only outside of the hands of people of color, but will never be truly accessible under capitalism. Chatelain explains thatFranchisewas spurred by her questions around the shortcomings of anti-obesity campaigns and a food justice movement that reduce the disparities caused by racial capitalism into poor and working class black people is eating and shopping habits. The book devotes little time on this subject, but Chatelain is point ties into her greater message: a movement for racial justice that focuses on changing individual behaviors in lieu of a structural critique of capitalism undermines real social change. The corporate heads at McDonald is still fight unionization efforts and attempts to raise the minimum wage tooth and nail. These are attempts to destroy and deny black self-determination. Black franchisees’ token efforts to turn McDonald is into a kind of community hub will never replace dignified housing, healthy food choices, good education, meaningful employment, health care, and public safety in working-class and poor black communities. Meanwhile, in the wake of state abandonment, black communities will continue to rebel and negotiate.

Below, on the basement level, a car rattles with every Bad Bunny bass blast. An old Jeep splashes through standing water and creaks its way into a space. The hollowthump-thumpof its doors. In bushes outside, birds squawkch-cH-CH Construction trucks rumbleDAA-DAA-DAA-DAA Joggersslap slaps lapon past. Until, after a few minutes of overture, at last, silence. The parking garage goes still. A moment later, the sound of trombone fills the space. Followed by tuba. Together, they reverberate, leisurely, deep, lumbering, like Godzilla emerging out of the nearby lake. Timothy Maines on tenor trumpet. Alec Rich on tuba. They stand beside their cars in the basement of the parking garage, their music carrying out of the structure, across the jogging trail circling the campus, across the sailing center, across an inlet of water, onto the beaches. Heads lift off blankets. Necks crane. Is thatbrass?A jogger stops outside the garage and crouches down to peek into the dim basement level. He spots the small horn section and yelps: “You sound great!”“Thanks!” shouts Maines. Rich puts his tuba down on the towel that he spread on the garage floor and swigs at his water bottle. Maines cradles his trombone and flips the sheet music on the stand before him. They play down here from time to time, sometimes solo, sometimes in duos or trios. You know, Rich says to Maines, nodding at the sheet music, the guy who wrote this, in the 1970s, he wrote music for a lot of porn films. “You would always see his name in the credits.”I am sitting nearby on a curb and I ca not let this pass without comment. “Who watches the credits of old porn films?” I ask.“Tuba players,” Rich says.“OK, now a medium bounce?” Maines asks, eager to continue.“OK,” Rich says, and they begin again. A stone is throw away, the imposing building for the Northwestern Bienen School of Music stands cold and jutting, like a glass-windowed cruise ship taking up too much space in a quaint harbor. It holds studios, practice rooms, concert halls. And yet, since the pandemic, for many of the music students here, the real place to practice has been outside, in the nearby parking garages on campus. The first time I heard music from a garage was just after lockdown, March 2020. I was walking in early morning and heard the moan of a bow on strings. It was coming from the South Garage. For much of last year, its gates were up. You could drive in and out freely, so I drove in and wound up, and up, and up, and somewhere around the third level, in the otherwise empty garage, I saw the source: a student on a stool beside her car, playing a cello. I continued upward, and on the next floor, a trumpet player. They were playing on different floors to avoiding stepping on each other is to es. Once I heard them coming from the garages, it seemed I heard it every day. As weather got colder, their scales, flourishes, strings and sudden blasts of French horn came less frequently. And yet it also never quite ended. On and off, if you hit it right, practices continued, coming out of the parking garage beside the visitor is center and the basement garage alongside the journalism school. It was far from unique, of course: Last year, across the country, as concert halls and indoor spaces closed, school choirs and garage bands and city symphonies met inside parking garages. (Not to mention, musicians have never needed a pandemic as an excuse to play outdoors.)Still, finding yourself an impromptu audience to an impromptu concert is a little like seeing a buck standing beside the road: It is not remarkable, but you ca not help but slow down and admire. Here, indeed, is one of the lovelier byproducts of the pandemic. Even better, even as the health crisis in this country winds down, even with universities on break, garage practicing is a modest gift that keeps giving. Jemma Goddard, a Northwestern graduate student in music education, uses Northwestern garages to practice euphonium (a kind of cross between a French horn and a tuba). “Being a brass player, it is fun to play in a space that covers up mistakes. I am also someone who gets nervous performing and here I would have people walking up to me while I play. I have had people pull their cars up alongside me and just sit and listen a while. And the more I realized people were listening, the better I play. It seems like everyone practices in here. So many that when I first heard people playing here I was kind of intimidated because they sounded so good. But we had a teacher who encouraged us to go outside — to think of the person just walking their dog as your audience for that afternoon.”The weirdest thing about practicing in a garage, she said, is your show biz instincts still kick in. Just playing casually or practicing the same tune again and again, you become aware of how you present yourself. You find yourself hoping you do not bore the joggers, dog walkers and construction workers. Selin Ozcelik, who recently finished a master is program in musical education, still uses the garage to practice her French horn. She meets with friends there to jam. “When the pandemic started, you could not get into anywhere (to practice). Big halls were booked. You had to share the practice rooms or could not use a room that was not designated your own. Ensembles were not allowed to meet. It got restrictive. But outside, in a garage, it was safer, there was the distance, there was air, and a lot of us just realized that the sound here w asway better than in university practice rooms, which can be dry.”Depending when you listen, the garage band selections are eclectic. “Fly Me To the Moon,” “Ride of the Valkyries,” William Tell Overture, Bruckner is Symphony Number 4. Perhaps the Beatles. One early Sunday morning in June, I drove into the basement garage and found Maines playing from memory, running the same melody over and over, tweaking slightly each time. Sun came through the garage skylight and framed him in a natural spotlight. “The acoustics are great here,” he said. “The intonation alone is a perfect way to train yourself to hear yourself. You hear your feedback just after a sound is produced. You play a chord and know if it is in tune. It is also relaxing — just sort of beautiful.”Later this summer, he is moving to Austin, Texas, to find work; at the moment, post-graduation, he pays rent through proceeds from the clicks on his YouTube channel (“Trombone Timo”), which has produced unlikely trombone-centered viral smashes. In the meantime, an Evanston apartment building is also not the ideal place to practice your trombone on Sunday morning. He is tried playing on the local beaches, but it often means playing louder to hear yourself. That said, the basement garage level in particular has become so popular, he was once kicked out by a double bass player. Duets help. A week later, he is alongside Rich, a current grad student at Northwestern. Their voices echo in the empty garage. “What are we playing?” Rich asks Maines, who points to the sheet music and scats out a roadmap: “Bum bum ba da da de tc ha tc ha …”Then Maines counts down and they blast off. A pair of skateboarders sail past, brothers Zach and Christophe Smith. Zach stops, kicks his board into his hand and listens a monument. “This music, it is nice. You might say, it completes the ambience. It feels like Evanston should, like a crossroads of all sorts of walks of life. I play violin. I get it. Share the music. Share the talent. These guys down here, that is freedom. You are reminded music is not just a job when you see them here.” The Smiths leave and a gaggle of teenagers — shirtless, backpacks, fresh off the beach — stroll past, singing along loudly. BUM! BUM! BUM! BUM!“I like a good tuba,” one says blankly, like the comic relief in a John Hughes flick. Rich smiles weakly. Twenty minutes later, they wrap for the day. An older jogger was listening shouts: “Garage band!” It is a dad joke. Maines and Rich laugh with the appropriate politeness, as if they have not heard it often, the n Rich turns to Maines and talks shop: “Sorry I have been giving you a workout on the lower ends.”“It is all good,” Maines says. Rich loads his tuba into his Subaru and drives away, the n Maines climbs into his own car, and though windows are closed, his radio is loud in the now-silent garage: “Ride of the Valkyries,” bombastic, galloping and yet, unlike the live version they played a moment earlier, it does not carry to the beach.cborrelli@chicagotribune.com",2,2,Chicago Tribune

The Democrat nominee has been clear that a line needs to be drawn between protesting and rioting.“I want to make it absolutely clear. Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. And those who do it should be prosecuted,” he said. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump paid a visit to the city, over the objections of both Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian. As to whether or not either man is keen to have Biden visit the city, neither has responded to requests for comment. However, Antaramian, speaking to on Tuesday, said it is “too soon” for Trump or Biden to be visiting Kenosha.“At this time, it is just the wrong time. Right now is a time for us to heal, and to be able to look inward and deal with the issues that we have to deal with,” he said. Although not officially a campaign stop, Biden is a candidate for president and he will be visiting a state whose 10 electoral votes are in play. The Badger State played a major role in the 2016 election; Democrat Hillary Clinton narrowly lost the state to Donald Trump, after she failed to campaign there. Democrats have reportedly been concerned about Biden is absence from the state as well. According to, Biden leads Trump by as much as 13 points in the state, according to the most recent poll conducted there. This will be the first visit by a Democratic presidential candidate to Wisconsin since 2012. Meanwhile, Anna Kelly, spokeswoman for Trump is campaign in Wisconsin, said that the former vice president is “trying to use a hurting community as a political prop for his failing campaign.”“While true leaders like President Trump are working with state and local officials to help Kenosha heal, candidate Joe Biden is more interested in fomenting dissent and division,” Kelly said.",1,1,Inquisitr

The Jefferson Parish coroner is office has identified the man shot and killed in the middle of an Old Jefferson street Monday night as Ronald N…Though Thiele threw the first punch in the May 19 brawl, Jefferson Parish Sheriff is Office investigators say Michel gained the upper hand and continued pummeling Thiele after the latter had seemingly lost consciousness.“I counted approximately 22 blows that were all unanswered,” Sheriff is Office Detective Scott Bradley testified during a preliminary hearing in the case in June. Thiele and Michel, both of Metairie, had been friends for a number of years but had a falling out over some text messages that Thiele found offensive, Bradley said. The pair argued and did not speak to one another for about nine months while Michel was out of town for work. When he returned, Michel reached out to Thiele on May 19 to see if they could reconcile their friendship, Bradley said. But the bitterness remained, and the pair exchanged hostile text messages, instead. Thiele drove to Michel is Woodlawn Drive home for a confrontation that was recorded by a video surveillance system, authorities said. The two men spoke for a moment before Thiele punched Michel, sending them both to the ground, Bradley said. Thiele was briefly on top of Michel before he was rolled onto his back, Bradley said. With Thiele pinned to the ground, Michel began hitting him.“At one point, it appeared to me that Mr. Thiele had lost consciousness or stopped fighting completely because his arms and legs just became limp,” Bradley said. “While he was defenseless, Mr. Michel continued to punch, to the point of being forcefully removed from the top of Mr. Thiele by (Michel is) girlfriend.”Thiele regained consciousness, walked to over to his truck and drove home. A relative told investigators that once he arrived home, he went into his bedroom and stayed there until his body was discovered two days later. Someone had gone to check on Thiele because he missed work, according to authorities. An autopsy determined Thiele died of blunt force trauma to the head and neck, the Jefferson Parish Coroner is Office said. His death is considered a homicide. Michel is defense attorney, Laurence Alterman, declined to comment about the case on Wednesday. But during the preliminary hearing, he told the court he believed Michel was being overcharged.“There was a fight precipitated by the victim. The defendant was at his own residence when this occurred,” Alterman said. Michel is scheduled to be arraigned on August 25.",2,2,NOLA.com

483,GOP Eyes Short-Term Extension of Unemployment Benefit at Reduced Level,-2.7,42.5,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/07/22/GOP-Considers-Short-Term-Extension-Unemployment-Benefit-Much-Lower-Level,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"As Senate Republicans and the White House try to reach consensus on their proposal for the next coronavirus relief bill, they are also discussing a possible extension of enhanced unemployment benefits, acknowledging that a broader deal is not likely to be reached before the $600-a-week payments are set to expire at the end of July.“I think we should do the whole thing,” Senator Rob Portman (R-OH)said, “but if we ca not get it all done by next week we cannot allow there to be a cliff in unemployment insurance given that we are still at about 11% unemployment. I think we need to do something and [in] the interim period we can have a compromise.”A big cut:The extension under consideration would likely reduce the benefit dramatically from the current $600 a week. Portman said Wednesday that GOP lawmakers were discussing a possible two-month extension of enhanced benefits, but at a lower level, with $200 per week being cited by some White House advisers. CNBCreportsthe extension now under consideration would lower the supplemental payment to $100 a week and last through the end of the year. The $600 per week payments have played a major role in maintaining household incomes and economic demand in the face of the worst employment crisis in decades. A potential extension would allow more than 20 million Americans to continue to collect extra unemployment benefits. An agreement on an extension is far from a sure thing, however, even as lawmakers are struggling to reach a deal on a broader package. Comments from White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows late Wednesday suggests that the administration may be backing away from a short-term extension, leaving the issue very much up in the air. Some top Democrats object:Democrats have proposed continuing the $600 payments through January, and top Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about a shorter-term extension. “I would prefer to reach agreement on a comprehensive response to the crisis, including an extension of unemployment assistance; state, local and tribal government assistance; and other priorities,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Wednesday, according toBloomberg News. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, reportedly accused Republicans of trying to stall. The risk:Some economists are expressing concerns about the shockwave that could be caused by bringing the unemployment payments to an end. In an analysis published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics earlier this month, former Obama economic adviser Jason Furman said that allowing the enhanced benefits to come to an abrupt halt would remove some $50 billion a month from the economy, reducing household spending, business operations and GDP Eliminating the federal benefit boost permanently would cause GDP to shrink by more than 2% in the second half of 2020, Furman said, while reducing employment by about 2 million (see the chart below). Lowering the weekly payment, which seems more likely than total elimination, also carries economic risk. Economist Ernie Tedeschi, who worked in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration, told The Washington Post that cutting the payment by two-thirds would have a powerful negative economic effect. ""If they lowered it to $200 a week, 30 million workers would wake up with a pay cut from a third to a half overnight,"" Tedeschi said. ""While $200 is marginally better than full expiration, the US would still take a major economic hit from this summer and this fall as a result from it.""The timing poses challenges, too, since most states will send out their last checks in the program at the end of this week, creating a rapidly approaching fiscal cliff as clunk y state-level unemployment offices shut the program down, while likely needing weeks to turn it back on again in the event of new legislation.",1,2,Fiscal Times
484,US Election 2020: How Joe Biden achieved victory - in charts,-2.17,44.0,https://news.sky.com/story/us-election-2020-how-joe-biden-could-achieve-victory-in-the-election-a-visual-guide-12124283,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Joe Biden is projected to win the election and become the 46th president of the USs. After a nail-biting race, the Democratic candidate took an unbeatable lead in Pennsylvania - picking up its 20 Electoral College votes and passing the 270 needed to gain the White House. So how did he do it? Some trends in voting patterns have become apparent. Mr Biden won Wisconsin and Michigan - and now Pennsylvania, three of the states that fell to Donald Trump four years ago. They are in the so-called ""blue wall"", a group of northern states that have been steadily Democrat supporting in many recent elections. It was the switch in 2016 of many voters in those states to supporting Mr Trump that gave him the keys to the White House, with many blue collar voters sold on his America First vision and pledge to revitalise the US steel and coal industries. In many parts of America is Rust Belt - in states like Ohio, Indiana and, to some extent, Michigan - Mr Trump is support held up. But changes in levels of support in other parts meant Mr Biden was able to take the key states that were enough to see him take the presidency. Across all the swing states, in areas with higher levels of education, there was a surge in support for the Democrat candidate in 2020 compared with 2016In general, the opposite was the case among those with lower levels of education. All areas with high numbers of non-college educated voters have seen a rise in support for Mr Trump. Blue collar workers, especially in the northern industrial areas, were previously seen as being his ""base"", but the latest data shows this appears to have become even more the case. The general trend underscores the growing polarisation of US politics and divisions in American society between those with different levels of education and often differing values. In places like Arizona, the areas with higher levels of education may have made the difference. Mr Trump held the state in 2016, even though his margin was the smallest since Republican Bob Dole is loss to President Bill Clinton, but in 2020, the signs are that it might have flipped. Counties like Pima, which includes Tucson and the University of Arizona, saw a significant rise in Democrat support among college educated voters. The county has seen an influx in recent years of better-educated Americans, attracted to a growing economy, higher tech industries and lured away from states like California by lower prices. Thirty-two percent of county inhabitants now have degrees - the same as the US national average. Pima is 92% urban. In several of the swing states, indications are that Joe Biden saw an increased vote share, compared to that of Hillary Clinton in 2016, among those living in urban areas. Urban areas sometimes have higher proportions of college-educated voters and people from minorities - groups that tended to support Mrs Clinton previously, but Mr Biden saw more of them support him this time in states such as Georgia, Minnesota and North Carolina. Even in states like Ohio and Iowa, which Mr Biden lost, Democrat support was up in urban areas. Sky News reported before the election on signs elderly communities in Florida may be less willing to vote for the man who they had helped into office in 2016. In the end, that was exactly what happened, with Mr Trump seeing a loss in support in areas with a higher population of over-65s. The same was true in Arizona, another key battleground, and a state with a larger retired population than the average. There was anecdotal evidence before the election that some elderly people were considering switching their vote to Democrat - and to a man who could himself be the oldest president in history - because they were keen to leave a legacy for their grandchildren. The elderly, thousands of whom have died this year in the US from coronavirus, may have also been more worried about the pandemic and voted for a candidate who pledged to take it more seriously. However, this did not occur across the board, and in many of the states where Mr Trump did well in 2016, especially in the north, there were signs that older voters backed him in greater numbers, despite the high levels of COVID-19 infection. The Democrats had been optimistic they would at least pick up the swing state of Florida, if not the firmly red state of Texas, which the polls said could go their way. In the end, they won neither. Behind the losses may be a dramatic swing to Donald Trump among the Latino population. In Florida, 48% of Latinos backed Donald Trump. Democrats on the ground say they believe it was the Latino vote that was key to Mr Trump is success in the state. Bradley Jackson, a Democrat activist in Florida, told Sky News he could see the effect as he campaigned. He said: ""One of the main things I did see was down in Miami Dade county - which is a Democratic stronghold - that the Hispanic population, mainly Cuban and Venezuelan, which have had socialist governments for so long, have taken that message that the GOP [Republican Party] have put out, calling Joe Biden a socialist and used that to convince people that this agenda is what is happening.""Many commentators have said that the polls may have been wrong because of a phenomenon call the Shy Trumper - voters who did not tell pollsters they planned to vote Trump, and the n did. Many of the graphs above show that in several groups, support for Mr Trump went up. In several states, particularly the former bellwether states like Ohio, and also including Iowa and Indiana, which were won by Barack Obama in 2008, Mr Trump is vote share held up. With turnout predicted to be the highest ever for a US election, it is clear that Mr Trump was backed by a huge number of Americans. Former Republican adviser Lanhee Chen told Sky News: ""Biden was winning by a much larger margin. Polls are a reflection of assumptions about who will turn out to vote and pollsters have to do their best to guess who is going to turn out on election day.""Clearly what Trump has been able to do in these states is to create an electorate that is more favourable to him. He is turning out voters that are going to support him and de motivating those who would oppose him.""",2,2,Sky News

The state is death toll of 4,406 has now remained steady since Monday, according tos tate data. The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported Wednesday evening that 142, 677 Americans have died from COVID-19. The number of hospitalizations also remained mostly steady, with the state reporting only one additional hospitalization, for a total of 63. That slight increase comes one day after a more significant up tick — the state was down to 54 hospitalized patients on Monday, before reporting an increase of 8 on Tuesday. Despite the fluctuations and occasional increases in hospitalizations, that number is still a fraction of what the state at the peak of the pandemic. In mid- to late-April, the state had nearly 2,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. In addition to hospitalizations, Governor Ned Lamont has repeatedly pointed to positivity rate as a key indicator of the success of the state is coronavirus response. Positivity rate is found by dividing the number of new cases by the total number of tests conducted. It is used to gauge whether a state is conducting enough testing — a lower positivity rate indicates that a state is identifying a larger proportion of its actual coronavirus cases. Connecticut officials have touted the state is low positivity rate, which has hovered around and often dipped under 1%. In early July, the positivity rate dipped as low as 0.5%, and neared that low again on July 10. But on Wednesday, the rate ticked up slightly. The state reported 127 new cases out of a total of 11,529 tests, for a positivity rate of 1.1%. With the new cases reported Wednesday, the state now has identified a total of 48,223 coronavirus cases. Connecticut is risk score increasedOn Tuesday, an initiative called Covid Act Now released a ranking of states’ coronavirus risk level — and Connecticut was the only state labeled “green” or “on track to contain COVID.”Connecticut officials, includingLamontand chief operating officerJosh Geballe, posted about the ranking on social media and applauded the state is efforts. But on Wednesday, the state is ranking was downgraded to “yellow” or “controlled disease growth.” Covid Act Now added a new metric to its ranking system, which changed the rankings for nine states, including Connecticut. The ranking now also accounts for daily new cases per capita.“We understand that taking into account [this new metric] has increased the risk score for many states and counties,” said Covid Act Now in an announcement. “This change may be disheartening, but we believe it is important for our COVID risk score to reflect risk as accurately as possible.”Connecticut is now one of only 10 states labeled “yellow.” There are no states currently labeled “green.”This story has been updated.

In his first speech as US president at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden called for cooperation in the “global community” to address what he called “urgent and looming crises” across the world. In calling for multilateralism, Biden drew a contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump – who withdrew the US from several UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation and UN Human Rights Council – without naming him.“We are back at the table in international forums, especially the UN, to focus attention and to spur global action on shared challenges,” Biden said. With the end of Washington ismilitary involvement in Afghanistan, Biden said the US will focus its energy and commitment to the future.“I stand here today for the first time in 20 years with the USs not at war,” he said. While stressing that the US will defend itself by force if needed, Biden said the military power should be a tool of “last resort”, adding that some of the biggest problems facing the world cannot be solved with weapons.“Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants,” the US president told the General Assembly. “To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world.”Biden called for creating a “new mechanism” to fund global health security. He also pledged to work with Congress to double Washington is contributions to an international fund to tackle climate crises in developing nations. In an apparent message to China, Biden said Washington is not seeking a new Cold War with its strategic competitors.“The USs is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement in other areas,” He said.“We will all suffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19, climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation,” Biden added. The USdrew China is ire earlier last week when it announced a security partnership with the UK and Australia that will see Washington and London help the Australian military acquire nuclear-powered submarines. Chinese officials called the pact “extremely irresponsible”, accusing the US and its allies of undermining international non-proliferation efforts. US, UK and Australian leaders have stressed that the submarines will be powered by nuclear power, not carrying nuclear weapons. Australia is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). On Tuesday, Biden said the US “remains committed” to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, calling for reviving the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions against its economy. Trump nixed the deal in 2018. Six rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna earlier this year failed to restore the pact. Negotiations have been on ice since June with the election of conservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.“We are working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically and seek a return to the JCPOA,” Biden said, referring to the original signatories of the agreement – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. “We are prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does the same.”Raisi, in a recorded message to the UN, said he supported a resumption of talks on Iran is nuclear programme, if it would lead to the US removing sanctions it has imposed on the Iranian economy since 2018. Biden urged using diplomacy, not violence, to resolve tensions in the Middle East, reasserting his administration is support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“The commitment of the USs to Israel is security is without question, and our support for an independent, Jewish state is unequivocal,” Biden said.“But I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel is future as a Jewish, democratic state living in peace alongside a viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian state.”Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ruled out allowing the establishment of a Palestinian state under his government before a meeting with Bidenat the White House.",2,2,Al Jazeera
488,I am high-risk for COVID-19 and eligible for a vaccine starting Monday. What do I need to know?,0.0,50.67,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/14/im-high-risk-for-covid-19-and-eligible-for-a-vaccine-starting-monday-what-do-i-need-to-know/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-14,17,"On Monday, Californians age 16 to 64 with underlying conditions can receive the coronavirus vaccine, adding 4.4 million people to the list of eligible folks. It is a population that is particularly vulnerable at any age to suffer the worst of the disease, officials said. But it will also be “challenging,” officials said, citing a liberal screening process designed to balance the need to verify a person is condition with the urgency of vaccinating as many people as possible. Officials caution that just because eligibility begins on Monday, it does not mean you will be getting a shot immediately. While supplies are increasing at hundreds of clinics, pharmacies, mobile sites and pods, they remain in limited supply. Remember, vaccines are still being given to millions of healthcare workers, seniors, front line workers and teachers, who have priority in the initial phases of the rollout. In Los Angeles County alone, for example, 2 million people with underlying conditions will become eligible next week, officials said Friday. The sheer demand sprung concerns about the extent to which people would be properly screened, and whether people would jump the line under the guise of having a medical condition. For those receiving a vaccine under this qualification, county officials said they were encouraging documentation of a condition but it was not required. Instead, the minimum threshold was that the resident attest to being at high risk, or having a disability that puts them at risk.“We certainly hope people will not try to take advantage of the situation,’ said LA County Department of Public Health Chief Science Officer Dr. Paul Simon. “We do not feel like it is realistic for our staff at the community sites to screen people. We do not have the medical expertise or the knowledge of the person is medical history to make that determination. That is why we are really urging people to go their provider.”In essence, officials are leaning on people is honesty to make it work.“The reasoning behind self-attestation is that, as you can imagine, it is going to be really hard to prove or verify individuals having certain kinds of comorbidities,” Orange County Health Care Agency Deputy Director of Public Health Services Margaret Bredehoft said. You ca not tell someone has diabetes by looking at the m, and physicians’ orders and prescriptions come in all kinds of formats, she said, noting there are also privacy concerns with asking people to share their medical records. Some county sites will continue to check IDs to verify a person is age, residency or workplace and that they have an appointment. Relying on people is honesty could allow some to jump the line, and “that’d be my concern,” Regional Center of Orange County Executive Director Larry Landauer said. The center coordinates services for OC residents with developmental disabilities.“There is people that absolutely need priority, and they should have something from their doctor.”Landauer said his and other regional centers are working to get a letter approved by the state Department of Public Health that they can distribute to clients showing they are eligible for vaccination in the phase that opens Monday. People between 16 and 64 are eligible if they have one of these conditions:State criteria also lays out that a person can be eligible as a result of a developmental or other “significant, high-risk disability,” one or more of the following criteria applies:State officials say this group would include all enrolled users of regional centers, independent living centers; in-home supportive services; community-based adult services and adult day health centers; Medi-Cal HIV/AIDS waivers; Medi-Cal home and community-based alternatives waiver programs; Medi-Cal Assisted Living waiver programs; all-inclusive care for the elderly programs; California Children is Services program (if the child is 16-21 years old); and the California Genetically Handicapped Persons Program. Number Under state guidance, confidentiality is protected, so there is no documentation required of a diagnosis or type of disability. But under the state is guidance, expect to be asked to sign a “self-attestation” that you meet the criteria. Riverside County spokeswoman Brooke Federico said adults who show up for a vaccine appointment next week will be shown a screening sheet with a list of various illnesses and asked if they fall into one of those categories.“If the resident answers in the affirmative, they will be vaccinated,” she said via email. “No note from their doctor or copy of medical records are required.”Residents should make sure they are eligible before scheduling an appointment, Federico added.“It is possible appointments will be filled quickly,” she said, adding that more appointments are opened each week as the county receives more vaccine doses. County Public health officials recommend checking with your health provider first. While supplies are limited, some health systems and their affiliated clinics are vaccinating — and they may have appointments available. For instance, in San Bernardino County, officials were asking residents to first ask their health care providers about vaccinations, county spokesman David Wert said via email. If you do not have a provider, or your provider does not offer vaccinations, you can make an appointment through the county is vaccination web site or hotline, Wert said.“If they make an appointment at a public vaccination clinic or pharmacy, we are asking them to bring a form of verification of their high-risk medical condition or disability, which mirrors the guidance from the state,” Wert added. Do not be surprised if your provider reaches out to you first. For example, Kaiser Permanente is supply continues to increase.“We will use this increased supply to significantly increase the number of our members we are able to vaccinate,” according to a statement from the giant provider. “Kaiser Permanente has already begun reaching out to our newly eligible members with underlying conditions, starting with those with the highest risk.”Beyond a health provider, here is how to get an appointment if you are newly eligible:Counties across California are expanding ways to get vaccine to neighborhoods where they are needed most. Mobile unit teams are expanding. For options, state officials recommend checking with your health care provider, local public health department, or your local pharmacy. According to state officials, if you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan is member services to request help for transportation to received covered benefits.

490,Hard-liner Raisi is 'engineered' Iran election win entrenches conservative rule,-5.67,39.0,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hard-liner-raisi-s-engineered-iran-election-win-entrenches-conservative-n1271616,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-21,25,"Hard-line judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi is win in Iran is presidential election last weekend was an unsurprising end to a process that had long seemed geared toward entrenching conservative rule in the Islamic Republic. The 60-year-old ultraconservative sailed through to a landslide victory Saturday, capturing nearly 62 percent of the vote and Iran is highest civilian position after eight years of President Hassan Rouhani is more moderate rule. A protege of Iran isSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,Raisihas been sanctioned by theUSsand has also faced a barrage of criticism from human rights groups for his alleged involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners. He will take power at a precarious time for the country, which is attempting to revive its tattered2015 nuclear deal with world powers, recover from theCovid-19 pandemic, bolster itssanctions-battered economy, and face up to the old age of its supreme leader. Asked about his alleged involvement in the 1988 mass executions during his first news conference as president-elect Monday, Raisi described himself as a “defender of human rights.”It marked a rare public accounting with a dark moment in Iranian history at the end of its war with neighboring Iraq. Asked whether he would meet withPresident Joe Biden, Raisi responded simply, “no.”A Department of State spokesperson said Sunday that while Raisi had been declared the winner, “Iranians were denied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process.” The spokesperson added that the State Department is Iran policy was designed to advance US interests “regardless of who is in power,” and that it would like to build on progress made during the latest round of talks to revive the nuclear deal in Vienna. Iranwatchers said Raisi is win was no coincidence as the nation creeps toward what could be a crucial moment in the decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Ahead of the vote, Iran is Guardian Council, a group of clerics and legal experts that vets candidates for elections, whittled down the nearly 600 applicants to be Iran is next president to seven approved candidates. The most high-profile moderate challengers were disqualified.“It is what we call electoral engineering,” Clément Therme, a research associate at the European University Institute in Florence, said in an interview ahead of the vote. “The list of seven is designed to make Raisi win.”It did the trick. Raisi is now likely to serve two four-year terms and consequently could be at the helm when the 82-year-old Khamenei dies and through the subsequent transition of power to the Islamic Republic is third supreme leader. Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House think tank, said it was clear engineering ahead of the election was trying to create a conservative win.“A conservative president would help manage succession and political transition, that might also require constitutional reform,” she said ahead of the vote. “They need internal conservative consensus in order to shepherd through a process that Khamenei would like to be very carefully managed.”Khamenei is successor remains unknown. Speculation has already begun that Raisi might be a contender for the position, along with Khamenei is son, Mojtaba. The succession could heighten tension between those who believe in internal reform to ensure the security and stability of the Islamic Republic and conservatives like Raisi who believe in maintaining the status quo. Raisi is a close adherent to Khamenei is political ideology and has already held top establishment jobs in Iran, including as head of the judiciary.“The election is about power transition and policy continuity post-Khamenei,” said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, also before the vote. “That is why Khamenei has gambled so much, engineered so much, embarrassed himself so much by disqualifying pretty much anyone.”The sense that the vote served more as a coronation than a democratic exercise appeared to boost an already widespread sense of apathy among many Iranians who have lost faith in the system — less than half of eligible voters turned out to vote, compared to 73 percent in the last presidential election.“There is this crisis of legitimacy of the Islamic Republic,” Therme said. “People, they do not want to vote to give some legitimacy to the system as a whole.”The low turnout may also have helped Raisi win. That is because when the public votes en masse, it tends to vote for pragmatic and reformist candidates, according to Vakil, of Chatham House. Iranians have become deeply frustrated with reformists whom they see as having failed to deliver results, analysts said. Supporters of the regime, by contrast, were likely to turn out for Raisi because he is the candidate of the “system.”As head of Iran is judiciary, Raisi is accused by Human Rights Watch of presiding over an institution responsible for the use of torture to obtain coerced confessions, prosecution of peaceful dissidents in unfair trials, and lack of respect for due process rights. Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions in the world, second only to China.“As head of Iran is repressive judiciary,” Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said, Raisi “oversaw some of the most heinous crimes in Iran is recent history, which deserve investigation and accountability rather than election to high office.”In Iran the president sets domestic policy. Raisi will inherit a struggling economy that has faced years of crippling US sanctions after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran is nuclear deal in 2018. He has also pledged to fight poverty and corruption. He is married to a university professor and has two daughters, one of whom appeared on state television ahead of the election and spoke of her father is simple way of life. Reyhaneh Sadat also spoke of her father is commitment to “building bridges” between men and women. Foreign policy, however, lies firmly in the hands of the supreme leader. It thus remains unclear what, if anything, Raisi is win will mean for the fate of the tattered nuclear deal that world powers are currently attempting to revive. Raisi has said he is supportive of the pact, which suspended international sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program, and is expected to back any eventual decision of the supreme leader. Asked about the country is ballistic missile program and Tehran is support of regional militias at the news conference Monday, Raisi described the issues as “nonnegotiable.”“He ca not be successful unless the JCPOA is rehabilitated,” Vakil said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. She pointed out that Raisi is populist agenda to fight poverty was hugely contingent on accessing Iran is foreign reserves and sanctions relief. Nevertheless, his win may make diplomacy between Tehran and the West more complicated. He will be the first serving Iranian president sanctioned by the US government even before entering office. Newly-elected Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has described Raisi as the “hangman of Tehran” and said his election was the last chance for world powers to “wake up” before returning to the nuclear agreement and to understand whom they are doing business with.“With sanctions hanging over him, he is not going to be able to engage in diplomacy,” Vakil said. “Let alone make trips to the UN.”Saphora Smith is a UK based freelance journalist.",1,2,NBC News

At least one out of every 378 Americans tested positive for the coronavirus this week, the COVID Tracking Project calculated. At this pace, the US will record its world-leading 11th million case by early next week, and may soon report more than 200,000 new cases per day. Testing is increasing, though much slower than case growth.pic.twitter.com/poiE2vkY2rNew restrictions on public gatherings and some new lock downs have been ordered in multiple states, with more measures looming. As the pointed out on Friday, this latest ongoing surge is spread out across most of the country but is now hitting the Upper Midwest the hardest:Unlike the first surge last spring, when the New York metropolitan area was ravaged but much of the country was almost untouched, this wave is washing over every part of the USs. Case numbers are trending upward in 46 states, and no states are seeing declines. More than 30 states, from Alaska to New Hampshire, have set new records in recent days. California recorded its 1 millionth case, a milestone previously reached only by Texas. But the outlook is especially dire in the Great Lakes region. Pennsylvania, Indiana and Minnesota all exceeded their previous single-day records on Thursday by more than 1,000 cases. Governor Mike DeWine of Ohiowarnedthat hospitalizations had soared to record levels. Wisconsin surpassed 300,000 known cases this week, an increase of more than 130,000 in just a month.

492,Earn Our Votes: The Black National Convention Aims to Set an Agenda That Both Political Parties Must Address,-16.33,32.33,https://www.theroot.com/earn-our-votes-the-black-national-convention-aims-to-s-1844879575,https://adfontesmedia.com/root-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,24,"If there will not be peace, the n let there be a lesson in the destruction of Black bodies. Let the funerals of those unarmed Black bodies killed by police resonate on a frequency so high that it breaks through white silence, shakes the rafters of white supremacy, and seeps into the consciousness of America. Let the hasht ag serve as a warning, a reminder, a coded message in a slave is song that Black Lives Matter. And once the ashes and the dust and the smoke disappears, let the agenda serve as a ransom note, stating flatly that what existed before was broken and what comes next must be better. That is the impetus behind the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), a coalition of some 50 nationwide Black-focused community groups that have banded together under the spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement to host the first ever virtual and free Black National Convention (BNC), to day, August 28 at 7 p.m. ET, a few hours after the 2020 March on Washington ends. (is a media partner of the BNC.)On Friday, activists from across the country will commemorate the anniversary of the 1963 March on…“What this convention will do is create a Black liberation agenda that is not a duplication of the Vision for Black Lives, but really is rooted as a set of demands for progress,”said Jessica Byrd, co-founder of the Electoral Justice Project (EJP) at the Movement for Black Lives. The Movement for Black Lives and the EJP—the electoral strategy arm of M4BL—will focus the Black National Convention on creating a unified Black platform whose demands for both the people and their respective communities are met.“Friday is Black National Convention will be a celebration of Blackness and building political power including Black people from all corners of our movement and the world—from Capitol Hill, Hollywood, and academia to the rural south,” said Byrd. “About 90 percent of the BNC is made up of local organizers, and we have commissioned a host of Black filmmake rs and Black creatives to produce a program that not only activates Black people politically, but champions Black joy, creativity, and resilience.”The lineup of speakers at the BNC is a who is who of those who have been doing the work, or to paraphrase the late John Lewis, causing good trouble, including: Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, #MeToo Movement founder Tarana Burke, writer and transgender rights activist Raquel Willis, Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. The event will be live streamed ona nd on the websiteBlackNovember.org, and directed by award-winning writer andSurviving R Kellyfilmmaker dream hampton.“I have long thought there was great storytelling to do in the world of Black activism,”hampton said. “The real stars have always been these organizers who get things done.”The convention was originally scheduled to take place inAmerica is Blackest city, Detroit, but as with most things in 2020, the coronavirus had different plans. Take the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the recent shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin, not to mention the staggeringly disproportionate number of Blacks killed by the coronavirus, and what you have is a pressure cooker that could be cooled with a Black agenda that prioritizes Black concerns, which includes but is not limited to: a call to end police violence, divestment from policing, and an investment in flourishing, sustainable communities, the group is web site notes. The 2020 Black National Convention will take inspiration and guidance from the 1972 National Black Political Convention, which brought thousands of African-Americans to Gary, Ind., to advocate for the betterment of Black people. What is hauntingly scary is the issues that plagued Black America in 1972 are the same issues that plague us today. Fromthe Gary Declaration, the doctrine that emerged from the 1972 convention:Our cities are crime-haunted dying grounds. Huge sectors of our youth — and countless others — face permanent unemployment. Those of us who work find our paychecks able to purchase less and less. Neither the courts nor the prisons contribute to anything resembling justice or reformation. The schools are unable — or unwilling — to educate our children for the real world of our struggles. Meanwhile, the officially approved epidemic of drugs threatens to wipe out the minds and strength of our best young warriors. The idea is not to leave the convention with an endorsement as the M4BL notes emphatically that they are “anti-Trump and pro-visionary.” They are clear that work needs to be done on both sides to ensure that Black issues are not only addressed but eradicated.“An endorsement is not our North Star,” said Kayla Reed, co-founder & executive director, Action St. Louis. “Our agenda is our North Star, and while we want Trump out of office, we also want elected officials to be aware that what they have done currently and what they have proposed is not enough.”So they will converge virtually to create a doctrine that will serve as a sacred document that the Black vote comes with demands and that the old system of doing things is not just ineffective, it is broken beyond repair. But the fight will continue and those in power have been put on notice: Black Lives Matter. Check back at 7 p.m. for the live stream of the event. Powered by",1,0,The Root

494,How difficult will Trump is environmental horrors be for a Biden administration to fix?,-18.67,41.67,https://www.mic.com/p/how-difficult-will-trumps-environmental-horrors-be-for-a-biden-administration-to-fix-40771842,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-28,25,"Donald Trump, who lies all the time, occasionally feels moved to brag that the USs has the “cleanest air” and the “cleanest water” in the world. It is not his highest-profile fib, but it is one of the most audacious, considering that his administration has spent the last four years dismantling regulation sand making it easier for industry to pollute the nation is air and waterways. Most significantly, he has rolled back an Obama-era requirement that cars be more fuel-efficient,dramatically loosened emission requirements for power plants, and allowed oil and gas companies to freely leak methane— a particularly nasty greenhouse gas — into the atmosphere. Like most of Trump is anti-environment, pro-corporate agenda, this dismantling of regulations has been carried out quietly and entirely through the executive branch. When federal agencies change regulations they do not need to seek the approval of Congress in many cases; instead they go through a fairly lengthy process of submitting a rule change, soliciting public input, and surviving the inevitable legal challenge. This can take years: That rule on methane took until August 2020 to finalize, and an attempt to strip California of its longstanding ability to set its own vehicle emission standards is still being fought in court. If Joe Biden, currently favored in the polls by a substantial margin, wins the election, his administration will be able to reverse these Trump policies, just as Trump reversed numerous Obama policies intended to fight climate change. But changing regulations is like turning around a battleship, and Biden will not be able to simply erase the last four years on day one. Here is how that process would play out. When Trump took office, Republicans in Congress used a relatively obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act to wipe out more than a dozen regulations enacted by the Obama administration. The CRA allows Congress to block rules recently made by an agency; functionally, this lets a new president is party reverse decisions made in the final months of the previous administration as long as they also have control of both chambers of Congress. (Exactly how recent a rule can be to get erased depends on the legislative calendar.)Since a Biden victory may coincide with Democrats retaking the Senate, the Democrats are now thinking about how to use the CRA to reverse some ofTrump is regulatory actions. The most significant target in terms of emissions is probably the weakening of rules on methane leaks, which was only put into place this August.“If there is a Democratic House and a Senate and a Democratic president, the n just as there was at the beginning of the Trump administration, when Republicans had the trifecta, the re is the opportunity to use this law to reverse things that were done,” said David Doniger, a climate expert and senior adviser to the Natural Resource Defense Council Action Fund. Doniger cautioned that there were two wrinkles to this approach. The first is that when the CRA is used to erase a rule, it ca not be immediately replaced with a similar one—even if that new rule is a lot stricter on, say, emissions standards than the old one. So if Democrats think that this would restrain the EPA from making a new rule in a specific area, they may not want to go the CRA route. The second problem is that Democrats will not just want to roll back Trump is actions but establish new regulatory benchmarks that target emissions more aggressively than Obama did. That will take a while. The CRA ca not be used to reverse older Trump administration actions, like its weakening of car and power plant emissions standards. In those cases, the Biden administration will have to go through the rule making process laid out in the Administrative Procedures Act, which is just as boring as it sounds. Essentially agencies need to come up with good reasons for changing their rules and seek out public comment, which can take years. An agency that does not follow the rules on rule making risks losing lawsuits, which is exactly what happened to the Trump administration — judges have repeatedly ruled against his EPA on cases governing everything from landfill emissions to water rules.“They got their heads handed to them in court for having not followed the administrative procedures,” Doniger said. “They tried to do things really fast, and they cut corners and they lost on the grounds that they just did not follow the rules.”A Biden administration is likely not going to be as world-historically incompetent as the Trump administraton, and the refore will be able to do things more quickly, somewhat counterintuitive ly by taking their time. Doniger added that career EPA employees, who generally want to police polluters rather than help the m, may be more enthusiastic about working around the clock to help roll back Trump is policies than they were about enacting them in the first place. Still, it will take a year or two at a minimum for new rules to come out, Doniger said. And new rules are always challenged by lawsuits that will take months to work their way through the court system — which adds yet another element to this process. After Amy Comey Barrett is confirmation vote on Monday, Republican-appointed justices hold a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. This could have all sorts of ramifications, including a potential weakening of the EPA is authority to do anything at all. For three and a half decades the courts have abided by a doctrine called “deference,” named after a 1984 case, which states that if the technical language in a law could have many possible meanings, judges should defer to the relevant agency when it comes to interpreting it, since that agency is experts have the knowledge to do so. If conservative justices really want to weaken bodies like the EPA, they could weaken or overturnChevrondeference, which would require Congress to pass more pieces of legislation to direct agencies to take particular actions. The silver lining in the clouds here, Doniger pointed out, is that a Democratically controlled Congress could respond to such a ruling by passing more specific laws — and they will be likely looking to pass climate change legislation anyway. For instance, if the Supreme Court suddenly decided to overturn the2007 ruling that declared the EPA could regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act, Congress could respond by updating the CAA to explicitly mention greenhouse gases as a pollutant. It is unclear how aggressive conservatives on the Supreme Court will be in trying to stop a Biden administration from regulating emissions and protecting the environment. But agencies will have the opportunity to carefully write rules that will be difficult for even right-wing justices to toss out, and Congress will be pressured by a slew of newclimate-focused organizations like the Sunrise Movementto push back on any court ruling that makes fighting climate change harder. These conflicts will be slow-boiling and take place out of the spotlight, in agency hearings and court filings and congressional committee meetings. But even if it takes years, if Biden wins next week he should be able to change many of the rules Trump put in place.“Especially if the Democrats take the Senate, the re is going to be opportunities to legislate that have not been there before,” Doniger said. “There is going to be this unpredictable interplay between the administrative path, judiciary and the Congress.”",1,1,Mic
495,"Hey President Biden, Thanks but I Do not Want “Unity”",-14.67,29.67,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35268232/president-biden-unity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,16,"Joe Biden faces a slew of challenges as he takes over the job of president of the USs this week: An ongoing pandemic, which the former president chose to downplay over and over again, continues to ravage the nation. We are just two weeks removed from a violent insurrection at the US Capitol that resulted in several deaths. The plague of systemic racism still wreaks havoc in all sorts of ways every day. It is going to take a lot of work from a lot of people to right these wrongs. So it is hardly a surprise that during his inaugural address—the official the me for the day, btw, was “America United”—President Biden decided to focus on “unity.” But I have to ask, what unity, Mr. President, do you speak of?If it is the same“unity” that prominent members of the Republican party are now calling fo rin the wake of what many considered to be the worst attack on the US federal government since 9/11, keep it. That type of “unity” is not about ending a deep-seated divide or quashing the rise of misinformation that mothered it. It is about allowing men like Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Ted Cruz (who today wore a mask emblazoned with the words “Come and take it”), and others who felt empowered to subvert a fair and free election to sidestep the consequences of their actions. Numerous reports indicate thatGOP Representative Lauren Boebert allegedly gave tours ahead of the insurrection. Six Republican senators and 121 Republican House members declined to certify votes for Biden as president. Why extend an olive branch to those who are willing and waiting to burn our democracy down?If Biden is idea of “unity” is continuing to appease anti-abortion politicians, forget it. In a country where1 out of every 4 women(to say nothing of the trans and non-binary people) will have an abortion by the time they are 45, a reported77 percent of Americans support. A reportedone-third of Republicans do not believe in their party is stance on abortion. Abortion is a common outcome of pregnancy, and to pretend otherwise for the sake of “bipartisanship” is not an act of unity but an act of willful ignorance. There can be no “unity” if those in power continue to overlook the persisting inequalities that have made it possible forCOVID-19 to disproportionately impact Black and Latinx people. There is no “togetherness” if those in positions of power continue to perpetuate the status quo when working moms are being pushed out of the workforce at disproportionate rates, thanks in no small part to the persisting inequalities that exist inside the home. To place an importance on “harmony” and “unification” when more than 500 immigrant children cannot be reunited with parents the US government forcefully separated them from is to blatantly deny that the history of this country is rooted in white supremacy that still very much exists, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. When those in positions of power—usually old white men—call for unity, it often comes at the cost of justice for those who have never and will never know such influence. Yes, in 2021 and likely the years that follow, the US faces what Biden called “a historic moment of crisis and challenge,” but this moment is far from new. If anything, it is a continuation of what can only be described as an American legacy, one that overlooks the most disenfranchised for the sake of the most influential. The ugly job of ridding this country of racism, sexism, bigotry, and hate is not accomplished by simply looking ahead and moving forward. Nor by bargaining with those who have gleefully upheld those ideologies. It is achieved after substantial contemplation, earned knowledge, and hard lines drawn in the proverbial sand. It is realized when “whataboutism” is disregarded and the allusion of “both sides” gives way to truthful, meaningful debate. It is difficult to ignore the siren sound of Biden is calls for unity. At face value, his insistent need to reach across the political aisle is heartwarming—even inspiring. That is, of course, until reality elbows its way to the forefront of your mind and you recall that to stand “unified” with a substantial population of this country is to, at best, be okay with people who might want you dead. To be “unified” with these people is to throw Black, brown, poor, and LGBTQ+ people under the political bus. I do not want unity, Mr. President. I want integrity. I want equity. I want accountability. I want justice served to those who knowingly lied to the American people and undermined our democracy.

497,Andrew Cuomo To Be Questioned In Sexual Harassment Investigation,0.0,45.33,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-cuomo-questioned-sexual-harassment-investigation_n_60f0c39ce4b0d5140ebe3ac0,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"ALBANY, NY (AP) — New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is expected to be interviewed Saturday as the state attorney general is office winds down its investigation into sexual harassment allegations that upended his national reputation and threatened his hold on power as he gears up to run for a fourth term next year. The timing of the interview in Albany, the state is capital, was confirmed Thursday to The Associated Press by two people familiar with the investigation. They were not authorized to speak publicly about the case and did so on condition of anonymity. Investigators were always expected to speak with Cuomo, who said at the start of the probe in March that he would “fully cooperate.”Saturday is interview signals that investigators are nearly done with their work, which has included interviews with the governor is accusers, though they may need some time to tie up loose ends before a report is issued. Several women have accused Cuomo, a Democrat, of inappropriate touching and offensive remarks. Cuomo initially apologized and said that he “learned an important lesson” about his behavior around women, though he is since denied that he did anything wrong and questioned the motivations of accusers and fellowDemocratswho have called for his resignation. Cuomo, in office since 2011,has rebuffed calls to step aside over the allegations. A message seeking comment was left with Cuomo is lawyer, Rita Glavin. A Cuomo spokesperson said Thursday he had no comment. The state attorney general is office declined comment.“We have said repeatedly that the governor does not want to comment on this review until he has cooperated, but the continued leaks are more evidence of the transparent political motivation of the attorney general is review,” Cuomo senior advisor Richard Azzopardi said. The scheduled interview with Cuomo was reported first by The New York Times. Former aide Lindsey Boylan accuses Cuomo of having harassed her throughout her employment and said he once suggested a game of strip poker aboard his state-owned jet. Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, said Cuomo once asked her if she ever had sex with older men. Bennett is lawyer, Debra Katz, said Bennett met via Zoom for more than four hours with investigators and also provided them with 120 pages of records to corroborate her accusations. A message seeking comment was left with Katz and lawyers for Boylan and another Cuomo accuser, former aide Alyssa McGrath. The investigation into the allegations against Cuomo is being overseen by the state is independently elected attorney general, Letitia James, who named former federal prosecutor Joon Kim and employment discrimination attorney Anne Clark to conduct the probe and document its findings in a public report. James, also a Democrat, is also investigating whether Cuomo broke the law by having members of his staff help write and promote his pandemic leadership book.

498,"As the Insurrection Narrative Crumbles, Democrats Cling to it More Desperately Than Ever",20.0,30.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/as-the-insurrection-narrative-crumbles,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,16,"six weeks, warnings were issued about imminent, grave threats to public safety posed by the same type of right-wing extremists who rioted at the Capitol on January 6. And both times, these warnings ushered in severe security measures only to prove utterly baseless. First we had the hysteria over the violence we were told was likely to occur at numerous state capitols on Inauguration Day. “Law enforcement and state officials are on high alert for potentially violent protests in the lead-up to Inauguration Day, with some state capitols boarded up and others temporarily closed ahead of Wednesday is ceremony,”announced. In an even scarier formulation,NPRintonedthat “the FBI is warning of protests and potential violence in all 50 state capitals ahead of President-elect Joe Biden is inauguration.”The resulting clampdowns were as extreme as the dire warnings. Washington, DC was militarized more than at any point since the 9/11 attack. The military was highly visible on the streets. And, described, “state capitols nationwide locked down, with windows boarded up, National Guard troops deployed and states of emergency preemptively declared as authorities braced for potential violence Sunday mimicking the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob of pro-Trump rioters.” All of this, said the paper, “reflected the anxious state of the country ahead of planned demonstrations.”But none of that happened — not even close.acknowledgedthree weeks later:Despite warnings of violent plots around Inauguration Day, only a smattering of right-wing protesters appeared at the nation is statehouses. In Tallahassee, just five armed men wearing the garb of the boogaloo movement — a loose collection of anti-government groups that say the country is heading for civil war — showed up. Police and National Guard personnel mostly ignored them. All over the country it was the same story. “But at the moment that Biden was taking the oath of office in Washington, the total number of protesters on the Capitol grounds in Topeka stood at five — two men supporting Trump and two men and a boy ridin’ with Biden,”reported(“With Kansas Capitol in lock down mode, Inauguration Day protest fizzles). “The protests fizzled out after not many people showed up,”reportedthe local Florida affiliate in Tallahassee. “The large security efforts dwarfed the protests that materialized by Wednesday evening,”saidCNN, as “state capitols and other cities remained largely calm.”Indeed, the only politically-motivated violence on Inauguration Day was carried out by Antifa and anarchist groups in Portland and Seattle, which caused some minor property damage as part of anti-Biden protests while they “scuffled with police.”, which spent a full week excitedly hyping the likely violence coming to state capitols by right-wing Trump supporters, was forced to acknowledge in its article about their non-existence that “one exception was Portland, where left-wing protesters damaged the Democratic Party of Oregon building during one of several planned demonstrations.”Completely undeterred by that debacle, Democrats and their media spokes people returned with a new set of frightening warnings for this week. The date of March 4 has taken on a virtually religious significance for the Q-Anon movement, announcedBen Collins, who was heard on NPRon Thursday speaking through actual, literal journalistic tears as he recounted all the times he called Facebook to plead with them to remove dangerous right-wing extremists on their platform(tears commence at roughly 7:00 mark). Valiantly holding back full-on sobbing, Collins explained that he proved to be so right but it pains and sorrows him to admit this. With his self-proclaimed oracle status fully in place, he prop he sized that March 4 had taken on special dangers because Q-Anon followers concluded that this is when Trump would be inaugurated. ShareThis is how apocalyptic cult leaders always function. When the end of the world did not materialize on January 6, Collins insisted that January 20 was the day of the violent reckoning. When nothing happened on that day, he moved the Doomsday Date to March 4. The flock cannot remain in a state of confusion for too long about why the world has not ended as promised by the prophet, so a new date must quickly be provided with an explanation for why this is serious business this time. This March 4 paranoia was not confined to NBC is resident millennial hall monitor and censorship advocate. On March 3,warnedthat “theCapitol Policeforce is preparing for another assault on the Capitol building on Thursday after obtaining intelligence of a potential plot by a militia group.” All this, said the Paper of Record, because “intelligence analysts had spent weeks tracking online chatter by some QAnon adherents who have latched on to March 4 — the original inauguration date set in the Constitution — as the day Donald J Trump would be restored to the presidency and renew his crusade against America is enemies.”These dire warnings also, quite predictably, generated serious reactions. “House leaders on Wednesday abruptly moved a vote on policing legislation from Thursday to Wednesday night, so lawmakers could leave town,” said the. We learned that there would be further militarization of the Capitol and troop deployment in Washingtonindefinitelydue to so-called “chatter.”NPRannounced: “The House of Representatives has canceled its Thursday session after the US Capitol Police said it is aware of a threat by an identified militia group to breach the Capitol complex that day.”Do you know what happened on March 4 when it came to violence from right-wing extremists? The same thing that happened on January 20: absolutely nothing. There were no attempted attacks on the Capitol, state capitols, or any other government institution. There was violent crime registered that day in Washington DC but none of it was political violence by those whom media outlets warned posed such a grave danger that Congress has to be closed and militarization of Washington extended indefinitely. Perhaps the most significant blow to the maximalist insurrection/coup narrative took place inside the Senate on Thursday. Ever since January 6, those who were not referring to the riot as a “coup attempt” — as though the hundreds of protesters intended to overthrow the most powerful and militarized government in history — were required to refer to it instead as an “armed insurrection.”This formulation was crucial not only for maximizing fear levels about the Democrats’ adversaries but also, as I havedocumentedpreviously, because declaring an “armed insurrection” empowers the state with virtually unlimited powers to act against the citizenry. Over and over, leading Democrats and their media allies repeated this phrase like some hypnotic mantra:But this was completely false. As Idetailedseveral weeks ago, so many of the most harrowing and widespread media claims about the January 6 riot proved to be total fabrications. A pro-Trump mob did not bash Office Brian Sicknick is skull in with a fire extinguisher. No protester brought zip-ties with them as some premeditated plot to kidnap members of Congress (two rioters found them on a table inside). There is no evidence anyone intended to assassinate Mike Pence, Mitt Romney or anyone else. Yet the maximalist narrative of an attempted coup or armed insurrection is so crucial to Democrats — regardless of whether it is true — that pointing out these facts deeply infuriates them. A television clip of mine from last week went viral among furious liberals calling me a fascism supporter even though it did nothing but point out the indisputable facts that other than Brian Sicknick, whose cause of death remains unknown, the only people who died at the Capitol riot were Trump supporters, and that there are no known cases of the rioters deliberately killing anyone(Two FBI operatives have since anonymously leaked that it is looking at a “suspect” who may have engaged with Sicknick in a way that ultimately contributed to his death. Butnothing still is known; Sicknick is mother claims he died of a stroke while his brother says it was from pepper spray; and all of this is worlds away from the endlessly repeated media claim that a bloodthirsty pro-Trump mob savagely bashed his head in with a fire extinguisher.)What we know for sure is that no Trump supporter fired any weapon inside the Capitol and that the FBI seized a grand total of firearms from those it arrested that day — a rather odd state of affairs for an “armed insurrection,” to put that mildly. In questioning from Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Thursday is hearing, a senior FBI official, Jill Sanborn, acknowledged this key fact:(The “one lady” who died referred to by this FBI official was Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed Trump supporter who was killed when she was shot point blank in the neck inside the Capitol on January 6 by an armed Capitol Police Officer). The key point to emphasize here is that threats and dangers are not binary: they either exist or they are fully illusory. They reside on a spectrum. To insist that they be discussed rationally, soberly an dis not to deny the existence of the threat itself. One can demand a rational and fact-based understanding of the magnitude of the threat revealed by the January 6 riot without denying that there is any danger at all. Those who denounced the excesses of McCarthyism were not insisting that there were no Communists in government; those denouncing the excesses of the Clinton administration is attempts to seize more surveillance power after the Oklahoma City courting bombing were not denying thatanti-government militias may do violence again; those who objected to the protracted and unhinged assault on civil liberties by the Bush/Cheney and Obama administrations after 9/11 were not arguing that there werenoMuslim extremists intent on committing violence. The argument the n, and the argument now, is that the threat was being deliberately inflated and exaggerated, and fears stoked and exploited, both for political gain and to justify the placement of more and more powers in the hands of the state in the name of stopping these threats. That is the core formula of authoritarianism — to place the population in a state of such acute fear that it acquiesces to any assertion of power which security state agencies and politicians demand and which they insist are necessary to keep everyone safe. There is, relatedly, a massive political benefit from convincing the population that the opponents and critics of those in power do not merely hold a different ideology but are coup plotters, insurrectionists,. That is the same political benefit that accrued from trying to persuade the population that adversaries of the Democratic Party were treasonous Kremlin agents. The more you can demonize your opponents as something monstrous, the more political power you can acquire. And as Democrats and liberals now gear up to demand a new War on Terror, this one domestic in nature, it should be no surprise that the rhetorical leaders of their effort now are the same lowlife neo con and Rovian slanderers — Bill Kristol, David Frum, Steve Schmidt, Nicolle Wallace, Rick Wilson — who demonized everyone who questioned them as part of the first War on Terror as traitors and terrorist-lovers and subversives. It is not a coincidence that neo cons are leading the way now as liberals’ favorite propagandists: they are the most skilled and experienced in weapon izing and exaggerating terrorism threats for political gain and authoritarian power. Ultimately, if this “armed insurrection” and threat of domestic terrorism are so grave, why do media figures and politicians in both parties — from Adam Schiff to Liz Cheney — keep lying about it and peddling fictions? Politicians and media figures do that only when they know that the threat, in reality, is not nearly as menacing as they need it to be to fulfill their objectives of political gain and coercive power.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

500,Next pandemic threat to economy: A wave of evictions,-6.33,44.33,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2020/0722/Next-pandemic-threat-to-economy-A-wave-of-evictions,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The first of the month had come and gone, and now in early July the man with the clipboard arrived at the apartments on North Hopkins Street, a plain two-story brick building where grass and weeds grow scraggly along the street and broken furniture lies abandoned around the dumps ter out back. To tenants he was a figure of doom. On the second floor, he stuck a folded eviction notice in the door of Apartment 14, two units down from where Sorea Appling lived. It was not long before Apartment 14 is tenant, and the woman in Apartment 5 downstairs, had found new places to live.“They say once you get your door knocked on by the man with the clipboard, you might as well leave,” says Ms. Appling, a public school janitor who has been out of work since March and worries that she might be next. Government aid for individuals during the pandemic was speedy but also limited in its duration. The expiration of eviction bans is a test of whether the US will let a health crisis also become a housing crisis. Her worries are increasingly shared by renters across the nation. For several months during the coronavirus pandemic a combination of tenant grit, landlord forbearance, and federal aid has helped people stay in their homes. State or local bans on evictions have in many cases offered a reprieve. Now those eviction bans are phasing out along with key government support for unemployed workers. With the economy far from recovered, some of the steepest declines in income have been faced by low-income renters like Ms. Appling. By some estimates, the USs could see more than 11 million households evicted in the next four months.“People are going to go over a cliff,” says Mary Cunningham, a housing expert at the nonprofit Urban Institute, and co-author of a new analysis on the problem. “We have seen this coming. We have been racing toward it with the clock running out and, so far, Congress has not responded.”Analogies like “cliff” or “tsunami” are apt. As the Senate convenes this week to consider new coronavirus relief, a key question is whether the resulting bill will include provisions to help at-risk renters. The expiring supports – from the CARES Act passed by Congress in April – include an eviction moratorium for the roughly one-quarter of rental properties that get federal backing, plus supplemental unemployment benefits that have so far buoyed up millions of households. Although some states have moved to extend eviction bans, the potential for mass evictions on an unprecedented scale looms. Economists say such an eviction wave could deepen poverty, widen racial inequality, and create severe new damage to the economy that will take years to repair.“The issue of inability to pay, poverty, and unemployment – that existed pre-COVID-19,” says Raphael Ramos, a lawyer with Legal Action Wisconsin and head of its Eviction Defense Project. “The difference between now and the n is that the pandemic has shifted the line of poverty. There are more people at risk than before.”Indeed, the coronavirus is amplifying a problem that has long festered in Milwaukee and other cities. Housing advocates say evictions are a symptom of a combination of chronic problems like low-paying jobs, too little affordable housing, and public transportation systems that are inadequate to take people to where the work is. Renters often scrape by on margins too narrow to absorb even modest difficulties.“A good part of our clients are not in 40-hour jobs, but in a patchwork of jobs – babysitter, bus driver, hair cutters,” says Peter Koneazny, litigation director at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, where calls from renters appealing for help have skyrocketed. “You have a lot of that. It is a kind of constant struggle for many people. Their head is barely above water, most of them.”Evictions are sometimes the result of cascading circumstances. Iyonna Hall-Davis was working as a certified nursing assistant in a Milwaukee suburb, often for 16 hours at a time, when she started having trouble with her car, an old 2007 Cadillac. Taking public transportation to work was “not an option,” she says. “No bus came near it.”Her transportation troubles led her employer to cut her hours, and she fell behind on her rent, Ms. Hall-Davis says. At the end of February a payroll check that would have covered what she owed arrived late, forcing her eviction. She is been struggling ever since, moving with her 3-year-old son among family and friends and waiting for her unemployment application to be acted on. She is been waiting 10 weeks. She hopes to use the money to rent a new apartment and buy another car that can take her to work.“Whenever that comes, I will get my life back together,” she says. To stave off the potential crisis, affordable housing advocates are pushing for one or more of the following from Congress: a comprehensive federal ban on evictions to replace the diminishing patchwork of protections currently in place, rental assistance for tenants affected by the pandemic, targeted help for landlords, continuation of the supplemental unemployment benefits at some level, and help for local governments, which are expected to be swamped by eviction notices once the moratoriums end. Many of those provisions are in the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion package passed by House Democrats in May Republicans in the Senate, however, say the Democrats’ measure is far too costly. Some housing groups are optimistic Congress will act. “It is brink negotiations,” says Bob Pinnegar, president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, which represents the rental housing industry. He expects an acceptable package will emerge. Affordable housing advocates are more optimistic about local initiatives. The “cancel rent” movement, for example, notched a victory recently when Ithaca, New York, passed a resolution calling on the state to cancel rent for residents and small businesses for three months. Massachusetts is the latest state to renew a pandemic-related ban on evictions. Its moratorium, which had been set to expire in August, will now stretch through the fall, due to an order Tuesday by Republican Governor Charlie Baker. In Wisconsin, by contrast, a two-month ban set by Democratic Governor Tony Evers expired May 26. That month, the Republican-majority state Supreme Court threw out Governor Evers’ coronavirus order as unconstitutional and mandated that new policies go through a legislative rule-making process. Mr. Ramos and others saw evictions in Wisconsin jump 40% over the previous year in the first week after the state eviction moratorium ended. They are now running 14% higher than last year.“There are a lot of people in this building who are under the threat of eviction,” says Ms. Appling, a slender woman with close-cropped blond hair and a silver crucifix around her neck. “Ever since March, these people have not been able to go to work.”Eviction has big ramifications for families. It makes it much harder to rent from other landlords, pushes families into substandard and more crowded housing, and has been shown to have negative effects on everything from physical and mental health to education for children who have to move from school to school, says Emily Benfer, a law professor at Wake Forest University and co-creator of the COVID-19 housing policy scorecard set up by the Eviction Lab, a research project at Princeton University in New Jersey. Pushing people into more crowded, substandard housing is problematic anytime. Doing it in the midst of rising coronavirus cases makes the potential health fallout much worse, says Ms. Cunningham of the Urban Institute. “It is really reckless during a pandemic to have people lose their housing when we are all trying to socially distance.”Evictions already hit people of color disproportionately. In Boston, a report last month from City Life and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that in non subsidized housing, more than a third of evictions happened in predominantly Black neighborhoods, even though only 18% of the rental housing was in those neighborhoods. That is partly a result of poverty and low income, the researchers said, but the most telling predictor was the neighborhood is racial composition. In the pandemic, people of color are more vulnerable because they are more likely to work the low-wage jobs most at risk during the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail positions, where people ca not work from home. And it is not clear how many of those service jobs will come back as the economic recovery shows signs of slowing. Among Americans in general, the problem of eviction is huge, affecting about 2.3 million households in a year, according to the Eviction Lab. In the next four months, the figure could hit more than 11 million, according to anew data analysis tool by global advisory firm Stout Risius Ross LLC In Milwaukee, on the ninth floor of a downtown apartment building, Edward Smith was alarmed recently to get a notice that he owed more than $3,000 in rent. Mr. Smith, a disabled Army veteran and former paratrooper, says he fell so far behind because he had to pay funeral expenses for his father, who died in May at a nursing home in the Chicago suburbs. Mr. Smith says his father, who was 90, had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I had to help bury him,” he says. Mr. Smith, a tall, friendly man who wears an American flag face mask, says he talked to the building is management after receiving the letter. “They said they are going to be sending out eviction notices at the first of the month,” he says. “I told them I will try – if I can set up a payment program.” But he is worried. He is applied for rental assistance. Wisconsin is spending $25 million of federal COVID-19 relief money to help tenants avoid evictions. The problem is that many renters do not know about the assistance. And housing advocates wonder what happens when the money runs out. In the meantime, many small landlords, too, are on the financial brink, unable to withstand a long-term dive in rental income. Yet some have shown leniency because of COVID-19.“The mom and pop landlords are doing what they can to keep good tenants,” says Lisa Owens, executive director of City Life/Vida Urbana, a tenant advocacy group in Boston. Ms. Appling, the school janitor, was astonished to hear from a friend that another landlord had forgiven tenants a month is rent. Moreover, many landlords know that tenants can apply for rental assistance. They are willing to wait. But not all landlords are so lenient, and as Ms. Appling has observed, evictions can happen suddenly and ruthlessly. She is been spared, but only for now. Furloughed from her job on May 4, she is been able to borrow enough from relatives to pay her $525-a-month rent. And yet the re is a limit to what she can borrow. She is applied for unemployment benefits but has received nothing, even after months of waiting",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

But I do not pay much attention to true pop culture, the things that are legitimately, hugely popular. Maybe that is just the ingrained brainwashing that gets leftover when your friend is older brother introduces you to punk rock in sixth grade. Yet I suspect that such a tendency is not particularly rare among BoingBoing readership. Put another way: y'all probably do not give a shit about Britney Spears. But, as the latest episode ofexplains, you probably should: even theACLUagrees that Spears' father took advantage of her mental abilities and cognitive condition to profit from her stardom, robbing his daughter from her right to autonomy in the process. Plenty of people will feel that initial impulse to think, ""Okay, so why should I care? She is a friggin' world famous pop star."" But the frustrating truth is that the situation that Britney Spears is facing is sadly quite common among people with physical and mental disabilities. People with disabilities do not even have access to the same marriage equality rights that LGBTQ+ people fought for. As the ACLU explained:Britney Spears is subject to a court-imposed conservatorship (in most other states this structure is referred to as a guardianship). This means that a court has determined she is unable to provide properly for her food, clothing, or shelter. The court has the n granted other people — her conservators — the legal right to make decisions for her. News reports indicate that this has been the case for Britneysince 2008. While we do not know the details of Spears' conservatorship, in general, conservators like those in her case have the ability to make decisions about all aspects of her life — where she lives, where and how she spends her money, what medications she takes, who she spends time with, and other decisions. Conservatorship means the court is taking away the civil liberties from one person and giving them to someone else. Sometimes it is ALL of that person is civil rights and civil liberties, and sometimes it is partial. But it is the court weighing into the person is life and saying you, as a person with a disability, are no longer able to make decisions about yourself and livelihood — such as where you live, and how you support and feed yourself — and we are putting someone else in charge of making those decisions. Because it is such an extreme step to take, it is really supposed to be a last resort. And once a court has put a person under a conservatorship, only a court can lift that conservatorship. I thought ""Free Britney!"" was just a weird, silly fan culture meme. I was wrong. So I recommend watching the new episode of—available above, or on FX or Hulu—to learn more about the cruelties of conservatorship as it relates to disability rights.

New York and Connecticut are ending mask mandates that have been in place for much of the past year, while New Jersey is removing limits on indoor gatherings. AdvertisementNew York Governor Andrew Cuomoannounced that his state will adopt the new federal mask and social distancing guidance for fully vaccinated people, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His statewide order requiring masks had been in place since April 2020 and required everyone over the age of 2 to wear a mask when in public. New Jersey will keep its indoor mask mandate.

I do not want to go back,"" New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy said Monday, according toThe New York Times. AdvertisementMurphy lifted the state is outdoor mask mandate on Monday. The CDC issued updated guidance last week that says fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outdoors or indoors in most cases. Private businesses can still impose their own mandates and face coverings are still required in some settings like public transit, nursing homes, homeless shelters, correctional facilities and schools. People who are not yet fully vaccinated or whose immune systems are compromised should continue to wear masks and socially distance, Cuomo said.""We have to reopen. We have to reopen smart, with a cautious eye. We have to get back to life and living and we have to do it the way New Yorkers do it. Unvaccinated people should continue to wear a mask and social distance, but if you are vaccinated you are safe -- no masks, no social distancing,"" Cuomo said, according toWNBC-TV New York City MayorBill de Blasiohas said he will lift all coronavirus restrictions for the city on July 1. Starbucks, Target and CVS are among the companies that no longer require masks in their stores for vaccinated customers unless it is required by law. The governors of all three states had previously announced that the restrictions would be lifted on May 19. They include removing capacity restrictions at restaurants, the aters, museums, gyms and other venues. Under the new rules, businesses are only limited by the space available for customers to maintain the required social distance of 6 feet. Restaurants can separate customers by less than 6 feet if there are barriers between tables. The easing of capacity restrictions includes Broadway, but show producers say they need time to advertise and market before the grand reopening on Sept. 14. Before the end of the year, about 30 shows are planning to begin performances in Broadway the aters. Under the new rules, the indoor social gathering limit in New York will increase from 100 to 250 people and the outdoor limit of 25 people expands to 500. The indoor residential gathering limit rises from 10 to 50 people. Large-scale indoor event venues in New York can now operate at 30% capacity, up from 10%. Large-scale outdoor event venues can operate at 33%.",2,2,UPI
506,Tennessee Is Doing Exactly the Wrong Thing to Stop COVID,-6.0,42.67,https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/tennessee-halt-vaccine-outreach-kids-why.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Tennessee is one of the least-inoculated states in the country, with only38 percent of the state fully vaccinated. Instead of doing everything possible to improve that number, the Tennessee Department of Health has decided to halt adolescent vaccine outreach and cease all COVID vaccination events on school property, theTennessean reported on Monday. But it is an even bigger mess than that: The new vaccine policy, which comes from Health CommissionerDr. Lisa Piercey, is not limited to COVID.vaccine outreach is to be stopped, including back-to-school outreach for routine vaccinations such as measles or HPV And the change comes alongside news that the state is top vaccine official, Dr. Michelle Fiscus, has be enfire dafter passing along legal guidance to vaccine providers detailing the state is mature minor doctrine, which allows 14- to 17-year-olds to obtain medical care without parental consent. Slate spoke with Tennessee-based pediatrician and public health researcherStephen Patrickabout the TDH is new policy, how he is seen attitudes toward vaccines change in recent years, and whether independent organizations will be able to do the work of vaccine outreach the mselves. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. It is very worrisome. We know that we are already behind the ball when it comes to vaccination for kids—vaccination for kids—after COVID-19. A lot of vaccines were delayed. … What I am worried about too is that it sends the wrong message more broadly about the value of vaccination. I think it is a critical time for public health, for pediatricians, to keep talking about vaccination and why we do it. Vaccination really is the cornerstone of both public health and pediatrics. Very concerned, no question about it. There is areport[Thursday] morning that the re is been a tripling of COVID infections in the state. We know that people who are dying from COVID are, by and large, unvaccinated. If you look collectively at the messaging and the attitudes—we are fostering when we are not spreading positive messages about vaccines in the state. I worry about what that will do to our ability to combat COVID Before COVID-19, we had relatively high vaccination rates in Tennessee. While pediatricians in the last decade have seen more worries and more vaccine hesitancy, there has not been anything quite like this before. It was really the conversations around the COVID-19 vaccine—and the conspiracy the ories that permeated—that became a perfect storm for vaccine hesitancy. That is really worrisome and problematic, and I worry it could have generational harm. My hope is that it rapidly shifts back. Like many things, I do not think the re is one specific cause. I think we have seen an erosion of trust in public health and politicization of public health over the last 18 months. I think this is a symptom of that, and another leap in a worrisome direction for caring for the public is health. My colleagues are really disturbed by this. … Vaccines have always been a routine part of the summer! Kids go back for sports physicals, for band camp, and you have outreach for routine vaccination. It should not be any different this year. We should follow the science and do the things we know protect kids and our communities. There was poll of Tennessee parents—from theVanderbilt University Medical Center is Center for Child Health Policyreleased in early spring—that looked at their concerns. One of those concerns was who do parents trust in Tennessee for information on vaccines and COVID-19. Consistently, the TDH was rated at the to p. When you have a trusted partner for parents, it is really important that that trusted partner has a really public stance on the virtues of vaccination. It is really a critical role of state public health agencies. My hope is that the TDH will reassess their decision. At the same time, we see pediatricians in the state and the medical community more broadly speaking out really positively about vaccines. … We have done public messaging, we have written editorials, we have worked in community organizations. … But it does feel like an uphill battle, particularly in weeks like this where the narrative trends so negative toward something that is so foundational. Yes, no question about it. We know that COVID-19—in terms of the disease burden and the complications of the disease—disproportionately impacts Black and Hispanic families. We also know that we have had some lower rates of vaccine uptake from those families, and a little bit more worry about the vaccine from Black parents. That makes the outreach even more important. It is worrisome overall that we are hesitating to do vaccine outreach. One of the pieces here is that the reasons for low vaccine uptake are complicated. One of the reasons relates to trust. As medical and public health professionals, we have to do things that foster trust in the community, and I worry that the TDH actions and the public discussion of them further erodes trust. We have seen complications from COVID-19 in children. There is also a broader, bigger issue: We have gone through a pandemic that has had devastating consequences—beyond the illnesses—to adolescent mental health, to food insecurity. One of the things that is really important to normalize kids’ lives and their access to food is getting back to school. And getting back to school. The path toward that is vaccinating kids. We need to protect kids before they go back to school. I worry that we are failing to see what at his vaccine is, in the midst of this pandemic, and how fortunate and blessed we are to not only have it, but to have it at such a degree—its availability here in the USs in comparison to the rest of the world. COVID-19 hit after a period of chronic disinvestment in public health, and I hope that when we emerge from this, we begin to realize the critical role of public health in protecting allo f us. But right now? I am worried we have not gotten thatmessage.",1,1,Slate

There was Sean Spicer, who got off to a mess of a start on Day One, lying about the attendance at the inauguration. (Kellyanne Conway said he was using “alternative facts.”) Spicer came out of the gate so angry that he was turned into a “Saturday Night Live” skit featuring Melissa McCarthy on a podium that ran into people. Then there was Sarah Sanders, another confrontational press secretary who started having fewer and fewer press briefings. Then came Stephanie Grisham, who did not even bother to have one official White House briefing in her eight months on the job. Then came Kayleigh McEnany, perhaps the most incompetent White House press secretary ever. She spent more time wagging a finger at the media than doing her job, which was to answer questions about the president is work, policies and decisions. So when Jen Psaki held her first press conference as Joe Biden is White House press secretary on Wednesday, it felt like,as CNN is Brian Stelter perfectly put it, a “return to normalcy.”Trump is White House claimed he was making “many calls” and having “many meetings.” The Biden team is actually revealing who Biden is calls and meetings are with. A return to normalcy…pic.twitter.com/Uqkb2x53XU— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter)January 21, 2021But let is all be careful,writes Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan. Sullivan wrote, “The national press — battered by four years of abuse by the president, and by the incompetence and falsehoods of his spokes people — is in a precarious position. We run the risk of being seduced by an administration that, in many cases, closely reflects our values: multiculturalism, a belief in the principles of liberal democracy, and a kind of wonky idealism. (Cue the ‘West Wing’ the me.)”But, Sullivan writes, there could be a return to another kind of normal: that journalists, in an effort to show toughness and objectivity, will become more confrontational. The job of the media, of course, is to hold the powerful accountable — especially the highest office in the land.“But,” Sullivan writes, “there is a difference between truly holding power to account and grandstanding.”The press, according to Sullivan, needs to resist false equivalency. They need to call out lies. They need to use plain language, such as racism and white supremacy, instead of euphemisms. And they need to resist returning to the old journalistic norms. If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter is media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But few share Trump is disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let is build proper support systems and processes to deal with high levels of stress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I am sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.’Our working paper found that the tech giants owe publishers billions of dollars.

The elections, which were held to fill state legislature seats, concluded with Republicans winning both, but that is not really the story. Rather, the story is the change in vote share that happened in these districts, both favoring the GOP compared to their 2020 results. Two GA special elections tonight, neither great news for DemsIn HD156 (rural Georgia), the Dem got 14%. Biden got 25%. In HD35 (suburban ATL), Dems are combining for 42%. But Biden got 47%. Underperformance from the presidential ticket in both.pic.twitter.com/gsRzAVcPdm— Brent Peabody (@brent_peabody)June 16, 2021The results in the more rural district are important because Democrats gaining vote share a lack of turnout to compete with the suburbs those areas handed the Democrats both Georgia Senate seats in January of this year. Blame that on whatever you want, whether it be Lin Wood telling Republicans not to vote or people just feeling disenfranchised after the prior November election, but seeing a return to more normal voting patterns is good for Republican chances in 2022. Remember, Senator Raphael Warnock will already be up for re-election again after just two years. The gains in suburban Atlanta are also something the GOP has been looking for. Again, blame it on what you want, but the GOP lost previously red suburban areas across the country largely due to a shift among college-educated women. Are things returning to normal? If they do, 2022 is going to be more than just the GOP taking the House by a slim margin, which would already be enough to give Nancy Pelosi a stroke. Conventional wisdom has placed Georgia as “lean D” following 2020, but perhaps what happened prior was the aberration? Maybe those rushing to redefine the entire state were overreacting? It is starting to feel that way. I certainly would not bet on Warnock in 2022 given he only won by 93,000 votes in a special election that might as well have been cooked up in a lab to favor him. With the opposition party already having built-in advantages in the first midterm of a new presidency, gains like we saw last night can lead to much bigger things. Nothing is dispositive this early in the game, but anyone who is honest would much rather be the GOP heading into 2022 right now.",0,0,RedState
509,More than a Meal: How Austin Ministries Are Expanding Thei......,-1.67,46.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/may/austin-camping-ban-tx-homeless-ministry-housing-church.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"East of downtown Austin, a row of more than 20 closely linked tents and makeshift shelters are set up outside the Terrazas Branch of the Austin Public Library, around the corner from Christ Church of Austin. The church is associate rector, Matt Dampier, visits the homeless encampment on Sundays to meet with people and offer Communion. I walked with him to the encampment shortly after a recent election that reinstated a camping ban designed to remove growing homeless encampments throughout the Texas capital.“They are trying to get all those homeless people out of sight,” Amy Goldman, 44, told us. “What they need to do is lower the cost of living and allow a living wage.”Goldman, wearing a clean Philippians 4:13 T-shirt, has been homeless for nine years. She moves between this camp, where she shares shelter with another person, and one further south where she keeps her own tent tucked away. Goldman is response accurately reflects that someone with a minimum-wage job ($7.25 an hour) would have to work 120 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Austin, according toEnding Community Homeless Coalition (ECHO) 2020 data. Limping along the wet sidewalk after a heavy downpour, Stephen Holmes, 54, stops to speak with us, his bare feet splattered with post-rain debris and his disabled left leg jutting outward.“I am not living the American dream,” Holmes said. He is originally from Austin and attended Anderson High School on the northwest side of town. “I am an Anderson Trojan,” he said proudly, as my heart sunk even further when I heard him name my neighborhood school. Holmes had been on disability and taking care of his father for 10 years before he died. He became homeless for the first time three months ago. “I want to be self-sufficient,” he said. “The state is going to need to find some cheap housing.” Dampier asked Holmes if he could pray for him, which he did. Goldman and Holmes are among some 3,160 people experiencing homelessness in Austin/Travis County, with 2,238 of those living unsheltered in tents, cars, and abandoned buildings as opposed to traditional shelters, according to 2021 statistics fromECHO Austin isHomeless Response Systemshows a 4.5 percent increase in the unhoused from 2019 to 2021, with a 20.6 percent increase for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Historically, the role of churches has been to distribute meals, clothing, and hygiene items, as well as offer community and fellowship, said Emily Seales, a Christian social worker who was a case management supervisor at Trinity Center in downtown Austin and is now engaged in a technology and health research study for Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center and the University of Texas. Growth in encampments over the past two years and recent debate over the reinstated public camping ban have led more leaders, such as Seales, to focus both on temporary assistance for their vulnerable neighbors and on advocacy to fix what they see as broken systems that have left people without livable wages and affordable housing in the first place. Part of that advocacy includes accelerating cooperative efforts between the city, established nonprofits, churches, faith-based organizations, and individuals.“I do not think the city knows what to do with faith communities,” said Cathy Stone, associate pastor at First United Methodist Church in downtown Austin. “But I think it is important that we start practicing and showing that we can do more and that we also want to be involved in advocating and decision making.”The bipartisan advocacy group Save Austin Now campaigned this spring to reinstate the public camping ban that Austin city leaders lifted back in 2019. The proposed ban, called Proposition B, passed in a May 1 special election, with 58 percent of voters in favor and 42 percent against. The ban now makes sitting, lying, or camping in public a criminal offense and prohibits soliciting money at certain times and locations. Now, Texas is moving toward banning camping statewide. The clearing of encampments will be delayed to allow the city time to implement a four-phase plan that includes conducting outreach and community engagement before enforcing the ban through citations and arrests. Austin is city manager, Spencer Cronk, said at a press conference that the city is looking into a variety of housing options, including city-sanctioned encampments—with the possibility of some on church properties. As one of its temporary solutions, the city has purchased three hotels to help with the transition to permanent housing. Stone is downtown church was highly vocal against the ban, including its senior pastor, Taylor Fuerst, who preached against it prior to early voting. Christ Church on the east side, where Dampier has been building relationships with members of the homeless community, was more divided. In Dampier is 800–900 person congregation, those in favor of reinstating the camping ban argued that the city failed to find housing solutions in the two years that the ban was lifted and raised concerns about the lack of dignity and vulnerability of living on the streets. Last year was one of the deadliest for people experiencing homelessness in Austin, with at least 256 deaths, KUTreported, based on figures from Austin is street newspaperEven those against the ban did not want to see people living permanently in encampments, Dampier said, but they were concerned about the lack of space at shelters to house them. Most of the people he spoke with preferred a more phased-out approach to empower those in encampments and incentivize cleanup. For years, Christians in Austin have offered aid and assisted in rehousing, and those efforts have continued during the pandemic. In downtown Austin, Trinity Center provides meals, bus passes, and case management, and in East Austin, Angel House, Austin Baptist Chapel is soup kitchen, has remained opened for breakfast. Austin is well-known Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck ministry has served millions of meals since 1998, and its tiny house Community First! Village is planning its fourth phase of development that will add 1,400 tiny houses over the next decade to its existing 500-house, 51-acre full-service community northeast of town. First United Methodist houses a Mobile Loaves & Fishes food truck and supplies volunteers for its downtown run. Prepandemic, the congregation also fed breakfast to 250–300 people twice a week followed by a worship service, and it continues to provide showers for women. Mission Possible sets up Church Under the Bridge, where four churches sponsor a Sunday a month to host weekly worship at encampment sites beneath overpasses. Amy and Simon Kenyon, members of Christ Church, can walk to the bridge at Sixth Street and I-35 where they have been leading services for 50–60 people on the first Sunday of the month for eight years. They hand out sausage wraps and coffee, which is secondary to the worship service, they said. The Kenyons consider the gospel as the transformative factor for those experiencing homelessness. “It is shocking to us how little faith Christians have in the gospel,” Amy Kenyon said. “It is usually heart issues that lead people to the streets.”Factors around homelessness abound, according to social worker Emily Seales, and include trauma, domestic violence, chronic health conditions, growing up in foster care, mental health diagnoses, intellectual disabilities, issues with the criminal justice system, and systemic racism and housing policy, atop the lack of affordable housing. Simon Kenyon, who is ordained through the Communion of Evangelical Episcopal Churches, said that he believes in more potential for those on the streets and that God has a better plan for them.“I think of Ephesians 2:10,” he said, “to be God is workmanship; something that he is created beforehand for each one of us to do and to be.”The Kenyons voted to reinstate the camping ban partly to help incentivize getting off the streets but also because they were told by those experiencing homelessness that Austin streets have become more dangerous due to the influx of people from other states. Despite those perceptions, 83 percent of people who are homeless in Austin started that journey in Austin or Texas, according to Seales. With the passage of Prop B, “there is literally nowhere to go,” she said. “People will go deeper into the woods, or there will be efforts in the same place over and over again to help people move along.”Some Christians are trying to simplify and accelerate the process of helping those experiencing homelessness by partnering with various agencies under one roof. Sunrise Homeless Navigation Center provides that kind of integrated model. The ministry grew out of Sunrise Community Church is desire to offer assistance to those in several nearby south Austin encampments. The center now serves food and offers showers, an address for mail, mental health workers, a health clinic, and housing case managers. Over six years, Sunrise has become its own entity with five paid staff and more than 100 volunteers, although it still shares a building with the church. They work together with various agencies’ staff to serve 200–300 clients every day and recently helped house their 550th person, said Mark Hilbelink, lead pastor of the church and director of the navigation center. Hilbelink operates from a Calvinist the ology, he said, that believes strongly in God is election of people. “We are not constantly in fear of people is salvation status,” he said. For that reason, the social work aspect takes precedence over evangelism, he said. Sunrise is current goal is to replicate its integrative model through a program called Compass Network that helps train and connect churches with the social services community. Sunrise adheres to the approach that handouts need to go hand in hand with a connection to the larger social services community. Hilbelink has also been mentor ing Leah Hargrave, a deacon at Mosaic Church and director of Mosaic Street Ministry, to create a navigation center in north Austin. Currently Sunrise is working with three teams of four to seven churches per team that have adopted a nearby micro homeless population (about 100 people). Christians with different theologies and different politics have come together to help, Hilbelink said.“They would never worship together,” he said, “but they are on this team because mission is on the forefront and everything else is behind.”On Sundays, a church from one team, with the help of interns from a variety of Texas universities, sets up a citywide database, ID printers, and connections to referral systems at a shopping center parking lot that is within one mile of the churches. The church hands out aid, while the interns work on the social services part. One location in south Austin has already helped house 20 people. Christians, like at Sunrise and Community First! Village, have developed some novel ideas that focus on more-integrated services and a communal approach, and cities all over the country are examining those models. In 2020, more than half a million people experienced homelessness in the USs, a 2.2 percent increase from 2019, according to theUS Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The lifting of national and local eviction moratoriums and the end of pandemic unemployment benefits by end of summer will also contribute to people losing their homes. Other municipalities—such as suburban SeattleandAurora, Colorado—have considered similar camping bans. Due to aho using crisis in Austin and other cities—rents have risen 3.3 percent since 2019 and 1.6 percent nationally—Hilbelink believes homelessness will become one of the biggest problems America will face in the next 10–15 years and will require an army to tackle. To take up the challenge, some churches will donate money, some will volunteer with an organization, others will adopt a micropopulation, and some will build navigation centers, Hilbelink said. Others, such as Seales and Stone, will advocate with city and state governments about equity and social justice issues, affordable housing, and living wages.“Every church is going to have to figure out what our response to this is going to be,” Hilbelink said.

From drive-thru setups, to mailing ashes to church members, Southern California churches found creative ways to safely keep the old tradition going. Saint Mark is Episcopal Church has multiple locations throughout Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino County, but it is their Upland location that adopted a modified “Ash and Dash” system for Ash Wednesday. For this system, the church opted to create an “ash kit” that was placed in either a passenger seat or trunk, allowing churchgoers to safely apply the blessed ashes the mselves.“Instead of imposing the ashes on people is foreheads, we are going to safely deliver the kits into their trunks or their passenger side window,” Saint Mark is Rev. Keith Yamamoto said. The church has had a drive-thru Ash Wednesday setup for four years now, which Rev. Yamamoto said the program helped him receive ashes in 2020, after an being involved in an accident that would not have allowed him to participate otherwise.“This is our fourth year doing the drive-thru experience because what we found was that people were busy, they could not take the time off work… to get to the church or the Ash Wednesday service,” Yamamoto said. “We started doing the drive-thru experience… so people on their morning commute could just come through our parking lot, receive the ashes and begin the rest of their day.”Those who chose to attend the Ash and Dash this year saw ministers in masks, instructing cars where to go an allowing them to receive the ashes without needing to lower their windows or contact anyone outside. The church also advised on Lent instruction, as well as carried out a streamed church service at 12 p.m., with another streaming at 7 p.m. St. James Episcopal Church in Los Angeles sent its congregants ashes by mail since they were not having in-person services for Ash Wednesday. The church will also be streaming a church service at 7 p.m. and asked that church members check their mailboxes as they put together their own ash kits and sent them out last week.“Many of our episcopal churches in the region have risen up with creative solutions such as mailing ashes that have been blessed… so they will have the ashes at home for the digital services that will take place on Ash Wednesday,” Bob Williams, Canon For Common Life of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, said. Hoping everyone is having a blessed#AshWednesdayand that you will be able to join us at 7PM for our Ash Wednesday live stream – and do not forget to check your mail for your ashes-at-home kit! 📬@StJamesLApic.twitter.com/O8CanaaBaI— Jon Feuss (@RevJonFeuss)February 17, 2021All Saints Church in Pasadena made their ash Wednesday a little more interactive this year with a “Burn It” campaign. The church asked its congregants to share messages and phrases of “negative or constraining experiences,” put those words to paper and drive by the church, where masked ushers would receive them. The church took those words as they came in throughout the day, Tuesday, and used the ashes for their Ash Wednesday service. St. Charles Borromeo chose to have a drive-in mass for Ash Wednesday, as parishioners parked in designated spots, and were asked to wear masks at all times, including while inside their cars. While the re, as would be the case in a drive-in the ater, guests tuned their car radios to listen to the live church service. With PPE on, servers from the church went around to cars, distributing the ashes. It is a wonderful encounter for people who might not be comfortable with coming into a church,” Williams said. “…the churches are rising up and finding creative solutions to make the observance meaningful.”Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

Dr. Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician who served as Tennessee is medical director of vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, was fired Monday. In the week prior to her termination, she received a package containing a dog muzzle, she told CNN is Anderson Cooper Wednesday. Tennessee vaccine official is story reveals an ugly truth about GOP and children is rightsFiscus has been at the center of a political battle in Tennessee over the vaccination of adolescents againstCovid-19. Before she was terminated, Fiscus released a memo citing Tennessee state law about whether minors may get medical care without their parents’ permission. Backlash to the memo from state lawmakers was swift and comes amid political polarization of vaccines as experts urge Americans to get their doses and disinformation continues to drive large portions of the population away. Fiscus said prior to her termination, a large Amazon package was delivered to her state office addressed to her. Inside she found a dog muzzle. There was no note and Fiscus said she contacted Amazon to try and determine who sent the muzzle. Amazon refused to reveal the sender, Fiscus said. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment.“At first, I thought that was a joke and contacted a few friends, and the n, when no one claimed it, I realized that that was something that was sent to me as some kind of a message,” Fiscus said. At the advice of others, she said reported the incident to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which confirmed to CNN it is investigating the dog muzzle package. Fiscus said she told her husband, “They obviously did not know me because they sent me a size three which is for beagles and I am obviously a pit bull, which requires a size six.” Fiscus said she is keeping the muzzle as a souvenir. Fiscus told CNN she sent the memo at the center of the controversy because physicians who were administering Covid-19 vaccines asked her what to do when minors showed up to be inoculated without a parent. Politics is causing needless deaths in the fight against Covid-19In response, and in consultation with legal counsel at theTennessee Department of Health, Fiscus said she sent a memo to the doctors citing the “mature minor doctrine,” which allows health care providers to decide if any child has the capacity to consent to vaccination the mselves. The policy has been in place for 34 years, was public facing on the Tennessee Department of Health web site and was blessed by the governor is office, she said. But legislators quickly began contacting the health department asking questions about the memo that some said undermined parental authority. On Monday, Fiscus was fired. Tennessee is health department told CNN by email Tuesday it could not comment on personnel matters. Fiscus said her firing was a symptom of a trend in many public health departments across the country. In her state, she sees a “bowing of the department of health to some saber-rattling of some of our legislators who felt that it was inappropriate to share the mature minor doctrine that has been Tennessee Supreme Court case law since 1987.”Legislative leaders are now seeking answers from Tennessee Governor Bill Lee regarding his decision to fire the state is top vaccination expert in the middle of a pandemic. During a virtual meeting with state legislative members Wednesday, Tennessee is Senate Democratic Caucus Chairwoman Raumesh Akbari said the decision to fire Fiscus has put the state in a more dangerous position.“We have all the tools we need to get out of this pandemic but the failure of leadership at the top is making this hard,” Akbari said. Leading up to her firing, Fiscus said the department had halted all adolescent vaccine outreach, from Covid-19 communications to HPV reminders and acknowledgment of National Immunization Awareness Month. The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed Wednesday it is temporarily halting all adolescent vaccine outreach, even for vaccines not related to Covid-19, telling CNN the issue is “polarized.”Tennessee is halting outreach on all vaccines for adolescents, including for Covid-19“We recognize where we are around the national conversation around vaccinations and it is a polarized conversation, and that is true in our state. And so we are just taking this opportunity to evaluate our messaging and to ensure that we are not hurting our efforts,” spokeswoman Sarah Tanksley told CNN in a phone call. Tanksley said Covid-19 and other childhood vaccines would still be available while the department of health re-evaluates the vaccination notification process. She said the goal was to ensure that vaccination reminders are sent to the parents of the adolescent. In a few cases, immunization reminders were sent directly to minors who had contact information listed in the department is electronic health records, according to a statement given to CNN by the Tennessee Department of Health. Tanksley said she is confident the department of health will continue to successfully communicate with parents and providers.“This is not a monthlong evaluation period or anything like that,” she said. But Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Davidson County Board of Health in Tennessee, said Wednesday he worries the halt could result in preventable outbreaks. Jahangir said the robust immunization program for children in the US has prevented outbreaks of diseases for decades.“The best way to save millions of Tennesseans is to encourage vaccinations, to make them easy and not buy into any rhetoric that vaccinations are problematic,” he said. “I think the politicization of vaccinations can truly have a really negative impact on Tennesseans and people around the US.”CNN is Martin Savidge, Angela Barajas, Rebekah Riess,Tina Burnside Keri Enriquez and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.",1,1,CNN
513,Would there have been a Donald Trump presidency without Rush Limbaugh?,-13.0,30.4,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2021/02/would-there-have-been-donald-trump-presidency-without-rush-limbaugh,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-18,16,"Rush Limbaugh, who died aged 70 from cancer on Wednesday 17 February, became one of the first in US broadcasting to helm a national call-in show in the 1980s. It was, for Limbaugh, perfect timing: in 1987, the USs got rid of the “fairness doctrine” under which broadcasters had to present both sides of controversial issues. Without it, Limbaugh could speak to one side. And he did. That same decade, hundreds of thousands of Americans were dying of AIDS On his show, Limbaugh ran a segment called the “AIDS update”, in which he mocked gay men who were dying. He accompanied the segment by playing Dionne Warwick is “I will Never Love This Way Again”. In 1990, Limbaughcalledthe segment “regretful” and “irresponsible”. In the 1990s, Limbaugh truly became a national figure: his nationally syndicated show aired on hundreds of stations. When, in 1994, Republicans took back the House of Representatives, members of the partycalledLimbaugh a “majority maker”, so influential were his right-wing broadcasts. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrichsold“Rush Limbaugh for President” T-shirts at his victory party that year. Also in the 1990s, LimbaughcalledChelsea Clinton, the president is daughter, the White House dog. He became fabulously wealthy, and part of that wealth was power; in 2009, Michael Steele,apologisedafter calling Limbaugh, ostensibly only a talk radio host, an entertainer. Limbaugh, in a way, was right to take offence. He was not only entertaining. He was shaping a new kind of Republican politics, in which Ronald Reagan is optimism for America was wedded to an angry denigration of anyone who found the mselves on the opposite side of Limbaugh is culture wars. Barack Obama is first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel,referredto Limbaugh as the voice of the Republican Party. And, for all the talk of identity politics on the left, few embraced bringing identity into politics like Limbaugh. In 2004, hes aid that the National Basketball Association, many players in which are black, should be renamed to be the TBA, or Thug Basketball Association, and that basketball teams should be referred to as gangs. Hesaid“Caucasians” were the race that should not have to feel guilty about slavery. He pushed the racist lie that Obama was not born in the US, a piece of disinformation which Trump used to kick start his national political career. In 2012, LimbaughcalledSandra Fluke, a law student who went before Congress to argue that employers should be required to offer health insurance that pays for contraception, a “slut” and a “prostitute”. Hecalledfeminists “femi-nazis”. In 2007, hein sinuated that veterans from the war in Iraq who spoke out against it were “phony soldiers”. He received the presidential medal of freedom from Donald Trump, to whose defence he often jumped. HesaidDemocrats allowed the violence in Charlottesville in 2017 — when white supremacists chanted “Jews will not replace us” and waved confederate flags — to spiral out of control on purpose, and that the coronavirus was the common cold and was being “weaponised” to hurt Trump. But, in a way, the real medal for Limbaugh is career was the Trump presidency itself. It was a logical conclusion of decades of people hearing sensational, bigoted, us versus them rhetoric for hours a day. Along with Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes ofFox News, Limbaugh, as much as any single American figure, created the politics of the Republican party we see today. And more than the others, Limbaugh created an obvious blueprint for Trump, who spoke warmly of his friend after his passing. The insults, the bombast, the outlandish statements followed by half-apologies, or no apologies at all: that was Limbaugh. The white, male grievance that characterised so much of what Trump said: that was Limbaugh too. It is possible, of course, that America would have arrived at this point had Limbaugh done any number of other things that did not involve talk radio. It is possible that we could have had a Trump presidency without him. It is possible that even if the fairness doctrine had stayed in place, and Limbaugh had been required by federal regulation to present both sides of an issue, that America would still be as polarised as it is today. We will never know. What we do know is what happened: the fairness doctrine was lifted, Limbaugh became a radio personality and political kingmaker, Trump became president. In an interview after the announcement of Limbaugh is death, Trump said that Limbaugh believed he, Trump, had won the election. That is not true of course. But to Limbaugh, and to Trump, truth was besides the point. Related",1,1,New Statesman

515,Trump Pushed 11 False Claims About Voting in 8 Minutes During the Debate,-14.67,32.67,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-mail-vote-debate-lies,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,25,"In the closing section of last night is unhinged presidential debate, moderator and Fox News anchor Chris Wallace raised a discussion about election integrity. ""What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?"" he asked. In keeping with his prior statements and tweets, Donald Trump made clear that he will offer no reassurance of any kind. Instead, he launched into an extended assault on mail voting filled with nearly a dozen false claims. As he has repeatedly in recent months, Trump mischaracterized, exaggerated, and lied about the risks of fraud in mail voting. And he doubled down on the idea that any delayed results caused by the extra time it takes to count mail ballots will inevitably signal a “rigged” election—an assertion that election officials and researchers strongly dispute, given that it can take time to process and count mail ballots accurately and fairly. That Trump did so in so bright a spotlight has election-watchers especially concerned.""At the end of the day, elections are legitimate because the public accepts them as legitimate. Putting out a lot of disinformation meant to confuse people and sow unfounded doubt undermines our democratic system,"" says Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Brennan Center is Democracy Program at New York University School of Law. ""We have been conducting vote-by-mail in some form in this country since the Civil War. The president uses it to vote in Florida, and our military relies on it. Many states have had extremely robust systems for decades. The system is safe and secure.""Following are the 11 lies, exaggerations, and mis characterizations that Trump managed to squeeze into one eight-minute stretch of the debate. If you exclude the times other people were talking, he hit well over two lies per minute:Trump started out by trying to draw a distinction between states where voters must request an absentee mail ballot (""solicited"") and states where ballots are automatically mailed to all registered voters (""unsolicited""). He claims that his own absentee voting in Florida is exempt from his criticisms about fraud, because he requests the ballot. But fraud in states that historically vote only by mail—Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah—is extremely low. Aanalysisfound that it affected just 0.0025 percent of ballots in the Colorado, Oregon, and Washington 2016 and 2018 general elections. Trump additionally criticizes the handful of states, like Nevada and California, that are sending mail ballots to all registered voters in 2020 for the first time because of the pandemic. But the re is no proof that this approach has caused significant problems. Later in the debate, Trump would cite examples of supposed mail ballot fraud in states like New York and Virginia that do not proactive ly send ballots—and are the refore conducting mail-in voting in a way that passes muster, by his definition. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThere is no evidence that mail-in ballots have been dumped in creeks, or any body of water for that matter. Trump is referring to nine military ballots that were improperly (but accidentally) discarded by a temporary employee in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in mid-September. On Thursday, the Justice Department made an initial statement about the incident that it later took down. It is extremely unusual for the DOJ to provide details of an open investigation. Ultimately the agency said that seven of the nine ballots were marked for Trump, but it did not share any evidence of foul play and pointed instead to the role of administrative error. It is tough to know which ""area"" Trump was referring to here, but election officials recognize that a small number of voters may attempt to vote twice in any election, either because of clerical errors, earnest confusion on the part of the voter, or, yes, malign intent. Therefore, each state has systems in place to monitor for double voting and reconcile any irregularities. The examples Trump cites took weeks, not months, to resolve. And while it is almost certainly true that it will take much longer than usual to get accurate results from every state due to increased mail-in voting, ""that does not mean anything nefarious is going on,"" the Brennan Center is Norden says. ""It just means election officials are doing exactly what they are supposed to do.""Set aside that ""losing"" implies misplacing, and allow for the more generous interpretation that Trump means those ballots were not counted. Nationwide, it is true that mail ballots are typically rejected at higher rates than those cast in person. If a ballot is filled out incorrectly, is not signed, or is received too late, election officials will flag it (to reduce the risk of ballot manipulation or fraud!), and this can mean that certain votes are not counted. But some states have already implemented mechanisms for notifying voters if their ballots were rejected and giving them an opportunity to remedy the issue; other states are working to quickly add such protections. Around 1 percent of mail ballots were not counted in the 2016 general election, so under any circumstances Trump is assertion of ""losing 30 and 40 percent"" is baseless. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThis is Trump is grievance in a nutshell. He claims that the election is rigged against him and that mail voting is the apparatus through which it will be manipulated. At the end of the day, this means he is accusing election officials of abdicating their most sacred responsibility to conduct elections in a fair and nonpartisan manner. He has no proof of significant fraud, but he also shies away from articulating the core of his allegation, perhaps because, in truth, election officials are overwhelmingly honest and dedicated. Folks, truly, this is not a thing!Again, there is no indication that ballots have wound up in bodies of water. Again, nope. See above. It took six weeks to certify the results of the June Democratic primary in New York is 12th congressional district, a delay that Trump has presented as evidence of fraud. It was not. A glut of mail ballots and a legal fight over thousands of disputed ballots lengthened the process. The New York state legislature has since passed reforms aimed at giving voters more time to request absentee ballots and giving them notice if their ballot is disqualified. Meanwhile, in spite of the turmoil, neither Maloney, challenger Suraj Patel, nor state election officials saw evidence of actual fraud in the race. As Tuesday night is voting discussion raged on, Trump invoked a prediction that ca not be fact-checked right now but could be dangerously self-fulfilling: ""This is not going to end well. This is not going to end well.""",1,2,WIRED

That new president, Joe Biden, says he wants to bring the nation together — even as his Democratic Party, and some members of the Republican Party, are demanding Donald Trump and his enablers be held accountable for what they have just done to America. Some say these two objectives, unity and accountability, are at odds with one another. In fact they are inseparable. Without accountability, unity will be an illusion, an invitation to further, deeper, more dangerous division. With accountability, the nation has a genuine chance to come together and move forward. For nearly two-and-a-half centuries, the leaders of our nation have fought to preserve and defend our Republic during times of strife. The men and women privileged enough to have earned the trust of the voters always proudly made the pilgrimage to Washington, DC as the peoples’ voice. Their politics differed, but there was a long line of commitment to truth, democracy and the freedoms we Americans universally hold dear. We were — and are — an imperfect nation, led by imperfect people. For all those imperfections, America has always been more than a nation; we are a people of many races and religions, gifted by providence a set of human ideals worth fighting for. Few Americans will ever have the opportunity to serve our nation in a capacity that carries as much honor, weight, authority or power that members of Congress in both chambers enjoy. It has never been an easy job and was never advertised as such. The best of our elected representatives took on the heavy responsibility of leadership, always guided by a relentless desire to create that more perfect union. Both the process executed in and the decisions made by these bodies set an example, not just to our fellow Americans, but to the entire world. America has a unique role in the world both as a moral compass and as an aspiration al model for a big, messy, but successful democracy: We are the benchmark. Despite historical stumbles and mistakes, we remained the shining city on the hill. It is more than a cliché. We have been a real model to those who want better across the globe. Through wars, pandemics, economic crisis, social unrest, scandals and attacks on our own soil, the Congress of the USs has always been a steady force, guiding our ship through turbulent waters, re-calibrating as we go, using our defining principles as outlined in our Constitution as our map. Designed by the founders to capture both the will of the people and to constrain its most passionate urges, we had a kind of unspoken, homeostatic balance. No one side of the ideological fight dominated too deeply, or for too long. Power ebbs and flows; our core principles should not. One thing the Founders would have never expected was a physical attack on the members of those august bodies to be ordered by a president who had lost a free and fair election. The could never have imagined that members of the Senate would stand on the floor and actively promote insurrection. The last time it happened was at the start of the Civil War, and those members were rightly expelled from the body. As hard as it is to admit, on January 6, our nation, democracy and government were attacked by a group of treasonous insurrectionists at the command of the sitting president of the USs. Not since the Civil War have we seen our fellow Americans attempt to tear apart the very fabric of our nation with such determination. And never in the history of our nation have our leaders unapologetically refused to hold those responsible for an attack on America accountable. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy attempted to block the impeachment of the president by claiming that this was a political game that would further divide the nation and that while the president may have incited the riot, now was not the time to push for impeachment. Only 10 bold members of the Republican caucus broke party lines to vote for impeachment. It was one of the most insulting, egregious, cowardly, anti-American acts in recent memory by a supposed leader in Congress. It ultimately did not matter, on January 13, President Trump became the only president in US history to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives. It was richly deserved. Never mind Trump is belated and obviously begrudging claims that he wants peace and a smooth transition, this after weeks of fiercely stirring the bubbling cauldron. You cannot suddenly stop a chemical reaction you have been stoking. You cannot suddenly switch off a raging fire you have fueled. And the president, who does not know much but does understand the logic of inchoate rage fed by disinformation, knows this. This is a dangerous moment, a fork in the road where one path leads to the healing of a divided nation and the other leads down the road of our demise. The choice is between an America we recognize and in which we take pride, or a Third World authoritarian kleptocracy. This moment sets the trajectory of the USs going forward. It is past time for outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in that body to live up to their titles and their calling. Our democracy is no longer one generation from extinction, as President Ronald Reagan once famously claimed; we are now just a few votes away. If McConnell and Senate Republicans allow for Trump to escape culpability for his actions that led to an attack on the sacred ground where they work every day, this country may well fall. It will not happen quickly, but the seeds will be planted. It will be clear that a demagogue slinging lies like a monkey throws poop can declare an election null and void, insist that he is the rightful leader, and get away with it. That message will be well-learned by all the wrong people. Trump is actions will be emulated by politicians with more skill and cunning than him, with the ability to manipulate information growing ever more sophisticated as technology and social media evolve. The actions of those who seek to destroy us must be met with a show of force so strong that no American ever attempts to overthrow our government again. The seriousness of this moment cannot be overstated. Already, Republicans are taunting Democrats with the claim that a drive to impeach, remove and otherwise hold Trump accountable is at odds with Biden is pledge to heal the nation, to end the bitter era of demonizations. This is turning history on its head, in real time. There is no path to unifying the people of this nation as long as loyalty to party and fear of a weak, deranged man take priority over ensuring the safety and well-being of our Republic and our democratic processes. The wounds that have been inflicted can only be healed by holding those responsible publicly accountable with a punishment that reflects the severity of the transgression. Sure, some on the fringes will only grow more furious with any move toward accountability, but the vast majority, those with a genuine interest in coming together, will understand that there is an underlying republic worth honoring, norms worth protecting, a Constitution worth defending. This is not only about Trump. By letting Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson and the rest of the Senate is Sedition Caucus skate for their role in the conspiracy, the Senate Republicans are telling Americans they want impunity, not unity. Senate Republicans giving Trump a pass for his fiery incitement to violence — which came after a spate of spurious lawsuits and repeated attempts to strong arm Georgia officials into changing their recounted, certified vote totals — are not interested in reconciliation; they are fine with Trump and his allies inciting an insurrection and staging an attempted coup on our own government. Five American lives were lost that day, based on the words, deeds, and plans of Trump and his dead-enders; if this is not grounds for impeachment and conviction, what is?History will remember who stood up for America when our democracy was tested from within; they are the brave, the deserving, the leaders. But history will have a longer, and more brutal memory for the conspirators and cowards, too. Hawley, Cruz and the rest of their seditious claque should be censured and expelled from the Senate. They, too, swear an oath to the Constitution. They, too, broke it. McConnell is famous for the ironclad control he exercises of his caucus. He alone will decide if he will let enough of his members vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. He is a base, transactional politician. He may not care much for his legacy, but failing to stand up in this moment may make retaking the Senate majority nearly impossible in a tough 2022 cycle — and that is something he most certainly cares about. The judgment of the voters has been rendered. Trump will go; it is inevitable. Accepting the legacy of his destructive character and politics is a choice. Holding to account the enablers, organizers, supporters and players in the insurrection — be they cop-killers in MAGA hats, senators or soon-to-be former presidents — is existential to preserving the republic. Donald Trump has always been a political parasite, slowly hollowing out his host. It is up to the few Republicans with honor, integrity, and a sense of duty to the country to make the final votes to stop the worst political cancer in American history from spreading, and killing this great nation.

517,Investigation shows VA took nine months to dismiss physician who taunted suicidal patient,-2.33,48.67,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/07/29/investigation-shows-va-took-nine-months-to-dismiss-physician-who-taunted-suicidal-patient/,https://adfontesmedia.com/military-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,18,"Despite claims of increased accountability at the department in recent years, Veterans Affairs officials took nine months to sever ties with a physician who told a suicidal patient she did not care if he shot himself, according to a report released by the VA Inspector Generalthis week. The veteran died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound less than a week later. The episode — which took place at the Washington DC VA medical center, just a few miles away from the White House — stands in contrast to President Donald Trump is frequent stump speech claims that “anyone who mistreats or abuses our great veterans can be promptly fired” thanks to legislation he signed into law in 2017. And it also calls into question the efficacy of VA officials’ recent efforts to emphasize all staffers’ role in suicide prevention, an issue that claims the lives of about 20 veterans and military members each day, even after years of intense focus on the issue. In a statement after the report release, DC Medical Center Director Mike Heimall said the conduct of the doctor involved in the case “is unacceptable and does not represent the dedication and compassion our employees exhibit daily.”The doctor was not named in the report. Investigators could not determine whether the veteran heard the comment by the physician — “(the patient) can go shoot (himself), I do not care” — during a medical discharge from the hospital in early 2019. The veteran, a patient in his 60s with a history of panic attacks and op io id withdrawal seizures, had been previously assessed as a moderate suicide risk. But when a team of physicians recommended his discharge with follow-up mental health consultation, the patient refused, prompting the physician to call campus police and shout the offensive comments. The patient died by suicide a few days later. Investigators could not say whether the patient ever heard the doctor is comments, or whether they were a factor in the death. But the IG report says at least three other employees heard the comment and reported it to superiors. Despite that, the doctor continued to see and treat VA patients for another nine months, before her contract was terminated for additional abusive language towards other employees. DC hospital officials emphasized that “this person was never a VA employee, only worked on a contract basis and is no longer welcome at the facility.”However, investigators found reports of “verbal misconduct” by the contract physician dating back to fall 2018, including incidents involving the chief of the hospital is emergency department and facility police. The report states that leadership at the facility opted not to cut ties with the problematic doctor earlier because they “believed that clinical reviews of the patient is care were sufficient, and the refore did not pursue formal administrative reviews related to (the physician is) pattern of verbal misconduct.”Heimall acknowledged that the incident “does not represent the quality health care tens of thousands of DC-area veterans have come to expect from our facilities” but also labeled it an “isolated” event. Officials at VA headquarters referred questions on the incident and the report to DC medical center staff and sidestepped questions about whether the event illustrates deeper problems within the department is suicide prevention and accountability efforts. Critics have repeatedly sparred with the White House over the value of the 2017 Accountability Act, which Trump has insisted has helped reform the entire agency by jettisoning more than 9,000 problematic bureaucrats and medical staff since its passage.“People do a bad job for our vets, and they get fired,” Trump said in a July 19 online campaign speech to supporters. “It is very simple … we had sadists in the re, we had thieves in the re, and you could not do anything about it, whether it was for reasons of unions or civil service.”But union leaders have argued the measure has largely allowed supervisors to target lower-ranking employees for quicker dismissal, rather than removing toxic leaders more responsible for systemic issues. In the DC medical center case, contract issues appeared to supersede staff concerns. After the physician was finally removed, facility leaders pledged to report the problematic behavior to the National Practitioner Data Bank. The inspector general report comes about a month after the White House announced its new veterans suicide prevention roadmap, the culmination of 15 months of work designed to refocus local communities and all federal agencies on the issue. Among the initiatives emphasis is the idea that suicide is preventable if leaders and community members take the issue seriously and provide help to veterans. Heimall said his facility has implemented additional suicide prevention measures since the 2019 incident, to include “weekly randomized audits of 20 percent of all suicide-related patient emergency room” to ensure that staff are providing appropriate care and “a comprehensive education program regarding employee misconduct and patient abuse.”Veterans experiencing a mental health emergency can contact the Veteran Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 and select option 1 for a VA staffer.

518,The Party of Violence,-10.67,31.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/the-party-of-violence/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,17,"Adam Smith said, “There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.” It was meant as comfort. A lot can be wrong and still not signal the apocalypse. So let is hope that the increasing fascination with political violence we are hearing from Republicans is a passing thing, and not a sign of unravelling. A Republican running for Northampton County executive in Pennsylvania gave a heated address on August 29 about mask mandates in schools. Steve Lynch is tired, he said, of providing his school board with arguments and data (he apparently thinks the data support letting kids go maskless), but the important thing about his rant is the threat of force:Forget into [sic] these school boards with frigging data. You go into school boards to remove ’em! That is what you do! They do not follow the law! You go in and you remove ’em. I am going in there with twenty strong men, I am going to speak to the school board and I am going to give them an option. They can leave or they can be removed.“You do not follow the law.” That is the kind of language that Republicans are now employing. You go in with “twenty strong men.” Lynch has not run for public office before, but he did attend the January 6 rally in Washington, DC and has posted on social media that the violence that day was a false-flag operation meant to discredit Trump supporters. Further south, Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina spoke last weekend at an event sponsored by the Macon County Republican Party. He delivered the kind of lies that have become routine among some Republicans. The election was stolen—and not just the presidential contest but also that won by Governor Roy Cooper (who defeated his opponent by a quarter of a million votes). Cawthorn told the crowd that vaccines are harmful to children and urged them to “defend their children.” A woman asked what he plans to do about the “535 Americans who have been captured from January 6.” Cawthorn, who has apparently heard this before, thundered, “Political hostages!” He went on to assure the audience that “we” are working on this and mentions “busting them out.” When someone in the crowd asked, “When are you gonna call us back to Washington?” he replied that “We are actively working on that one.”He was not finished. Insurrection talk is becoming hisspecialty: “The things that we are wanting to fight for, it does not matter if our votes do not count. Because, you know, if our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen, the n it is going to lead to one place—and it is bloodshed.”You may remember Cawthorn. He was the young man who, addressing the Stop the Steal rally on January 6, praised the crowd is courage and contrasted it with the “cowards” in Congress. Cawthorn is work experience before serving in Congress consisted of a stint at Chick-fil-A and a part-time job in a congressional office. He dropped out of college after a single semester in which his grades were mostly Ds. But he was apparently active in that one semester: More than 150 of his classmates signed a letter accusing Cawthorn of being a sexual predator. One woman told the Washington Postthat he drove her to a rural area only to become enraged when she rebuffed his sexual advances. He drove back at speeds of up to 80 miles an hour. Naturally, Donald Trump has endorsed him for “whatever he wants to do.”In neighboring Tennessee, the Williamson County school board was disrupted by anti-mask parents. As doctors and nurses testified that masks would help limit the spread of COVID-19, people cursed and threatened the m: “We will find you!” “We know who you are!”In Georgia, a mobile vaccination site had to be shut down after anti-vax protesters showed up to threaten and harass health care workers. “Aside from feeling threatened the mselves, staff realized no one would want to come to that location for a vaccination under those circumstances, so they packed up and left,” a spokeswoman for the state health departmenttoldtheAtlanta Journal Constitution. A survey of the rest of the country yields yet more examples. We are all old enough to remember a time when election workers were public-spirited citizens, usually elderly, who volunteered their time (or got very modest compensation) to sit for hours at polling sites scanning names from lists of voters and handing out little stickers. That America is gone, driven out by a radicalized Republican party. A number of states with Republican majorities have passed laws that would impose criminal fines of up to $25,000 for such “offenses” as permitting a ballot drop box to be accessible before early voting hours or sending an unsolicited absentee ballot application to a voter. But that is not the worst of it. Election workers have been hounded andthreatened. Bomb threats have been emailed to election sites. “You and your family will be killed very slowly,” read a text message sent to Tricia Raffensperger after her husband, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, declined to “find” enough votes to flip the state to Trump. As many as one in three election workers has reported feeling unsafe, and thousands are resigning. When Liz Cheney made the principled decision to vote for Trump is impeachment, she noted that one reason more Republicans might not have chosen to join her was that “there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security—afraid, in some instances, for their lives.”Republicans talk incessantly about other people is violence. The rioters who burned buildings after George Floyd is death. The criminals who make Chicago a murder capital. Immigrants who supposedly terrorize their host nation (they do not). Criminal violence is a problem, but the kind of violence Republicans are now flirting with or sometimes outright endorsing is political—and the refore on a completely different plane of threat. Kyle Rittenhouse, an ill-supervised teenager who decided to grab an AR-15 and shoot people at a Kenosha riot (killing two and wounding one) was lionized by the GOP His mother got a standing ovation at a fund raiser in Waukesha. Ashli Babbitt has become a martyr. Allen West, former chair of the Texas GOP, speaks approvingly of secession. Former national security advisor and Trump confidant Michael Flynnsuggeststhat we need a Myanmar-style coup. Some 28percentof Republicans respond affirmatively to the proposition that “because things have gotten so far off track” in the USs, “true American patriots may have to resort to violence” to save the country. Maybe that is not so bad? Not even a third. Another poll framed itdifferently: “The traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.” Fifty-six percent of Republicans agreed. They are playing with fire. Nothing less than democratic legitimacy is on the line. These menacing signals suggest that January 6 may have been the overture, not the finale.",1,1,The Bulwark

520,"Were the Founding Fathers Not Involved in Pledge, Anthem, ‘In God We Trust’?",0.0,48.0,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/founding-fathers-pledge-anthem-in-god-we-trust/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"In the summer of 2021, we received inquiries from Snopes readers about the accuracy of a widely-shared mem e insisting that several to tems of American civic and political culture, such as the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance, were in fact relatively recent inventions, and thus had no link to the ""Founding Fathers,"" whose actions and intentions are often regarded as sacrosanct in the USs. The mem e consisted of a banner image featuring Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, along with the following text:The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1923. The Star Spangled Banner was adopted in 1929.""Under God"" was added to The Pledge in 1954.""In God We Trust"" was added to our money in 1956. So... NO They were not created by our Founding Fathers. The following screen shot shows a selection of instances of the mem epos ted to Facebook in 2021, and illustrates its popularity on that platform:The broad point of the mem e is correct — the four to tems mentioned were not adopted until many decades after the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the Founders did not play a part in their implementation. As such, we are issuing a rating of True. However, the accuracy of the specific dates listed in the mem e was mixed. The following is an assessment of each date and milestone listed in the meme, bearing in mind that the overarching point of the mem e remains correct. The basic format of the pledge was devised by Francis Bellamy, a Christian minister, to mark the occasion of Columbus Day, in, the 400th anniversary of the Columbian expeditions. Anofficial program for that day is commemorations set out the text of the pledge, to be recited in public school classrooms across the nation:""I pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""After that, two significant changes were made. In, the American Legion organized a National Flag Conference in Washington, DC, at which it was decided that the words ""my flag"" should be replaced with ""the flag of the USs,"" in order to avoid confusion (or subterfuge) on the part of recently-arrived immigrants. This is the development in 1923 to which the mem e refers. That formula of words was formally adopted by Congress in1942, and the second significant change came in, when the words ""Under God"" were added (more about which below). The mem e has the right era, but the wrong year. In fact, the US Congress did not formally adopt ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as the national anthem until two years later. On, the following resolution wasapproved:""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the USs of America in Congress assembled, That the composition consisting of the words and music known as The Star-Spangled Banner is designated the national anthem of the USs of America.""The version of the pledge re-adopted by Congress in1945is identical to the one now in use, save for two words: ""Under God."" As the mem e correctly points out, that phrase was added on June 14,1954, as the comparison below illustrates:That phrase actually first appeared on US currency, though not as far back as the era of Washington and Adams. As an entr yon the official web site of the US Treasury Department outlines:The motto IN GOD WE TRUST was placed on USs coins largely because of the increased religious sentiment existing during the Civil War. Secretary of the TreasurySalmon P Chasereceived many appeals from devout persons throughout the country, urging that the USs recognize the Deity on USs coins. In April 1864, Congress passed a law that ""changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864two-cent coin.""In the 150 years since the n, ""In God We Trust"" has appeared intermittently on various coins. In 1956 — the year referred to in the meme— it became the official motto of the USs, and the first paper currency bearing the phrase was printed in 1957.",2,2,Snopes

One only needs to look at the complete spectrum of behaviors supported and undertaken by the left. Teaching children everything fromtransgenderismtoracism and sexism, extreme social justice behaviors practically being required in universities by leftist professors, and even pardoning the most violent behaviors as riots destroy towns is pretty common for the left. The radicalization does not stop at the left, though. Looking at the behavior of some of the right-leaning people that had infiltrated the Capitol building, you can see that sanity and calm thinking had not won the day. While not quite as destructive, the actions looked a lot like the leftist Black Lives Matter riots than anything. These people did not just arrive at their conclusions in a vacuum, and while there are many paths to becoming a radical, the left is ability to make people feel a sense of desperation is definitely one of them. One of those ways the left does that is to silence, censor, and belittle. It is a tactic that might work a while but behind the seal they put on dissent, pressure builds. At some point, it is going to explode. The censorship of conservatives is not new. It is been going on for years and it is no conspiracy theory. Video evidences hows just how blatant the censorship of conservatives is, and despite how the leftists in Silicon Valley deny it, it is clear that the left wants it. Michelle Obama, for instance,called for Trump to be silenced on social media. Melinda Gates wants the same, but for everyone who disagrees with the left is politics. Senator Josh Hawley just had hit book canceled by Simon and Schusterafter the Capitol Hill riot, mostly because he was blamed for being the cause of the riot in the first place. He was not. He never advocated for the riots to happen, unlike Democrats Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, or Joe Biden himself. I could continue but you have likely gotten the point by now. The silencing of conservatives or right-leaning voices is not going to make the problem go away, it is only going to increase the anger and vitriol felt by the silenced. The radicalization will not come because of an abundance of radical speech, it will come from a lack of expression of dissenting opinion, the vast majority of which is entirely reasonable. Resentment will drive the radicalism, not false information. There is a difference between dissenting speech and actually dangerous speech, and the left has more or less lost sight of what that difference is in its quest to sensationalize and silence. The left continues to put the kibosh on conservative speech at its own risk, and — God forbid — a real insurrection rises up that actually takes the lives of a good number of people, the left will only have the mselves to blame.",1,0,RedState

525,‘Revolutionizing a culture’: How critical race theory grew from law school thesis to K-12 trend,10.33,39.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jun/16/how-critical-race-theory-grew-law-school-thesis-k-/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,23,"Middle school students in Buffalo, New York, were assigned to read an essay as part of the district is “emancipation curriculum” this year that “the USs was founded as a racist society.”As homework, they were to read an essay stating that “all White people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.”Eleventh-graders in Seattle Public Schools will be taught critical race theory as part of a program inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Central to the theory is the idea that US laws and institutions are inherently racist and that Whites still oppress Blacks and other people of color more than 150 years after the end of slavery and decades after advances of the civil rights movement. This school of thought is spreading rapidly through American classrooms, work places and government offices. It grew out of a field called critical legal theory, which took root in the 1970s, according to the American Bar Association. Critical legal theory breaks with the belief that law is pure. It argues instead that societal biases such as race and class influence law. Critical race theory is adherents generally broaden the traditional view that racism is perpetrated by individuals. Racism, they say, is ingrained in American democracy. In other words, although White people may think they are not racist, they are part of and benefit from a racist system. Pioneers of critical race theory included Derrick Bell, who taught at Harvard University. Bell, who died in 2011, is recognized as the godfather of the movement, according to a paper on critical race theory by the conservative Heritage Foundation.“As I see it, critical race theory recognizes that revolutionizing a culture begins with the radical assessment of it,’” Bell wrote in an essay cited by Heritage. Others who helped establish the intellectual movement include law professors Kimberle Crenshaw of UCLA and Columbia University, Cheryl Harris of UCLA, Richard Delgado of the University of Alabama and Patricia Williams of Columbia University. Ms. Crenshaw “did not believe racism ceased to exist in 1965 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, nor that racism was a mere multi-century aberration that, once corrected through legislative action, would no longer impact the law or the people who rely upon it,” according to a 2019 profile in Vox. “Rather, as Crenshaw wrote, discrimination remains because of the ‘stubborn endurance of the structures of White dominance.’”Until recently, the teaching of slavery focused on the actions of specific people, whether it be slave owners or members of the Ku Klux Klan, said Dorinda Carter Andrews, chairwoman of Michigan State University is department of teacher education. She credited critical race theory with helping educational thought evolve to a broader approach to racism.“What teachers are trying to do is get young people to think of slavery not just as the actions of what White individual people do to individual Black folks, but see slavery as part of an economic system at the time,” she said. Using that broader view, teachers are discussing how the US system of government continues to disadvantage people of color.“Critical race theory does not claim that White people are bad,” Ms. Andrews said. “It is opposed to any form of racism in which one group has systemic power over another.”The material used in classrooms, however, often takes a decidedly negative view of White people. City Journal, a publication of the conservative Manhattan Institute, showcased the essay that Buffalo middle school students were assigned to read as a prime example of critical race theory in practice. The essay, “Definition of Systemic Racism in Sociology,” was written by sociologist Nicki Lisa Cole. It says “all White people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.”The essay contends that systemic racism “is premised on the research-supported claim that the USs was founded as a racist society, that racism is thus embedded in all social institutions, structures and social relations within our society.”Ms. Cole, of the Graz Institute of Technology in Styria, Austria, wrote that racism is everywhere: “It is present in our laws, our politics, our economy; in our social institutions; and in how we think and act, whether consciously or subconsciously. It is all around us and inside of us, and for this reason, resistance to racism must also be everywhere if we are to combat it.”She cites fellow sociologist Joe Feagin: “Feagin uses historical evidence and demographic statistics to create a theory that asserts that the USs was founded in racism since the Constitution classified Black people as the property of White people. Feagin illustrates that the legal recognition of slavery based on race is a cornerstone of a racist social system in which resources and rights were and are unjustly given to White people and unjustly denied to people of color.”Ms. Cole wrote, “These historical practices created a social system that had racist economic inequality built into its foundation and was followed through the years in numerous ways, like the practice of ‘redlining’ that prevented [people of color] from buying homes that would allow their family wealth to grow while protecting and stewarding the family wealth of White people.”She concluded that the problem continues in the “massive difference in the average wealth of White versus Black and Latino families.”Buffalo Public Schools declined to comment for this article. Fatima Morrell, the school district is associate superintendent for culturally and linguistically responsive initiatives, has said the classwork is not designed to indoctrinate students.“We definitely have not pushed any political agendas,” she told WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. “We give them the research, and we allow them to have the discussion, and the n to problematize and question anything they are learning,” she said. “Then we allow our students to make up their own minds about positions that they will take.”Ms. Morrell said students need to be taught about systemic racism. “There is implicit bias, and there is systemic racism, and so we want to problematize that,” she said. Critical race theory advocates insist the lessons better reflect reality in teachings about race, civics and American history. Teaching that the ills of slavery continue to keep down people of color, they say, gives students a fuller understanding of the nation is history and the current racial strife, rather than what they consider to be a Eurocentric, watered-down version that American schools have traditionally taught.“I believe, if we are intellectually honest without ourselves, we know that this country was founded on principles associated with White supremacy,” said David B Miller, director of International Education Programs at Case Western Reserve University is school of applied social sciences. “Unless and until we can have an honest discussion of the good, bad and ugly, the nation will continue to struggle with this.”To many parents, however, the idea of systemic racism — that American laws and institutions such as education and health care are biased against minorities — is an over simplistic fallacy. Opponents warn that steeping children in critical race theory spreads a distorted view of America.“It is basically a narrative script that says White people are the oppressors and other people are at different levels of being oppressed,” said Asra Nomani, vice president for strategy and investigations at Parents Defending Education, which tracks race-based instruction at schools.“It is so simple-minded. It is very shallow and very superficial and intellectually vacuous,” she said. “We definitely should talk about racism and discrimination, but we need to do it with a balanced lens.”The principal of an elementary school in San Mateo, California, sent home an “oppression matrix” to guide parents in conversations with their children about race. Society is privileged people, the matrix said, are White people. Those labeled as oppressed included “Asian, Black, Latino/a, Native People.”The school district did not respond to The Washington Times’ inquiries about the “oppression matrix.”“By sending messages like White people are privileged and Black people are not, or that the system favors Whites over Blacks, it causes us to go into camps based on race,” Ms. Nomani said. “That actually is a departure from the civil rights movement and the nation is ideals of a color-blind society.”The spread of critical race theory in schools is fueling a backlash. The Florida Department of Education last week barred the teaching of critical race theory in the state is public schools. It said students should not have lessons that “distort historical events.”Lawmakers in 15 other states have proposed bills barring the teaching of divisive ideas such as critical race theory. Opponents also are flooding the US Department of Education with complaints about a proposed grant program that would encourage K-12 schools to incorporate critical race theory into their curricula. The proposal does not specifically mention critical race theory but includes The New York Times’ “1619 Project” as an example of what the Biden administration would like schools to use. The newspaper series has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies and presenting American icons such as President Lincoln in a negative light. Christopher F Rufo, a contributing editor of City Journal, wrote in the New York Post that school districts are using mandatory training sessions to hammer teachers with critical race theory. In one session, Seattle public school teachers were told that “the USs was built off the stolen labor of kidnapped and enslaved Black people is work,” according to Mr. Rufo is account.“At the conclusion of the training, teachers had to explain how they will practice “anti-racist pedagogy,” address the “social-justice movements taking place” and become “anti-racist outside the classroom,” he said.“The main message: White teachers must recognize that they ‘are assigned considerable power and privilege in our society because of their ‘possession of white skin.’ To atone, they must self-consciously reject their ‘whiteness’ and become dedicated ‘anti-racist educator[s].’”Seattle Public Schools declined to comment. Critical race theory, opponents say, also is seeping into public policy. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative advocacy law firm, last month sued the Biden administration for prio rit izing bars and restaurants owned by women and minorities to receive coronavirus relief funds. The lawsuit accused the administration of discriminating against White business owners. The law firm also submitted comments against the Biden administration is proposed grants for schools to teach critical race theory.“CRT, is, at bottom, a Marxist experiment to remake society through class struggle. It is not an educational tool and certainly should not be funded with our tax dollars,” the group wrote. Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC Click here for reprint permission.

At first, Pence was greeted by cheers when he appeared on stage at the Faith and Freedom Coalition event, which was billed as charting a policy course toward a conservative majority. But as he began speaking, he was briefly interrupted by a woman who shouted “traitor” several times before she was escorted out. Pence ignored the outburst and continued with his speech. It is unclear who the woman was or what her motivation was for heckling Pence. As she started, others in the audience also appeared to yell ""no!"" repeatedly as Pence spoke over the cacophony. During the January 6 assault on the Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump is supporters, some in the crowd were heard chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” who was in the building overseeing the counting of electoral votes solidifying Biden is presidential victory. Trump had been urging Pence to try to overturn the results of the election, but the vice president said hed id not believe he had the authority to do so, causing a highly public rift between the two that worsened in the aftermath of the riot. Though Pence on Friday touted what he saw as the accomplishments of the Trump presidency, he has also made clear recently that he may never see “eye to eye” with the former president about January 6. At a GOP event in early June, Pence called it a “dark day in the history of the USs Capitol.”""You know, President Trump and I have spoken many times since we left office. And I do not know if we will ever see eye to eye on that day,” he said. The former vice president delivered his usual stump speech Friday, outlining what he said are the promises he and Trump fulfilled over the last four years and attacking the job President Joe Biden has done so far.“After 140 days, the Biden administration and Washington Democrats pushing open borders, higher taxes, runaway spending, de funding the police, abortion on demand, censoring free speech, canceling our most cherished liberties — the time has come for every American dedicated to faith and freedom to stand up and be heard and turn back the agenda of the radical left,” he said. Pence slammed the Democratic Party, which he claimed was responsible for setting “off a violent crime wave that is wreaking havoc on families all across the country,” and took a swipe at the Black Lives Matter movement.“Black lives are not endangered by police. Black lives are saved by police,” Pence said. ""We do not need to de fund the police, we need to defend the police, and put the lives of law-abiding citizens.”Pence did not address the numerous deaths of Black people in police custody, including George Floyd in Minneapolis, which sparked protests for racial justice and police reforms last summer in cities across the country.

This could cost DHS a lot, and leave the department – which is already dealing with ast affing shake-up– liable for problems that may happen during transfers (like injuries). Also, it is not entirely clear that the move islegal. Immigration has been a top priority for President Trump, and his admin has struggled to deal with the influx of migrants.

More than 1,200 people have reportedly been killed and more than 115,000 are infected. You need a high immunization rate to help prevent a measles outbreak (think: about 90-95% of people in an area). But in Madagascar, less than 60% of people are vaccinated.

Since the '70s, the two have coexisted in a pretty simple relationship: writers bring the talent and agents get them jobs...in exchange for a cut of the money.

That is because the writers' union – the Writers Guild of America – was frustrated over how agents were starting to work more closely with studios without passing on the extra money. Now, the writers' union is telling 13,000 Hollywood writers to fire their agents until they can work something out.

528,Public Health Experts Call On CDC To Change Its Mask Guidance,-6.0,45.33,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/22/1019311989/public-health-experts-call-on-cdc-to-endorse-masking-indoors,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not budged on its guidance that vaccinated people can skip mask-wearing, but some local governments faced with surging cases are going back to mandates, such as Los Angeles County, which recently mandated indoor mask use, including at places like bars and restaurants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not budged on its guidance that vaccinated people can skip mask-wearing, but some local governments faced with surging cases are going back to mandates, such as Los Angeles County, which recently mandated indoor mask use, including at places like bars and restaurants. Thesummer surge in COVID-19 cases is an unwelcome surprise for health officials and experts who thought, for a brief period, that the US had the coronavirus pandemic largely under control.""This is the low season. It should not be spreading as fast during summer,"" saysAli Mokdad, who tracks coronavirus trends at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. Respiratory diseases such as the flu and COVID-19 usually spike in the winter, when people spend much of their time sequestered indoors. But now, in the blazing heat of summer,hospitals in some parts of the country are again getting slammed with COVID-19 patients. Holiday gatherings over the Fourth of July — which President Biden once hoped would mark the country isindependence from the virus— may have fueled new outbreaks. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths are ticking up after a long decline. Back in mid-May, when over a million new people were getting vaccinated each day, theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance declaring that it was safe — for fully vaccinated people — to shed their masks in most settings. ""You can do things you stopped doing because of the pandemic,"" the CDC is director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said at the time. Now, with vaccination progress stalling, a growing chorus of doctors and experts is saying the CDC let up on masking too early. They want the nation is public health agency to call for masking and mitigation measures in areas that are suffering, to stop the virus is spread.""We need to reduce the circulation of the virus right now, so when we start the surge in the winter, we will be in a better position,"" Mokdad says. The CDC is May guidance was based on sound science but led to poor policies, saysDr. Ali Khan, a former CDC official who is now at the University of Nebraska Medical Center is College of Public Health. The vaccines do protect people from getting seriously ill from COVID-19, so letting vaccinated people stop wearing masks made sense.""The science was strong at that time,"" Khan says. The CDC intended for the announcement to encourage people to get vaccinated. It did for some, says Khan, but it also led to the de facto lifting of mask policies for unvaccinated people — just before the more transmissible delta variant started to take hold. The summer surge, he says, is the result: ""Those who did not want to wear a mask and did not want to get vaccinated are out there now spreading disease to others who are not vaccinated.""The timing of the guidance was off, saysJessica Malaty Rivera, an infectious disease epidemiologist who has worked with theCOVID Tracking Project.""When the Biden administration and the CDC [said] if you are vaccinated, you can take your mask off, I screamed,"" she says. ""Because for so long, we have been talking about getting to a place where transmission is low and vaccination is high. Transmission was lower [at the time]. Vaccination was not high. So it seemed truly premature.""The tone of the messaging also signaled to vaccinated people that they could throw caution to the wind, Rivera says. ""It gave people, in their minds, immunity passports,"" she says. ""It said to the m, 'I am vaccinated — I can go to Miami. I am vaccinated — I can go to this party in a basement.' ""The messaging around lifting mask use should have been more gradual, Rivera says: ""You can change some of your behavior, but do not just have a rager as if the pandemic was not happening. Calibrating, instead of eliminating [all caution], was where we needed to go.""It is not too late for the CDC to change its tune now, particularly with a more transmissible virus spreading rapidly, saysDr. Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University: ""In my mind, it would be advisable for CDC to say, given the spread of the delta variant in our country, we would recommend that people go back to using masks indoors,"" particularly in areas with huge spikes in cases.""It would be helpful for the CDC to say, if your numbers get to a certain level, you should recommend masking,"" he says. Implementing indoor mask mandates for everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is ""the right and scientific thing to do,"" says IHME is Mokdad. ""That is the only way we can send a signal to the public in the USs that we are not out of danger, [while] we encourage [more] people to go and get the vaccine.""Several health care organizations have recently called for universal masking for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, includingNational Nurses United, a large nurses union, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recently recommended universal masking in schools. Rivera says this policy would be safer and easier to implement than theCDC is guidance, which offers different options for vaccinated and unvaccinated people.""Who is going to be monitoring who is vaccinated and who is unvaccinated? Teachers, administrators, parents?"" Rivera asks. She adds that having different rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated people ""creates all kinds of issues of equity and judgment and access.""So far, the CDC stands by its statement that vaccinated people do not generally need to wear masks. ""At this time, we have no intention of changing our masking guidance,"" wrote CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald, in bold text, in an email to NPR In a White Housepress briefing on July 22, the CDC is Walensky described mask-wearing, for vaccinated people, as ""a very individual choice.""""You have exceptional levels of protection from that vaccine, and you may choose to add an extra layer of protection by putting on a mask,"" she said, while also suggesting that local officials in places with large gaps in vaccination coverage and rising case rates consider ""additional measures.""The public is lulled by the fact that the summer surge is largely hitting unvaccinated young people, who are more likely to survive COVID-19, says Khan. But the re is a danger that the surge in cases could spill back into more vulnerable groups, such as older adults and immunocompromised people.""There are still many people in those high-risk groups that have not yet gotten the vaccine, and it is not 100% effective,"" he notes. Meanwhile, cases are rising rapidly week over week. Vaccinated people are still protected. But the more virus that is circulating in the community, the more likely it is that people — both unvaccinated and vaccinated — will get it.""What you do not want is disease to spread from younger people back into high-risk individuals, which would be a disaster,"" Khan says.",2,2,NPR

The organization has 110 staff members; about 80 of them will be eligible to join the union. Sunrise Movement, founded in 2017, gained momentum thanks to a huge network of grassroots organizers — the majority of whom are unpaid. There are thousands more Sunrise supporters that are volunteers, according to Sunrise. Volunteers will not be part of the union. When asked about whether Sunrise workers are pushing for any particular protections or benefits, Gabbi Pierce, internal communications coordinator at Sunrise, said that was not a primary focus. Instead, workers unionized in order to gain tools that would let them deal with employment issues when they come up, “to protect what we have as workers in an organization that we really value,” Pierce said. “We are more motivated to organize to protect what we like in our jobs, and what we have in our jobs.”The announcement follows the high-profile exit of former Sunrise regional organizer Akshai Singh.

They were originally set to take place in 2020, but we repostponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. This time around, despite concerns abouts urging COVID-19 case number sin Japan and the nation is slow vaccinationrate, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) appears to be adapt inga “show must go on” mentality. The 17-day series of games are set for Friday, July 23 through Sunday, August 8. Athletes are already arriving in Japan — but unlike past years, they have been mostly confined to their hotel rooms. Here is what you need to know. The Tokyo Olympics marks the second time Japan is capital has hosted the games since 1964. There will be more than 11,000 athletes participating in games across42 competition venues. According to the IOC, viewers can expect a number of new sports this year including skateboarding, surfing, baseball, and karate. The games are being streamed across a mix of platforms. NBC will broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies along with competitions. A full schedule of games is available on theTokyo Olympics website. Additional coverage can be found onNBCOlympics.com, the NBC Sports app, and NBCUniversal is streaming service,Peacock(which has a free tier for Olympics coverage). Japan has been hit hard by COVID-19 this spring, thanks to the spread of a troubling new strain nicknamed “Eek” that scientists say carries a mutation that reduces vaccine protection. Hospitals were nearly hitting capacity as recently as last month, forcing people to be treated at home or wait to be admitted to a medical facility,reported. It is part of the country is current fourth wave of infections. In May, Japan peaked at about6,200 cases daily. That same month, a group of health professionals signed a letter pleading with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to cancel the games to no avail. Still, the numbers have allegedly improved since the n with officials reporting that cases have dropped to about2,000 per day. But a troubling new report from the questions the data is accuracy, alleging that Japan is “massaging” its COVID-19 numbers to look more favorable ahead of the games. To address COVID-19 safety, Japan is currently banning foreign spectators from attending events. As for local spectators, the Japanese newspaper reports that the government will make a final decision about crowds and potential crowd capacities by around June 20. Vaccines are not required for athletes ahead of their arrival, but they will be available to Olympics officials and athletes because of donations from Pfizer and BioNTech. Athletes will betesteddaily, and non athletes (coaches and officials) will be tested daily for the first three days after arrival and the n “regularly” (though it is unclear how often that really is). And unlike a non-pandemic year when visiting athletes would be able to tour the local area, visitors have been asked not to go to bars, restaurants, or use public transportation. Athletes have also been advised to socially distance when they are not in a sports setting — which, as noted byThe Cut, puts a huge damper on potential romping at the infamous “horny Olympic Village.” Hugs and high fivesare“discouraged” and mask sare required most of the time. The quarantining has forced most visiting athletes to get real comfortable in their hotel rooms. According to the, the Australian national women is softball team — which arrived in Tokyo earlier this month to train — have been spending most of their downtime playing video games in their hotel. I am so glad you asked. As previously noted, until just recently, COVID-19 was ravaging Japan. Even now, only about2% of the country is vaccinated, according to the BBC That is probably one reason locals do not seem particularly enthusiastic about the upcoming massive events. In fact, public opinion of the games islow, with more than 80% of Japanese residents saying they are in favor of the Olympics being postponed again or canceled altogether, according to theLA Times. As of last week, thousands of volunteers have quit, perReuters. We also know that cities that host the Olympics can be negatively affected through financial burdens, excess waste, and the displacement of locals to make way for stadium infrastructure. There have been many localprotestsandad campaigns opposing the event. But both the IOC and the Japanese government appear to feel that they are in too deep — pulling out of the Olympics now could reportedly cost the country billions of dollars. Simone Biles.

535,A Daring Left and a Cowed Center,16.67,30.67,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/08/a-daring-left-and-a-cowed-center/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"The first fact of sociopolitical life in America today is this: liberals in elite positions are frightened of the Left. A college president may direct an institution with a $900 million endowment, meet with legislators and business heads, and boast a 30-year record of academic honors, but the sight of eight African American undergrads marching toward his office with scowls on their faces alarms him like nothing else. A CEO may draw a $3 million salary and manage 1,300 workers, but the threat of a boycott coming from a few networked Millennials with ties to Sleeping Giant calls for immediate emergency action. They know what they are up against. Leftists form digital mobs, shut down events, block access, cancel, and dox. They show up at people is homes, harass employers, and ruin businesses. They are ruthless, they are irrational, but the tantrums they throw muck up the works and clog the pipes. That is the advantage they press—they will tear the system down if the people in power do not comply. A liberal in charge of an organization is particularly vulnerable. His job is to do precisely the opposite of clogging. He must maintain the flow, keep the wheels turning, and the money coming. His highest ideal is stability. He does not believe very deeply in Truth, Honor, Integrity, and Fairness, but he is not cynical. He does favor those virtues, but he knows not to clasp them too closely. That road, he understands, leads to conflict. Conflict, however, is the Left is primary method, not resolution. In the 1960s, when youth protests hit the campus and the streets, liberal leaders were baffled by the frequent absence of clear and distinct priorities laid out by the protesters. Oh, there were lots of specifics, but the crowds’ actions seemed to exceed the content of their stipulations. The concessions liberals made to demonstrators did not appear to satisfy them even though the concessions were exactly what the demonstrators asked for. There was an antic, anarchic character to the mass that did not fall sway to negotiation. Liberals in charge kept asking the mselves, “What exactly do they want? What is their agenda?” Protesters talked about “the system” and other hazy conditions that were too abstract and cosmic for high-level bureaucrats to address. It was very confusing for the m,and that was the point: to keep officials uncertain and off-balance. If liberals never quite understood what these unpredictable characters would do next, if they saw that the protesters did not give a damn about the institution for which the liberals were responsible, the intimidation worked. This is where liberals in power are now. They aim for a peaceful, prosperous society wherein nobody pushes the strong beliefs—God, family, nation—too strongly. Let is all get along. But the crowd to their left is volatile, and it senses a moment of opportunity. Not long ago, hard leftists were marginal figures in liberal institutions, from the New York Timesto Yale University to the Democratic Party. Now, they run a fair portion of the operations, including human resource departments in corporate America. Liberal leaders dislike the dynamic, but they ca not face down the Left. So they choose another tactic: to fabricate dangerous terrorism forming on the Right. When we compare the facts of right-wing violence against liberal anxieties over it, we have to judge those professed anxieties either as a cynical maneuver or a pathological defense mechanism. I favor the latter. I have heard too many liberals express their concerns with too much sincerity to think otherwise. The grave distress over a dangerous, anti-democratic Right looks like a way for liberals to appease or distract their leftist accusers, though liberals may not realize exactly what they are doing. The ridiculous overreaction to a putative white nationalist threat does not just foster liberal politics, for instance, turning Donald Trump into a demon that must go. It also serves a psychic need. By postulating a right-wing menace, liberals can work off the nervousness that leftists cause them by applying it to a substitute object. Their tension with the far Left is displaced onto tension with an imagined far-Right, one that does indeed allow them to speak out. College presidents ca not confront leftist protesters and punish them for violations of academic codes. Still, they can broadcast with fervor their abhorrence of the “haters” on the Right who have caused those protesters to suffer. Whatever actually happened at the Capitol on Wednesday, liberal leaders have expressed their alarm in such solemn and dismayed to nes one can sense a profound relief behind their words. The discord liberals have felt in their relations with the radical Left now dissipates in the sober condemnation of the Trump hordes. For a moment, liberals may unite with the Left in a reassuring unity. The rioters have given them a fresh opening to tell their overheated comrades: “See?—If not for us, these right-wing crazies would seize the reins and victimize you all over again.”The liberal elite has a profound interest in maintaining this right-wing danger. The window-breakers at the Capitol have done them a great favor. While left-wing riots proceeded all summer, liberals had to keep their mouths shut. The hard Left had taught them to watch what they say, and it could not have made the elite comfortable, not when they care so much about a status quo that keeps them in high places. Leftists are quite right to cast the status quo and “the system” as dubious things. This is where the liberal elite is most vulnerable. All too many conservatives and establishment Republicans fail to recognize this dynamic. They do not see that when liberal elites sign on to “systemic racism” and other leftist concoctions that liberals are not endorsing an ideology. No,they are protecting the mselves. The failure to discern liberal motives may be because establishment Republicans, too, have an investment in the status quo. It is done well by the m, and it is made them just as scared of the fractious Left as liberal elites are. That was the big problem with Donald Trump. He was not scared. The guilt trips, the accusations, #TheResistance . . . none of it fazed him. He did not worry about leftist students and activist groups and community organizers and digital mobs targeting him, occupying his office, running through 10 years of Facebook posts, or picketing outside his building. He could have worried about the m, but he did not. It was not in his character. That is why leftists and liberals hated him so, and why establishment Republicans wanted him gone. He would not play the game. Now that his presidency is over, it remains to be seen whether Republicans will go back to the old rules or not. It all depends on this: have enough conservative voters been awakened to the sham that if Republicans sustain it, they will be punished in 2022?",1,0,American Greatness

537,What Is A Filibuster? Here is What is Up With The Latest Congressional Fight,-10.33,37.67,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/what-is-a-filibuster-heres-whats-up-with-the-latest-congressional-fight-58925354,https://adfontesmedia.com/elite-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,16,"For the first time in two decades, the Senate chamber is split 50-50, and new Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and new Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are already butting heads. America is first congressional clash under the administration of President Joe Biden was settled on January 26, as McConnell relented on his demand that Democrats maintain the Senate filibuster rule — effectively putting an end to an early partisan gridlock. Butwhat is a filibuster, how does it work, and how would it affect Biden is agenda as president? Here is what is up with the latest congressional fight. Because of the January 5 Senate runoff elections, in addition to Vice President Kamala Harris' position as tie-breaker, Democrats have effectively gained control of the Senate in 2021. While a Democratic majority is ideal for Biden, seeing as how it would help him pass a COVID-19 relief package and other much-needed legislation, Republicans still have one handy tool to obstruct the president is agenda: the Senate filibuster. According to the US Senate, ""a filibuster is an attempt to block or delay Senate action on a bill or other matter"" through debate, which in practice usually means that some determined politician stands up and talks for hours on end (or, more normally, just threatens to do so)to prevent moving forward. It can go on indefinitely — that is, until cloture is invoked. The Senate cloture rule limits filibusters to just 30 hours of additional debate before requiring lawmakers to move to a decisive vote. However, 60 Senate members are needed to be on board invoke it, which effectively requires bipartisan support to get someone to sit down, shut up, and quit filibustering. While there are some exceptions, that high threshold for cloture means the filibuster can often be used as a way to stonewall legislation, since anyone who opposes a bill is unlikely to vote to end debate. Ultimately, that could pose a problem for Biden is early agenda. Progressive groups have put pressure on Democratic leaders to reform or eliminate the Senate filibuster rule as early as March 2020, and progressive members of Congress have followed suit — urging Biden to prevent Republicans from using the filibuster to obstruct legislation. When hashing out the terms of a new 2021 power sharing agreement (modeled after theThe 2001 Senate Powersharing Agreement) for a rare 50-50 congressional makeup, Schumer and McConnell reached a sticking point: McConnell wanted to keep the filibuster in place. In a January 23 interview with,Senator Dick Durbin criticized McConnell is demand to retain the filibuster. ""If we gave him that, the n the filibuster would be on everything, every day,"" Durbin said. Several other congressional Democrats agreed, including Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar, and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey. In a January 21 speech on the Senate floor, McConnell demanded the filibuster rule remain untouched. ""I cannot imagine the Democratic leader would rather hold up the power-sharing agreement than simply reaffirm that his side will not be breaking this standing rule of the Senate,"" he said. On January 26, however, he stepped down from the stalemate when two Democrats,Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, assured him they would not do away with the rule. ""The legislative filibuster was a key part of the foundation beneath the Senate is last 50-50 power-sharing agreement in 2001,"" McConnell said in a January 25 Senate address, voicing his approval of the compromise. ""With these assurances,I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent.""Amid this congressional clash between party leaders, a 2005 video of Biden speaking about the Senate filibuster rule has since resurfaced. In it, the president (only a Delaware senator the n) states that ""the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill,"" but rather, ""it is about compromise and moderation.""The roles were reversed at the time: Democrats were filibustering President George W Bush is nominees to appellate courts, and the Republican Party threatened to compromise the filibuster rule. This was avoided, however, through a bipartisan deal to invoke cloture among the Senate. The Senate filibuster rule has been in place since the mid 1800 is, and has facilitated countless compromises on legislation since the n. With a fiercely divided Senate — and nation — it is clear Biden will have to make a lot more room for compromise in the future.

538,Governor Newsom is French Laundry dinner raises question of what counts as outdoor dining,1.1,47.5,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/18/newsoms-french-laundry-dinner-raises-question-of-what-counts-as-outdoor-dining/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,17,"Governor Gavin Newsom has been busy apologizing to a pandemic-weary public about his decision to attend a dinner party earlier this month at the exclusive French Laundry in Napa County despite his daily pleas urging Californians not to congregate. But photos that surfaced this week of the get-together on an enclosed patio that the governor is office had said was “outdoors” are raising another question: What exactly constitutes outdoor dining? And, definitions aside, what is safe?With the arrival of wet, chilly weather, Bay Area restaurants already struggling to survive say the guidance has not been clear. And it is more important than ever, with most counties moving back this week in the state is reopening road map to the most restrictive purple tier, which allows only outdoor dining. The soiree Newsom attended at the 3-star Michelin restaurant did not sit well with Dan McCranie. Earlier this summer, state agents tried to shut down sidewalk service at his Ladera Grill in Morgan Hill and other South Santa Clara County restaurants in one of the first weeks of outdoor dining. More than five months later, the rules are still as opaque as the French Laundry is Red Kuri Squash Velouté.“I think our county and state medical executives are making the best decisions they can with their current understanding of the virus,” McCranie said. “Having said that, I do tire of being lectured to by science-challenged bureaucrats (and) putting up with the arrogance of our political establishment, who assume that they are so elevated in stature that the rules simply do not apply to them.“Governor Newsom falls into both of those line items.”When asked what constitutes outdoor dining, the state is public health department pointed to guidance for restaurants that mentions outdoor dining but does not explicitly define it. Individual counties can also create their own, more specific rules. Santa Clara County, for instance, says that outdoor dining spaces must either be uncovered (umbrellas excepted) or have at least half the perimeter open. That means a tented outdoor dining space must have at least two sides open to allow for free air flow, which helps limit the spread of the deadly disease. Alameda County also outlines specific guidelines for outdoor restaurants — giving businesses several options, including a shade structure “minimally open” on three sides to allow airflow. Contra Costa County is rules dictate that outdoor areas covered by sunshades must be fully open on all sides. EXCLUSIVE: We have obtained photos of Governor Gavin Newsom at the Napa dinner party he is in hot water over. The photos call into question just how outdoors the dinner was. A witness who took photos tells us his group was so loud, the sliding doors had to be closed. 10pm on@FOXLApic.twitter.com/gtOVEwa864— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA)November 18, 2020Before the photos surfaced on Fox is Los Angeles TV station, the governor is office said the birthday dinner for Newsom is aide was outdoors. But the pictures show a space with a roof and what appear to be at least three solid walls. The fourth wall appears to be a sliding glass door that was open at least part of the time, but when the party grew too loud it was reportedly closed. It is worth noting that while Napa County, where the French Laundry is located, is now in the purple tier, it was in a lower tier when the dinner occurred, meaning some indoor dining was allowed. The governor is office did not respond Wednesday morning to a request for comment. Napa County and the French Laundry also did not respond to questions about what constitutes outdoor dining.“I think it was bad judgment and terrible optics,” said John Swartzberg, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley, pointing out that the virus is spreading more rapidly than in the past. “Eating with other people now is much more dangerous than a few months ago, and a few months ago was dangerous.”In terms of the actual science, there really is no clear line between what is safe or unsafe in terms of outdoors vs indoors.“It is a continuum and the more airflow is restricted, the more indoors-y they behave,” said UCSF infectious disease expert George Rutherford of restaurant setups. “The safest is to be in an open field and spread out … as you add walls you are less likely to dissipate potential airborne particles into the atmosphere.”Researchers at Stanford and elsewhere have found that full-service dining is particularly risky, with the coronavirus spreading easily indoors, particularly where diners linger without masks as they eat. Even when there is clear county policy about what is allowed or not, restaurant owners still have to navigate city bureaucracies.

In Santa Clara County, the rules on outdoor dining have been in place for months, but county officials nevertheless are sending reminders to about 7,000 restaurants and food purveyors as they inform them of the new purple tier prohibition on indoor dining. It is primarily a matter of education, said Mike Balliet, the county official who is currently overseeing the Business Engagement Outreach Team. When they receive a complaint from a consumer that a restaurant is, for example, operating with an outdoor tent that is “completely enclosed,” Balliet said they research the restaurant is compliance paperwork, review the rules with the owners and ask them to make the necessary changes.“The vast majority of businesses want to do the right thing,” he said. “Once we have approached the m, typically they do.”",2,2,Mercury News

540,Are US Workers More Highly Taxed Than They Think?,2.67,43.67,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/12/Are-US-Workers-More-Highly-Taxed-They-Think,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-12,25,"Workers in many industrialized countries pay more in taxes than Americans do, but those workers also receive more benefits in exchange – benefits that American workers pay for separately. As a result, comparisons of tax rates across countries can be misleading, since they fail to capture payments made for similar benefits. The most important difference centers on health care, which most Americans pay for privately, along with their employers. Using recent data from the OECD, Matt Bruenig of the liberal People is Policy Project calculated “compulsory payment rates” across countries that include income taxes paid by employers and employees and add in the insurance premiums paid by both parties as well. Once American insurance premiums are included, the overall “tax” rate looks quite different in cross-national comparisons, with the US rising near the top in compulsory payments paid by labor (see the chart below). The upshot, Bruenig says, is simple: Americans “do not pay as many formal taxes as [Europeans] do, but when you bring in payments we are compelled to pay and that are deducted straight out of our paychecks just like taxes are, it really does not look that much different, at least as far as labor taxes are concerned.” And Bruenig says this makes the case for universal care that much stronger. “American workers already pay more than enough money to provide good health care to everyone in the country. It is just that they pay it into a private insurance system that wastes large portions of it on rents and administrative redundancy.”",1,2,Fiscal Times
541,"Two Pfizer Covid vaccine doses give over 95% protection, shows Israel study",-0.67,47.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/05/two-pfizer-covid-vaccine-doses-give-over-95-protection-shows-israel-study,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-05,25,"Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have proved more than 95% effective against infection, hosp itali sation and death from Covid-19 inIsrael, the country with the highest proportion of its population vaccinated in the world, research has found. One shot of the vaccine was partially effective, offering 58% protection against infection, 76% against hospitalisation, and 77% against death. The authors of the observational stud yin the Lancet medical journals ay this shows the importance of having the second shot. Their study demonstrates the power of vaccines to end the toll of coronavirus, they say. “These findings suggest that high vaccine uptake can meaningfully stem the pandemic and offers hope for eventual control of the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak as vaccination programmes ramp up across the rest of the world,” they wrote. Lead author, Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis, of the Israel ministry of health, said: “Until this point, no country in the world had described the national public health impact of a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. These insights are hugely important because, while there are still some considerable challenges to overcome, they offer real hope that Covid-19 vaccination will eventually enable us to control the pandemic.”But many other countries will not be able to imitate Israel, commentators in the journal say.“Regrettably, rapid population-level coverage cannot be easily replicated in many other countries. The global use of the [Pfizer/BioNTech] vaccine is limited by supply issues, high costs, and ultra-cold chain storage requirements,” wrote Prof Eyal Leshem of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Israel, and Prof Annelies Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who were not involved in the study. Israel has used only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which the company supplied on the understanding that data from the vaccination programme would be published to demonstrate its real-world efficacy. The country had a national lock down from 27 December 2020 until 7 March 2021 because of a big surge in infections, which peaked in January. By 3 April, 72% of adults over 16 and 90% of the over-65s had received two doses of the vaccine. As in the UK, the dominant strain of the virus has been the “Kent” variant, B117. Some cases of the “South African” variant, B1351, have been found latterly, but too few to be taken into account. By seven days after the second dose, the vaccine was giving people 95.3% protection against infection and 96∙7% protection against death. Protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 97.0% and 91.5%, respectively. Protection against hospital admission was 97.2% overall. By 14 days after the second dose, the protection had risen slightly further. The authors, some of whom declared shares in Pfizer, wrote that “relying on protection against Covid-19 from a single dose might not be prudent”. The vaccine was developed to be given as two shots and substantially higher levels of antibodies have been observed after the second dose.“Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses. It is possible that one dose will provide a shorter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new Sars-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge,” they wrote. In a separate study published in the BMJon Thursday, researchers from Denmark and Norway revealed their investigations into the blood clots that have been linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. They looked at 280,000 people aged 18-65 who received a first dose of the vaccine in the two countries in February and March. They found more clots in the veins than would be expected, although the events were still rare – 11 per 100,000 vaccinations. There were 2.5 clots in the veins of the brain per 100,000 jabs. Ina linked opinion, Prof Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia, said the study did not change the conclusions of the UK and European medicine regulators that the benefits of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks for most age groups.“Those countries that delayed their own vaccination programmes at a time of high transmission rates by declining to use available Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines should know that their decision will have contributed to an increase in the number of avoidable deaths from Covid-19,” he writes.",2,1,The Guardian

We are certainly mindful of the advances that the Taliban have made in terms of taking over yet — an increased number of provincial capitals. And the other thing I’d say is that no potential outcome has to be inevitable, including the fall of Kabul. ByChristina Goldbaum,Sharif HassanandFahim AbedKABUL, Afghanistan — Three major cities in western and southernAfghanistanwere confirmed on Friday to have fallen to the Taliban, as the insurgency is race to seize control of the country accelerated. In seizing Kandahar and Lashkar Gah in the country is southern Pashtun heartland, as well as Herat, a vital cultural and economic hub, the insurgents appear to be nearing a complete military takeover. Only three major cities — including the capital,Kabul— remain under government control, and one is under siege by the Taliban. With both Kandahar and Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, in their hands, the Taliban now effectively control southern Afghanistan. Over the past week, the insurgents have toppled city after city in a stunning advance that has well positioned them to attack Kabul. It has also laid bare the Afghan security forces’ near complete collapse less than three weeks before the USs is set to completely withdraw. Some American officials fear theAfghangovernment will implode within 30 days, and are preparing for an evacuation of the US Embassy in Kabul. The insurgents now control well over half of the country is 400-odd districts. And they hold more than a dozen provincial capitals, including another capital south of Kabul,Ghazni, and one in the northwest, Qala-e-Naw. The sieges in multiple cities have been devastating. Kandahar, Lashkar Gah and Herat had been heavily defended, with battles raging for weeks.

544,New York is Anti-Gun AG Touts Success In Brooklyn “Buyback”,11.67,34.33,https://bearingarms.com/cam-e/2021/01/31/ny-ag-success-gun-buyback/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,18,"Even though the re is absolutely no evidence that compensated confiscation events reduce violent crime, suicide, or accidents involving firearms, New York Attorney General Letitia James is hosting a so-called buyback this weekend in Brooklyn is Brownsville neighborhood. The cash and prizes offered to those handing over a gun no questions asked are pretty substantial; gift cards worth up to $25o as well as a new iPad. Event organizers say Brownsville was chosen for the Saturday swap because it is been hit hard by the spike in gun violence.“We get these guns off the streets, these guns ca not be used in crime. They ca not be used in suicides. We ca not have the tragedies that we see with children finding guns in their homes,”Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalezsaid. Forty-eight guns were collected Saturday. When asked if that was a disappointing total,State Attorney General Letitia Jamessaid all it takes is one.“One gun that can result in carnage, one gun that can result in the death of multiple individuals, so I am really not focused on the number,” she said. Something tells me if 480 guns were turned in, James would be touting that figure. The anti-gun AG might claim that getting even one gun “off the streets” can make a difference, but as former NYPD officer Rob O’Donnell noted on Twitter, James’ “buyback” could actually provide criminals with enough cash to go out and get another gun. So technically one could make about $600 profit per rifle ($50 gift card + $550 IPad). This simply highlights the nearsightedness of Government programs such as the se, asking for fraud and abuse but doing very little to reduce crime.— Rob O’Donnell (@odonnell_r)January 29, 2021Even those turning in “junk guns” that are not in working condition could receive enough money and goods to be able to afford a firearm in working condition, though they’d have to acquire it on the black market. That probably does not matter much to James either. The most beneficial aspect of her compensated confiscation effort is public relations, not public safety, and the AG has received glowing praise from local media for hosting the event. From the:“Gun violence is an ongoing threat to our communities,” said State Senator Zellnor Myrie. “We need to bring multi-faceted solutions to this problem — stronger legislation, support for community-based violence interruption groups on the front lines, and gun buyback events like this one. I am proud to support this confidential buyback event in Brownsville and thank Attorney General Letitia James and her staff, along with my other partners in government for their continued efforts to get guns off our streets.”“In 2020, NYC had a spike in gun violence which had a profound effect on our community in important measure to keep our children, families, and friends safe,” said Assemblymember Latrice Walker. “Thank you to Attorney General James, who has created a safe space for Brownsville and surrounding communities to turn in guns with no questions asked. Let is all take advantage of this program and make our streets safer.”“Getting guns off of the street is a multi-pronged approach,” said Council Member Alicka Ampry-Samuel. “It is imperative that we use every tool at our disposal to keep families and residents safe. The Southeastern part of my district has not had a shooting since November 4. The last gun buyback in Brooklyn recovered 33 guns. These are excellent statistics and we should move aggressively to keep up the momentum. Attorney General James’ track-record of gun buyback events across the state is something to be replicated right here in Brooklyn, and I thank her for her collaboration on this important event.”That reads more like a press release than an actual news story. If there was any real reporting on James’ so-called buyback, it would have to at least mention the fact that criminal justice experts say the re isno real benefit to these events other than allowing politicians like the ones quoted above to claim they are “doing something,” instead of doing something that works.",1,0,Bearing Arms

546,What is antifa and how does it relate to the season of protests?,1.67,49.33,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/9/2/21400139/answers-to-your-questions-about-antifa-anarchist-socialist-violence-protests-racism-anti-fascist,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,22,"Right-wing and left-wing protesters clashed in Portland, Oregon, as they have many times before. This time, a 600-car caravan of Trump supporters driving through the city attracted counterprotesters, and before the night was over, one man shot and killed another. A self-proclaimed anti fa supporter, 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehol, was investigated as a person of interest after his sister identified him to police.“I am 100% ANTIFA all the way! I am willing to fight for my brothers and sisters!” he wrote in a June 16 post. “We do not want violence but we will not run from it either!” When police went to arrest him in Olympia, Washington, the confrontation ended in his death. What is antifa? It is become a watchword in this highly volatile season of American politics. But everyone seems to use the word “antifa” differently, with definitions ranging from a small set of organized groups that oppose fascism, to a larger movement of anti-Trump protesters who are willing to resort to property destruction and violence. For the average American, it can be difficult to sort out what exactly anti fa is and whether it is a threat. Put simply, anti fa is an unstructured movement known for using counterprotests and physical force to stand against fascists and racists. The existence of the movement is incontestable, but observers debate whether it is dangerous. On Saturday night in Portland, individuals who identify as antifa, or anti-fascists, were just one type of people in the streets, along with Black Lives Matter supporters, and members of Patriot Prayer, a Portland-based right-wing group that is known for attracting white supremacists and getting into violent brawls. These groups have clashed many times before. But it is anti fa that President Donald Trump and several members of Congress have singled out by calling it a domestic terrorist organization. As protests against police brutality have raged for months, with some turning destructive in both Portland and Kenosha, Wisconsin, this amorphous group has been accused of stirring up street violence, destroying property and attacking police in cities across the country. Conservative pundits like Chris Talgo, editor and research fellow at the Heartland Institute based north of Chicago, say anti fa is a dangerous force, “hellbent on destroying people is businesses, federal property and the like.” Some academics, however, who have studied the movement say anti fa is being given more attention than it is due. Mark Bray, a part-time lecturer at Rutgers University and author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” acknowledges there has been a spike in violent and destructive demonstrations in the months following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. But he says that very few of the people engaging in such behavior are actively part of anti fa groups.“Antifa is a useful boogeyman,” said Bray, adding that certain conservative politicians and media sources have used anti fa as a broad term to describe anyone who carries out illegal acts involving arson, looting or graffiti. But while the number of members that belong to actual anti fa groups may be small, Talgo fears the movement, aided by social media, is having an outsized impact on the protest culture across the country.“I do understand anti fa is not responsible for all of this,” said Talgo. “But anti fa is laying the groundwork for this bedlam to take place by normalizing these tactics.”Today in the USs, antifa, which is short for anti-fascists, is known as a very loose collection of individuals and groups who aggressively oppose far-right movements, mainly focusing on white supremacists, neo-Nazis or other organizations with violent agendas like the Proud Boys, said Oren Segal, vice president for the center on extremism with the Anti-Defamation League. The movement is not organized. Rather, it is comprised of small squads of people in different cities, with no national leaders or unifying structure, Segal said. While the concept of anti-fascism dates back to the early 20th century when the authoritarian forms of government gained prominence in Europe, modern-day anti fa has its roots in a movement called Anti-Racist Action (ARA), which had anarchist and communist elements and emerged out of the Midwest in the 1980s, according to Alexander Reid Ross, who lives in Portland and is the author of “Against the Fascist Creep.” Anti-Racist Action grew in popularity among the left-wing anarchist punk scene, and in the mid-2000s some people associated with ARA started organizing as antifa, Ross said. It was not until 2015, however, when Trump is presidential candidacy sparked conflict between anti fa and far-right groups, that the movement attracted mainstream involvement and media attention, Ross said. Bray said it is impossible to quantify how many people are part of the anti fa movement. The Torch Network, a coalition of anti-racist and anti-fascist groups including Rose City Antifa, has just nine chapters. But Bray noted that there is a difference between people who are members of anti fa groups and people who associate with the cause more generally.“People doing this work do not divulge their identities,” said Bray, who interviewed more than 60 anti-fascists for his book. According to Ross, the Pacific Northwest, and Portland in particular, has become a focal point for antifa. Because of media attention, groups there are some of the most well-known, despite having few members, he said. Rose City Antifa in Portland, which formed in 2007, is the longest standing anti fa group in the US and mainly focuses on research, said Ross. A Rose City representative declined to answer questions about membership numbers. Another Portland-based anti fa group founded in 2018, called Popular Mobilization or PopMob, has less than 20 members, according to one of its founding members, Sylvan E She responded to a Facebook message sent by the Deseret News to the official PopMob page and asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy. Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and an expert in US politics and social movements, estimates that at most, the number of people who identify as part of antifa, is in the low thousands. But antifa is following online is much bigger. PopMob is social media following has doubled, said Sylvan E The group now has more than 20,000 followers on Twitter and 7,400 followers on Facebook. A web site called Itsgoingdown, a platform that covers the anti fa movement, went from having 9,000 followers on Twitter when Trump was elected, to 92,000 to day, according to a web site administrator. In an August 19 statement,Facebooksaid it removed more than 980 groups, 520 pages and 160 ads from Facebook in addition to 1,400 hash tags on Instagram that were being used by organizations to encourage riots, “including some who may identify as antifa.”In recent weeks, anti fa supporters in Portland wearing masks, helmets and shields have reportedly used weapons like rocks, fireworks and bottles filled with chemical solutions against far-right protesters and instigators.“Antifa activists focus on harassing right-wing extremists both online and in real life,” the Anti Defamation Leaguereported. “The use of violent measures by some anti fa against their adversaries can create a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame. This is why most established civil rights organizations criticize anti fa tactics as dangerous and counterproductive.”Ross said much of anti fa sees nonviolence as an ineffective tactic against fascists. Bray said property destruction is “one of the tools in their tool box,” in addition to do xx ing (disclosing sensitive information as a form of harassment) and community mobilization. When Bray was working at Dartmouth College, the president of the school wrote a letter disavowing Bray is research, because he did not denounce the legitimacy of violent protest tactics. Although, Bray says, violence is “not always the most effective strategy.”Jeff Schoep, an anti-racist advocate and the former head of the National Socialist Movement, which was once the largest neo-Nazi organization in the country, said he used to get into bloody fights with anti fa people who would come from out of state to protest at NSM rallies. But the fights only motivated him to further defend the white nationalist beliefs he held at the time, he said.“I definitely think anti fa is dangerous, and I definitely think we should be worried about it,” said Talgo. But in terms of street demonstrations, it is hard to attribute violent acts to anti fa groups or anti fa sympathizers because they usually do not self-identify, Talgo said. Such events also tend to attract opportunists and rogue criminals. Additionally, anti fa adherents and other protesters often dress in black block: all black clothing, including face coverings, making them hard to identify. It is a tactic that has been part of protest culture for decades but has become more popular as a means of maintaining anonymity in light of smart phones and increased surveillance, according to Bray.“Just because they are not wearing name cards that say, ‘Hi! I am an anti fa member,’ does not mean they are not associated,” said Talgo. Sylvan E. does not cast judgement on those who use violence in protest, but she said PopMob does not encourage it either.“We try not to draw too heavy a line between good protester and bad protester ideas. I think that ultimately serves to work against the actual work people are doing,” said Sylvan E. “We do not want to see people get hurt; that is not the goal of this movement.”Sylvan E. said that PopMob does not coordinate with anyone outside of Portland. She also explained that while members may support anarchist and communist ideologies individually, those the mes are not the focus of the group.“There is a frustrating lack of understanding in American media about what anti-fascism is and what anti fa means,” said Sylvan E. “People think the re is some sort of central organization pulling the strings making decisions for different anti fa chapters around the country, and that is very much not the case.”Because anti fa is an unstructured group, it is difficult to tell what kind of influence the movement has had on the tenor of protests in recent months, said Segal. But according to the ADL is tracking of public demonstrations since the pandemic, including those in response to the killing of George Floyd, there is no evidence that anti fa adherents have played any kind of organizational role, Segal said. They have however, showed up to participate in protests organized by others. Trump has repeatedly said that anti fa forces are responsible for nationwide destruction and unrest, despite reports from both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI which have shown no evidence of a direct link between anti fa involvement and protest violence, according to TheWashington Post. Rather “lone offenders” pose the biggest threat, said theFBI bulletin. And Trump himself may be driving online traffic to the to pic, with Twitter mentions leaping from 300,000 to 3.9 million in the two days after the president tweeted he would declare it a terrorist organization, according to an analysis by media intelligence companyZignal Labs. Sylvan E. says PopMob has taken a back seat role to the Black Lives Matter movement in Portland, although PopMob wholeheartedly supports Black Lives Matter and has used its platform to boost awareness. Sylvan E. said she has participated in the standoff between protesters and federal law enforcement officers that has taken place near the Hatfield Federal Courthouse over the course of many weeks, but her group did not play an organizational role in those demonstrations either.“The protests for Floyd is murder have been broader in terms of where they have taken place around the country, have involved a bigger cross section of the population politically and demographically, and have been more popular among Americans, especially Democrats and independents,” said Kazin. “I think anti fa is a tiny, tiny part of these demonstrations.”Talgo believes it is the mainstream media, not Trump, that has portrayed anti fa dishonestly.“The media is portraying them as the moral opposition to Donald Trump,” said Talgo. “I am struck by how it seems that the mainstream media uses gentle language with antifa. It is almost like they treat them with kid gloves like, ‘Oh, they are just out there trying to achieve social justice.’”“I would definitely say what is going on in Portland and Seattle represents the more radical elements, and if you let this keep happening, if you keep emboldening the m, it could spread like a virus,” said Talgo. Kazin maintains that the influence of anti fa is exaggerated, but opinions on both the right and on the left are affected by points of view.“The right likes to inflate it. Most people on the left wish it was not around because it hurts the cause of the left,” Kazin said. Even if antifa is power is overblown, the movement is still worth talking about, said Segal.“In a time where anti fa is being used as a political talking point, where the concept of anti fa is being used to create fear and anxiety, understanding what it actually is is more important than ever before,” Segal said.",2,2,Deseret News

Palladino, 76, an avid photographer, had just stepped outside his home near Masonic Avenue and Page Street to test out a new camera when someone tried the take it from him, according to police and his family. Palladino was pulled to the pavement and seriously injured. He remained on life-support as of Friday night, his family said. Palladino was known in his career for representing celebrities and sometimes dangerous clients including the Hells Angels. Born to a working class family in Boston, Palladino moved to the Bay Area to attend UC Berkeley before founding a detective agency in the 1970s with his wife, Sandra Sutherland. His early cases included work on the Patty Hearst kidnapping and interviewing survivors of the Jonestown Massacre. He would later help defend the auto magnate John DeLorean on drug charges before being hired to discredit sexual misconduct allegations against Clinton in the 1990s and, more recently, similar allegations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in 2017.

I do not live for anything but this.”Palladino cultivated a persona as a brash private detective who wore flashy suits, his stepson Nick Chapman told the Examiner on Friday.“He was a somewhat flamboyant character at times and could be very aggressive in defense of his clients,” Chapman said. But Palladino was also a “real human” who had just decided to retire at the beginning of the year, was reading short stories and had taken up cooking.“The stuff I read mostly does not capture the man I grew up with and who I worked for,” said Chapman, who worked under Palladino as a private detective.“He was very passionate about justice, about democracy, about the First Amendment, about people being entitled to the best defense that they could get,” Chapman said. “And he was not blind to the limitations of our justice system.”Police have not announced an arrest in the case.

Published: December 21, 2020 7:48pmUpdated: December 22, 2020 8:27amThe exodus of some businesses and wealthy executives from California is not stopping some state lawmakers from supporting a wealth tax proposal in a state where Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is being targeted for recall. A wealth tax proposal that was pushed this year would have applied up to a 0.4% tax on the amount of a state resident is net worth over $30 million dollars. The proposed bill,AB 2088, would have made those who spent more than 60 days in California in a year subject to some level of the wealth tax. The amount of the person is wealth subject to the tax would depend on the amount of time spent in the state during the prior ten years. And under the proposal, even leaving the state would not free the taxpayer of the burden, because anyone who had been subject to the tax in the preceding ten years would still be subject to some level of the state wealth tax for up to 10 years. State Senate Minority Leader Shannon Grove during an interview on the John Solomon Reports pod cast said that the proposal failed but that it ""is coming back this year."" According toLaw360, state legislators adjourned without advancing the legislation. Grove, a Republican, said state Democrats will ""try to say that if you generate any revenue in the state...that they can track you down in whatever other state you go to and they can tax you California state taxes for ten years after you leave.""And while some state lawmakers support slapping wealthy individuals with a wealth tax, some Californians are backing a push to recall Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.""Unaffordable housing. Record homelessness. Rising crime. Failing schools. Independent contractors thrown out of work. Exploding pension debt. And now, a locked down population while the prisons are emptied.

If you have been paying attention to population trends in Alabama over the last decade, that fact should not surprise you. Baldwin County, home to most of the state is beaches, has been one of the fastest growing counties in the state over the last few years, and the Number 1 fastest since 2010. It is also the state is largest county in terms of physical size, with more square miles than the entire state of Rhode Island. And Baldwin County is also home to Foley, a city of around 21,000 people and the fastest growing city in Alabama between 2019 and 2020, according to recently released population estimates from the US Census Bureau.[Ca not see the list?Click here.]Foley added more than 1,000 people in that one year, a growth rate of 5.1% - the fastest rate among Alabama cities with at least 10,000 people in 2020. And over the last decade, Foley is growth is even more impressive. Between 2010 and 2020, it added nearly 7,000 people, or a growth rate of around 47%. Three other cities in Baldwin County made the top 10 - Fairhope (Number 3), Gulf Shores (Number 7) and Daphne (Number 8). Alabama is second fastest growing city - Athens - should not be a surprise, either. It is part of Limestone County, another fast-growing county and part of the Huntsville metro area. Athens grew by 4.5% between 2019 and 2020, helpingLimestone County become Alabama is fastest growing county over the last two years. The fourth fastest growing city in Alabama is not actually a city at all. Pike Road is a town in Montgomery County, and nowhere else in the state can compete with its growth over the last decade. In 2010, it was home to just 5,400 people. Since the n, its population has nearly doubled, now standing at 10,500, for a growth rate of more than 95%. A pair of cities in the Birmingham metro area made the top 10 - Calera (Number 5) and Chelsea (Number 6). Auburn, home to its namesake university, is the engine fueling fast-growing Lee County. It is the largest city to make the top 10 for growth rate, with an estimated population of 68,000 people in 2020. Auburn added around 1,900 people between 2019 and 2020, which was also the highest total population gain among the top 10. It ranked ninth in growth rate at 2.9%. Cullman city, in Cullman County, rounded out the top 10 with a growth rate of 2.6% between 2019 and 2020. Some of these numbers could soon change. The population figures discussed here are estimates, specifically part of a program used to gauge the accuracy of the Census Bureau is ability to make good educated guesses about population totals. To do that, these estimates will be compared to the 2020 Census - the once-a-decade head count of each person living in the USs.2020 Census numbers will be released later this year, and some major corrections are expected in Alabama. Earlier this year the Census released state population totals - the first official batch of numbers from the count. In that count,Alabama had about 100,000 more people than expected, and it is not clear where those extra people might be.

Thursday is new-case report marks the first day the state has reported more than 2,000 new cases since August 1. The US on Wednesday tallied more than 100,000 new cases in a single day for the first time. Identified COVID-19 cases in Arizona rose by 2,135 on Thursday to 252,768, and known deaths were at 6,087, according to the daily report from the Arizona Department of Health Services. New cases have eclipsed 1,000 for nine of the past 12 days. The past several weeks have seen relatively higher daily case reports as the virus spreads at its fastest rate in Arizona since June, although case numbers are still well below where they were during the summer peak. But new case rates in Arizona fall below the rates reported in 33 other states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isCOVID Data Trackersays. Cases are surging in North Dakota, where the new case rate per 100,000 people for the previous seven days was 157.8 as of Wednesday, the CDC reports. By comparison, Arizona is rate was 19.3. The increase in new COVID-19 cases in the summer was an early indicator of more hospitalizations and deaths in the weeks to come. Governor Doug Ducey last week saidArizonans ""need to keep our guard up""but announced no new preventive measures, instead pointing to existing strategies such as restaurant capacity limits. The number of patients hospitalized statewide for known or suspected COVID-19 cases rose to 1,100 on Wednesday, up from 1,065 on Tuesday and 956 on Monday.

COVID-19 patients were using 13% of all inpatient beds and 15% of ICU beds. Overall, 30% of ventilators were in use. Percent positivity, which refers to the percent of COVID-19 diagnostic tests that are positive, has gone up slightly, which many health experts consider an early indicator of a spike in illnesses. Of known test results from last week, the percent positivity was 7%, up from 6% the week prior, according to the state, which has a unique way of calculating percent positivity. Percent positivity was at 4% for several weeks during August, September and October, according to state data. Johns Hopkins Universitycalculates Arizona is seven-day moving average of percent positives at 11.7% as of Thursday. It shows the state is percent positivity had reached a relative plateau and is now trending upward. A positivity rate of 5% is considered a good benchmark that the spread of the disease is under control. Reported cases in Arizona: 252,768. Cases increased by 2,135, or 0.85%, from Wednesday is 250,633 identified cases since the outbreak began.

Last week it was at 7%, up from 6% the week prior. The state number sleave out data from labs that do not report electronically. ADHS has begun including probable cases as anyone with a positive antigen test, another type of test to determine current infection. Antigen tests (not related to antibody tests) are a newer type of COVID-19 diagnostic test that use a nasal swab or another fluid sample to test for current infection. Results are typically produced within 15 minutes. A positive antigen test result is considered very accurate, but the re is an increased chance of false-negative results, the Mayo Clinic says. Depending on the situation, Mayo Clinic officials say a doctor may recommend a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm a negative antigen test result. Arizona as of Wednesday had the 15th highest overall rate of infection in the country.

551,"For Midwest farmers, floodwaters threaten millions in crop and livestock losses",-0.25,54.5,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/for-midwest-farmers-floodwaters-threaten-millions-in-crop-and-livestock-losses,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Farmer Jeff Jorgenson looks out over 750 acres of cropland submerged beneath the swollen Missouri River, and he knows he probably will not plant this year. But that is not his biggest worry. He and other farmers have worked until midnight for days to move grain, equipment and fuel barrels away from the flood waters fed by heavy rain and snowmelt. The rising water that has damaged hundreds of homes and been blamed for three deaths has also taken a heavy toll on agriculture, inundating thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock. In Fremont County alone, Jorgenson estimates that more than a million bushels of corn and nearly half a million bushels of soybeans have been lost after water overwhelmed grain bins before they could be emptied of last year is crop. His calculation using local grain prices puts the financial loss at more than $7 million in grain alone. That is for about 28 farmers in his immediate area, he said. Once it is deposited in bins, grain is not insured, so it is just lost money. This year farmers have stored much more grain than normal because of a large crop last year and fewer markets in which to sell soybeans because of a trade dispute with China.“The economy in agriculture is not very good right now. It will end some of these folks farming, family legacies, family farms,” he said. “There will be farmers that will be dealing with so much of a negative they will not be able to tolerate it.”Jorgenson, 43, who has farmed since 1998, reached out to friends Saturday, and they helped him move his grain out of bins to an elevator. Had they not acted, he would have lost $135,000. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who has declared a disaster in 41 of Iowa is 99 counties, said she planned to press Vice President Mike Pence for a federal disaster declaration during his stops in Omaha to tour flooded areas along the Missouri River.“It will be helpful for him to see it. I have reached out, and we have told him it is catastrophic,” she said. Pence said the Trump administration would expedite presidential disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa. He said he spoke to the governors of both states shortly after arriving to assure them federal aid will soon be on the way. The flooding is expected to continue throughout the week in several states as high water flows down the Missouri River. Swollen rivers have already breached more than a dozen levees in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. The flooding, which started after a massive late-winter storm last week, has also put some hog farms in southwest Iowa underwater. The dead animals inside must be disposed of, Reynolds said. The water rose so quickly that farmers in many areas had no time to get animals out, said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.“Places that have not seen animal loss have seen a lot of animal stress. That means they are not gaining weight and will not be marketed in as timely a manner, which results in additional cost,” he said. In all, Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson estimated $400 million of crop losses from fields left unplanted or planted late and up to $500 million in livestock losses. In a news release issued Tuesday, Governor Pete Ricketts said there have been deadlier disasters in Nebraska but never one as widespread. He said 65 of the state is 93 counties are under emergency declarations. In neighboring Missouri, water was just shy of getting into Ryonee McCann is home along a recreational lake in Holt County, where about 40,000 acres (16,188 hectares) and hundreds of homes have been flooded. She said her home sits on an 8-foot (2.5-meter) foundation.“We have no control over it,” the 38-year-old said. “We just have to wait for the water to recede. It is upsetting because everything you have worked for is there.”The Missouri River was forecast to crest Thursday morning at 11.6 feet above flood stage in St. Joseph, Missouri, the third highest crest on record. More than 100 roads are closed in the state, including a growing section of Interstate 29. Leaders of the small northwestern Missouri town of Craig ordered an evacuation. The Holt County Sheriff is Department said residents who choose to stay must go to City Hall to provide their name and address in case they need to be rescued. In nearby Atchison County, Missouri, flood waters knocked out a larger section of an already busted levee overnight, making the village of Watson unreachable, said Mark Manchester, the county is deputy director of emergency management/911. Officials believe everyone got out before thousands of more acres were flooded. But so many roads are now closed that some residents must travel more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) out of their way to get to their jobs at the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, he said.“It is a lot harder for people to get around,” Manchester said. River flooding has also surrounded a northern Illinois neighborhood with water, prompting residents to escape in boats. People living in the Illinois village of Roscoe say children have walked through flood waters or kay aked to catch school buses.

The audience assumes Hammond is a Republican. Out joyriding one day, Hammond crashes his car and lapses into coma. While still comatose, the Angel Gabriel visits Hammond and turns him into a committed and caring progressive. Is there another kind?Upon waking, Hammond convenes his cabinet of corrupt self-servers and rejects their plea that the party must come first. Instead, Hammond insists their first priority be the American people. He refuses to use the US Army against a marching mass of the unemployed and fires the secretary of state when he objects.“I suggest you read the Constitution of the USs. You will find the President has some power,” Hammond warns his cabinet members. Some power? Fully indifferent to the Constitution, Hammond grabs all the power that can possibly be grabbed. When the cabinet objects to his usurpation of power, Hammond fires the cabinet. When Congress threatens to impeachHammond, he declares martial law and dispenses with Congress. When accused of being a dictator, Hammond argues that his is a dictatorship based on some imagined Jeffersonian principle of Democracy, namely the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Now with total power, Hammond enacts a national banking law, stops foreclosures, provides direct aid to some 55 million farmers, circumvents private industry and launches his own “Army of Construction.”A young aide, Hartley Beekman, and his female counterpart, Pendie Molloy, serve as something of a progressive chorus. “The way he thinks is so simple and honest that it sounds a little crazy,” says Beekman of Hammond.“He is doing the things you wanted,” Molloy answers. “And If he is mad, it is a divine madness.

When the nation is chief racketeer refuses to go back to his unnamed home country, Hammond warns him that the government is about to “muscle in on his racket” and federalize the sale of alcohol. The racketeer fights back, and Beekman employs a legion of tanks Waco-style against the racketeers. When captured, the racketeers are all hauled before a three-man court martial headed by Beekman, promptly declared guilty, and executed en masse by a firing squad. Watching this story unfold, I kept thinking that Hammond or Beekman or Molloy or someone would have a moment of reckoning and say, gosh, maybe we have gone too far, but that never happens. After coercing the world is nations into disarmament by none too subtly threatening their leaders with aerial mass destruction, President Hammond collapses. As he lies on his deathbed, his face morphs into that of Abraham Lincoln. While strains of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” waft in the background, Molloy, played by real life Communist Karen Morley, declares, “He is proved himself one of the greatest men who ever lived.”William Randolph Hearst, the n a Franklin Roosevelt fan, financed the movie and helped shape its message. Louis B Mayer, a Republican, did not read the script prior to production and hated the end product. He released it nonetheless, and it did well at the box office. FDR, who took office soon after the movie was released, reportedly loved the film. Indeed, he seems to have modeled several of his programs on Hammond is. Before the events of the last few months reminded us of the left is reflexive fondness for fascism, the few critics reviewing the movie thought it a warning about Donald Trump. Of course they did. If self-awareness has never been a liberal strong suit, projection was, is, and always will be.

The racketeer fights back, and Beekman employs a legion of tanks Waco-style against the racketeers. When captured, the racketeers are all hauled before a three-man court martial headed by Beekman, promptly declared guilty, and executed en masse by a firing squad. Watching this story unfold, I kept thinking that Hammond or Beekman or Molloy or someone would have a moment of reckoning and say, gosh, maybe we have gone too far, but that never happens. After coercing the world is nations into disarmament by none too subtly threatening their leaders with aerial mass destruction, President Hammond collapses. As he lies on his deathbed, his face morphs into that of Abraham Lincoln. While strains of the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” waft in the background, Molloy, played by real life Communist Karen Morley, declares, “He is proved himself one of the greatest men who ever lived.”William Randolph Hearst, the n a Franklin Roosevelt fan, financed the movie and helped shape its message. Louis B Mayer, a Republican, did not read the script prior to production and hated the end product. He released it nonetheless, and it did well at the box office. FDR, who took office soon after the movie was released, reportedly loved the film. Indeed, he seems to have modeled several of his programs on Hammond is. Before the events of the last few months reminded us of the left is reflexive fondness for fascism, the few critics reviewing the movie thought it a warning about Donald Trump. Of course they did.

In a recent column in theLA Times, Jean Guerrero used a personal story involving her family to spotlight the shared distrust that is prevalent within some immigrant groups. Guerrero wrote how her father, an immigrant from Mexico, had been inundated with misinformation about COVID-19 from social media, and was believing it. He sent her a link to a now-removed YouTube video from a chiropractor who claimed the virus and the media coverage was designed to take away the rights of citizens. In one passage, her emotions over seeing her father being overtaken by the lies and conspiracy the ories being circulated were plain to see.“When I called Papi tourge him to wear a mask, his mind was made up: He said I was brainwashed. He did not believe my mother, who is a doctor, about COVID risks, either. I was frightened for his safety and angry at the people preying on Latinos’learneddistrust of authorities.”Anyone with relatives who have been trapped in the online rabbit holes that paint COVID as some warped conspiracy theory can certainly relate. And misinformation is not just restricted to minority populations. But history has plenty of examples that help illustrate where suspicion and distrust of authorities developed in communities of color. The Times’ column mentions sterilization efforts of a third of Puerto Rican women between the 1930s and 1970s, as well as thousands of latinos in California. The distrust is virtually ingrained in the DNA of some of those groups. Time may pass, but those painful memories endure. News & Guts have seen the impact of misinformation in Miami is Cuban community. The exiles who came to South Florida to escape Castro is regime have a distrust of government based on experience. They are often easy marks for rampant false reports that are spread on platforms like Facebook. In areas such as Homestead, some Hispanic churches have reportedly labeled the COVID vaccines as “the marks of the devil” and evidence of government control. The Miami Herald is recent report indicated that these churches and the anti-vaccine messaging has had a negative impact on the South Florida latino community is trust in the vaccination process. The latino population already is well behind others in vaccination rate, despite the fact that community has been particularly hard-hit by the virus. According to this report, Hispanics and latinos are nearly twice as likely to get COVID-19 as their white counterparts, four times as likely to get hospitalized by it, and nearly three times as likely as whites to die from COVID This is why latino activists have been pushing for greater educational and awareness programs aimed at fighting the misinformation in those communities they say is being spread on Facebook, YouTube, even through family group chats on WhatsApp.#COVID19has hit Latinos disproportionately hard, making vaccinations a crucial public health mission. But the re is wide mistrust & disinformation among Latinos on the vaccine. It is incumbent on health officials & docs to educate with cultural sensitivity. isa hasht ag campaign called #VacunateYathat fights the misinformation about the virus and the vaccines with facts.

In a new statement that he released in connection to Easter, he reiterated his false idea that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election. For this claim to be true, the n — considering the fact that the entire presidential transition process has long since played out — thousands and thousands of people would have to be in on the imaginary fantasy land scheme that Trump claims cost him his victory. Besides the fact that Trump sounds utterly unhinged, the fact that the GOP will not distance itself from his delusion is dangerous. Trump commented as follows:‘Why is it that every time the 2020 ELECTION FRAUD is discussed, the Fake News Media consistently states that such charges are baseless, unfounded, unwarranted, etc.? Sadly, there was massive fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election, and many very angry people understand that.

Here is his takeaway 👇🏻— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT)April 3, 2021No court anywhere in the country ever even partially accepted the idea that systematic fraud plagued the 2020 presidential election, and authorities at virtually every meaningful level of government have long since confirmed in various ways that no meaningful evidence of systematic election fraud has emerged. The depth of Trump is delusion seems difficult to overstate. Can he even explain the basics of how this imaginary fraud scheme took place? Who was in charge? Where are the records of any secret planning meetings? Where are the thousands and thousands of people whose cooperation would have been required for a nationwide election-rigging scheme?Meanwhile, no matter Republican complaints about the imaginary villain of “cancel culture,” Trump also called for a boycott of Major League Baseball following their decision to move the planned All-Star Game out of Georgia in protest of suppressive new voting restrictions that state Republican leaders recently enacted.

557,"With teen suicide on the rise, Tucson educators struggle to prioritize mental health",0.0,46.67,https://tucson.com/news/local/with-teen-suicide-on-the-rise-tucson-educators-struggle-to-prioritize-mental-health/article_7db1b000-c0aa-5066-931f-fed3443e0102.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/arizona-daily-star-bias-and-reliability/,,25,"Thousands of Tucson children are preparing to begin a new semester of school online only despite concerns about students’ mental health and educators’ ability to identify those in need of help via virtual platforms. Most Tucson-area school districts have opted to push pause on hybrid in-person learning, returning to remote instruction as COVID-19 continues its rapid spread in Pima County. The decision eliminates the limited face-to-face contact many students had become accustomed to in the fall. Referrals to mental health agencies that treat children and teens are up, sometimes prolonging the time it takes to receive services. Teachers struggle to balance academics and prepare kids for standardized testing in the spring while still prio rit izing their emotional needs. Some school counselors, stretched thin even before COVID, are being asked to cancel meetings and classes with students to substitute for staff who are out sick or in quarantine. The death of an eighth-grade student by suicide in November shocked the Vail School District.“This is the kid that would pop into his old teacher is classroom during passing period and just say hello and get a big hug,” says Vail spokeswoman Darcy Mentone. “This was a kid that the principal knew super well and adored. You know those kids — the happy, friendly kids. This was one of those kids.”Vail Unified had two students die from suicide this year. The other was a high school student who died in September. Pima County has seen a 67% increase in suicides this year among children ages 12 to 17, according to the Pima County Health Department. And across the state, 43 children had died by suicide by mid-November, compared to 38 for all of 2019, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. The eighth-grader in Vail, who had been a student in the district since kindergarten, had just begun attending in-person classes two days a week after doing remote learning since schools closed in March. His new teachers had only seen him a couple times. And because of COVID-19 precautions, he was not able to see his old teachers, who knew him well. His teachers are all asking the mselves: What if they had seen him? Would they have seen that something was wrong?“We have done a lot of speculation on that,” Mentone says. “When something like that happens, you look at everything that you are doing and the n question everything you are doing and ask yourself if the re is anything I could have done differently.”In a classroom, it is easy to read a kid is body language or physical appearance to see if something is wrong; On Zoom that is much more difficult, says Tucson Education Association President Margaret Chaney. And it is not just the lack of traditional schooling and corresponding social supports that is affecting children is well-being. The pandemic also has caused serious issues such as parents being laid off, pending evictions and homelessness, and relatives getting sick with coronavirus and even dying. Public school classrooms in Arizona also have one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the country, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. And the state is counselor-to-student ratio is the worst in the nation. School counselors have multiple responsibilities, including helping students with academics and now, in some cases, monitoring students using on-site learning spaces for vulnerable kids.“There are so many issues, and counselors in particular, their caseloads range between 250 to 500 or 800 kids a piece,” Chaney said. “How do you address all of their needs at any one time? It just seems impossible to me. This country has the means to address it; this country simply has not addressed it.”At the beginning of the school year, Chaney pushed for the Tucson Unified governing board to put the academic curriculum aside for the first five weeks so teachers could spend time checking on students’ emotional stability, looping in counselors and social workers as needed. Chaney says one of the reasons that did not happen is because preparing students for the upcoming AzMERIT and other state standardized tests has made prio rit izing social-emotional wellbeing over academics difficult. AzMERIT test scores have broad impacts, including the A-F School Accountability System, both state and federal funding and teachers’ performance-based compensation. In an informal teacher survey recently conducted by the Star, many of the 84 teachers who responded said state testing should be canceled so teachers can focus on students’ emotional health.“We are stuck with this crash-course trajectory of state testing and grades and so forth and no way to mitigate all of the other issues that are so clear to the average person that really need to be addressed … whether or not you eat, whether or not you are sleeping. Do you have a place to live? Are you about to be evicted?” Chaney said. In a normal year, when Andrea Rickard, a fourth-grade teacher at Myers Ganoung Elementary, prepares her students for the standardized tests, she encourages them to meet or exceed the district average. But this year, she is not even bringing up AzMERIT With kids learning from home, “no standardized test is standardized,” Rickard says. There are great disparities in students’ situations while learning from home, from kids who have no parental support and are caring for younger siblings to those who have two parents both available to help.“We are living through a time that is historically unsettling and dangerous, and to carry on business-as-usual with testing, it feels ludicrous to me,” Rickard says. She hopes standardized tests will be canceled, but regardless, she has already prioritized her students’ emotional well-being. She has kids go into breakout rooms on Zoom so they can just hang out together. She also lets them interact with each other by typing in the chat while she is teaching — the remote equivalent of passing notes in class.“Some of these kids never see anybody, and so I just feel like they need to socialize and interact with one another,” she says. Reading a book can be a great way to mark the end of the workday and help you unwind. Renee Quihuis, a third-grade teacher in the Sunnyside School District, is worried about her students falling behind academically but says, “If we only focus on curriculum, the n we have already lost them.” Her students are behind where they would be in a normal year, but making time for them to have fun has improved morale.“Connections are more important than the curriculum right now with everything that is going on,” she said. “The standardized tests might not look very pretty, but at least they are learning something. If I stopped the games, if I stopped that time when they get totalk to each other, I think they would be checked out completely.”Access to school counselors varies by school and by district. Since COVID-19, counselors are even more overloaded with students in need. And in TUSD, some are being called away from those duties, being asked to monitor vulnerable kids using in-person learning spaces when staff are out sick or have to quarantine,. When Nicole Walsh, an elementary school counselor in TUSD, was told she had to leave her regular duties to fill in for a monitor, she refused. Filling in would have meant canceling counseling lessons and individual sessions with students.“I just feel ethically I ca not do that,” she said. “If I start being inconsistent and not showing up, they are not going to show up either.”COVID-19 has doubled Walsh is job. With a caseload of about 500 kids, she often works from 8 a.m. until she crashes at midnight. She works weekends, and she expects to hear from families and students over the winter break. Walsh does weekly 30-minute classes on social-emotional skills for every grade level, as well as groups, individual sessions with students, and a lot of communication with teachers and parents. She saw depression really set in with some of her third- through fifth-grade students in the last month, since the district announced schools would stay closed indefinitely as COVID-19 spikes in the broader community.“They are not this resilient bunch of kids that this is going to have no impact on the m,” she said. “It is gonna have a big impact on several kids and a so-so impact on others. … This is like your parents getting divorced, if not worse. You have basically been divorced from your friends for a year.”Walsh has referred many students to mental-health agencies, but said due to increased need, there is a longer wait for services. La Frontera, one of the region is major providers of mental health services, has seen an exponential increase in the need for therapy services, and the requests for in-person therapy is sky high, says Adrienne Trees, director of children is integrated care and therapy services. Trees says the agency is hiring more mental health professionals to accommodate the influx. Mental health service provider Intermountain Centers has seen a 25% increase in referrals of children and teens since COVID-19, says spokesman Paul O’Rourke. Ann Conway, a TUSD high school counselor with a caseload of about 450 students, is seeing a huge increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in the students she works with.“We have also heard a lot from parents that they are trying to get their kid into a counseling therapy, but the re is nobody accepting new patients or the waiting lists of different places are several months out.”Conway is trying to help kids and parents access limited community resources while also giving them tips and techniques to manage their emotional and academic needs. If kids are suicidal or in immediate crisis, she refers them to the Crisis Response Center or Palo Verde Behavioral Health is Intensive Outpatient Program. Conway estimates she is making double or triple the amount of these referrals as before COVID-19. School districts are doing what they can to reinforce mental health services for students and make them more robust. Apart from the regular counseling services, Sunnyside is giving classes on social-emotional skills and providing students with coping strategies. The district is also in the third year of a three-year grant facilitating support groups, where all the high school students were invited, and those who were interested could join. The district also offered suicide prevention training to all high school freshman and reached about 275 students. In TUSD, apart from the work the counselors are doing with students and referrals to community resources, schools offer a food pantry, clothing bank, hygiene pantry, online support groups, and online classes/workshops for parents, says spokeswoman Leslie Lenhart. Marana Unified has a certified school counselor at every campus and a crisis response team. In response to COVID-19, the district sent a “family needs assessment” to all families at the beginning of the pandemic. It asked about children is mental, social and emotional health, as well as any other needs the family had. The district followed up with those who needed assistance. Through a pilot program in Vail schools, Empire High students answered a questionnaire, developed in conjunction with university researchers, meant to gauge emotional well-being and available support systems. From the data collected on that survey, Empire staff did three suicide interventions, says Vail spokeswoman Mentone. While schools are essentially closed, staff will also be calling and checking in on students. Vail is also referring students to counseling services with faith leaders and giving families a list of local places where they can easily access mental health services. If you or a loved one needs help, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) — help is available in English or Spanish.

558,The Illinois Legislature Just Voted to End Cash Bail. Here is How Organizers Made It Happen.,-18.0,45.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/money-bond-pretrial-fairness-freedom-incarceration-jail-illinois,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-01-13,25,"Illinois is poised to eliminate the use of cash bail in the state is carceral system following the passage of the Pretrial Fairness Act by the state legislature on January13. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker,who has said he favors ending cash bail, is expected to sign the bill into law. The policy of conditional pretrial detention — holding accused people in jail until their trial, unless they can afford to pay bail — is currently practiced in all50states, although New Jersey did drastically reduce the use of cash bail. It is a practice that necessarily penalizes poor people and disproportionately affects Black and Brown people, already overrepresented in US jails and prisons. The Pretrial Fairness Act was included in a criminal justice reform bill put forward by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus. It is the culmination of a longstanding organizing drive by the Coalition to End Money Bond, the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice, and other community organizations. According to a statement from the Coalition to End Money Bond,​“Among other things, this bill will overhaul the state is pretrial justice system and end the use of money bond in its entirety. It also makes many people ineligible for pretrial incarceration.”This legislation is poised to have a huge impact: According to the Coalition for Money Bond, each year, more than a quarter of a million people are incarcerated in Illinois county jails — and9out of10are incarcerated while they are still awaiting trial (that is, locked up before they have been convicted of anything). If the bill is signed into law, it will be the first in the country to entirely end the use of money bond.spoke with Malik Alim, campaign coordinator of the Coalition to End Money Bond, about the likely passage of the Illinois law and its implications for the broader movement to end the use of cash bail. Pending Governor Pritzker is signature, we will become the first state to completely end the use of cash bond, which means that no one would be held in jail because they ca not afford to pay a certain amount of money. That means that the standard for detaining someone is going to be higher. But that also means that judges will have more discretion in determining if a person will be held or not, much more discretion than just what amount of money they post to get out. Cash bail systems create a coercive process for the pretrial system. When people are held in jail because they ca not afford to pay the money bond, they are more likely to take a plea deal and say that they did something that they may not have done so that they can get back home to their children and go back to work. So if you dangle someone is freedom over their head based on what they will cop to, obviously you are going to have a lot more cases plea out. And what we saw from the Illinois State is Attorneys Association was exactly that: The State is Attorneys Association wants to protect their conviction rate, because in popular culture, the role of a prosecutor is to enforce the law and order. And so they want to have a high conviction rate and a high clearance rate. And plea deals are a big way that they accomplish that. So when we take away that coercion, people are able to make more clear-headed decisions about how they want to proceed in their case. Absolutely. And I give a lot of credit to the Legislative Black Caucus. I appeared with them in a press conference in September, where they unveiled their four-tiered approach to stemming systemic injustice. They stood strong. We were really proud to see that they stood behind the language in the bill, and that they trusted the advocates and the directly impacted community that developed this bill. I do not think the re is another campaign in another state that is moving along like this one. But I will say, I think that this win says a lot about the larger political landscape, in terms of progressive politics and making sure that Joe Biden is held accountable to the left progressive movement. This kind of sweeping, comprehensive reform came at the first opportunity that Illinois could pass it since this summer. I think that this is a signal to the progressive left and to the moderate left that Biden is kind of moderate agenda on most issues that the left cares about is not going to be sufficient. We push him along from the grassroots. What we have heard from our seasoned legislative colleagues who have been in Springfield doing these types of negotiations for years is that they have never seen the type of energy, will, dedication and power in a campaign like they see in this. That needs to be replicated in other places, and the Coalition to End Money Bond has done an amazing job at capturing each step of the process that we have gone through — and our campaign is clearly replicable. We are open to anyone who wants to share best practices. Because it is not optional — other states must follow suit, now. I would say the tactic of multiple tactics. The fact that we started by challenging the judiciary through a lawsuit that we filed that was challenging the constitutionality of the money bail system. In that realm, we opened up the possibility for the creation of the Supreme Court Commission on Pretrial Practices, which ultimately recommended major legislative changes. We also were organizing at the county level. We got General Order18.8A, which limited cash bail, passed in Cook County in2017by pressuring the chief judge. So, the legislature, the judiciary and bully pulpit, so to speak — the voice of the people and the power of the people — are the three approaches that we to ok. We are focused on implementation now. A lot of smaller county governments around the state raise the issue of how they will operate without the money that they count on from cash bail, and from the fees and fines that get taken when someone does not see their case through. Obviously, we should have better governance, and people should not be basing their budgets on the backs of poor Black and Brown people. But it is an issue that we have to deal with, because they have been doing it. We need to make sure that those counties are being consulted with and are being given direction on how to make that money up. We are also focusing on the issue of accountability for judges, because there are plenty of statutes and processes and procedures that are on the books right now that judges do not follow. So it is on us to advocate as the directly impacted community, to make sure that these judges are actually following the new statute — that they make sure that a person is in fact a clear threat to a person or persons, and that they are not creating a nebulous wider net, in direct conflict with the law that we just passed. So we are looking at implementation, and we think that the two year phase-in period is necessary. We do not want to cause more incarceration. And we want to make sure everyone is ready to implement this. I think when folks start getting into the weeds and the nitty gritty of the language in our bill, our bill is language is very progressive. It really does restore some semblance of the presumption of innocence and of the prosecution is mandate to actually show that a person should be locked away in a cage. That should be a very high standard of evidence, and that is what we are making it. And so when other states begin to draft their own legislation and look at what is on their own statutes and things like that, we would strongly urge them to to look at the intentionality behind the language that we use, and to try to model it after ours, in order to make sure that we do not increase pretrial incarceration in other in other parts of the country. And with our language, that will not happen. I hope you found this article important.

560,Pro-Abortion Candidate Beto O’Rourke Fantasized About Running Over Children With a Car,25.5,27.25,https://www.lifenews.com/2019/03/19/pro-abortion-2020-candidate-beto-orourke-fantasized-about-running-over-children-with-a-car/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,22,"It is one of the strangest admissions a candidate for president has ever made. But, over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke apologized for for writings he made as a teenager describing fantasies about running over children with a vehicle. Here is more:“I am mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words,” the Democratic presidential candidate said during a taping of the “Political Party Live” pod cast in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “Whatever my intention was as a teenager does not matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language I have used, and I have to constantly try to do better.”His comments come after a report Friday revealed O’Rourkewrote prose when he was a teenager describing a scenario in which he would accelerate a car into a group of children while hearing them scream. The report also showed he was a secret member of a hacking group called the “Cult of the Dead Cow,” which focused on showing people how to hack Microsoft computers.“It is not anything I am proud of to day, and I mean, that is — that is the long and short of it,” he said. “All I can do is my best, which is what I am trying to do. I ca not control anything I have done in the past. I can only control what I do going forward and what I plan to do is give this my best.”“One day, as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street. They were happy, happy to be free from their troubles…. This happiness was mine by right. I had earned it in my dreams,” O’Rourke wrote.“As I neared the young ones, I put all my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of the two children on the hood, and the n the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. I was so fascinated for a moment, that when after I had stopped my vehicle, I just sat in a daze, sweet visions filling my head,” O’Rourke continued. The news is perhaps not surprising given that O’Rourke supports abortions up to birth. That is a position he defended yesterday, as video ed during a campaign stop. O’Rourke was captured on camera at a campaign event in Clevelandresponding to a question about third-trimester abortions and whether or not he supports abortions up to birth.“That should be a decision that the woman makes. I trust her,” O’Rourke says. Not only does O’Rourke have a 100-percent pro-abortion voting record like the other Democrat presidential candidates, he also sponsored a radical pro-abortion bill that would have legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth. The so-called “Women is Health Protection Act” was introduced in Congress in 2017, with dozens of Democrat sponsors, including likely presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders. Nicknamed the “Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act”by pro-life groups, the bill would have invalidated nearly all state and federal abortion regulations, including waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on late-term abortions and sex-selection abortions and more. The congressman has also failed to speak out againstNancy Pelosi and House Democrats blocking a request by Republicans to vote on a similar bill to require medical care and treatment for babies who survive abortions. That puts him on record supporting their decision to allow infanticide to continue unprosecuted. Here is his lengthy record supporting abortion,courtesy of Texas Right to Life.",0,0,Life News
561,"Welcome to the Claremont Institute, where pro-Trumpers are waging a war on corporate America over 'wokeness'",0.0,42.0,https://www.businessinsider.com/conservatives-capitalists-divorce-trump-woke-capital-going-to-get-ugly-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-19,17,"On May 18, a pro-Trump think tank called the Claremont Institute hosted a conference at a Ritz Carlton not far from the Pentagon. It featured talks by a small but influential faction of American conservatives including former Trump national-security advisor Michael Anton, Representative Jim Banks of Indiana, and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author and US Senate hopeful JD Vance. The event was billed as a response to a growing threat facing the American right, the latest and most urgent battle in the culture wars. It was titled simply ""What to Do About Woke Capital.""For several years now, the conservative movement has been fretting about its fraying alliance with corporate America, which has increasingly sided with progressive causes. In 2015 and 2016, boycotts by American Airlines, Eli Lilly, and Intelhelpedblock anti-LGBT ""religious-freedom laws"" in Indiana, Arkansas, and Arizona. In 2017, pressure from PayPal, Deutsche Bank, and the NBAledNorth Carolina to repeal its anti-trans bathroom bill. In 2019, Disney, Netflix, and Warner Media moved business out of Georgia after the state enacted severe limits on abortion access. Last summer, dozens of major brands signaled support for Black Lives Matter. And in April, corporations from Coca-Cola to Major League Baseball denounced Georgia over its attempt to restrict voting and to hand control of the state is elections to pro-Trump forces. There is, of course, a simple explanation for these decisions: Corporations are seeking to align their public image with the values of their customers, shareholders, and employees. The positions considered ""woke"" by conservative ideologues — that police should kill fewer Black people, that abortion should be legal, that gay and trans people should not be subject to discrimination, that voting should be easier for everyone — are increasingly considered sensible by a majority of Americans.""Corporationsawakened — to their duties,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management who has convened a series of high-profile Zoom calls with top CEOs to strategize political interventions. ""And it is a good thing. Using the term 'woke' disparagingly is odd to me. It is hard to understand how the opposite — being asleep on the job — is preferable.""But for conservatives the shift in corporate loyalties represents a deep betrayal. For the past half century, big business has been a reliable ally and major funder of the right. Corporations did not stay out of politics — they actively sided with conservative Christians to promote an ""awakening"" in American politics, defending traditional notions of family, church, and neighborhood against the threat of communism, civil rights, and labor unions. To ensure the survival of ""our American way of life and our enterprise system,"" beer magnate and conservative me ga donor Joseph Coors said in 1975, ""the whole business community is going to have to get involved in political activities.""Now, the conservative political class is reacting to so-called woke capital with the anguish of a lover scorned. Senator Tom Cotton has denounced giant corporations using their ""wealth and power to force liberal dogma on an unwilling people."" Senator Josh Hawley bemoans an ""alliance of leftists and woke capitalists"" hoping to ""regulate the innermost thoughts of every American, from school age to retirement."" And Senator Ted Cruz ostentatiously swore off corporate PAC money in a Wall Street Journalmissiveentitled ""Your Woke Money Is No Good Here.""At the Woke Capital conference in May, the Claremont set went even further. The organization, which has a strong relationship with the Christian right, has positioned itself as the vanguard of a conservative realignment — shifting from market fundamentalism and toward a more militant right-wing nationalism. To Claremont thinkers, who have long worked to provide the intellectual scaffolding for Trump is haphazard agenda, the enemy is not only the left, but the inherent decadence of America is corporate elites.""In just three generations,"" said Arthur Milikh, executive director of Claremont is new Center for the American Way of Life, ""America is most powerful corporations went from being more or less patriotic"" to being ""globalist"" enablers of a ""woke oligarchic state.""As Milikh sees it, the right gave American corporations everything they wanted — tax breaks, free trade, open immigration — naively believing that capitalists would defend conservative values. But instead, helamented, ""much of the conservative establishment came to view the pinnacle of human life as private consumption and personal license, defining national health by GDP growth."" The result has been not only ""spiritual enervation"" and ""the weakening of patriotic sentiment"" but ""the creation of a new oligarchic elite openly hostile to the nation.""This new the me of the Trumpist right — that American corporations are, in essence, no longer American — represents a profound fissure in the conservative movement. The campaign against woke capital is driving a wedge between social conservatives and big business, fracturing the long-standing coalition that helped drive American politics to the right. As Tucker Carlson summed it up in the title of his keynote address at a 2019 conference on conservative nationalism, ""Big Business Does not Care About Your Family."" What distinguishes these new populists from the old guard of mainstream conservatism is their explicit aspiration to replace the current elite with a new one — a strategy intended to extend the MAGA right is vision of minority rule long into the future. From the outside, the long, enduring marriage of Christian traditionalism and capitalist free enterprise looked remarkably stable and mutually beneficial. From inside the conservative movement, though, it was always more a marriage of convenience than of philosophical affinity. On one side of the alliance were traditionalists — communitarian Christians, agrarian nostalgics, neo-confederates — who sought a theologically informed moral order. They were ambivalent about capitalism, which views liberal individualism as the building block of political and social life. On the other side of the alliance were libertarians and free-market evangelists, who saw the state as the primary threat to human freedom. What brought the two sides together, and gave birth to the modern conservative movement, was Communism. During the Cold War, William F Buckley is National Review broker ed an uneasy peace between these competing tendencies. American liberals, the Review set reasoned, would never be sufficiently committed to Christian virtue or to free enterprise to resist the onslaught of Communism. The answer was ""fusionism,"" a political coalition of Christians and capitalists whose shared goal — defending Western civilization from its enemies within and without — was sufficient to solidify an alliance. But for those at the Claremont conference, who see the mselves as the inheritors of the traditionalist position, fusionism turned out to be aFaustian bargain. Wealthy elites got their way, basking in unrivaled wealth and personal liberty, while traditionalists got the short end of the stick: a disenchanted, amoral society where abortion is legal, conspicuous consumption has replaced spiritual fulfillment, and individual self-expression trumps virtue.""Everyone on the right has basically been fed this Adam Smith fairy tale about economic and political history, in which all the good things should go together,"" Julius Krein, the editor of the right-wing journal American Affairs, told me. ""That is fusionism: free markets plus moral virtue. It is all a nice, big, happy combination."" Seeing big business ""at least rhetorically"" embrace progressive causes has been, Krein added, ""a huge threat to that whole fairy tale. Even if it does not provoke resistance per se, it provokes a lot of consternation and panic because you have your origin myth directly threatened.""In a sense, the right is hand-wringing over corporate progressivism is just sour grapes — the whining of a political movement hoisted by its own petard. After all, it was the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that maximized the power of corporate leaders to impose their values on the public. First, in Citizens United they allowed corporate money to dominate the electoral process. Then in Hobby Lobby they empowered private companies to engage in religious activism, observing that nothing in the law requires ""for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else""But in a perverse twist, conservatives ca not quite bring the mselves to blame big business itself for the outbreak of wokeness. They have preached for so long that God favors capital, they have to find another explanation for why some of the world is richest and most powerful corporations are abandoning them. So those at the Claremont conference blamed not the owners, but the managers they believe have usurped control of American capitalism. This critique of managerial ism draws on the the ories of James Burnham, a founding editor of the National Review, who has enjoyed a renaissance in right-wing circles in recent years. His 1941 book ""Managerial Revolution"" argued that the corporate economy had become so complex that owners were forced to enlist technocratic managers to run their companies. Over time, Burnham thought, this new managerial elite would assume control of capital, reduce the owning class to mere shareholders, and proceed to ""exploit the rest of society.""For those at the Claremont event, Burnham is concept of a middle strata between capital and labor serves as a way to exonerate wealthy owners, placing the blame for woke capital on a younger, inferior generation of mid-level bureaucrats. ""What we have seen over the past several decades is the creation of this new bureaucratic and administrative layer within the corporate world, which is far less talented and far less productive,"" Daniel McCarthy, editor of right-wing journal Modern Age, told attendees. ""Woke young people coming to corporate America end up specializing in a kind of moral extortion over the people who are actually more talented and experienced than they are.""For conservatives, the term ""woke"" — which originated among Black activists and artists back in Burnham is day — remains closely associated with ""identity politics."" In his opening remarks at the conference, Milikh defined the term as ""the doctrine that so-called oppressors, identified by the color of their skin, must be humiliated, punished, and made to perpetually apologize for the sins of their fathers."" Such fantasies of racial vengeance, unmoored from the actual goals of to day is social movements, pervaded nearly every speech at the Claremont event. What the woke want, said Azerrad, who teaches at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school, ""is to redistribute power and honor to their preferred victim groups — you know the list — and to punish the oppressors: straight white men."" In a revealing aside, Azerrad recommended ""a very amusing but also quite insightful"" Twitter account called @WokeCapital, which documents examples of ""corporate woke propaganda."" The account is also explicitly racist, referring to the NBA as ""Apehoop League, "" and captioning a picture of a mixed-race military couple with the words ""Swirler Occupied Government.""Presenters were particularly incensed by corporate brands that signaled support for the George Floyd protests last June. ""No moment illustrated what woke capital meant for our country than the riots last summer tied to the Black Lives Matter movement,"" JD Vance declared in his keynote address. Wearing a beard and evidently work shopping a bellicose stump speech for his Senate campaign, Vance accused Amazon is Jeff Bezos of deliberately funding riots to undermine his competitors. ""Who benefits most when small business on Main Street are destroyed?"" he asked. Bezos, Vance said, is ""getting rich from destroying America.""The racist undercurrents of the Claremont conference are not incidental — they are central to the emerging conservative realignment. Burnham, who was repeatedly cited at the event, believed that ""Western civilization, thus Western man, is both different from and superior in quality to other civilizations and non-civilizations.""The way to protect Western culture, Burnham argued, is not a democratic assault on the decadent oligarchy. Rather, the liberal managerial elite must be replaced with a new conservative elite, one that appreciates the threat posed by immigration and racial egalitarianism. Samuel Francis, a leading disciple of Burnham and a prescient the orist of Trumpism, argued in 1992 that ""Middle American radicals"" must ""displace the incumbent elite, dismantle its apparatus of power, and itself constitute a new elite and re-constitute American society."" Only by doing so, he argued, could Middle America ""preserve itself from destruction and extend its present moment in the political sun into an enduring epoch of civilization.""Francis, not coincidentally, was a virulent racist, hailed by white supremacists as the ""premier philosopher of white racial consciousness of our time."" In 2000, after the Chamber of Commerce supported calls to take down the Confederate flag at the South Carolina capitol, Francis argued that big business was no friend of the right. ""Capitalism, an economic system driven only, according to its own theory, by the accumulation of profit, is at least as much an enemy of tradition as the NAACP or communism,"" he said. At base, to day is right populist war on so-called woke capital is a battle for power — by displaced elites — to shape the national consensus and define its most cherished symbols. Nowhere is this clearer than in American Moment, another pro-Trump outgrowth of the Claremont Institute. Founded by a trio of 20-something conservatives — Saurabh Sharma, Nick Solheim, Jake Mercier — the organization describes itself as ""dedicated to identifying, educating, and credential ing young Americans who will implement public policy that supports strong families, a sovereign nation, and prosperity for all.""Translation: The group plans to recruit a new generation pro-Trump conservatives to replace the existing political and economic elite with … well, the mselves. ""If we do not form our own elite,"" the founders write, ""one that is patriotic and acts as a champion for the great middle of our nation, the old regime will continue to win, and America will continue to lose.""Trump failed, Sharma told me, in no small part because there were not enough ""true believers"" across the federal bureaucracy to implement his nationalist agenda. Sharma wants to change that. ""We built up American Moment to create a pipeline of staff, essentially, that will go into congressional offices, future presidential administrations, public-policy organizations,"" he said. ""People that think like this, that are willing to devote serious parts of their lives to doing this sort of work.""Where previous generations of conservatives dreamed of dismantling the entire administrative state, Sharma sees seizing and deploying political power as a necessity for making America great again. ""People on the right are broadly shut out of culture,"" he said. ""And more and more so shut out of capital. So if we are quickly approaching an America where the only thing the right can do is occasionally win elections, we better use whatever tools we have at hand to rebalance power in the other domains, and defend the interests of our voters."" To do otherwise, he suggested in the coded language long employed by far-right elites, would be to engage in ""civilizational malfeasance.""As for woke corporations, Sharma envisions a future Trump administration, staffed by ideologues ""credentialized"" by American Moment, that is willing to use a variety of carrots and sticks — from tax hikes to antitrust enforcement — to discipline corporate leaders who engage in virtue signaling. ""I think the re is a lot of interesting stuff to be done the re,"" Sharma said. ""But it would require the complete takeover of the bureaucracies that implement this sort of policy.""As an example, Sharma pointed to the decision last year by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to op en a ""formal investigation"" into Princeton University, after the school said that ""racism and the damage it does to people of color nevertheless persist at Princeton."" Sharma imagines using anti discrimination laws to ""call the bluff"" of businesses that admit to histories of racism. ""Let is use the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a hammer to bash every corporation that decides to virtue signal about this stuff, and see if they really mean it,"" he said. Sharma is vision of a far-right administration using the levers of government to punish corporate elites has not exactly taken over Washington yet. But throughout history, many a conservative revolution has begun with tiny groups of disgruntled ideologues gathered in hotel conference rooms. Just as the eggheads of Buckley is era helped lay the groundwork for the Reagan revolution, to day is Claremont brain trust is working to set the stage for a regime that is far more nativist and nationalistic. Their plan, like so many Republican efforts these days, has little concern for democracy as such. They understand that if right-wing populism is to credibly embody the will of the people, a lot of people must be written out of the social contract.""Re-establishing America is ancient principles"" would require ""a sort of counter-revolution,"" Glenn Ellmers, a senior fellow at Claremont, said in a recentessay. Seizing power, he goes on to explain, is ""the only road forward."" It is fine for conservatives to ignore or even sabotage the outcome of elections, he implies, becauseTrump voters are ""authentic Americans.""And what of the majority who elected Joe Biden? What will become of them in the new, anti-woke America governed by a conservative elite?""It is not obvious what we should call these citizen-aliens, these non-American Americans,"" Ellmers concludes. ""But they are something else.""Related storiesMore from Politics",1,1,Insider
562,Why Cryptocurrency Is A Giant Fraud <U+2767> Current Affairs,-5.33,34.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/04/why-cryptocurrency-is-a-giant-fraud,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"A company called Coinbase has gone public, and Wall Street seems excited. Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange—it allows you to buy, store, and trade cryptocurrencies, which are invented kinds of alternative moneys. The most well-known of these are Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are4,000different kinds of these invented new forms of money. (If you’d like to start your own currency,you can.)Coinbase is debut on the stock market has been called “the crypto event of the year,” “the coming-out party for crypto,” and it went well.reportsthat “the groundswell of investor interest is hugely validating for both the crypto economy and the companies that have cropped up to support it.”Voxsaysthat “you should probably start paying attention to bitcoin” because the success of Coinbase shows that it has gone “from nerdy curiosity to mainstream investing opportunity and payment method.” “Once mocked as a tool for criminals and reckless speculators,” reports the New York Times, cryptocurrency “is sliding into the mainstream.”If it is mainstream now and we should pay attention to it, it is a good idea if we try to understand what it is and what its economic implications are. You may have ignored Bitcoin because the evangelists for it are some of the most insufferable people on the planet—and you may also have kicked yourself because if you had listened to the first guy you met who told you about Bitcoin way back, you’d be a millionaire today. But now it is time to understand: is this, as its proponents say,the future of money?Many discussions of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency—I am going to use “Bitcoin” and “cryptocurrency” interchangeably for convenience, even though Bitcoin is just a specific cryptocurrency—begin with a long explanation of the blockchaintechnology that makes it possible. I think for the purposes of talking about what Bitcoin means and does, this is a mistake and a distraction—like having a discussion about the social effects of air travel by talking about how ailerons work. What matters for the purposes of our discussion is that it is a made-up alternate system of money that, because it is built on block chain technology, can be transferred from one person to another without having to go through a bank or a payment processor. Because you do not have to use a bank, and can easily transfer bit coin from person to person, it is also “private,” in the sense that you do not have to give anyone your credit card information or even your name to transfer funds. This makes it particularly attractive to criminals, because it is sort of like the digital equivalent of cash: easy to hide, tough to trace. And because it is not tied to a national government, Bitcoin can be used around the world without having to convert currency. There are many who see this as revolutionary and important. “The popularity of this form of currency is expected to grow exponentially, as it is decentralized, safe, and anonymous,” read sone analysis. “The fact that a huge section of technology-savvy individuals and companies are favoring the decision of using different form of encrypted currencies clearly indicates that the future of Bitcoin or crypto currencies as a whole is going to be bright.” Across the internet, you can find blog posts and explainers that tout the benefits and possibilities of this new form of currency. Some people in positions of power agree: “This is the revolution,” said Representative David Schweikert, a Republican member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. “We just have to sell it.”I have been among those who have ignored cryptocurrency for a long time, but has told me I am no longer allowed to, so I have read up on it. And I have to say, Schweikert is partly right: “selling it as a revolution” is a hugely important part of why cryptocurrency is succeeding. But as is generally the case when someone is trying to sell you something, the whole thing should seem extremely fishy. In fact, much of the cryptocurrency pitch is worse than fishy. It is downright fraudulent, promising people benefits that they will not get and trying to trick them into believing in and spreading something that will not do them any good. When you examine the actual arguments made for using crypto currencies as currency, rather than just being wowed by the complex underlying system and words like “autonomy,” “global,” and “seamless,” the case for their use by most people collapses utterly. Many believe in it because they have swallowed libertarian dogmas that do not reflect how the world actually works. Let is start with the basic promise, that of being “decentralized, safe, and anonymous.” People like the word decentralized. I like it a lot myself. Nobody likes. You know who liked things centralized? Stalin. But what does the word actually mean? In this instance, it means that financial transactions are peer to peer, rather than going through your bank or a processor like PayPal, and that there is no central bank altering the money supply, as there is with the US dollar. Many of the pitches for Bitcoin begin by emphasizing itsdecentralizednature. There are recurring the mes and bits of rhetoric in the pro-crypto propaganda. (A term whose use is more than justified.) It is about freedom. It is about getting the government off your back. It is about getting middlemen and third parties out of your transactions. It is about control, autonomy, empowerment. But if we get past the rhetoric and think about the implications for the average person, it is not clear that we are actually meaningfully improving “freedom” in any but the most abstract, theoretical way. For the average currency user, why is it so important to get rid of banks and the government and these suspicious-sounding “third parties?” Yes, we all hate bankers, but is the tyranny of Venmo so oppressive that we shouldYes, it is true that if you bank with a credit union, you can think of it as “surrendering control of your assets to a credit union.” The crypto-enthusiasts raise the specter of violating the Terms of Service and having your account suspended. I do not know about you, but this has not happened to me, ever. I have gone overdrawn and had to pay stupid fees (fees they hilariously euphemize as “overdraft protection”). I have had my debit card stop working because the bank thought a purchase was fraudulent and it was not. But the main problems that people have with their banks and credit unions don ot have to do with the bare fact that an institution is holding their money. In fact, when we examine whether Bitcoin can function usefully as an alternative currency for the average person, we see that all of the grand claims for it fail entirely. Using it does not create greater security or safety for one is finances. It does not free one from the oversight of the government. It is not convenient or free. Its volatility makes it functionally useless as a currency. Furthermore, these drawbacks are not fixable; they are products of the very concept itself. There is a reason that you are not using Bitcoin for transactions, even though it has been around since 2008. It is that while Bitcoin is based on an interesting technological innovation (blockchain), it i sa good idea for an alternate money system, due to its dependence on several libertarian illusions. A lot of the pitches for cryptocurrency suggest that having your money in a bank makes it less secure, because a Third Party is being entrusted with it. So much of the propaganda is about “security” and how payments made with Bitcoin are more Secure than those made with PayPal, because you do not have to provide identifying information and the transactions do not involve “third parties.” One site lists on the “ways cryptocurrency will help you” the prevention of fraud, because “individual crypto currencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender, as with credit card charge-backs.” From the:This really does essentially amount to lying. It depends on a confusing definition of “security” that misleads people into thinking they are somehow less likely to be scam med if they transact in cryptocurrency. In fact, because there are no trusted third-party institutions, if someone tricks you into a fraudulent transaction, the re is nothing you can do about it. Credit card payments, as noted above, can be stopped and reversed. But Bitcoin payments ca not. Once the money is gone, it is gone. This is touted as a feature because it helpsmerchants: if a customer gives the merchant money, the customer ca not take it back if they do not like the merchant is product. But most of us are not merchants. We are consumers. The fact that transactions are “irreversible” may reduce the fraud risk for the merchants, but it has a flipside, which is increasing fraud risk for the customer. It is not rational for consumers to surrender their right to stop a charge, and it is not accurate to describe this as “fraud reduction.” In fact, it is just shifting who suffers the consequences for fraud. In fact, it turns out that there are a few advantages to having those “third party intermediaries” from whose tyranny cryptocurrency promises to help us escape. I grumble when my bank stops a payment on my credit card thinking it is fraudulent, but I like that my bank has fraud protection. (Thanks,federal law, for putting a set of rules in place saying when banks are liable for fraud, thus incentivizing them to catch fraudsters.) Bitcoin is decentralization means nobody is looking out for you.. Getting rid of a third-party institution that offers fraud protection is not making your payments “more secure,” it is making the mlesssecure. The use of “security” here means narrowly “it is guaranteed that the person who is supposed to receive the money will in fact receive it.” But from the consumer is perspective, the “security” of transactions is holistic, meaning that it does not matter whether one aspect of the transaction is secure if there are many other aspects that are highly insecure. Often, if you look closely, there are serious qualifications and caveats about the “security” benefits—Bitcoin “can represent a safer alternative to fiat trading if the right conditions are met (namely implementing an effective block chain analytics practice to remain safe from errant typologies that exist on the blockchain)[emphasis added.]” How likely are ordinary people to even learn what these words mean, let alone know whether they are implementing them effectively?Indeed, those without technical know-how are easy to steal from in the world of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin.org warns of scams including: “Blackmail, Fake Exchanges, Free Giveaways,Impersonation,Malware,Meet in Person,Money Transfer Fraud,Phishing Emails,Phishing Websites,Ponzi Schemes,Pyramid Schemes,Prize Giveaways,Pump and Dumps,Ransomware, andScam Coins.” The same web sites that tout the unbelievable security benefits of using Bitcoin, the way it can stop identity the ft, the n warn of Bitcoin identity theft. The “anonymity” of Bitcoin transactions may help you. But it may also help a scam mer take advantage of you. For most everyday use, you do notanonymous transactions. You want there to be a record of what you paid and who you paid it to, so that they have a legal obligation to give you what you paid for, and it can beshow nt hat they received the money. This is not to say that anonymous transactions offer nobody any benefits ever. The most obvious class of people who might need it are those operating outside the law. This includes drug cartels and white collar criminals, but it also includes criminal i zed industries like sex work. Marxist domina trix Mistress Magpietoldthethat while “the majority of her clients are not well versed in digital currencies,” cryptocurrency could offer a way to operate “furtively under capitalism, in a way that might not be needed in a more open socialist society.” This is an argument for having an anonym i zed digital currency of some sort in the here and now, but it should be noted that it means we should be building a world in which cryptocurrency is obsolete, because people are not prosecuted for victimless crimes. But does cryptocurrency actually offer these benefits anyway? In fact, anyone who starts using Bitcoins and thinks they are making untraceable transactions is wrong. The very idea that Bitcoin is “anonymous” is highly misleading.comments that “there is no surefire way to maintain one is anonymity when using Bitcoin.” TheWall Street Journal,discussinghow Bitcoin scammers operate,says that while it is a “cat and mouse game” between law enforcement and the scammers, more sophisticated tracking tools are being developed all the time, and the one thing we do know is that the scam med will likely never see their Bitcoin again. In fact, the idea that cryptocurrency is even particularly useful for crimes may be false. The RAND corporation notes that despite the “perceived attractiveness of crypto currencies for money laundering purposes . . . an estimated 99 per cent of cryptocurrency transactions are performed through centralised exchanges, which can be subject to AML/CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism] regulation similar to traditional banks or exchanges.” So nearly all transactions are facilitated by third parties, namely companies that act as “exchanges,” serving as an intermediary that facilitates transactions. These companies are subject to subpoenas just like any other. In fact, if you go on Coinbase—the exchange that is mainstreaming the use of cryptocurrency by making it easy to use—the very first thing you are asked is to verify your identity, giving your name, phone number, the last four digits of your social security number, etc. Unless you are a highly sophisticated actor, you are not going to be keeping the government from being able to figure out if you made a particular payment to a particular person, because your use of cryptocurrency will be through a legitimate company that complies with US financial regulations. If you are a savvy enough individual to avoid the exchanges, you may not experience this. But it is a vanishingly small number of people who need so much more privacy than that which can be offered by any bank,are doing legitimate (if unlawful) things such as trying to subvert US sanctions,andcannot operate in the even safer medium of cash,andare sophisticated enough to figure out how to avoid all the obvious pitfalls by which they can be caught and prosecuted. If you are an ordinary consumer, the privacy difference is going to have almost no practical effect, and sot here is no reason for you to use a cryptocurrency rather than just a currency. Bitcoin is advantages are far more likely to help the sophisticated person trying to steal your money than they are to help you keep your money safer than it would be in Chase Bank. Thecites “easy transactions” as a key draw for cryptocurrency. Perhaps, though not really easier than existing payment processors that do not require you to convert your money into an arcane new currency and back again to use it. But importantly, cryptocurrency also offers new and scary ways that you can actually lose all of your money, which should certainly factor into an assessment of how convenient it is. AWall Street Journalanalysisin 2018 found that 20 percent of all Bitcoin tokens were lost and probably unrecoverable, because if you lose your PIN for your Bitcoin wallet, you can never access it again. “Unlike an ATM PIN, this password ca not be recovered easily, since there is no bank to retrieve it,” says theJournal. Investopediasays that “the reason for this has to do with the structure of crypto currencies and the emphasis they place on privacy and security.” One guy who had $220 million in Bitcoin, because he bought early and the value exploded, had no way to access it because he had lost his PIN Once again, we see the word “security” being used in a strange way. Security, for most of us, means the reduction of the risk that our money will disappear. If you lose access to your Bitcoin, a “crypto hunter” can help you try to track it down, but one of the great things about having a bank is that when lose my PIN, I just call the bank and they let me into my account. I do not want this “third party” to disappear, even for an additional kind of privacy that means nothing to me practically speaking. The trade-off offers me nothing. In fact, I tried using Bitcoin once, and I was struck by how extremely inconvenient it was. I kept asking myself: “why would I ever want to use this?” Of course, companies like Coinbase offer ways to buy, sell, and transfer cryptocurrency swiftly. But they are a centralized third party administrator! Institutions like banks could continue to arise, because they make it easier for unsophisticated users to navigate the complicated world of crypto. But the n we are just recreating banks, defeating the whole purpose of using cryptocurrency in the first place. As Doug Henwood notes:This means that Bitcoin is caught in a paradox: if the reasons why you should not use it are dealt with, the whole purpose of using it in the first place is defeated. If Coinbase becomes just like PayPal or Venmo, what earthly reason is there for me to convert my dollars into Bitcoin using Coinbase, and transact with someone who will the n have to convert the Bitcoin back to dollars (at least if they want to use it almost anywhere)? What added value is being provided by the alternative currency? I am sure private services will pop up that can help me “implemen[t] an effective block chain analytics practice to remain safe from errant typologies that exist on the blockchain,” which I am told I need to do. But the n I am paying someone to help me solve a problem I did not even have before,I do not get convenience and am still giving a cut to a middleman-type-entity, in this case the person who helps me—the oblivious non-techie—from accidentally screwing up the use of this complicated currency. Many of the supposed advantages of Bitcoin, the n, are actually. Having a fixed money supply with no central bank means there is no regulator who can help stabilize the value of the money. As I was writing this article, the value of Bitcoinplummeted 10 percent in 24 hours. If the US dollar lost 10 percent of its value in a single day, people would be comparing this country to Zimbabwe. Yet Bitcoin is intended to be better than fiat currency! The biggest illusion at the heart of the crypto-fraud is that markets can be self-regulating and stable. In fact, markets are created by states and societies, exist within frameworks of law, and must be tended, fed, and cared for by governments if they are to function. Bitcoin pretends to shed the very feature that makes money work—adapting to and conforming social and political institutions and rules. Instead, it relegates its own political judgments to a rigid algorithm, which makes it both unable to respond to the changing world and completely outside the control of the society that must accept and use it. In fact, let is imagine a scenario that will help us see how silly this all is. Let us imagine that I come up with a scheme to revolutionize how people transact. I have invented a new form of currency called Nbucks. They are slips of paper with my face printed on them. I set about trying to encourage businesses to pay people in Nbucks and trying to encourage people to buy them from me. (I sell each Nbuck for $1.) “Why,” you might ask me, “should I transact in Nbucks instead of US dollars?” I have ready answers for you. First, the Nbuck is not controlled by the US government. I am only going to make 1,000 total Nbucks, so the money supply is fixed. Using Nbucks you can transact with people without going through a bank or paying a fee. And you can transact with people in other countries who take Nbucks, without having to go through the pesky process of converting to the local currency. With my special Nbuck app, you can transfer your Nbucks to other people at any time without any fees. Through Nbucks, I tell you, we will free ourselves from centralized government control of the money supply. You will have total autonomous control of your money, for while I set up the mechanism to the initial Nbucks, once they are made, my role ends and we just kind of see what happens with it. Now, at this point you might ask a few questions about my nifty system, such as:“You say I can transact with other people who use Nbucks, but how many people use these things?”“0.01 percent,” I answer, “but it is growing all the time.”“I see,” you reply. “And so what is the advantage of having a currency I can barely use? Why would we switch to this system when we have dollars?”“Well, it is free of centralized government control. And banks. Plus its value is going up all the time. An Nbuck worth $1 today will probably be worth $5 next year, because there are only 1,000 of them and demand for them is increasing.”You will notice that my answer seems like a good argument for buying them as a speculator, but it is not an argument for why they are useful as a currency. In fact, it seems to cut against their usefulness, because it is hard to transact if the value of the money is changing unpredictably all the time. In fact, while it is clear that Nbucksfunction as an alternative currency system if enough people switched to the m, it is not clear why anyone would switch to that system. If I convince enough people that these things are valuable, they will indeed be valuable—just like Beanie Babies became valuable because people were convinced of their value—but how is what I am offering useful to the average consumer as a currency in which they should conduct transactions? In fact, it is essentially useless for the typical person, because they ca not buy much with the money, it is inconvenient to keep converting dollars to Nbucks and back again, and their value is unpredictable. A portion of people in society could switch to using glass beads instead of US dollars. The beads might even be more difficult for the government to trace. The beads might even become extremely valuable. But none of this is an argument for switching to a glass bead economy, or for any given individual to embrace beads. Likewise, Bitcoin could be adopted more and more widely. Cryptocurrency does seem to be taking off. I am not saying the trend will not continue. I am saying it does not solve the problems it says it solves, and that ordinary consumers do not stand to gain much of practical value (and have a lot to lose) from using cryptocurrency. There is no value added unless you are a dissident/outlaw, and even the n, you are better off using cash if you can. Why, the n, does the value of Bitcoin keep going up and up? Why is Coinbase so valuable? Because people believe in it. Or they believe they can make money off it. And people made vast fortunes off it. You might buy some Bitcoin because you think it is going to keep gaining value, and you might not be wrong. Hell, GameStop stock went up and up for a while; speculators can speculate on anything. The irony with Bitcoin is that the better it is as an investment, gaining value rapidly, the worse it is as an actualcurrency, because its worth is unpredictable. (Doug Henwood outlines some of the other reasons Bitcoin fails as an actual currencyhere.)Now, personally, I do not care very much whether people want to use cryptocurrency, though as a believer in consumer protection I would warn anyone considering it to be very, very careful. It does interest me, however, because the people who believe in it seem to embody the wishful thinking common among free market libertarians who think that freedom from “the government” is automatically good. In reality, while plenty that the government does is oppressive (e.g., mass incarceration) some of it is extremely useful (e.g., FDIC insurance). Much of what banks do is odious, but a credit union can be an extremely useful institution. Regulators are good. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is good. Being unable to be traced by the government isgood. But sometimes, as in the case of rich tax evaders and people who have stolen our savings, we want things to be traced. Many of the problems cryptocurrency seeks to solve can be dealt with through means that do not involve trying to jettison the US dollar. For example, one of the touted virtues of cryptocurrency is that it is fast and there are no transfer fees. In reality, transfers are often quite slow and fee scan be exorbitant. But public digital dollars and consumer accounts at the federal reserve could reduce the problems that come with bank account access, minimum deposit fees, slow transfer speeds, ATM fees, etc. These problems are not getting solved with Bitcoin—Bitcoin ATMs are popping up around the country, but turning your cash into Bitcoin or your Bitcoin into cash costs money. (My bank refunds ATM fees, meaning that using Bitcoin ATMs would be a very stupid thing for me to do.) If the infrastructure to make Bitcoin convenient and usable has to be built by the private sector, the n it try to squeeze money out of consumers. The promise of “free transactions” with Bitcoin is, like so many other capitalist promises, illusory. The question of whether people will be exploited by the finance industry is nota question of whether they are using US dollars or some alternate currency, but whether the institutions they are relying on operate in the service of the public interest or of private interests. When I say that cryptocurrency is a fraud, let me be clear: I do not mean that it ca not work as a currency. Anything can work as a currency, though the better ones have predictable values so that a hamburger costs the same on Tuesday as it does on Wednesday. I mean that for most ordinary people, the answers offered to the question “Why should I use cryptocurrency?” are deceptive or nonsense. Instead of being taken in by the privacy and security—which are good things that people indeed want—we have to look at whether these things are actually being delivered to consumers and if the difference is meaningful and worth the trade-offs. What are youreallygetting, what are you giving up to get it, and is the rhetoric of crypto-propagandists actually fulfilled in the real-world experience of using it? This total lack of an actual argument for why it is good is why Warren Buffett has long thought it is a worthless delusion and refuses to go near it. Buffett does not doubt that people might make money on it, but he sees that the claims made for it simply do not hold up. (Buffett prefers to invest in more tangible assets like predatory mobile home companies.)When I point out that the US consumer has no reason to adopt Bitcoin as a currency, the most forceful (and most left-ish) reply I get is that while this may be true for the US, cryptocurrency offer wondrous advantages to unbanked people in the developing world. If you are in a country whose currency is unstable or where international wire transfers are prohibitively expensive, Bitcoin might be helpful. They point me to news stories about how people in certain African countries are increasingly using Bitcoin for certain purchases. Let us note that there is something to the argument that there is ao f people for whom Bitcoin may be better than existing alternatives for certain purposes. I think this class of people is very limited, however. People in the developing world do not like losing 10 percent of the value of their wealth overnight any more than people in the USs do, and to the extent that Bitcoin offers advantages, it does so only because the existing alternatives are so bad. It is true that in some places, international wire transfer fees are outrageously expensive. Sending Bitcoin is not free, and you have to convert it back into cash if you want to actually do anything with it, but it might be better than the alternative, in some places, for now. But if wire transfer fees come down in the next few years, that advantage will be lost. The argument that Bitcoin will be globally helpful depends on assuming that the existing banking industry is not going to succeed in expanding its reach. During an economic crisis, or in places where bank failures occur, Bitcoin might be more helpful. In Venezuela and Zimbabwe, there may be an argument that despite cryptocurrency is disadvantages, people are less likely to lose their shirts by using it. But what this means is that we have got a case the cryptocurrency helps those who:To the extent that Bitcoin is the “future of money,” the n, it is only the future of money in situations of extreme crisis or deprivation—I suspect a lot of the pro-crypto people who understand its present-day uselessness are betting on a future collapse of the global economic system, although I think they overestimate the chances that Bitcoin itself could keep functioning effectively in such a nightmare scenario (someone has to maintain the actual wires). This argument for the usefulness of Bitcoin actually makes me think of the Segway. The Segway was intended to revolutionize transport, and its technology was innovative and impressive and cool. But the Segway did not revolutionize transport. It did end up being used for a lot of tour groups, however. Bitcoin seems similar. Blockchain is clearly impressive. But that does not mean Bitcoin will revolutionize global commerce. Like the Segway, however, it may develop some niche application for some small group of people for whom its disadvantages do not outweigh its advantages. Even those people, however, may eventually find their way back to government currency. Many governments are starting to explore the possibility of offering digital versions of their fiat currency through central banks. These kinds of accounts would make transfers easier and cheaper and give many more unbanked people the ability to store their wealth in a secure place. (The prying eyes of government will still be a problem.) We shall see whether progress is made quickly on this front. If not, it may well be true that swathes of the developing world resort to crypto funny-money. But if so, it will be because it is the least-worst option. If you want a good example of nonsense crypto-hype, have a look at this pseudoscholarly masterpiece by Vijay Boyapati called “The Bullish Case For Bitcoin.” It was recently promoted by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and even re-tweeted by progressive congressman Ro Khanna. (Khanna is a crypto-booster,sayingits decentralization “provides a check against economic mismanagement” and is “the next digital frontier.”) Boyapati provides a case that Bitcoin is a good investment (using some deeply amusinggraphs), but he also tries to show that it has strong potential as a currency.* He lists the supposed qualities a currency needs and shows that Bitcoin is better than the US dollar (fiat money) on most accounts:Of course, half these ratings are false and most of them have nothing to do with what people need from money in the real world. The fact that US dollars are not “scarce,” in that the government can create more of the m, is actually a good thing (for one thing, it means the money supply can grow with the economy; for another, it means we can stimulate the economy through putting new money into it). Boyapati says dollars are less “durable” than Bitcoin, because “many governments have come and gone over the centuries, and their currencies disappeared with the m,” which is true as a historical fact but tells us nothing whatsoever about the future of the dollar. Note that Boyapati does not include in his fake ratings “spendable” (i.e., can you actually use it for anything) because Bitcoin would be crushed on this. Boyapatiinvoke some fake science—like the “Gartner hype cycle”—to support his belief that Bitcoin is future is bright. Look at this magnificently stupid graph designed to show that Bitcoin will eventually be as trusted as gold:You should expect to hear more of these sunny pro-crypto arguments, because those who are heavily invested in cryptocurrency will be working hard to try to trick people into thinking it is in our best interest to embrace cryptocurrency. Boyapati is pitch looks like prophecy, but people who are invested in Bitcoin need to be making these prophecies all the time, as emphatically as possible, because for the currency to succeed people must join in the collective belief that the prophecy is true. (More cynically, for people speculating on Bitcoin to maximize their return the demand for Bitcoin must keep rising.)The world of cryptocurrency is one in which wily and technologically sophisticated people can easily take advantage of less financially or technologically savvy people—and the people making the arguments for it happen to be exactly the ones who can navigate this world well and make money in it. It is the libertarian paradise, a Wild West where everyone is trying to take each other is money and there are no publicly-controlled entities looking out for the common good.contributor Andrew Anchetacommentson the ugliness of this world, which has come to replicate the worst aspects of existing capitalism: “crypto-capitalists have reinvented the finance industry is fractional reserves and derivatives, private interests began trading votes and carving out monopolies, and rent-seekers found ways to extract surplus value, all while trashing the environment and finding new ways to concentrate wealth at the to p.”Trashing the environment? Oh yes, I have not even told you about the fact that Bitcoin is “autonomy” means it has to deploy a silly system that ends up using the same amount of electricity as an entire country, and the problem is getting worse. Cryptocurrencies vary in their wastefulness but Bitcoin “is only likely to consume more and more electricity over time” despite already using an “unfathomable amount of electricity.” Vitalik Buterin, the computer scientist behind Ethereum, the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency, admits that it is an unnecessary “huge waste of resources.” Ethereum has promised to improve the system in a way that will reduce these destructive side effects. But what it means is that at the moment, cryptocurrency is imposing a giant externality on everyone: the failure to put a price on carbon emissions means that polluters can essentially steal from the rest of us. If the energy problem can be solved, cryptocurrency will become somewhat benign and useless rather than actively destructive and useless. This will be used by some to convince you that you ought to start thinking about using cryptocurrency, and merchants ought to accept it. Be careful, because this fad could genuinely result in portions of the economy switching to a system that disadvantages consumers, on the promise that it will solve problems that easily be solved through effective public institutions,ifwe were able to exercise our collective political will. The need for security, privacy, and easy money transfers is real, but the promise that a new form of money will rein in the surveillance state or free us from profiteers is illusory. Only strong—yes, sometimescentralized—democratic institutions can do that. As you can see, this successfully makes the case that high fees are unavoidable, but it also undermines the reasons why any sane person would use this as currency rather than a speculative investment.",1,1,Current Affairs

And, of course, on the afternoon of January 6, Jordan was on the phone with the White House, which would seem to qualify him more as a witness than a member of the committee. Anyway, among the five white men selected by McCarthy, three of them voted against certifying the current president is victory. All five of them voted against impeaching for his role in inciting the violence that descended upon the capitol.

564,"14 more Utah schools shift online this week, including the first elementary to have an outbreak",0.0,50.0,https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/11/18/more-utah-schools-shift,https://adfontesmedia.com/salt-lake-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"An additional 14 Utah schools have shifted online so far this week, coming after another 25 last week as the pandemic surges across the state and spreads into more classrooms. Wednesday also marked the highest single-day increase of cases for K-12 schools in Utah with an additional 598. The previous record was 378 from last Friday. There have now been nearly 11,000 infections tied to students and teachers since August. And, in total, 77 Utah schools have temporarily shut their doors due to outbreaks since reopening this fall. The biggest share of the new school closures came from Jordan District, where the board of education voted to temporarily move five schools to remote learning Wednesday night. The district has been particularly hard hit by the virus and closed 14 schools last week, many facing a second or third outbreak.“The point of moving to virtual is to slow the spread,” stressed board member Jen Atwood during the virtual meeting. Overall, 21 of the district is 57 traditional schools have moved online, including now 11 of its 12 middle schools and all six high schools. That is the most closures of any district in the state. It also has the highest total number of infections – at 1,695 — of the districts in Salt Lake Countythat have reopened in person. That is an increase of nearly 500 more cases in Jordan District from last week. But Wednesday was the first time that the board chose to close elementary schools, which have so far avoided the high transmission rates that have overwhelmed middle and high schools. Three element aries — Butterfield Canyon, Foothills and Westvale — will move to virtual learning. Butterfield Canyon appears to be the first elementary in the state to hit the 15-person outbreak threshold that the state health department recommends trigger a two-week closure. As of Wednesday, there were 14 infections there. The board said a few more would be reported in Thursday is numbers, putting it over the edge. Previously, only two elementary schools have closed in the state, both in Piute County School District in central Utah. But they did so as a precaution without having 15 cases. Pediatricians in the state warned this week that while elementary-age children may not see high numbers of cases, there have recently been more kids with severe illness from the virus landing in the hospital. As such, both Foothills and Westvale in Jordan District are moving online as a safety measure, the board voted. Neither has hit the 15-case threshold. And Westvale, accordingly, will only be shut down for Monday and Tuesday next week as a small reset before Thanksgiving Break. All of the others will close for the full two weeks, with the last in-person day on Thursday before going remote through December 4. The bigger problem is that absentee and quarantine rates at the element aries are so high that it is too difficult to continue holding in-person classes. At Westvale, for instance, there are seven positive cases of the virus. That has led to 94 students and staff being quarantined. And an additional 20 kids were absent Wednesday. With that, roughly one-third of the school was out.“There comes a tipping point with absenteeism and quarantines,” said board member Matthew Young. “It just absolutely hits a tipping point.”Westvale is also dealing with several teachers and administrators being out. The two middle schools, likewise, had not hit 15 cases, but both Oquirrh Hills and Joel P Jensen were close enough and the board voted to close the m, too. Jordan District briefly considered moving all of its schools to online instruction through Thanksgiving, but the measure did not pass. Additionally, this week Fremont High in Weber School District was closed, as well as Legacy Junior High and Syracuse Junior High in nearby Davis School District. North Summit High and Morgan High also moved online. Meanwhile, Tooele High, Corner Canyon High, Brighton High and Farmington High all had their second outbreaks and shifted to virtual instruction.",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune
565,Biden is Distracting Parade of Celebrity Boomers,-15.0,36.5,https://newrepublic.com/article/159117/biden-celebrity-surrogates-carole-king-crosby-streisand,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"With the tiresome necessity of political convention season concluding, we now enter the homestretch of a long two years of presidential campaigning. Here, we will see exactly how Joe Biden plans to argue his case. According to an Associated Pressstoryon Wednesday, it will involve plenty of celebrities. Biden is superstar backers are “flooding the zone as much as possible,” in the words of Michelle Kwan, the Olympic figure skater and a seasoned Democratic celebrity surrogate. It is hard not to get chills hearing about Biden is reliance on his superstar allies, given how the same sort of strategic deployment turned out for Hillary Clinton. But so far, Biden is taking a slightly different approach. His gang is a little more …distinguished. Experienced. Seasoned. We are talking Carole King, James Taylor, David Crosby, Barbara Streisand,Sheryl Crow—singers of the same vintage or earlier as the musicians Homer Simpson got roasted by his kids for liking in the “Homerpalooza” episode. Which aired in 1996. Perhaps Biden is Boomer Bench is a little more authentic than the approach Clinton took four years ago, which dutifully trotted out huge millennial stars like Taylor Swift andKaty Perry, as if to say: This is the shit you idiot kids like, right? Her campaign also engaged in more niche, targeted pandering to young and trendy, more media-savvy audiences, like writing a post for the now-defunct web site The Toast and appearing onBroad City. It is a little harder to imagine Joe Biden showing up on a Twitch stream or appearing on theOffice Ladiespodcast, but the re is plenty of time. After all, he does haveDiploin his corner. There are advantages to getting celebrities involved in your campaign. For a start, they are super rich. Secondly, their friends tend to be similarly wealthy. And maybe the re is a third advantage, who knows? Focus on the first two. In one revealing story,The Financial Timesnotedin May that wealthy participants in virtual fund raisers expect a “rain check” on the “perks” that they would usually receive at in-person events, such as getting face time with the candidate. This is the avenue of influence that causes campaign finance reform advocates to warn about these events. It is definitely a more acute concern when it is a lobbyist paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to whisper in the candidate is ear, of course, but it is not like these multimillionaire celebrities have no interests of their own. Still, the Biden campaign is strategy of “flooding the zone” with celebrities may have more to do with trying to attract other, less famous wealthy donors than with attracting donations from the celebs the mselves. A Biden campaign officialtoldThe Financial Timesthat they were “preparing to test new fundraising measures, such as deploying more celebrity surrogates,” to make up the gap with Trump is more robust fundraising. Those less well-known but critical donors—your Average Joe Millionaire—might need an added inducement to shell out if they are not going to get to chat to Biden himself. The chance to speak with pop-cultural royalty about politics can at least serve as a memorable part of The Biden Experience. Celebrities have stumped for Democratic presidentialcandidatesforyears, but the genuine love celebrities and musicians had for Obama, who was also perhaps the only president we have ever had to come close to being “cool,” greatly accelerated this dynamic. It is almost easy to forget that Obama was once an outsider candidate, challenging the Clinton status quo, and that—combined with the obvious fact that he stood to break the centuries-long cycle of white presidents—allowed him to accrue no small amount of street c red with hip backers. Obama used in die sad-dad rockers The National is song “Fake Empire” (which actually does not hol da very positive message about America) in an ad during his primary campaign, and the band played a benefit show in their home state of Ohio for him. This was all very trendy stuff, in 2008. The excitement about Obama was inextricably wrapped up in celebrity, both his own and that of his famous supporters. Now the same celebs who loved Cool Obama are on the hook for Old Joe. At least one celebrity endorser even explicitly mentioned Obama when endorsing Biden. In an updated version of “Lookin’ for a Leader,” Neil Young sang last month: “Yeah, we had Barack Obama, and we really need him now. The man who stood behind him has to take his place somehow.” Talk about damning with faint praise. But if Obama made it a trend, now it is mandatory. One unspoken benefit of celebrity surrogates: It means Joe Biden does not have to do all the campaigning himself, or more specifically, that he does not have totalk so much, thus defusing some of his well-known gaffe risk. Bidenreiteratedlast week that he does not intend to resume active, in-person campaigning, telling Reuters that he and his running mate, Kamala Harris, were “going to follow the science, what the scientists tell us” and that the campaign “will win” despite the candidate choosing to sequester himself at his Delaware home. It is true that staging large campaign events with lots of people presents unique dangers during the coronavirus pandemic. But there is evidence that suggests outdoor, socially distanced events with masks are lower risk and that President Donald Trump is embarking on “an increasingly aggressive travel schedule” to battleground states, staging “open-air events with small crowds.” There is a whole world of activities Biden could do aside from packed rallies. He could visit reopened schools, or factories, or hospitals—all places where the people he is asking to vote for him have been required to keep working. But why bother going places, when you have David Crosby just a Zoom call away?As Sarah Jones noted for this publication in 2016, Clinton is campaign “employed a candy-colored brand of female empowerment seemingly based on the assumption that white women is political priorities are influenced by the pop culture they consume.” This time, we have many of the same celebrities and the same heavy-handed effort to Reach Out to Voters, without even a half-hearted invocation of any kind of bigger reason to care about Joe Biden at all. The celebrities’ message will boil down to the same message his campaign has had all along: He is not Trump. The Democratic National Convention essentially hammered this case throughout four evenings of virtual content, forsaking much mention of the policies Democrats intend to pursue and striving so mightily to draw disaffected Republicans away from Trump that it studiously avoided any criticism of the GOP beyond its current standard-bearer. It was in many ways reminiscent of Clinton is myopic anti-Trump focus; the Biden campaign is firm commitment to not really campaigning also feels eerily similar to Clinton, who spent the summer of 2016focusing on celebrity fund raisers over campaign events. This election is different for a thousand reasons, but it is hard not to feel the cold wind of November 2016 blowing again.",1,1,New Republic

The incident happened on the afternoon of April 21 in Elkton, Md., according to theMaryland State Fire Marshal is Office. The suspect was arguing with another woman and a man before the fire, according to a witness video reviewed byNBC News. Gail J Metwally, 47, has been charged with first- and second-degree attempted murder, first-degree arson, first-degree assault, two counts of first-degree malicious burning, two counts of malicious destruction of property and two counts of reckless endangerment, the fire marshal said. Witnesses say they saw Metwally setting multiple fires inside her home, the n pulling up a chair to watch the flames from the lawn. One Snapchat video shows her reading a book during the fire, NBC News reports.“The 911 caller stated that she actually went inside the house, set multiple items, multiple fires inside the house. She the n exited the house and proceeded to sit on a lawn chair where she actually watched the fire spread throughout the house,” Senior Deputy State Fire Marshal Oliver Alkire told local broadcasterWMAR Metwally walked away a few minutes after the home was engulfed in flames, authorities said. Bystanders heard another woman calling for help from the basement of the burning home, so they rushed in and helped her escape through a window, the fire marshal said. The victim has since been identified by local media as Blenda Holbrook, 52.“She almost burned to death in that house,” her brother told WMAR. “I am just really thankful to the two guys that helped her out of that basement, because I do not think she’d be here today if they had not helped her.”Firefighters and police showed up a short time later. Metwally was arrested near the scene. The fire marshal concluded that the cause of the fire was arson. Authorities say Metwally was one of four people living at the home. The victim, who was trapped in the basement during the blaze, was also a resident. The other two residents were not home at the time.",2,2,Global News
567,Biden is Private Prison EO Wo not Affect Mass Incarceration,7.67,40.0,https://freebeacon.com/policy/bidens-private-prison-e-o-wont-affect-mass-incarceration/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced an end to federal use of private prisons, a move he heralded as a blow to mass incarceration but which would affect just 2 percent of all prisoners. Biden is executive order, which requires the Department of Justice to begin phasing out private detention contracts, is specifically targeted at ""decreas[ing] incarceration levels"" by reducing ""profit-based incentives to incarcerate."" Speaking to the press Tuesday, Biden called the order ""just the beginning of my administration is plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system.""""President Biden is committed to reducing mass incarceration while making our communities safer,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing on the order. ""That starts with ending the federal government is reliance on private prisons.""But the federal government is not reliant on private prisons, and the order would affect less than 2 percent of all prisoners in the USs, official data show, including just 16 percent of federal prisoners. It would also not reduce incarceration, as prisoners would be moved to public facilities and would likely leave untouched the many federal private prison detainees housed under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Biden is order instead follows private prisons' role as a popular scapegoat for advocates of ""criminal justice reform,"" who argued as far back as the Obama administration that profit-motivated corporations would tend to increase incarceration. That position is similar to other popular arguments—like advocacy for marijuana legalization on de carceration grounds—that allow proponents of reform to avoid talking about prisons' large population of violent offenders. In its specifics, the new order only requires that the Department of Justice not renew its contracts with ""privately operated criminal detention centers."" It does not implicate detention centers administered by other departments. That may mean that private entities will still detain illegal aliens pending deportation, who account for ""the vast majority of contractor-operated facilities,"" according to the private prison group Day One Alliance. In other words, the Biden order may target a small share of a small share of offenders. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statisticsindicate that private prisons hold just 7 percent of state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners. In total, they detain roughly 116,000 of the roughly 1.4 million prisoners in the USs—the federal prisons that Biden is order would close house just 28,000 people or roughly 2 percent of the US prison population. In fact, the BJS data show, the federal private prison population was already in decline, falling between 2018 and 2019. Just five states hold more than 20 percent of their prisoners in private prisons, while 18 states hold none at all. These facts did not stop ""criminal justice reform"" groups from praising Biden is executive order, with the ACLU is David Fathicalling it""an important first step toward acknowledging the harm that has been caused and taking actions to repair it."" It also garnered praise from the union representing some 30,000 federal prison workers, who stand to gain from the closing of competitors. Biden is order explicitly restarts an initiative of the last days of the Obama administration, which similarly prepared a phase-out in the months leading up to the 2016 election. Following his victory, President Donald Trumpreversed that decision shortly after taking over the White House. That made it a popular punching bag in the ensuing years, particularly during the 2020 Democratic primary. Then, contenders such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren(D., Mass.) andCory Booker(D., NJ) took aim at it,as didnow-Vice President Kamala Harris. Those candidates likely induced Biden to pull his criminal justice platform to the left, including endorsing an end to federal private prisons—part of a larger effort to shed a tough-on-crime image from his days in the Senate. Opposition to private prisons in the 2020 field followed that group is use of other popular progressive talking points on ""criminal justice reform,"" like the debunked claim that marijuana criminalization is a major driver of incarceration. Just as with prisoners in private prisons, marijuana offenders account for a small fraction of overall prisoners. In reality,48 percent of prisoners are violent offenders, a fraction that has risen even as prison populations have shrunk over the past decade and a half.

569,Intelligence Contractors Vying for Slimmer Spy Budget in FY 2021,0.0,44.4,https://about.bgov.com/news/intelligence-contractors-vying-for-slimmer-spy-budget-in-fy-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-23,17,"The Department of Defense and theOffice of the Director of National Intelligence(ODNI) released their intelligence budget requests for fiscal 2021 totaling $85 billion earlier this year. DODandODNIreleased enacted 2020 figures October 21, allowing for comparisons and revealing a slight decrease from $85.8 billion total in the fiscal 2021 request. A large portion of the intelligence community is budget goes to contracting which indicates companies are likely to be competing for fewer dollars in the future. Most contracting by the intelligence agencies is not transparent. Historically, the share of budgets devoted to contracting has been reported at about70%. The US intelligence community is budget is comprised of two primary categories, the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the National Intelligence Program (NIP). The MIP is overseen by the Pentagon and includes spending for the intelligence components of the military services as well as some of the funding for intelligence agencies that fall under DOD such as theDefense Intelligence Agency(DIA) or the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency(NGA). The NIP pays for other intelligence agencies such as theCentral Intelligence Agency, portions of theFBI, and the State Department isBureau of Intelligence and Research(INR), as well as some portion of the DOD-controlled agencies. For fiscal 2021, DOD announced its MIP request would be$23.1 billion, the same as was appropriated for fiscal 2020, and ODNI requested $61.9 billion, a decrease from $62.7 billion in fiscal 2020. DOD and ODNI do not release detailed budget figures for the various agencies for security reasons. In fiscal 2012, the combined MIP and NIP budget was $75.4 billion making the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through the 2021 request about 1% and thus not keeping pace withinflation. About70%of the intelligence budget is spent on contracts based on the latest figures available, meaning that the approximately $59.5 billion to be spent on contracts for the intelligence community in fiscal 2021 is smaller in real terms than it was a decade ago. Determining what exactly the intelligence community spends its contracting dollars on is difficult because the intelligence community is exempt from reporting contract spending to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). A search in Bloomberg Government is Contracts Intelligence tool shows a total of only$3 billion for the National Security Agency, DIA and NGA since fiscal 2017 and no data for the CIA The billions that the community spends that are not disclosed are spent on a broad range of goods and services. Some of these contracts are directly related to personnel that perform intelligence collection and analysis, or the building of intelligence satellites, while others may pay for more mundane things, such as janitorial services in intelligence community facilities, office supplies, or construction and repair of buildings. However, even in the cases where the work is not directly intelligence-related, contractors often require security clearances because of the sensitivity of the work being performed around the m, the individual identities of those performing the intelligence work, or even the location where the work is being done. Competition for intelligence community work is challenging because of the limited number of contractors that have cleared personnel authorizations. It is also difficult to identify available opportunities because solicitations are often released with a prerequisite for organizations to have certain security clearances. The intelligence community is primary platform for releasing opportunities,Acquisition Research Center, has both unclassified and classified components and does release a portion of the acquisition documents at the unclassified level that are accessible with registration and login-in credentials. For contractors seeking to participate in the intelligence market, partnering with companies already in the market, or hiring personnel with experience are often the best ways to break in. If the budgets continue declining slowly, as they have for fiscal 2021, the market is only likely to become more competitive in the immediate future.

Settlement of the lawsuit was announced by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. The EEOC had originally filed the lawsuit in 2017. The company was charged with failing to consider African American employees for promotions to vacant route sales positions. One example is Ronnie Johnson, a Black employee who applied for a route sales position.“Despite six years of exemplary job performance with the company and previous route sales experience, Birmingham Beverage denied him an interview and instead promoted a white delivery driver with only nine months’ experience on the job, whom Johnson was supervising at the time,” apr ess release from the EEOC says. Despite Black employees frequently expressing interest in promotions, none were hired in the four years prior to the lawsuit, according to the EEOC At least 11 white applicants or employees were hired or promoted to these route sales positions.“At the time of the lawsuit, Birmingham Beverage is only two Black route salesmen were assigned to routes in predominantly African American neighborhoods,” the release says. The suit alleged that Birmingham Beverage violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on multiple occasions. As a result of the suit, Johnson and 34 other Black employees, former and current, will receive a monetary settlement. Birmingham Beverage also agreed to review its policies on the hiring and promotion processes to ensure Black employees and applicants have equal opportunities, provide anti-discrimination training to all employees and hire a Title VII coordinator.“This case illustrates the destructive and demoralizing impact race discrimination can have on employees when they are denied employment opportunities based on their race,” EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows said in the release. “For many years, African American workers at Birmingham Beverage demonstrated their fitness and desire for promotion but were denied employment opportunities because of the color of their skin.”Lehr Middlebrooks Vreeland & Thompson, PC represents Birmingham Beverage in the litigation. According to their response on the company is behalf, Birmingham Beverage “stands behind its hiring and promotion decisions to hire and promote the best qualified applicants.”They also claim they have employed “many African American Route Salesmen” over the last five years.“The high costs of litigation of class claims made the continued vigorous defense of the suit economically infeasible and presented a distraction to our core business operations,” the response states. “We look forward to continuing to hire and promote applicants and employees of all backgrounds into positions for which they are qualified.”",2,2,AL.com
571,COVID-19 Is Derailing Other Important Scientific Research,-0.67,44.0,https://heavy.com/news/covid19-scientific-research/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,21,"GettyAmadou Kone, a professor of molecular biology at the University Clinical Research Centre, is seen working in a COVID-19 testing laboratory in Bamako on January 9, 2021. For many researchers, the choice to spend decades working in a lab or in the field comes from a desire to help – to expand understanding of how life works or to improve human health. So when COVID-19 emerged, many scientists dropped what they were doing and switched their focus to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the pandemic. Suddenly, the ranks of scientists who had been studying coronavirus es were flooded with newcomers seeking to contribute in some way, many with little prior experience in infectious diseases. Some wanted to join in on the biggest problem facing the world. For others, it was the only way to open labs. Others saw funding opportunities. We,a virologistandvirologist-physician, saw this pivot in our own fields. Many of our colleagues began working on SARS-CoV-2. As an editor/adviser at the Journal of Virology and Science, one of us handled hundreds of papers in 2020, nearly half focused on COVID-19. Curious about the trend and implications, we analyzed published papers about SARS viruses found in PubMed and found the number had increased 20-fold relative to the early 2000s, when the first SARS coronavirus appeared. Our analysis has not yet been published. Another recent analysis,which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that the proportion of biomedical research papers focused on coronavirus es rose from 0.07% to 5.3% from 2019 to 2020. Many of these papers came from fields that had not considered coronavirus es before, such as psychiatry, cardiovascular research and oncology. When a new virus is ravaging the planet, scientists should help. This is an all-hands-on-deck emergency, and researchers with different backgrounds can bring new perspectives that can lead to major breakthroughs. Yet there is some evidence that as labs have shifted attention to SARS-CoV-2, efforts have been duplicated, and precious time and resources have been used ineffectively. This rapid scientific reorientation has implications far beyond SARS-COV-2 and potentially leaves the world vulnerable to other health crises. Understandably, the rush to enter the field has led to many labs doing the same experiments at the same time. Some level of duplication is essential to ensure that findings are reproducible. But some of this duplication is unnecessary: A search for “SARS-CoV-2” and “ACE2” (the major receptor that SARS viruses use to enter cells) in an online archive of unpublished research yielded more than 1,400 papers, and we found evidence of overlap. For example, hundreds of these papers examine inhibition of viral entry into cells. There is overlap even in unique subniches: Dozens of papers focus on nanobodies, a unique type of antibody often generated using alpacas, and the titles of many of the papers are very similar. Fresh perspectives from newcomers do not always yield breakthroughs. Science and the media have been temporarily derailed by problematic research contributed by scientists switching to a new field – such as a paper bynonepidemiologistsreporting that a vaccine against tuberculosis may protect against COVID-19 because countries with high rates of vaccination have lower mortality rates of the virus. Despite extensive media coverage –the study was picked up by 90 media outlets – a closer look revealed no evidence the vaccine had any protective effect. In biomedicine, academic labs study a specific topic and are led by experienced scientists who direct trainees. Over several years of training, a select number of trainees have the desire and gain sufficient expertise to open their own labs and begin mentor ing the next generation of scientists in their field. This is how we keep science going. Normally, trainees work in a lab investigating a particular field of biology or medicine, such as cancer or neurodegeneration. Each trainee studies a single, specific topic and publishes his or her research as scientific papers. The rapid pivot to COVID research means many labs – and trainees – that were once studying other topics are now focused on SARS-CoV-2, which means fewer young scientists are now being trained to tackle other health threats. This loss of knowledge and expertise could leave us less prepared for the next health crisis or outbreak. At this point, our concerns are theoretical. We ca not say something like this has happened in the past, because nothing like COVID-19 has occurred in the modern research era. When other viruses such as SARS (caused by the virus SARS-CoV-1), Ebola and Zika became news, some scientists switched gears to help, but at nowhere near the scale we see now. Now, one year into the pandemic, many lab teams may want to ask: Can we continue to make an important and distinct contribution to the field? For some – those with a unique angle or the appropriate experience and facilities to handle dangerous pathogens – the answer may be yes. However, for many others, it may be time to pivot back to pre-COVID-19 research topics in which the overall advances will be more significant. Even within the field of infectious diseases, it does not make sense for the vast majority of virologists to focus on COVID-19. With hundreds of viruses colonizing bats and other animals around the world and the potential for spillover and future pandemics, it is imperative that we study many different viruses.[Sign up for The Conversation is newsletter.]Some researchers need to do “curiosity-based work,” in which we follow investigations with no obvious link to human health. You never know where the path will lead. By studying yellow fever virus,Charles Ricelaid the groundwork for his research on hepatitis C virus, which was acknowledged with last year is Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Meanwhile, those who continue to study COVID-19 and other infectious diseases need dedicated, sustained funding, not isolated surges of cash that rely on the expedient wishes of Congress. Extending National Institutes of Health funding periods from five years to seven years would help immensely. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute recently adopted a similar approach. To prepare for the next outbreak, the field needs stable funding to study many different viruses, monitor reservoirs of viruses with pandemic potential and develop new antivirals we can rapidly deploy during the next pandemic. In the war against the COVID-19 pandemic, facing SARS-CoV-2 will not be the only battle we fight. The attraction of working on the pandemic virus can divert scientists from other pressing health concerns that can be just as deadly.

572,Trump Takes Swipe At FBI Chief Over Handling Of Russia Probe Documents,6.0,37.0,https://dailycaller.com/2020/08/13/donald-trump-christopher-wray-russia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-caller-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"President Donald Trump took a swipe at FBI Director Christopher Wray in an interview on Thursday, saying that the FBI chief has not been as forthcoming as he would like with documents related to the Trump-Russia probe.“I wish he was more forthcoming, he certainly has not been,” Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “There are documents that they want to get, and we have said we want to get. We are going to find out if he is going to give those documents. But certainly he is been very, very protective.”Trump is remarks comes as congressional Republicans have ramped up public allegations that Wray has withheld documents related to the FBI is investigation of the Trump campaign. Last week, Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnsonsubpoenaed Wrayfor all documents related to Crossfire Hurricane, the name of the FBI is counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign. The investigation began on July 31, 2016 and was folded into the special counsel is probe, which started before Wray took office. On Monday, Senator Lindsey Grahamcalled on Wrayto explain a February 14, 2018 memo regarding an FBI briefing provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding the primary source for Christopher Steele, the British spy whose dossier the FBI used to obtain surveillance orders against Carter Page. The briefing memo did not disclose that Steele is source,Igor Danchenko, disputed some of the key allegations in the dossier. Georgia Representative Doug Collinscalled on Wray to resign on Wednesday for failing to disclose Trump-Russia documents.“I have reached my limit with Director Wray,” Collins said on Fox News. “It is time for him to resign. It is time for him to move on. Let is let other people take the reins here.”“Either he was willfully not knowing what was going on, he was intentionally misleading the Senate, or there was actually a cover up going on.”Wray has reportedly opposed White House and congressional efforts to declassify various documents related to the dossier, FBI sources, and Crossfire Hurricane. Bloombergreportedin January 2018 that Wray opposed the declassification and release of a memo from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that alleged that the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding the dossier. The memo was largely vindicated by a Justice Department inspector general is report released on December 9, 2019 that said the FBI made 17 “significant” errors and omissions in applications submitted to the FISC to surveil Carter Page. Trump downplayed his role in selecting Wray for the FBI position, telling Bartiromo that “he was chosen by a certain person, and I said, go ahead, put whoever you want.”“I am so honest that I said you could put anybody you want. Let is see how Wray turns out. He is either going to turn out one way or the other.”“Bill Barr has a chance to be the greatest of all time.

573,"LBJ Stole an Election. 72 Years Later, Democrats Are Using the Same Bag of Tricks.",29.0,8.67,https://thenewamerican.com/lbj-stole-an-election-72-years-later-democrats-are-using-the-same-bag-of-tricks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-05,16,"The Bible says the re is nothing new under the sun. That certainly applies to voter fraud in American politics. The commonly parroted talking point among the mainstream media and other mouthpieces of the establishment is that voter fraud, at least to a degree that could sway an election, does not happen in America; that it is only found in third-world countries but could never take place in a nation as sophisticated as ours. Such assurances fly in the face of reality. In fact, voter fraud has been a long-time fixture of American politics and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant of history or deliberately trying to obfuscate the truth. Anyone who has studied urban political operations, especially the infamousTammany Hallmachine, knows that vote fraud, including dead people voting and party bosses filling out absentee ballots on behalf of voters, has been a fact of life since at least the 19th century. Perhaps the most famous case of voter fraud is Lyndon Baines Johnson is 1948 stealing of the US Senate race against former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson. This election stands out because of its significance for America — Johnson had already forsaken his House seat and lost a Senate race in 1941, so a loss in 1948 would have ended his political career and prevented him from reaching the presidency — and because the fraud has been conclusively and definitively proven, even to the point of the biggest participants in the steal admitting to what they did years after. Aspreviously noted, LBJ overcame an 11,000-vote Election Night deficit against the conservative former governor in the Democrat primary thanks to tens of thousands of “block votes” he purchased, particularly from the Rio Grande Valley, where a group of corrupt political bosses took advantage of the heavy Mexican demographic is willingness to play along and keep quiet in obeisance to their powerfulpatrones(Spanish for “bosses” or “chief”), who would win over commoners with favors (giving a local family cash for funeral expenses, helping an old lady with her medical bills, etc.) and silence dissidents at gunpoint. The ringleader of the Valley is political bosses was George Parr, a sheriff and county judge known, like his father before him, as the “Duke of Duval” County. Parr is dominion encompassed seven counties; he ruled Duval, Brooks, and Jim Hogg counties as a virtual satrapy and his control extended into Zapata, Webb, La Salle, and Starr counties through alliances with lesser local bosses. In Precinct 13 of the city of Alice in Jim Wells County, the precinct in which the mysterious last-minute 200 votes that pushed Johnson over the edge to an 87-vote victory were “found,” the votes were supervised by Parr is enforcer, a tall, burly, savage Mexican by the name of Luis Salas, better known as the “Indio.”Salas left many a man near-death in fist fights and carried a revolver around his hip, often under the guise of the law (Parr made him a city policeman in Alice and a deputy sheriff in Duval, Jim Wells, and Nueces counties).“In all these years, George told me to give our candidate 80 percent of the total votes, regardless if the people voted against us,” Salas told author Robert Caro, as recounted in the book. How did Salas and other vote-sellers ensure their client, Johnson, won the election?One method was getting the dead to vote. As detailed in:The number of votes at the’ command was not necessarily limited by the number of eligible voters. Since voters over the age of sixty were not required to pay poll taxes, and since poll tax lists were checked irregularly to eliminate the names of those who died after sixty, “in the Valley,” as one expert on the subject puts it, “the ‘machine’ votes the dead men.”In many cases, votes were cast on behalf of individuals without their knowledge, as in the case of a young man who testified at the behest of the Stevenson team that, although a ballot was cast in his name, he had in fact been out of town and not voted when the election occurred. Even non-citizens were utilized to give Parr is candidates an edge. Caro writes:Nor was American citizenship necessarily a requirement; on Election Day, voters were recruited in saloons on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande and brought across in truckloads to vote on the American side. Starr County was “an excellent location for bringing voters from across the border, a commentator notes. In Webb County, the small town of Dolores had about 100 American citizens — and in some elections recorded as many as 400 votes. Of course, in many instances, physical voters were not used at all. In precincts where the bosses had total control, such as the Salas-run Precinct 13 in Alice, they would simply add to the tally sheet as many votes as their candidate needed. This was the case with the scandalous 200 votes, which were a product of Parr, seeing that Johnson was still about 150 votes short a week after the Election, ordering Salas to say that the Johnson vote count was not the 765 originally reported, but(one of Stevenson is attorneys, who saw the original tally sheet, said the “9” in the 965 had the appearance of having been a “7,” with a loop added to it to turn it into a “9”). The Johnson camp could afford all this thanks to the virtually unlimited financial resources of the interests who backed him, from Texas oil magnates to federal contractors such as Brown & Root to liberal Northeastern businessmen. Johnson is 1948 Senate bid was, at the time, the most expensive campaign in the history of Texas. A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black halted the trial and investigation of the fraud just minutes before the vote boxes whose contents would have proved the tampering of the count were to be opened in court. But those involved in the steal later admitted the truth. Salas, for example, told Caro that he lied under oath and did, in fact, falsify votes for Johnson, opening for the Democrat “the road to reach the presidency of this country.”“This is history like it or not, nobody can erase these facts,” Salas said. The shocking turn of events of the 1948 Senate race in Texas was not unlike what Americans witnessed in the 2020 presidential race: A popular candidate appeared to have the contest all but wrapped up on Election Night; the n, in subsequent days, that lead was gradually eroded as new ballots, overwhelmingly skewed in favor of his opponent, were “discovered” in precincts known for their corrupt politics. Then, as now, the reason for the delay in reporting is clear: The bosses instructed their elections officials not to report their tallies until the rest of the state had already done so, allowing them to know how many ballots they needed to fabricate. LBJ lost his first Senate bid in 1941 because, already in the lead, he mistakenly told Parr and company to report their results immediately, allowing opponent W Lee O’Daniel is men to falsify the right amount of votes to pushover the to p. In 1948, turnout percentages in the 80s and 90s alerted observers to the scam. In 2020, cities responsible for Biden is victory likewise had unprecedented turnout in the 80s and 90s. In 1948, the media, which largely supported liberal and New Deal-supporter Johnson over conservative “neanderthal” Stevenson, took Johnson is claims at face value and for years thereafter enshrined the narrative that the Stevenson camp were merely sore losers. And in 1948, as in 2020, the courts, all the way to the Supreme Court, ultimately failed to deliver justice. In the Johnson case, it was thanks to the brilliant political maneuvering of his army of lawyers and the local election officials he bought. A common stalling tactic in court by such officials on the Johnson side was saying that they had conveniently “lost” the vote tally sheets and otherwise doing all they could to prevent an inspection of the original records — not unlike Democrat precincts to day, where officials resist efforts to audit and have even moved to destroy records as quickly as possible. Those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Sadly, due in part to a mass media and leftist academia that misinforms and dis informs the public, we failed to learn in time to prevent a repetition of 1948 on a much grander scale in 2020. Now, whether President Trump wins the fight or loses, Americans’ faith in the integrity of our electoral system has forever been shattered.",0,0,The New American

Paxton himself had claimed Twitter is ban ""chills free speech"" and accused multiple tech giants of a ""seemingly coordinated deplatforming"" of Trump following the Capitol riot. He echoed frequent conservative beliefs that Twitter,Facebook, Google and others are breaking the spirit of the First Amendment with an alleged bias against right-wing views. These sites should be treated as public spaces and forced to carry any otherwise legal content, according to these beliefs. Twitter may have a solid case, however. As a private company, Twitter is within its rights to determine what it does and does not publish. It might also point to a long history of refusing to ban Trumpdespite repeated violations of its policies, instead relying on labels or limitations on specific tweets. This was not a company that rushed to ban a dissenting view, in other words. Paxton is office had not formally commented as we wrote this, but it would not be surprising if he fought hard to protect the investigation.

575,Seeing Doug Emhoff as Second Gentleman Upends Masculinity—For the Best,-10.67,33.67,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a35278785/doug-emhoff-second-gentleman-masculinity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,16,"The response to one of the most patriarchal and overtly racist presidents in history did not just lead to the election of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first woman and person of color to serve in the role—it also led to the country getting to know Doug Emhoff, the first (of hopefully many) Second Gentleman in this nation is history. Seeing a man in this role, which until now has only been filled by women, helps transform the very notion of masculinity. Truly! Because if a full gender revolution is to be achieved, it is just as important for us to see men serving in support of women as it is to see women thrive in leadership positions. Throughout time and especially in government, women have performed the undervalued and often invisible labor necessary for men to become leaders. Sure, that might mean taking care of the family and the house, but it also means performing the intense emotional labor of supporting someone with a front-facing role. Former First Lady Michelle Obamatalked about this with Oprah back in 2018saying, “When you get married and have kids, your whole plan, once again, gets upended…especially if you get married to somebody who has a career that swallows up everything.”President Obama echoed the toll it took on her in his book. “Despite Michelle is success and popularity, I continued to sense an undercurrent of tension in her, subtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,” the former president wrote. Simply put: Women have enabled men to become relentless movers and shakers for decades, and it is well past time for dudes to return the favor in really public ways. Since the 2020 presidential campaigns began a million years ago, voters were able to see more male partners than ever before support their spouses in this way. We witnessed Bruce Mann rally behind his wife, Senator Elizabeth Warren; John Bessler stand beside his wife, Senator Amy Klobuchar; Chasten Buttigieg become a beloved figure on his husband Mayor Pete Buttigieg is campaign trail; Jonathan Gillibrand support his wife, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand; and Abraham Williams smile alongside his wife Representative Tulsi Gabbard is campaign. When Harris became Biden is VP pick and the n the VP-Elect, Emhoff announced that he would ditch his own career as an entertainment lawyer (he will teach a class at Georgetown Law) in support of hers. Perhaps seeing a man as public as the Second Gentleman make these choices will make us value the legion of wives and partners who have been making them with little to no recognition for so long. As an author who has been on a quest to prove to men that freeing the mselves from masculinity will ultimately make them happier, nothing brings me more joy than seeing Emhoff not simply embrace but also actively celebrate his secondary role in service to his wife. I freaking love when he does small things like post tender self i es of the ir“couple time,”bud up with other dudes supporting their spouses(hi, Chasten!), or chronicle her work adventures in the Senate with grainy pics that are not really even feed-worthy. (Still cute though.)Those are actions we really only see from women or “wife guys,” who arememe-ified into oblivion. But making sure that the next generation of boys grows up seeing men perform all kinds of roles, not just the front-facing ones, is crucial for their emancipation as fully human men. Besides, slotting a man into a position traditionally reserved for a female, is not just good for boys to see, it might make us take roles of support more seriously. When men experience struggles that women share, it inadvertently makes them more visible because our society inherently trusts and values the male experience. Sorry, but it is true. Just look at the way men joining a certain industry makes the pay of that job increase. That is why I have often argued that one of the most effective ways to increase the stature of professions like teaching and nursing would probably be for men to simply join them. The same applies to Second Gentlemen. Both President Joe Biden and Emhoff symbolize a new kind of masculinity that clashes not just with the Trump kind but also with his most vocal and violent supporters. As a culture, we need to be just as excited about a man being supportive as we do about woman being assertive. Both are equally valid and valuable qualities we should all strive to develop no matter our gender. The pressure on men to choose one over the other is simply misery-producing and frankly boring. In the words of the first Second Gentleman, which hepennedfor, “I want them to grow up in a world where it is not news that a loving partner—of any gender—supports them in everything they do.”The point is clear: If we want more girls to become comfortable being firsts, we need to make sure we are teaching boys to be just as comfortable being second.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

Dave Butler, a spokesman for Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tells US News. ""He answered her questions regarding the process of nuclear command authority.""MORE:The statement follows a letter Pelosi sent to Democratic colleagues on Friday.

On Wednesday, after contracting the coronavirus, Lloyd, who had served with the Metropolitan Police Department for nearly 30 years, died at University Medical Center. He was 53.“Everyone knows Erik as the man that shows up when tragedy strikes, whether it is injury or a death,” Will Huddler, chairman of the Las Vegas Police Managers and Supervisors Association, said before learning of Lloyd is death. “And now, it is just this awkward feeling for the agency and all of us that Erik is the one who needs help. He is always been there to help us.”In a statement from the Metropolitan Police Department, delivered as an Honor Guard led Lloyd is body and a procession of police vehicles from the hospital to Palm Downtown Mortuary & Cemetery, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said the department “is a better agency for having Erik.”“He was the type of officer who represents all the values you want in a person,” Lombardo said in the statement. “He was hardworking, honest, kind, and generous with his time. He created a legacy outside of his work here at LVMPD, working to help people in their greatest time of grief.”Lloyd was born in Downey, California, and is survived by his wife of 22-years, Minddie, two daughters and five grandchildren, Metro said. Nevada Assemblyman Tom Roberts, who retired from Metro as assistant sheriff in 2018, shared news about Lloyd on Facebook.“RIP Erik. God bless you and your family,” Roberts wrote. “Honor to know you and work with you all these years. You will be missed by so many.”Lloyd is wife, who works as the judicial executive assistant to District Judge William Kephart, also contracted the virus and has since been released from the hospital, according to multiple sources. As the two battled the virus, the Police Wives of Southern Nevadalaunched a fund raiser to support the couple.‘Like a super strong flu’Kephart said he has known both for more than 20 years, often spending time together outside of work. Erik Lloyd and the judge, a former prosecutor, played softball together and traveled across the country on fishing and hunting trips as Lloyd rose through the ranks of the police force. Kephart recalled how Lloyd, who had survived a battle with throat cancer, told him the virus felt “like a super strong flu,” before his condition suddenly worsened, and he was rushed to the hospital a little over a week ago.“He always had control of himself and his life,” Kephart said. “That is what is kicking my butt is I think he thought he had this under control.”Through his leadership, Lloyd connected with other elected officials, too, like Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick.“Lt. Lloyd was an amazing officer whose work in our community helped countless families,” she said in a statement. “His passing shows us all the dangers of this virus and the importance of doing everything we can to fight it. Knowing the lieutenant is no longer with us makes my heart ache.”Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson learned of Lloyd is death Wednesday.“It is a sad day for the Metro family, and the entire Las Vegas community as Erik was a superb police officer, and a gentleman,” Wolfson said. “And in all of my dealings with him he was the epitome of professionalism. He cared so much about his work, and he will be greatly missed.”As president of the Injured Police Officers Fund since January 2004, Erik Lloyd coordinated fundraising efforts for wounded cops and their families, most recently organizing a “Shay Day” for 29-year-old Shay Mikalonis, who was shot June 1 as police took people into custody at the conclusion of a Black Lives Matter Protest on the Las Vegas Strip.“I do not know too many people who could do that for that long,” Huddler said. “But the re is never been any desire to look elsewhere. He puts forth genuine care for the men and women he works with, plus he is good at what he does.”Lloyd joined the force as a patrol officer in September 1990 before he started work as a narcotics detective in 1995. He climbed the ranks to sergeant in 2003 and lieutenant in 2014, when he worked internal affairs and with the Southern Nevada Counterterrorism Center. He had planned to retire in December, said Annette Mullin, the director of the police employee assistance program.“Erik was one of those great leaders,” she said. “We have many on our agency, but he was one of those calm leaders that help you get the job done. And he will be missed. Our hearts break.”Last week, Congress passed a measure known as the Safeguarding America is First Responder is Act that provides benefit to law enforcement and presumes that officers who die or become disabled from COVID-19 or complications related to the virus did so in the line of duty. The results of Lloyd is efforts for wounded and fallen officers are likely to resonate far into the future.“There will be more officers injured, and the groundwork that Erik has laid, they are going to benefit from,” Huddler said. “They will have no idea. But we will know it is because the work Erik has put in. He is just a special guy.”Supervises deadly force examsLloyd also served as the lieutenant over deadly force examinations, leading investigations when someone dies in police custody.“He is the right person for the job because he has to be able to represent the community is interest and still do that in a way where the officers understand that his intent is to get it right,” Huddler said. “There is not anyone who wants police accountability more than police officers. The great thing about Erik is he never takes it personal. He is just very objective about his work, and he is very fact based, and it is refreshing.”Huddler said he had known Lloyd for 18 years, and “I have always looked up to him,” recalling how Lloyd guided him through preparing to test for a promotion. “First and foremost, he is a family man. He loves his family,” Huddler said. “But a close second to that is he loves his community. He truly does represent the best of us. He is a consummate professional. And I have never met a person that does not respect him.”Since the Lloyds were diagnosed with the virus, Kephart said he has received hundreds of messages from concerned friends.“When you get the good ones, and you lose them like this, or for any reason, it is just terrible,” the judge said. “It strikes home. He was a great guy. He is gonna be missed by a lot of people. I do not know if I can get passed the pain and the hurt that it is causing me, and I do not know if I will.”Contact David Ferrara atdferrara@reviewjournal.comor 702-380-1039.

580,How a recent surge in concern about child sex trafficking has links to online conspiracy community QAnon,-9.0,37.5,https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2020/8/12/21353119/conspiracy-theory-qanon-link-connection-child-sex-trafficking-exploitation-social-media-advocacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,22,"SALT LAKE CITY — Advocacy against child sex trafficking has surged in recent weeks with concerned individuals posting hash tags like #savethechildren, sharing images of young girls with their hands tied up captioned, “The real pandemic is child sex trafficking,” and even marching while chanting “Child Lives Matter.”Child exploitation is a widespread problem that has gotten worse during the pandemic, according to Marci Hamilton, founder and legal director ofCHILD USA, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia that is committed to ending child abuse and neglect. She said her organization has “never been busier.”But an online conspiracy theory community called QAnon may be one of the main drivers of this sudden up tick in posts about child trafficking on social media, says Brian Friedberg, senior researcher at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. Freidberg worries that many people posting about the issue online may not be aware that QAnon conspiracy the orists have played a key role in making it go viral at this time. Members of the QAnon community, an unorganized group of individuals who sympathize with posts by an anonymous figure “Q”, believe the unsubstantiated claim that there is a global child trafficking ring run by powerful people in Hollywood and politics who use children as sacrificial objects, either for sadistic pedophilia or to harvest a chemical compound found in blood called adrenochrome, said Friedberg. Other conspiracy the ories pushed by the group touch on issues ranging from politics to science. A common the me is that President Donald Trump is aware of the secret evils in the world and working to fix the m, Friedberg said. The recent wave of advocacy to end child trafficking, involving marches planned around July 30th is World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, presents a more palatable view. But it is all ultimately rooted in QAnon, said Travis View, one of the hosts of a pod cast calledQAnon Anonymous.“The people who bind to the general vague, abstract ‘Save the Children’ message without being aware of its QAnon origins, is a new and interesting phenomenon,” View said. During the pandemic, interest in QAnon has exploded, as people are spending more time on the internet and grappling with overwhelming uncertainty, said View. Research byMarc-André Argentino, a PhD. candidate at Concordia University in Montreal, shows that in the last 22 weeks, the interaction rate on QAnon-related Facebook pages has increased 232%. Google searches, YouTube searches and Twitter posts have all seen massive increases as well. Meanwhile, QAnon rhetoric is seeping into political discourse, View said. Well-known figures from Roseanne Barr toTrumphimself have shared QAnon content. More than a dozen currentRepublican congressional candidates are self-avowed QAnon sympathizers. And while attention to the issue of child trafficking is undoubtedly a positive thing, View and Friedberg worry that certain posts shared by QAnon supporters are meant to recruit people to the conspiratorial belief system. At a time when misinformation, especially about the coronavirus, is rampant, a group like QAnon is particularly dangerous, they said.“This is something QAnon followers often do, they point to the grain of truth within their own theory, the n they extrapolate their entire deranged worldview,” said View. “It is a growing cult-like extremist movement that is roping in a lot of innocent people.”QAnon emerged in October 2017 when the anonymous figure dubbed “Q” posted on the web site 4chan in a thread about the Mueller investigation. Q claimed to have high-level government security clearance and insider information about the imminent arrest of Hillary Clinton, according to Friedberg. Q gained legitimacy, despite the fact that Clinton is arrest never came to pass, and developed a following by frequently posting cryptic messages called “Q drops” for people to decipher. After being kicked off of 4chan, moving to 8chan and finally ending up on a web site called 8kun, Q continues to post. There have been more than 4,000 Q drops since 2017. But to this day, no one knows who Q is. The QAnon community, however, stretches far beyond those who use 8kun, and its philosophies encompass numerous conspiracy the ories without direct links to Q is posts, said James Tabery, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Utah, who has studied conspiracy thinking. Rather, QAnon is a network of people across platforms who sympathize with Q is messages that there the re is a deep-state cabal set on exploiting the good people of the world and undermining Trump is presidency. The “pizzagate” conspiracy acted as a springboard for QAnon, said Tabery. That debunked rumor, which gained steam during the 2016 presidential election, accused Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking Democratic Party officials of operating a child sex-trafficking ring with the cooperation of restaurants like Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria in Washington, DC It culminated in Edgar Maddison Welch, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina, traveling to the restaurant armed with an AR-15 style rifle in an attempt to rescue the alleged child sex slaves. He was arrested after firing three shots, and no one was injured. More recently, the arrest and death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2019 and the arrest of his alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell this year, have stoked the flames of QAnon is belief in a mass network of powerful people participating in a human trafficking scheme, Tabery said. Dozens of women have come forward saying they were sexually abused by Epstein, including many who have said they were underage at the time and were also abused by Epstein is friends. But while QAnon is the ories about international sex trafficking may be mingled with truth, speculation does not stop there. Some sympathizers have pushed unfounded the ories that John F Kennedy is still alive, that Trump planned the Mueller probe in order to mobilize personnel and investigative resources that would uncover Democrats’ wrong-doing, and that figures like Bill Gates and Bill Clinton are responsible for the coronavirus.“Part of what is difficult about trying to characterize QAnon is that it is so amorphous,” said Tabery. “Ask 10 different QAnon sympathizers what they believe, and you will get 10 different answers.”View said that QAnon is more than a single conspiracy, it is an entire belief system or way of thinking that people buy into.“The general principle of QAnon is that whatever the mainstream narrative is, whatever science or the medical authorities is saying, is really a front, and the truth is something worse and more sinister,” View said. Children are more at risk of exploitation than ever before, said Hamilton. That is because they are spending more unstructured time on the Internet since normal schooling and summer activities have been canceled due to the coronavirus, she said.“Children have never been more available to people who prey on them online,” Hamilton said. She declined to comment on QAnon. Sarah Bendtsen, policy counsel for Shared Hope International, which is based in Vancouver Washington and focusses on ending child sex trafficking, said that high-profile criminal cases, like Jeffrey Epstein is, and conspiratorial accusations — like that Wayfair was using overpriced cabinets as a front for selling children — have brought increased public attention to the issue of sex trafficking.“It is kind of a dance between a real present threat and invalid coverage of trafficking, but it is still gone mainstream particularly on social media,” said Bendtsen. “I think it is an unprecedented time of the whole country trying to figure out how to ensure the well-being of children.”While the Wayfair conspiracy originated on Reddit, according toSnopes, QAnon was one of the main amplifiers of the theory, said Friedberg. In general, the QAnon community has capitalized on the growing concern about child trafficking, he said.“All of us can agree, everyone is against sex trafficking,” said Steven Smallpage, assistant professor of political science at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, who is an expert in conspiracy the ories. “The hook is, ‘Given that you think sex trafficking is evil, let is punish the people (allegedly Democrats) who do it.’ That is where QAnon takes the reins.”On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it is awarding more than $35 million in Justice Department grants to organizations that help victims of human trafficking. While the move was widely praised, some people, including Smallpage, see it as a way to distract from domestic problems, including racial tension and the Black Lives Matter movement.“A lot of it just fertile ground for conservative politics to take a very salient, charged, symbolic issue to change the narrative away from the economy, domestic strife and the pandemic,” Smallpage said. Hamilton said it is sad that anyone would use the suffering of children to advance their interests. “Children ca not be protected if what we are doing is obsessing about politics.”Experts agree that the biggest threat QAnon poses is in spreading disinformation, particularly in relation to the coronavirus. According to View, QAnon networks have served as an accelerant for anti-mask and anti-vaccine propaganda. QAnon followers had a “huge hand” in promoting the “Plandemic” documentary, which spread numerous unsupported claims about COVID-19 being a money-making scheme, as well as the America is Frontline Doctors video, in which a physician proclaimed that hydroxy chloroquine is a cure for the coronavirus, View said. Both videos were removed by social media sites including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, but their alleged “censorship” only served to bolster QAnon claims that powers that be are working to hide the truth, according to View.“QAnon is ramping up and exacerbating unbelievable levels of distrust in society. You need to understand QAnon as a symptom of a hyper-partisan, distrustful society. That is what generates something like QAnon, it feeds back and contributes to it,” said Tabery. A recent poll fromGallup and the Knight Foundationshows distrust in media sources is at an all-time high. Even though the FBI has designated QAnon as a source of domestic terrorism, and there have been a handful of instances where QAnon supporters have come into contact with law enforcement (like whenMatthew Wrightfrom Arizona stopped traffic on the Hoover Dam Bridge with an armored truck), Tabery says physical threats posed by QAnon supporters pale in comparison to the dangerous ideas they spread.“We live uncertain times,” he said. “What QAnon specifically does is it really brushes aside any moral ambiguity and it brushes aside any uncertainty, and it makes things very black and white. There is good and there is evil. You are either team Trump and you support his vision, or you are part of the deep state and you are trying to undermine his election.”One of QAnon is catch phrases is, “Where we go one, we go all.” The group looks forward to a day of reckoning where all the world is evil will be exposed, and many experts have likened it to a cult.“It becomes a tribal identity,” said Smallpage. “It no longer really matters who or what Q was in the beginning. It is so far beyond that.”",1,2,Deseret News

Inhis plan for health care, Biden said that he wants to build on the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, which covers access to preventive care and contraceptives. He proposes that ""the public option will cover contraception and a woman is constitutional right to choose.""However, since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has blocked public funding of abortion under Medicaid, except in cases of incest or rape, or if the pregnancy is a danger to the mother is life, according to theKeiser Family Foundation. It is not a federal law, but rather a rule added to the annual Congress spending bill, which is approved every year. According to his plan, Biden supports repealing the amendment. Biden made headlines for dropping his support of the Hyde Amendment last year amid criticism from his Democratic rivals in the primary race. ""If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone is ZIP code,""he sai din June 2019, when he made the change. He added that he had ""no apologies"" for his previous stance. And that is not the first time Biden is stance on abortion has changed over the years—especially during his time in the Senate.pointed out, ""In 1981, he supported a constitutional amendment that would enable states to overturnRoe vs Wade. In his 2007 book,Promises to Keep,he wrote that while he is 'personally opposed to abortion,' he did not feel he had the 'right to impose [his] view on the rest of society.'""In 2006, Biden called himself the ""odd man out"" of his party, because he did not support federal funding for abortion and voted for bans on the procedure later in pregnancy,CNN revealed in a resurfaced video last year.""I do not vote for funding for abortion,"" he said, per CNN. ""I voted against partial birth abortion—to limit it—and I vote for no restrictions on a woman is right to be able to have an abortion under Roe vs Wade. And, so I am—I made everybody angry. I made the right-to-life people angry because I will not support a constitutional amendment or limitations on a woman is right to exercise her constitutional right as defined by Roe vs Wade. And I have made the groups—the women is groups and others—very angry because I will not support public funding and I will not support partial birth abortion.""""As president, Biden will work to codify Roe vs Wade, and his Justice Department will do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate the constitutional right to an abortion, such as so-calledTRAP laws[or targeted restrictions on abortion providers], parental notification requirements, mandatory waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements,"" Biden is plan states. The Supreme Court ruling of Roe vs Wade in 1973 made abortion legal in the USs, but states were still able to place restrictions on the procedure. At this stage,more than 20 state sare poised to ban abortion if Roe vs Wade is overturned. Just this year, states likeFlorida and Mississippihave implemented abortion limitations. The former vice president said that he wants to ""codify"" Roe vs Wade, as it is not included in the Constitution. In an NBC town hall, Biden addressed the possibility of Judge Amy Coney Barrett overturning Roe vs Wade if she is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. ""Number one, we do not know exactly what she will do, although expectation is that she may very well move to [overrule] Roe,"" he said. ""And the only thing, the only responsible response to that would be to pass legislation making Roe the law of the land. That is what I would do.""The former VP made this announcement in his health care plan, citing how the Obama–Biden administration repeatedly ""fought Republican attacks"" on the organization. For example, during Obama is final months in the White House before Trump is swearing in, his administration passed a regulation saying that states with federal funding for family planning ca not discriminate against Planned Parenthood and providers like it. Biden said he will release guidance to keep states from blocking Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, as well as reverse Trump is domestic gag rule. The organization announced its official endorsement of Biden for president in June.""Joe Biden is the only candidate in this race who will stand up for our health and our rights,"" acting president Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement. ""He was instrumental in the creation of the Affordable Care Act, which expanded birth control with no co-pay to 63 million women, and in helping to ensure that sexual and reproductive health care was accessible across the country. He has spoken out for LGBTQ+ rights, and against the systemic racism in this country that is costing Black people their lives. Biden has committed to champion access to sexual and reproductive health care — including access to abortion — and to fight for our communities. When he left the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden had a 100% voting record from Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and has been clear he is ‘100% for sexual and reproductive health.’ And we are going to hold him to that.""Read more of Planned Parenthood is endorsement of Bidenhere. According toThe New York Times, President Trump opposes Roe vs Wade and supports the Hyde Amendment, directly countering his opponent on these issues. The president also wants to restrict access to mifepristone and misoprostol, medications that induce abortions without surgery up to 10 weeks into pregnancy. Biden does not explicitly address medication abortion, but has called the general procedure an “essential health service,” per NYT President-elect Biden also opposes—and plans to reverse—Trump is gag rules that withhold federal funding for family planning for organizations that give abortion referrals.""As we celebrate to day, we are beginning a new chapter: one where we take full control of our bodies, our rights, our democracy, and our futures,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement. ""The work does not end, because our fight to protect and expand health care for millions of Planned Parenthood supporters, patients, and global partners cannot let up for even a moment.

583,"Study: $15 Minimum Wage Would Cause 400,000 New Crimes Per Year",14.5,36.5,https://freebeacon.com/issues/study-15-minimum-wage-would-cause-400000-new-crimes-per-year/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-free-beacon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"A $15 per hour minimum wage would lead to $2.4 billion in property crimes, anew paper released Monday argues. The paper directly contradicts past arguments, most prominently from the Obama-era Council of Economic Advisers, that raising the minimum wage would reduce crime rates. Rather, the authors find, an increase to the minimum wage drives up property crime rates among 16-to-24-year-olds, the group most likely to be working for minimum wage already. Myriad factors determine whether or not people choose to commit crimes,including economic ones. Access to jobs, steady income, and education, can all influence whether or not a person begins a career as a criminal. This has a practical implication for policymakers looking to reduce crime: In addition to expensive interventions like increasing incarceration or the number of cops, enhancing labor market access and outcomes might be an effective approach. This insight is the basis for an argument put forward by the Council of Economic Advisers under the n-President Barack Obama in 2016. As part of a broader overview of economics and the criminal justice system, the CEA conducted a ""back-of-the-envelope"" analysis and concluded that raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would cut the crime rate by 3 to 5 percent—equivalent to 250,000 to 510,000 crimes. However, there is a problem with this approach. Although the minimum wage increases take-home wages for some workers, it also leads to reduced hours and job loss among workers. This is especially true for those whose skill level who puts the market value of their labor below the floor imposed by the minimum wage—a situation which increasingly encourages the replacement of people with robots. These effects, especially when they fall on otherwise low-skill Americans, may actually lead to a net increase in the amount of crime following a minimum wage hike. This could be because a lost job or hours could lead to petty larceny to get by; because the emotional impact of losing a job could be expressed in criminal behavior; or because of lost human-capital benefits thanks to a hike is effect on school enrollment and on-the-job training. The new paper, ""Do Minimum Wage Increases Reduce Crime?"" attempts to quantify the reality of the CEA is claim, and whether or not it is drowned out by adverse effects. The results are not heartening for minimum-wage advocates. The authors, a group of economists, estimate that a minimum wage hike to $12 would result in approximately 231,000 additional property crimes annually, equivalent to costs of $1.3 billion. A $15 minimum wage would result in 410,000 additional property crimes, equivalent to $2.4 billion in costs.""We find little evidence that minimum wage increases affect violent or drug crimes, or net crime among older individuals, but do increase delinquency-related crimes related to teenage idleness,"" the authors write. ""We conclude that increasing the minimum wage will at best be ineffective at deterring crime and at worst will have unintended consequences that increase property crime among young adults.""To reach these conclusions, the paper is authors rely on county-level arrest records from the FBI is Uniform Crime Reporting system. To these records, they add information on minimum wage increases between 1998 and 2016 by county, state, and federal law, in order to exploit the way that the minimum wage has changed in different places at different times. Using these figures and standard statistical methods, the authors estimate the effect of the minimum wage level on the crime rates of 16-to-24 year-olds in each county and year, the group on which changes in the minimum wage has the most impact, and who are most crime-prone. They also compare their results for that age-group against those over 25. The results of their analysis with the UCR indicate that there is a statistically significant effect of a higher minimum wage on increasing property crime arrests, but neither drug nor violent crime arrests. These effects are consistently significant among 16-to-24-year-olds, not among those 25 and over. They are most significant in urban counties (those with 100,000+ population), and do not vary significantly across races. Importantly, most of the crime increase among 16-to-24-year-olds is driven by an increase in petty larceny; the authors find no evidence that minimum wage hikes affect other types of property crimes or any violent crimes. In addition to the UCR, the study uses survey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which tracks the wage levels and criminal behavior of a cohort of respondents surveyed regularly from their adolescence in 1997. Using these data, the authors also identify an increased likelihood of engaging in property crimes among 16-to-24-year-olds affected by the minimum wage. Similar, smaller effects for minimum-wage-exposed people over 25 further reject the CEA is claim that a minimum wage hike will cut crime. Rather, the authors suggest, pushing up the minimum wage encourages the young people most likely to be affected by the hike—through fewer hours and less employment—to opt to engage in petty larceny.""Together, the findings from this study suggest that, in contrast to the CEA claim, higher minimum wages are unlikely to be an effective tool to fight net crime,"" they conclude.

584,The Journalistic Tattletale and Censorship Industry Suffers Several Well-Deserved Blows,16.0,35.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-journalistic-tattletale-and-censorship,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,16,"journalistic “beat” has arisen over the last several years that can best be described as an unholy mix of junior high hall-monitor tattling and Stasi-like citizen surveillance. It is half adolescent and half malevolent. Its primary objectives are control, censorship, and the destruction of reputations for fun and power. Though its epicenter is the largest corporate media outlets, it is the very antithesis of journalism. I havewritten before about one particularly toxic strain of this authoritarian “reporting.” Teams of journalists at three of the most influential corporate media outlets — is “media reporters” (Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy),NBC is “disinformation space unit” (Ben Collins and Brandy Zadrozny), and the tech reporters ofThe New York Times(Mike Isaac, Kevin Roose, Sheera Frenkel) — devote the bulk of their “journalism” to searching for online spaces where they believe speech and conduct rules are being violated, flagging the m, and the n pleading that punitive action be taken (banning, censorship, content regulation, after-school detention). These hall-monitor reporters are a major factor explaining why tech monopolies, which (for reasons of self-interest and ideology) never wanted the responsibility to censor, now do so with abandon and seemingly arbitrary blunt force: they are shamed by the world is loudest media companies when they do not. Just as the NSA is obsessed with ensuring there beno place on earth where humans can communicate free of their spying eyes and ears, these journalistic hall monitors cannot abide the idea that there can be any place on the internet where people are free to speak in ways they do not approve. Like some creepy informant for a state security apparatus, they spend their days trolling the depths of chat rooms and 4Chan bulletin boards and sub-Reddit threads and private communications ap ps to find anyone — influential or obscure — who is saying something they believe should be forbidden, and the n use the corporate megaphones they did not build and could not have built but have been handed in order to silence and destroy anyone who dissents from the orthodoxies of their corporate managers or challenges their information hegemony. Oliver Darcy has built his CNN career by sitting around with Brian Stelterpetulantly pointing to people breaking the rules on social media and demanding tech executives make the rule-breakers disappear. The little crew of tattletale millennia ls assembled by NBC — who refer to their twerp y work with the self-glorifying title of “working in the disinformation space”: as intrepid and hazardous as exposing corruption by repressive regimes or reporting from war zones — spend their dreary days scrolling through 4Chan boards to expose the offensive mem es and bad words used by transgressive adolescents; they the n pat the mselves on the back for confronting dangerous power centers, even when it is nothing more trivial and bullying than do xx ing the identities ofpowerless, obscure citizens. But the worst of this triumvirate is the tech reporters, due to influence and reach if no other reason. When Silicon Valley monopolies,publicly pressured by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other lawmakers, united to remove Parler from the internet, the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked:“Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. That seems problematic.”These examples of journalism being abused to demand censorship of spaces they cannot control are too numerous to comprehensively chronicle. And they are not confined to those three outlets. That far more robust censorship is urgently needed is now a virtual consensus in mainstream corporate journalism: it is an animating cause for them.""Those of us in journalism have to come to terms with the fact that free speech, a principle that we hold sacred, is being weapon i zed against the principles of journalism,""complainedUltimate Establishment Journalism MavenSteve Coll, the Dean of Columbia University is Graduate School of Journalism and a Staff Writer at. ANew YorkerandVoxcontributor who runs a major journalistic list serv appropriately called “Study Hall,” Kyle Chayka, has already begun shaming Substackfor hosting writers he regards as unacceptable (Jesse Singal, Andrew Sullivan, Bari Weiss). A recentGuardianarticlewarnedthat pod casts was one remaining area still insufficiently policed. ProPublicaon Sundaydid the same about Apple, and last month one of its reporters appeared on MSNBCto demand that Apple censor its pod cast content as aggressively as Google is YouTube now censors its video content. Thus do we have the unimaginably warped dynamic in which US journalists are not the defenders of free speech values but the primary crusaders to destroy them. They do it in part for power: to ensure nobody but they can control the flow of information. They do it partly for ideology and out of hubris: the belief that their world view is so indisputably right that all dissent is inherently dangerous “disinformation.” And they do it from petty vindictiveness: they clearly get aroused — find otherwise-elusive purpose — by destroying people is reputations and lives, no matter how powerless. Whatever the motive, corporate media employees whose company title is “journalist” are the primary activists against a free and open internet and the core values of free thought.driving all of this were on full display on Saturday night as the result of a reckless and self-humiliating smear campaign by one of star tech reporters, Taylor Lorenz. She falsely and very publicly accused Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen of having used the “slur” word “retarded” during a discussion about the Reddit/GameStop uprising. Lorenz lied. Andreessen never used that word. And rather than apologize and retract it, she justified her mistake by claiming it was a “male voice” that sounded like his, the n locked her Twitter account as though— rather than the person she falsely maligned — was the victim. But the details of what happened are revealing. The discussion which Lorenz falsely described took place on a relatively new audio app called “Clubhouse,” an invitation-only platform intended to allow for private, free-ranging group conversations. It has become popular among Silicon Valley executives and various media personalities (I was invited onto the app a few months ago but never attended or participated in any discussions). But as noted this week, “as the app has grown, people of more diverse backgrounds have begun to join,” and it “has carved out a niche among Black users, who have innovated new ways for using it.” Its free-speech ethos has also made it increasingly popular in China as a means of avoiding repressive online constraints. These private chats have often been infiltrated by journalists, sometimes by invitation and other times by deceit. These journalists attempt to monitor the discussions and the n publish summaries. Often, the “reporting” consists of out-of-context statements designed to make the participants lookbigoted,insensitive, or otherwise guilty of bad behavior. In other words, journalists, desperate for content, have flagged Clubhouse as a new frontier for their slimy work as voluntary hall monitors and speech police. Fulfilling her ignoble duties the re, Lorenz announced on Twitter that Andreessen had said a bad word. During the discussion of the “Reddit Revolution,” she claimed, he used the word “retarded.” She the n upped her tattling game by not only including this allegation but also the names and photos of those who were in the room at the time — thus exposing those who were guilty of the crime of failing to object to Andreessen is Bad Word:Numerous Clubhouse participants, including Kmele Foster, immediately documented that Lorenz had lied. The moderator of the discussion, Nait Jones,saidthat “Marc never used that word.” What actually happened was that Felicia Horowitz, a different participant in the discussion, had “explained that the Redditors call the mselves ‘retard revolution’” and that was the only mention of that word. Rather than apologizing and retracting, Lorenz thanked Jones for “clarifying,” and the n emphasized how hurtful it is to use that word. She deleted the original tweet without comment, and the n — with the smear fully realized — locked her account. Besides the fact that are porter recklessly tried to destroy someone is reputation, what is wrong with this episode?Everything. The participants in Clubhouse have tried to block these tattletale reporters from eavesdropping on their private conversations precisely because they see the mselves as Stasi agents whose function is to report people for expressing prohibited ideas even in private conservations. As Jones pointedly noted, “this is why people block” journalists: “because of this horseshit dishonesty.”One reporter, Jessica Lessin, recently complained she was blocked by Andreessen from his Clubhouse discussions — as if she has the divine right to monitor people is communications. And Lorenz herself has been obsessed with monitoringClubhouse discussions in general and Andreessen in particular for months, mocking him just last week when she obtained a fake credential to enter:Just take a second to ponder how infantile and despotic, in equal parts, all of this is. Thisreporter used her platform to virtually jump out of her desk to run to the teacher and exclaim:he used the r word!This is what she tried for months to accomplish: to catch people in private communications using words that are prohibited or ideas that are banned to tell on them to the public. That she got it all wrong is arguably the least humiliating and pathetic aspect of all of this. Beyond all this, what if he used the word “retarded”? What would it mean? If someone uses that term maliciously, as a slur against others to mock their intellect, it is certainly reasonable to condemn that. Used with that intent and in that context, it is unnecessarily hurtful for people who suffer diseases of cognitive impairment. But that is not remotely what happened here. Anyone who spent any time at all on the sub-Reddit thread of r/WallStreetBets knows that “retards” was the single most common term used by those who short-squeezed the hedge funds invested in the collapse of GameStop. It is virtually impossible to discuss the ethos of that subculture without using that term. Thiswas one of their most popular battlecries:“We can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent.”And the use of that term in the sub-Reddit was not just ubiquitous but fascinating: layered with multiple levels of irony and self-deprecation. Sociologists could, and should, study how that term was deployed by those Redditors and what role it played in forming the community that enabled them to strike a blow against these hedge funds. It reflected their self-perceived place at the bottom of social hierarchies, expressed the irony that they as unsophisticated investors were defeating self-perceived financial wizards, and marked their culture and community as transgressive. Did some use it with malice? Maybe. But there was vast complexity to it. To declare any discussion of that term off-limits — as Lorenz tried to do — is deeply anti-intellectual. To pretend that there is no difference in the use of that term by the Redditors and its discussion in Clubhouse on the one hand, and its malicious deployment as an insult to the cognitively disabled on the other, is dishonest in the extreme. To publicly tattle on adults who utter the term without any minimal attempt to understand or convey context and intent is malicious, disgusting and sociopathic.the prevailing ethos in corporate journalism. They have insufficient talent or skill, and even less desire, to take on real power centers: the military-industrial complex, the CIA and FBI, the clandestine security state, Wall Street, Silicon Valley monopolies, the corrupted and lying corporate media outlets they serve. So settling on this penny-ante, trivial bullshit — tattling, hall monitoring, speech policing: all in the most anti-intellectual, adolescent and primitive ways — is all they have. It is all they are. It is why they have fully earned the contempt and distrust in which the public holds them. ShareThe same stunted mentality just resulted in the destruction of the career and reputation of Lorenz is far more accomplished colleague, science reporter Donald McNeil. On a 2019 field trip for rich high school kids to Peru, he used the “n-word” after a student asked him whether he thought it was fair that one of her classmates was punished for having used it in a video. McNeil used it not with malice or as a racist insult but to inquire about the facts of the video so he could answer the student is question. Aftersenior editors — including African-American editor-in-chief Dean Baquet — investigated and concluded that “only” a reprimand was appropriate — “it did not appear to me that his intentions were hateful or malicious,” said Baquet — dozens of McNeil is colleagues wrote a furious letter demanding far more severe punishment. “Our community is outraged and in pain,” said the 150 Times employee-signatories, adding: “intent is irrelevant.”Intent is irrelevant when judging how harshly to punish this storied journalist for uttering this word. They got what they wanted. McNeil wrote agrovelling, abject apology, and the n the announced he was gone from his job after forty-five years with the paper, including for COVID reporting over the last year that the paper had submitted for a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Just think about that:New York Timesemployees, who are unionized, demanded that management punish a fellow union member more harshly than management wanted to. In 2002, McNeilwon the 1st place prize from the National Association of Black Journalists for excellence in his reporting on how the AIDS crisis was affecting Africa. Now his forty-five-year career and reputation are destroyed — at the hands of his own colleagues — because “intent is irrelevant” when using off-limit words. The overarching rule of liberal media circles and liberal politics is that you are free to accuse anyone who deviates from liberal orthodoxy of any kind of bigotry that casually crosses your mind — just smear them as a racist, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, etc. without the slightest need for evidence — and it will be regarded as completely acceptable. That is the rubric under which the most famous lawyer of the ACLU, an organization once devoted to rigid precepts of due process, decided on Saturday to brand two of his ideological opponents as “closely aligned with white supremacists.” Fresh off being namedbyMagazine as one of the planet is 100 most influential human beings — this is someone with a great deal of power and influence — trans activist and ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio decided tos pew this extremely grave accusation about JK Rowling and Abigail Shrier, both of whom oppose the inclusion of trans girls in female sports:As I havewritten before, I am not in agreement with those who advocate this absolute ban. I am open to a scientific consensus that develops hormonal and other medicinal protocols for how trans girls and women can fairly compete with CIS women in sporting competitions. But that does not entitle you — especially as an ACLU lawyer — to just go around casually branding people as “closely aligned to white supremacists” who have never remotely demonstrated any such affinity, just because you feel like it, because you crave the power to destroy your adversaries, or are too slothful to engage their actual views. But this is absolutely acceptable behavior in mainstream and liberal circles. I just spent the week being widely branded by these kinds of people as a “misogynist” — someone who— because I criticized and mocked Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez for her scornful rejection of the offer from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to work with her to investigate Robinhood is conduct in the GameStop affair. I particularly critiqued her ludicrous accusation to Cruz that “you almost had me murdered” — a claim that even CNN is “fact-checker” Daniel Dale, who would rather poke out his own eyes than conclude that a popular Democrat has lied —said was without evidence because “Cruz did not advocate violence against Ocasio-Cortez, much less call for her murder.”AOC is a popular and powerful politician, and journalists are allowed to criticize and mock such people. It is our job. Yet for doing mine, I was casually and widely cast as a sexist hater of women (ironically, an old homophobic trope long deployed against gay men) by the likes of Ashley Reese(“just baldly misogynistic”) of(which really ought to just change its name toYou are a Misogynist, since it has no other content) and long-time Media Matters and David Brock smear artistEric Boelhert(“Greenwald is hatred of women knows no bounds”). That I was one of AOC is first and most active supporters back in 2018 when she ran against incumbent Joe Crowley — when people like Reese and Boelhert had not even heard of her — and that I have defended her more times than I can count, while also criticizing her on occasion, obviously goes unmentioned and does not matter (for those asking why I supported her, Iinterviewed AOCduring her primary run and she gave impressive answers now unrecognizable from her politics). My support of AOC in 2018 was simultaneous with my misogynistic support for Cynthia Nixon for New York Governor and Zephyr Teachout for Attorney General. Was my misogyny hidden the n, or did it just recently develop? There is no reason to interrogate any of this. It does not deserve that. There is zero rationality let alone evidence to this tactic. It is just driven by spite and stupidity and vindictiveness. I can ignore these kinds of accusatory smears, or scorn and ridicule them and their practitioners — and I do — because they have no power over me. But consider how many people in journalism or other professions whose positions are less secure are rightly terrorized by these lowlife tactics, intimidated into silence and conformity. They know if they express views these Stasi agents and their bosses dislike, their reputations can be instantly destroyed. So they remain silent or pliant out of necessity. That is the purpose, the function, of these lowly accusatory tactics: to control, to coerce, to dominate, to repress. The people who engage in these character-assassinating, censorship-fostering games — especially those who call the mselves “journalists” — deserve nothing but intense scorn. And those who are free from their influence and power have a particular obligation to heap it on them. Aside from being what it deserves, that scorn is the only way to neutralize this tactic.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald
585,2021 Olympics in Tokyo highlights struggles of Black athletes in white spaces,-16.0,31.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/2021-olympics-tokyo-highlights-struggles-black-athletes-white-spaces-n1274826,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Late in June, amid a series of disappointing headlines aboutBlack women Olympian hopefuls, users of Black Twitter and Black Instagram started to debate whether to watch this year is summer games. The broader question of whether to prioritize structural racial justice at the expense of Black individuals navigating, and possibly dominating and reforming, said structure deserves further investigation. The headlines that spurred the conversation bore similar messages:""Hammer thrower Gwen Berryfaces backlash from conservatives after Olympic trials flag protest""""Black-owned Swim Cap Brand Made For Thicker Hair TypesBarred From Tokyo Olympics""""US sprinter Sha'Carri Richardsonnot named to relay team, will not compete in Tokyo Olympics""""Namibian sprinters banned from Olympicsfor ‘elevated’ testosterone levels""""Brianna McNeal, Olympic 100m hurdles champ,loses appeal of five-year suspension""While those protest calls have waned somewhat, the broader question of whether to prioritize structural racial justice at the expense of Black individuals navigating, and possibly dominating and reforming, said structure deserves further investigation. One question that emerged from the rumblings was: What is the best way to hold the international athletic community accountable for the potential financial and social disempower ment experienced by Berry, Richardson, McNeal, Christine Mboma, Beatrice Masilingi, and pretty much any Black athlete with natural hair?Others were quick to argue that any type of Black protest, especially one involving this year is Black Olympians, would itself disempower the games-bound competitors when they clearly need the support of the Black community now more than ever. Gabby Thomas, the 24-year-old runner who qualified for her first Olympic Games with the second-fastest 200-meter dash time ever (after Florence “Flo-Jo” Griffith Joyner) agreed with this. In a viral tweet that has since been deleted, Thomas wrote, “It hurts to see so many Black people choosing not to watch the Olympics this year. … There are so many Black athletes who have put in YEARS of hard work for this moment — myself included. We want your support.”“I worry some of the anger and disdain may be misplaced,” she continued. “The ‘Olympics’ and those at the IOC have nothing to do with current events taking place.”Thomas’ points reflect the contradictions that further complicate an already complex debate about Black participation in white spaces. Thomas’ latter point seems to refer to the widespread backlash against the anti-doping ruling that dashed the Olympic dreams of the magnetic21-year-old sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson. (Richardson tested positive for THC, the chemical in marijuana, which she admitted smoking to cope with the recent death of her biological mother.)Another contentiousanti-doping-related ruling resulted in a five-year Olympics ban for McNeal, 29, a hurdling gold medalist poised for her second Olympic Games. (Her case centered on a 2020 drug test McNeal claimed she missed while recovering from an abortion.)It can be hard to push institutions to change without turning athletes into collateral damage. Nzingha Prescod, a two-time Olympian and an advocate for racial and social justice on the USA Fencing board of directors, admitted that navigating circumstances like those that led to Richardson is rulings can be “very tough” for athletes.“When your lifestyle is, like, goes one way, when the rules go this way, it is hard to coordinate that sometimes,” she told me during a recent phone call, adding, “And yeah, it is really sad.”But Prescod also said that Richardson and McNeal is cases are high-profile examples of a policy that has affected hundreds of equally hopeful athletes. “It'd be unfair for them to change the rule for Sha’Carri when, you know, so many other athletes have had to lose their shot,” she said. Richardson was not personally discriminated against, whether or not you feel the broader policy was discriminatory. But her case certainly has added to the feeling that Black elite athletes face an uphill battle. On the other hand, as the award-winning sports journalist and author Howard Bryant told me in an email, it can be hard to push institutions to change without turning athletes into collateral damage. This touches on the even trickier complication addressed in Thomas’ first tweet, which is how to protest anti-Black discrimination and biases in spaces and institutions that nonetheless provide financial and social capital to Black individuals. At the center of this debate is the ideal of “the Black athlete,” an individual and — to some — a representative of the Black community. At the center of this debate is the ideal of “the Black athlete,” an individual and — to some — a representative of the Black community. Sub “actor” or “writer” for “athlete” and you will find a similar debate relating to a variety of predominantly white cultural spaces and ceremonies like the Grammys, the Oscars and The Emmys. It is even cropped up in noncompetitive spaces that yield cultural and financial capital, like TikTok. Nuances of this ongoing conundrum can be found in an illuminating discussion started by storyteller and multi hyphenate creatorNaima Cochrane. Respondents noted how tricky it can be to balance the good of the collective and the good of the individual. Athletes (and actors, for that matter) may also feel differently given their own conflicts of interest. Before saying ""We should boycott the Olympics...""There are 60 or more Black people on the US Olympic T&F team. Over 25 women. Some having both their first and last games (like Alyson Felix).4 BM in men is boxing, 3 BW in women is boxing, 1 BW in rugby (!), 2 BW in soccer... This last point raises a critical contradiction between performative (albeit good intentioned) virtue signaling online and direct effective action. In a separate but similar example, I have publicly spoken out about the systemic issues of anti-Black racism throughout media and privately (in those group chats — if you know, you know) called for Black journalists to boycott predominately white publications until these issues are adequately resolved. And yet, I have yet to walk it like I talk it — because I understand where the reach and resources that allow my own reporting and writing on Black communities lie, no matter how unjust that reality is. Working and protesting within the system is easier on the part of my brain that strategizes my future. But it is also taxing on my integrity, my values and my hopes for Black liberation. (For anyone else struggling with this tension, I highly recommend reading Zakiya Dalila Harris’ new novel, “The Other Black Girl.”)“It is sad that people want to boycott because of, you know, structural, structural things that need to change,” Prescod told me during our conversation. “Things need to change, but … I just do not think the answer is boycotting.”So, what should Black athletes do? I do not know what the answer is, but I do know that real change requires deliberate organizing, individual concessions and discomfort, and unwavering solidarity among Black folks.

Apparently, media access was not only extremely limited to a few shouted questions at the beginning, but security the n stepped in to get a little hands y with the press corps. And for the first time during his presidency, they found a reason to somewhat chastise Biden. Here is the harrowing or hilarious account, whichever you prefer.

He did not step in and put a stop to it, likely because he did not know where he was and it was not written for him to doon his notecards. I must say, that is quite the betrayal given how subservient and slavish the press have been over Biden and every aspect of his presidency. This is a news media that literally worships at his feet, spending all week spinning tails about how Biden is going to stand up to Putin and lay down the law. When given the chance to interject on something as simple as not mistreating the press, Biden just laughs at them. Yeah, that is gotta sting. This comes after Biden made the press wait for almost three hours a few days ago to give a 20-minute press conference where he called on pre-selected (likely pre-screened) reporters to field softball questions about Republicans. He has no respect for these reporters, and he is not afraid to let them know it. Of course, I am under no illusions. The press will not learn any lessons here. They will simply say, “Sir, may I have another?” the next time Biden abuses them. They are so ridiculously in the tank that they ca not even muster real criticism in the face of the president kowtowing to Putin is demands, lifting sanctions, and green lighting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Trump was lambasted as a Russian stooge for four years, but Biden is showing that he is truly the one with a soft spot for Putin. Will the press call him on it? Nah, they will not. Instead, we will get more glowing profiles in courage. In the end, I am going to have to go with hilarious in regards to what I feel about this entire drama. The press had a chance to be independent and hold those in power to account. Instead, they bowed at Biden is feet, rushing to do his bidding at every turn. Now, they are getting treated with all the respect they showed their own profession. You hate to see it.",0,0,RedState
587,Group of House Republicans Call on Trump to Veto $1.4 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill,9.33,43.33,https://thenewamerican.com/group-of-house-republicans-call-on-trump-to-veto-1-4-trillion-omnibus-spending-bill/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"A number of House Republicans want President Trump to veto a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill being worked out in Congress, deriding it as an example of Washington “swamp politics.”In a letter signed by 14 of the chamber is Republicans, including Representatives Andy Biggs of Arizona and Chip Roy of Texas, the lawmakers described the measure as a “massive take-it-or-leave-it bill, negotiated behind closed doors, that expands government, spends at record levels well above 2011 base cap levels, and funds unnecessary or even harmful federal programs.”Negotiations are set to continue Thursday as lawmakers attempt to reach an agreement on the massive spending bill and prevent a government shutdown while they simultaneously try to finalize a separate coronavirus stimulus bill.“I am hopeful by tonight … we will have an agreement on the omnibus,”saidHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) on Wednesday, although the day ended without a deal. Sources told Fox News that another interim spending bill may be needed to avoid a shutdown after the Friday deadline, citing unresolved policy issues. There is reportedly a plan to put the $900 billion coronavirus aid package on top of the $1.4 omnibus to create a bill with an approximately $2.3 trillion price tag. Such legislation, however, would be huge and require time on the part of legislators in order to become familiar with the bill. The Republican signatories of the letter worry the omnibus bill will increase the national debt. They blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the proposal “fully funds an agenda rejected by the American people” and stressed the fact that Democrats’ House majority significantly shrunk thanks to November is election. They also pointed to the president is promise in 2018 that he “would never sign another bill like this again” when he signed that year is omnibus spending bill.“This bill promises to be even larger, exemplifying everything that is wrong with the swamp politics of Washington, DC,” the lawmakers said. The Republicans take issue both with the legislation is content and cost, arguing the federal government should work to save money since it is simultaneously passing COVID-19 stimulus. They wrote to President Trump:Supporting this is a vote to fund an education system that is failing to educate our children while teaching them that America is evil, it is a vote to fund grants to states that run a badly broken election system; it is a vote to fund a healthcare system that empowers insurance companies at the expense of hard-working Americans; it is a vote to under fund border security and empower cartels; it is a vote to continue war without so much as a debate much less a vote on a new AUMF for our men and women in uniform; it is a vote to fund Planned Parenthood; and, among many other things, it is a vote to send money to state and local agencies that are perpetuating the shutdowns that are destroying our way of life. Our country will be better off if you veto this omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2021. Is the president willing to go to war over the uni party while he is also in a bitter fight to win a second term despite voter fraud being perpetuated by the failure of many of the nation is institutions — from the courts to state legislators — to perform their constitutional duties?The establishment certainly wants the omnibus and COVID-19 relief bills passed. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said fiscal conservatism should be thrown to the windin light of the pandemic.“The case for fiscal policy right now is very, very strong and I think that is widely understood,” Powell said following a Federal Reserve meeting, adding that “the time to focus on [budgetary concerns] is when the economy is strong, unemployment is low and taxes are pouring in and the re is room to get on a sustainable path because the economy is doing well.”Although the stock market remains at all-time highs, unemployment is expected to grow as state and local governments order new business closures to prevent the spread of coronavirus as the mainstream media stokes fears with fear-mongering stories such as the recent one about a White House security director who allegedly lost his leg due to COVID-19. President Trump has played ball with his own party for years now, but they have repeatedly refused to return the favor. When it comes to this spending monstrosity, fiscal conservatives hope, the president should forget the establishment and stand by his principles.",1,0,The New American

589,Rising Progressive Star John Fetterman Announces Run For US Senate,-6.0,43.0,https://nowthisnews.com/politics/rising-progressive-star-pennsylvania-lt-gov-john-fetterman-announces-2022-run-for-us,https://adfontesmedia.com/nowthis-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-08,16,"Published on 2/8/2021 at 2:53 PMThe Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, who made a national name for himself in 2020 with his forceful — and often amusing — push back against Republicans’ baseless claims of voter fraud, has announced he is running for Senate in 2022. Progressive Democrat John Fetterman, 51, announced Monday that he is officially joining the race for the seat that will be vacated by retiring Republican Senator Pat Toomey. Fetterman previously ran for the Democratic nomination for the same Senate seat in 2016, but lost to candidates with more statewide name recognition — who eventually lost to Toomey. But five years later, he is built a name for himself with his consistent advocacy for issues like Medicare for All, raising the minimum wage, and cannabis legalization, as well as his work as a statewide leader during a critical election cycle. Prior to serving as Lt. Governor, Fetterman served as mayor of Braddock from 2005-2019, a small town in western Pennsylvania that features heavily in his debut campaign video:“The things that I learned, you know, in Braddock, is that every place matters. No place deserves to be written off,” Fetterman says in the video. “These places across Pennsylvania feel left behind, they do not feel part of the conversation. That is why Donald Trump went to these small counties and held these big rallies. Though the self-described democratic socialist disagrees with Trump on just about every policy issue, Fetterman has repeatedly given the former president credit for the crowds he drew in Pennsylvania. Trump won the key swing state over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by about 44,000 votes, while Biden won the state by about 80,000 votes in 2020. Inan interview with NowThison November 23, after Trump had lost Pennsylvania but continued disputing the legitimate election results, Fetterman said if he could talk to Trump, he would tell him:“You did a great job in Pennsylvania.” Trump “barnstormed the state, he understood this is how you win in Pennsylvania … You energize these small counties and his base. And I was impressed,” he said. But he also said it was clear that Trump lost, and he garnered a lot of national media coverage for speaking out against the baseless claims of voter fraud being pushed in and against his state — where Trump is lawyer Rudy Giuliani held his infamous Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference he day media outlets called the race for Biden.“I can be objective about it,” Fetterman said in the November interview. “I might disagree with somebody politically. I can say yeah, he played Pennsylvania as good as he could play it in the last ten days...but he just came up short. At this point, it is time to just hang it up.”In the new campaign video, Fetterman says, “We cannot afford to take any vote for granted, we cannot afford to take any place for granted.”“Talk is cheap,” he adds, summing up his no-nonsense approach to politics which involves speaking very bluntly and honestly. Fetterman is not just a refreshing voice in Democratic politics; he takes the same approach to governing.“I am the only Lieutenant Governor in the history of Pennsylvania to REJECT living in a mansion-with a chef and gardener-that YOU pay for, but@giselefettermanopened up its pool to the children of PA,” Fetterman tweeted, referencing his wife Gisele, and linking to aCNN article from June 2019about the couple opening the pool at their official residence to the public. Rare for someone in his position, Fetterman is also openly proud of that time he broke state and federal law —in order to officiate a same-sex marriage in 2013, which was still illegal in the US at the time. The lieutenant governor faced his own kind of revolt in the Pennsylvania state Senate the day before the deadly US Capitol riot on January 6. State Republican senators voted to remove him from presiding over the session because he was blocking their anti-democratic attempts at control, including their refusal to seat a state Democrat who had legitimately won his election. The incident set a worrying precedent for small d-democratic politics in statehouses across America, and was soon eclipsed on a larger scale by an insurrection over presidential election results at the Capitol, egged on by Trump himself — and some sitting Republican senators. Fetterman promises to be “sedition-free” if elected to the US Senate. A handful of Republicans are also considered as early contenders for the seat,Politico reported.

Former president Barack Obama speaks during a cabinet meeting as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi looks on at the White House in Washington, DC, 2009. (Olivier Douliery / Getty Images)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. When Americans started facing the threat of foreclosure at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Barack Obama campaigned on a promise of a simple, straightforward, and elegant solution: Force big banks to accept some losses and write down the amounts homeowners owed on their mortgages, the reby avoiding mass foreclosures. Soon after winning office, Obama abandoned the pledge to the delight of his Wall Street donors. Now, new data suggests that had Democrats instead used their huge congressional majorities to deliver relief, they could have rescued hundreds of thousands of families who were thrown out of their homes while Obama is administration was bailing out the banks. Separate data, meanwhile, suggests that lessening the blow of the housing crisis on middle-class families may have averted Donald Trump is narrow victory in 2016. The data provides a powerful cautionary tale to President Biden and congressional Democrats as financial analysts have warned of the possibility of a significant increase in foreclosures this year. The new study evaluates so-called mortgage “cramdown,” whereby bankruptcy judges reduce outstanding home-loan debts in order to keep people in their houses. The Supreme Court restricted the procedure in 1993, leaving judges unable to use cram down to reduce middle-class Americans’ debts on their primary residences — even though judges were free to keep using cram down to shield wealthy people is investment properties and vacation homes from creditors. Comparing data from courts that had previously used cram down with courts that did not use cramdown, the analysis from researchers at the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, and PUC Chile finds that cram down “reduces the five-year foreclosure rate by 29 percentage points … stabilizes living arrangements and circumstances of households” and is associated with a reduction in crime rates. In early 2009, Obama is incoming administration pledged to “reduce mortgage payments for economically stressed but responsible homeowners, while also reforming our bankruptcy laws” — and the new administration had recent history as a va lida to r of its pro-cramdown rhetoric. When the federal government extended cram down to rescue family farmers in the 1980s, it had the effect of compelling lenders to preemptively write-down the mortgage principal to avert bankruptcy proceedings, according toFederal Reserve Bank research. But after Wall Street banks thatbankrolledObama is campaign mounted a furious lobbying blitz, the White Housequickly backed down— and Democratic lawmakerssaidObama officials abandoned the effort, dooming it to defeat.“The banks — hard to believe in a time when we are facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created — are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place,”saidIllinois Senator Dick Durbin after af ailed Senate effort to pass cram down in 2009. Ultimately, between 2007 and the end of Obama is first term, banks foreclosed on more than four million households who were unable to use cram down in the same way corporations and wealthy investors can use the provision to shield their own property. Researchers conservatively estimate that cram down may have prevented roughly six hundred thousand foreclosures — and maybe significantly more. Datacompiledby the Center for American Progress suggests that Trump ended up turning the foreclosure disaster into a huge political opportunity for himself, increasing Republican electoral support in areas that were particularly hard hit by the housing crisis.“Larger proportions of underwater homeowners were prominent features of counties where support for the Republican Party increased from 2012 to 2016, compared with where the Democratic Party gained or maintained a foothold in 2016,” CAP is analysis found. “In addition to declines among suburban and rural voters, Democrats experienced shrinking margins of victory in several distressed metropolitan areas. This may have played a role in turning Michigan and Wisconsin from blue to red in (the 2016) presidential election.”During the COVID-19 pandemic,millions of homeowner shave taken advantage of mortgage forbearance programs to put off home payments. Though that has stemmed the tide of foreclosures for now, recent data shows an up tick in new foreclosure proceedings. A recentFederal Reserve analysis estimated “current forbearance programs may prevent about 500,000 foreclosures that otherwise would have occurred” last year — almost exactly the number of foreclosures that the new cram down research said would have been prevented during the last housing meltdown. In response, Democratic lawmakers included what some consider a limited version of cram down in aCOVID-related spending package signed by Trump at the very end of 2020. Theprovisionsallow for more bankruptcy protections and discharged debts even if debtors missed some mortgage payments on a residential home — as long as the missed payments were related to hardship incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, those protections are temporary and end later this year. At the end of 2020, Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced legislation to reinstate cramdown. As a bankruptcy law professor, she was one of the most outspoken voices for the policy. The legislation has not yet been reintroduced in the new Congress.

596,New quarantine rules for teachers could keep Nebraska schools open,2.33,48.0,https://omaha.com/news/local/education/new-quarantine-rules-for-teachers-could-keep-nebraska-schools-open/article_71e3db57-bde1-5b5d-9744-5bede5cbafd9.html#tracking-source=home-trending,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,22,"Parents and students spoke out against a decision from Omaha Public Schools to cancel fall sports. A new Nebraska directed health measure could keep teachers on the job — and schools open — after staff members have a close contact with COVID-19. The new language could be a “game changer” for schools as they attempt to keep their doors open during the pandemic, said Gretna Superintendent Rich Beran. But the state is teachers union says the change to quarantining protocols, which took effect this week, could put teachers at risk. The change allows a teacher to stay in the classroom after a close COVID-19 contact instead of quarantining, as long as the teacher takes certain precautions. A close contact means coming within 6 feet — for at least 10 minutes — of a person who tested positive for COVID-19, had a fever of 100.4 degrees or above, or had sudden onset of a cough or sudden onset of shortness of breath, according to the document. Under the measure, the teacher could remain on the job as long as they have no symptoms, wear a face covering or mask for 14 days, practice social distancing and self-monitor twice daily for fever and other symptoms. The new protocol took effect Tuesday. The guidelines also apply to paraprofessionals and other staffers at schools and educational service units. The prospect of running out of teachers and substitutes remains a concern for school officials. As of last week, for example, the Millard Public Schools reported 216 students and staff members quarantining. Millard Superintendent Jim Sutfin said he is reviewing the implications of the measure for his district.“Specifically, we are working to identify situations and circumstances where this new directive may be of benefit to our staff, students and community while also keeping safety as our primary goal,” he said. Nebraska State Education Association executive director Maddie Fennell said union officials are reviewing the document and intend to come up with guidance to protect the safety of their members and students. Teachers are already overwhelmed teaching during the pandemic, she said.“Now they are basically being told to teach until you become severely ill or you drop,” she said. “We are basically being called essential workers without saying that. But essential workers need to have the appropriate PPE and everything in place.”Not every district has the personal protective equipment on hand, and social distancing practices vary from school to school, she said. She said many teachers have been buying their own protective equipment. Nebraska Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt said the intent is to provide more flexibility to local health departments when deciding to quarantine teachers.“We have a lot of people get quarantined and never come down with anything,” Blomstedt said. He said the change should not force a person to teach if they feel they have been exposed to the disease.“If someone thinks they have really been exposed, and they want to quarantine, it still gives them the flexibility to be able to do that,” Blomstedt said. “But I think we have folks who go, ‘Hey, look, I do not think I was really exposed. I am showing no symptoms. Can I monitor and come back?’ I would hope it would empower the individual as well.”Mass quarantines are a concern because they could cause a school to shut down, despite having no significant spread, he said. Blomstedt said he agrees with union leaders that teachers who teach in person should have protective equipment, such as better quality masks, to ensure their safety. He said he does not know how many of the people who are quarantined for contact eventually get the disease.“I only have anecdotally, where we have been told quite a few times that people are being quarantined out of an abundance of caution, and the n not coming down with anything, and returning after the quarantine time, which creates a kind of mistrust in the quarantine process, too,” he said.

598,"The Unemployment Rate Is Falling, But More People Are Losing Their Jobs Permanently",-6.0,46.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-unemployment-rate-is-falling-but-more-people-are-losing-their-jobs-permanently/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-02,25,"These days, reading the monthly jobs report can feel like opening a time capsule. According to the data for June,which was released to day, the recovery from the COVID-19 recession was still chugging along as of the middle of last month, when the two surveys that form the backbone of the report were conducted. The unemployment rate fell from 13.3 percent in May to 11.1 percent in June, and 4.8 million more people were employed in June than in May Those numbers look promising — but it is important to remember that they are just a snapshot of what the economy looked like in mid-June. And alo th as changed since the n. Most importantly, COVID-19 infections have spiked in states across the country, and many governors have rolled back the phased reopenings that brought many jobless workers back into the labor force. That could have a seismic impact on the sectors of the economy, like leisure and hospitality, that saw the biggest gains in June. Even underneath the surface of the June report, there were signs that the recession is deepening. Crucially, the number of workers who have permanently lost their jobs rose quite a bit — signaling that for an increasing number of Americans, getting back to work will not be an easy matter. And the unemployment rate for white Americans continues to be much lower than the unemployment rate for Black, Hispanic or Asian Americans. That is an important reminder that some workers are continuing to do much better than others as the recovery creaks into gear. If you just focus on the report is headline numbers — the unemployment rate and number of payroll jobs — the country is economic situation was looking up in June. In fact, the drop in the unemployment rate may have been even more dramatic than the to pline number lets on. Over the past few months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been struggling with an issue that is unique to our pandemic-ridden times: A substantial number of workers were reporting that they were absent from their jobs for the entire week referenced in the survey for “other reasons.” That probably meant they were temporarily out of work because of COVID-19 — but they were not counted as unemployed. To be clear: The BLS has been extremely transparent about the presence of this problem, and itdoesnotmean that the numbers were fudged. Our methods for measuring unemployment are simply not designed for a pandemic-induced recession. But it is important to take the misclassification issue into account because if those workers had been included in April, BLS estimates that the unemployment rate would have been about 20 percent; in May, the rate would have been about 16 percent. By June, the BLS reported that it mostly had the misclassification issue under control — which meant the actual unemployment rate declined even more substantially, to around 12 percent. Bear in mind, though, that we still have along way to go before we are anywhere near pre-pandemic levels of unemployment. It is all about your frame of reference: An 11.1 percent unemployment rate is stunningly low compared with where we were in April, when close to 20 percent of the population was unemployed. But it isstill higher than at any point in modern history— including the unemployment rate at the apex of the Great Recession. And there are many reasons to believe that the recovery could stall — or even backslide — in the coming months. One clue is tucked in the June report: Of those who did lose jobs, a larger share of them were permanent than in previous months. In April and May, 88.6 percent of job losses were classified by the BLS as “temporary,” which fit the early the me of this recession: Businesses shut down temporarily to stop the spread of COVID-19 but planned to reopen later as the virus came under control — particularly with the assistance of government loans such as thePaycheck Protection Program, which incentivized small businesses to keep employees on payroll during the closures. But in June, the share of job losses that were temporary fell to 78.6 percent, a sign that a growing number of workers will not have a job waiting for them when the crisis lifts.“As more job losses become permanent, this recession will look more and more like an ordinary recession, where in recent history the recovery has been a slow slog,” said Nick Bunker, the director of economic research for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, a research institute connected to the job-search site Indeed. “That means the hopes of a quick recovery will be slimmer and slimmer.”The fact that some of the industries hit hardest early in the recession made big gains in June is both good and bad news. Leisure and hospitality, which had lost a staggering 8.3 million jobs in March and April, built on its May gains to add 2.1 million more workers in June, an increase of nearly 21 percent month over month. Similarly, retail trade, which lost 2.4 million jobs in March and April, bounced back with about 740,000 new workers in June, a 5.4 percent increase month over month. And education and health services, another of the industries most affected (with 2.8 million total job losses in March and April), added 568,000 jobs in June, for a 2.6 percent gain month over month. Overall, almost every major industry sector of the economy added jobs in June, with total private employment up by 4.3 percent since May However, it is worth noting that despite better-than-expected jobs reports in both May and now June, total private employment is still down 10.2 percent relative to its pre-crisis level in February. Things are looking better, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. And the hammer might fall yet again on sectors like leisure and hospitality, which includes the restaurant industry. Several states allowed restaurant sand evenbarsandcasinosto reopen at partial capacity in May and June — only to abruptly close the ma gain when case counts started to spike. That means that some of the workers who finally got to return to their jobs as servers, bartenders or blackjack dealers might well be unemployed again in the July report. That everything these days is in a state of flux complicates even the most seasoned experts’ ability to read the report. Erica Groshen, who served as BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017, said it is extremely difficult to isolate the impact of the many different forces that are churning underneath the report. “We have got all of these effects that are going at cross-purposes,” she said. “We have the ongoing effects of restrictions in place. We have the effects of some restrictions being lifted. And we have the deepening of the recession itself.” All of that, she said, makes it hard to assess exactly what is happening under the surface — much less what will happen next. And again, the gains have not been equally distributed throughout the population — another the me of this very unequal recession. Although the unemployment rate for women dropped at a faster rate (2.8 percentage points) than for men (1.6) in June, women still had a higher overall unemployment rate than men did. Likewise, the unemployment rate for white Americans dropped by 2.3 percentage points last month, while it only fell by 1.4 percent for Black Americans and 1.2 percentage points for Asian Americans. And at 15.4 percent, Black Americans still have the highest unemployment rate of any racial or ethnic group, 5.3 percentage points higher than their white counterparts. Perhaps one bit of encouraging data in this jobs report was that the unemployment rate for Latino or Hispanic Americans did drop by quite a bit — it was down 3.1 percentage points in June. However, that still left their overall unemployment rate at 14.5 percent, which is not only far higher than it was before the coronavirus recession began (it was 4.4 percent in February) but also higher than the unemployment rates for white (10.1 percent) or Asian (13.8 percent) Americans. Aswe have said oft enduring this crisis, you really need the next jobs report in order to interpret the current one. The June report shows that the unexpected employment gains of May were not a mirage — the economy really did start recovering earlier and more quickly than many economists expected. But next month is report could be a sobering reminder of just how fragile any economic gains are — at least while the virus is still spiraling out of control in many parts of the country. So we will know better by next month whether the concerning trends in this report have deepened, as well as how much the recent COVID-19 outbreaks across the country have hamstrung the nascent recovery. Intypical fashion, our economic data is moving at a much slower pace than the virus, which leaves us guessing at where things might head next.

600,Murders spiked in 2020. Why?,-2.33,45.33,https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/jul/14/murders-spiked-2020-why/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. More InfoThe scene of a deadly shooting in St. Petersburg, Fla., where three people were found dead. (Tampa Bay Times/Martha Asencio Rhine)In America is larger cities, murders rose sharply in 2020. Murders rose most in communities where shootings were already more common and where poverty and unemployment are high. The mix of the pandemic and the police response to racial justice protests may have played a role, but there is not enough hard data yet to prove a link. Readily available guns provided fertile ground for violence, but do not explain the higher 2020 death toll. Completely apart from the bipartisan blame game over crime, there is the stark reality that in most American cities, murders have gone up. One survey of America is larger cities found that between 2019 and 2020, homicide deaths rose more than 30%. An analysis of 34 cities found a ""historic increase.""Some Republicans say rising homicides are due to the ""defund the police"" movement and the failures of Democratic urban leaders. Some Democrats point the finger at the wide availability of guns and Republican resistance to police reform. Those are the talking points. The real causes, experts say, are not so clear. No one debates that last year was unique. There was the pandemic and the havoc it wreaked. There were the racial justice protests and, in some cities, periods of vandalism and looting. What all that has to do with rising homicide rates is what mayors, citizens and criminologists are trying to figure out. There are many possible explanations, but it will be months before we have enough hard data to bring the outlines of the driving forces into sharper relief. In the meantime, the numbers we have show that beneath the national trend lines, the re is wide variation among cities, making it even more difficult to pinpoint causes. Apreliminary FBI crime report for 154 cities shows that murders rose 10% across the group in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. But look closer and you find that the increase was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As far as Ben Frazier can tell, the problem predates 2020. Frazier, an activist in Jacksonville, Fla., heads up the Northside Coalition, a community group focused on stopping the shootings in the handful of neighborhoods where about two-thirds of the city is murders take place. One ZIP code in that area has been dubbed ""the killing fields.""""For us, 2019 was the pivotal year,"" Frazier said. ""I ca not see a difference due to the pandemic. Because what we saw happen in 2020, started before.""In 2019, murders in Jacksonville went up 21%. The following year, 2020, the increase was less than half as much — 8%. Frazier said he is hard pressed to find an explanation that does not include the area is extreme poverty.""Half of the people are living below the federal poverty line,"" Frazier said.""We have double-digit unemployment. The kids walk the streets in roving bands. It is a very disappointing, depressing picture, to see so many young Black men with nothing to do.""And, Frazier said, there was ready access to weapons.""I have nothing to point to as far as statistics, but I can only tell you that there were far too many guns in the hands of people who should not have the m,"" he said. A careful analysis of trends in 34 cities by theCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, lends support to Frazier is broader the mes, but suggests that in many places, the mix of factors was more complicated.""More disadvantaged cities — those with higher poverty and unemployment rates — experienced greater increases in homicide in 2020,"" the report said. Guns have been readily available for some time, the report said, and the re is no clear evidence yet of a shift there that would explain a rise in murders in 2020. The council is study of 34 cities found a 24% increase in homicides in the first quarter of 2021, but it notes that three cities in its sample — New York, Chicago and Los Angeles — accounted for 40% of the increase. With great circumspection, the report is authors concluded that ""while it is impossible to be certain, it is probable that the pandemic, protests, and other factors all combined to create a perfect storm of circumstances pushing homicide rates to record levels.""The hunt for an explanation turns on finding the shifts that incrementally made murder more likely. COVID-19 caused a disproportionate number of deaths in Hispanic and Black communities. TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionnoted the tight association between higher health risks and the markers of economic stress, such as lower incomes and higher unemployment.""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to the mselves.""Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the pandemic-driven economic downturn also mattered.""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlin said. ""Last year we saw both at play.""There are signs that work-at-home policies added to domestic homicides. By one count, shooting deaths related to domestic violence rose 4% in 2020.""Women were stuck at home with abusive spouses,"" McCoy said. But as with homicides in general, trends varied widely from place to place, with some cities seeing decreases, and others reporting spikes in the range of 70% or higher, with no clear explanation for the differences. On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the murder of George Floyd. Going back to the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., there has been a running debate over whether such protests over police violence lead to less policing and more crime. Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah said the confrontations between police and protesters played a role in 2020, because they made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassell said. Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. This line of thinking often melds with accusations that cities cut police budgets in response to protests. That holds little water. Even as local governments struggled to balance their budgets in the midst of the pandemic,police spending went up, sometimes as a fraction of a city is budget, but also in absolute terms. Researchers disagree whether the protests the mselves had any effect in causing police to pull back from everyday enforcement actions. It is too early to know about 2020, but a detailed study of the so-called Ferguson Effectfound no connection between protests, policing and crime. Researchers Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and Joel Wallman at the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation counted arrests to measure police activity, and compared that with homicide rates. If the Ferguson Effect was real, they argued, homicide rates should go up in places where arrest rates went down. They wrote that while the re is ample evidence that targeted policing does reduce crime, ""we have found little evidence that the 2015 rise in big-city homicide rates resulted from declining arrest rates for violent, property, drug, weapon, and minor crimes.""At the same time, Rosenfeld and Wallman said greater mistrust of police might be a key driver. If people of color do not think the police will treat them fairly, having more police might not help. Also, residents might hesitate to call police. Homicides could rise as people take matters into their own hands, they suggested. Firearms are far and away the weapon of choice for murder, and sales of guns are up, so it might seem reasonable to link the two. In his response to rising crime, President Joe Biden focused on cracking down on illegal gun sales. But the re is not a reliable correlation between the legal purchases of guns and increases in homicides. Between 2006 and 2014,gun sales doubled, while the homicide rate fell by 25%. While purchases skyrocketed during the pandemic, criminologist Aaron Chalfin at the University of Pennsylvania told us that guns used in crimes tend to be several years old. A surge in sales in 2020, or even 2019, would not necessarily translate into more killings last year.""Guns and poverty are the conditions that create fertile ground, but they do not really help us out with the ‘why now?’ part of this phenomenon,"" Chalfin said. Still, Chalfin thinks that the combination of the pandemic and racial justice unrest might have increased gun purchases in certain neighborhoods as residents acted to provide their own protection. He thinks it is reasonable to infer that the police pulled back to some extent. The mix might explain the rise in homicides. Except that murders began to rise in January and February, before either the pandemic or the protests started.""There are limits to what we can infer,"" Chalfin said. ""It is really hard to understand the world and all of its variations.""FBI,Quarterly data - Q1 2021, June 21, 2021FBI,Crime data explorer, accessed July 2, 2021FBI,Overview of Preliminary Uniform Crime Report, January–June, 2020, Sept. 15, 2020White House,Remarks by President Biden and Attorney General Garland on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy, June 23. 2021PBS,Frontline: A Handful of States Fueled a National Increase in Domestic Violence Shooting Deaths as COVID-19 Spread, June 2, 2021Criminology and Public Policy,Did de-policing cause the increase in homicide rates?, May 2020FBI,National Instant Criminal Background Check data, accessed July 13, 2021Major Cities Chiefs Association,Violent crime survey: 2020 end of year, February 2021Major Cities Chiefs Association,Violent crime survey: 2021 first quarter comparisons, May 2021Council on Criminal Justice,Pandemic, Social Unrest, and Crime in US Cities 2020 Year-End Update, February 5, 2021Congressional Research Service,Recent Violent Crime Trends in the USs, June 20, 2018Florida Times-Union,Jacksonville shooting victim called ‘innocent’ by mother in FB post, November 25, 2019White House,Remarks by President Biden and Attorney General Garland on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy, June 23. 2021PBS,Frontline: A Handful of States Fueled a National Increase in Domestic Violence Shooting Deaths as COVID-19 Spread, June 2, 2021Criminology and Public Policy,Did de-policing cause the increase in homicide rates?, May 2020FBI,National Instant Criminal Background Check data, accessed July 13, 2021Jacksonville Sheriff is Department,Murder data, accessed July 12, 2021Florida Department of Law Enforcement,UCR Offense Data, accessed July 12, 2021Bloomberg City Lab,Cities Say They Want to Defund the Police.

She is not alone.,-3.33,48.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/britney-spears-reproductive-rights/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-24,25,"When Britney Spears revealed on Wednesday that being under conservatorship had denied her the right to have her IUD removed and have another child, her words set off shockwaves of horrified disbelief.“I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things, and more so,” Spears said in Wednesday is testimony to the judge. But reproductive coercion is hardly unique to Spears: It is a systemic component of an American system, both legal and cultural, that disproportionately impacts women and marginalized communities. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. And while it has a long and tragic history in this country, the practice remains as pressing of an issue in the present, a chilling reminder of the ways reproductive autonomy is seized as collateral to limit the rights of some.“This is shocking to a lot of people. It probably should not be,” said Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University. “Forcible sterilization, whether temporary through the use of long-acting contraception, or permanent through tubal ligation or salpingectomy, is actually quite common in the USs, certainly for those in the disability community.”As recently as September 2020, a whistle blower alerted officials that undocumented immigrants being held at the for-profit Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia were being forcibly sterilized. There, forced hysterectomies were allegedly not only performed without informed consent, but often without even the attempt at consent given the language barrier that existed between those being detained and those responsible for their care. But the practice extends well beyond immigrant detention centers. In the USs, there is no federal oversight or regulation of reproductive health care within the prison and jail system, including for prenatal and postpartum care. Not only are incarcerated pregnant people separated from their newborns anywhere between 24 and 48 hours after giving birth, butin 23 states, there are no laws barring the shackling of inmates during childbirth. Until 2016, no one had even begun collecting data on how many pregnant people are incarcerated in the US, let alone their birth outcomes, including pregnancy-related and infant death. Thereproductive justice movement arose out of the history of reproductive coercion facing Black families and communities of color since the very founding of the USs. Enslaved people were forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. Modern gynecology as we know it was born from medical experiments performed on enslaved people with neither anesthesia nor consent. The federal court opinion in the 1974 case of called out the way that Mexican-American women were being coerced into unwanted sterilizations at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center. Though the ruling was never made public, it resulted in medical consent forms being made available in multiple languages for hospital patients, and in patients under the age of 21 being granted 72 hours to make decisions regarding sterilization procedures.

You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected]. Power imbalances — often rooted in race — continue to play a role in determining who is granted reproductive rights, and to what extent. The same holds true when it comes to people living with disabilities, including those related to mental health. In the 1927 ruling,the Supreme Court decided it was constitutional for the state of Virginia to forcibly sterilize a “feeble minded woman” for the betterment of the “welfare of society.” This standard stood until 1945 is ruling inSkinner vs Oklahoma, where the court determined that any policy of forced sterilization should be subject to the strictest possible scrutiny. Jasmine E Harris, a law professor at the UC Davis School of Law, called the Buck vs Bell case one of power and control, not dissimilar to what is currently playing out with Spears. “What Britney is testimony should make us all do is to stop and say, if you apply an intersectional lens to this … stripping someone of legal capacity is in the state subordination playbook. We have seen this happen with other marginalized communities, but in particular women.”The attention surrounding Spears’ conservatorship case is no doubt influenced by her fame (and wealth, and race). But the public reaction to her reproductive choices being controlled by others speaks to how little is understood about a still relatively common practice. Leah Goodridge, a social justice lawyer who has worked with low-income women, noted the ways in which Spears’ case stands out because of her race.“Britney Spears is a famous woman who is White, with money, and a certain level of privilege that comes along with that, and she is still entangled and the victim of misogyny,” Goodridge said. “So the takeaway also is, ‘Can you imagine for Black and brown women, for women of color who are also facing similar dynamics, but do not have the same privilege?’”Kimberly Mutcherson, co-dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School, said reproductive coercion has been and will continue to be highly gendered in our country “in part because women have the capacity for pregnancy — but also because it is a place where law can continue to regulate the kinds of choices that women get to make about how we get to live our lives.”Spears’ family is famously from Louisiana, where right now94% of counties are without an abortion provider, with 72% of the state is women living in those counties. The state has some of the country is strictest and most aggressive abortion regulations: Shouldbe overturned at any point, abortion would immediately become illegal there. Louisiana still requires that those seeking abortion care receive medically inaccurate but state-mandated counseling 24 hours before any abortion procedure, necessitating two separate in-person trips to the clinic. (Telehealth for abortion care is also banned the re). While Spears is unable to have her unwanted IUD removed, many women in Louisiana struggle to get access to desired contraception, especially long-acting reversible forms like IUDs. According to Power to Decide, the national campaign to prevent unplanned pregnancy,312,390 Louisiana women in need of birth control live in contraceptive deserts, meaning they lack access to a county health center providing the full range of contraceptive choices. An additional8,590 women live in counties without a single health center that provides the full range of options. The self-described trauma faced by Spears is one faced by countless people in the USs, past and present, who find the mselves up against a system where their reproductive choices are determined for them by others based on where they live, their mental health history, immigration status and race. Spears’ story feels so jarring because it shines a light on an American problem not rare, but ubiquitous.“You can really draw this sort of painful time line in this country about how reproduction has been manipulated for populations of people who were thought unworthy of parenting or unworthy of procreation,” Mutcherson said. “And so in that sense, what is going on with Britney Spears, frankly, is not that shocking. Because it is something that law in the USs, in various ways, has allowed for centuries.”",2,2,19th News
602,The disturbing and cruel psychology of Marjorie Taylor Greene,-21.75,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2021/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,25,", the House Republican and subject ofFriday is. I want to discuss her hostile confrontation of David Hogg, the teenager who saw friends and classmates being murdered in the 2018 Parkland massacre. A year later, Greene stalked Hogg while he was walking down a Washington street. She demanded he defend his gun-reform advocacy. She later called him ""a coward"" in the pay of George Soros. She said the ""radical gun control agenda David Hogg was pushing"" made him a ""little Hitler.""Consider what it took for someone to do this. Consider what a grown woman has to do psychologically to look into the eyes of a teenager who witnessed unimaginable suffering, and call him ""a coward."" Most of us possess a sense of empathy. Most of us, even if we are champions of the Second Amendment, could not tolerate knowing that we have compounded a young man is pain. Most of us would recoil instantly. ""Oh my God!"" most of us would say. ""I am so sorry! Go ahead and say whatever you want!""Not so for Marjorie Taylor Greene. Unlike most people who cannot tolerate knowing that they have compounded a young man is pain, Greene was capable of maligning Hogg even after looking him in the eye. She was capable of his pain, the n of adding to it. ""Coward,"" she said. ""Little Hitler,"" she said. Hogg is suffering was not something to recoil from, as it would be for most people with a sense of empathy. It was something arousing such animosity it turned a teenaged boy into Greene is enemy. This is not to say Greene does not have empathy. This is to say she is capable of overriding it. This matters greatly to our national politics. You hear it said frequently the re is so much hate in the world because the re is so little empathy. (This tends to be a liberal view of a problematic, unpredictable, often violent world.) But what if suffering does not arouse empathy? What if, for a lot of Americans, it is not something to ease. It is something to punish. It is something, on, that enrages them more. To understand how this is possible, consider the American tradition of parenting in which violence, neglect, and trauma are ordinary, tolerable, even encouraged. In a bestselling book on ""Biblical"" child-rearing, Larry Christenson wrote in 1970 isthat, ""God holds you accountable for the discipline of your children(his italics). If you discipline and bring up your children according to His Word, you will have His approval and blessing. If you fail to do so, you will incur His wrath.""In 1979, Roy Lessen said in that hitting your kids was God is idea. He ""commanded parents to spank their children asa n expression of love. Spanking is not an option. It is an issue love cannot compromise. The question we face as parents is this: do we love God enough to obey Him, and do we love our children enough to bring into their lives the correction of spanking when it is needed?""For conservative Christians in America, there has been a consensus around cruelty-as-love for the last. ""Fear is as essential to Christian parenting as love,"" wrote the historian Philip Greven in 1990 isSpare the Child, a history of the religious roots of corporal punishment. ""Without fear, they insist, there can be no true love.""This is not isolated to conservative Christians. A 2014 poll found 81 percent of parents thought hitting children was sometimes appropriate. Two thirds had hit their kids at least once. One third never did. Among conservative Christians, the sort who'd vote for Marjorie Taylor Greene, cruelty-as-love is an uncontroversial principle. These people are capable of looking at a sobbing child and offering even more violence. These people are capable of looking at a sobbing child and feeling no emotion but rage. ""Quit your crying,"" I heard sometimes as a child, ""or I will give you something to cry about.""It is a choice that became a tradition that became so ordinary as to be invisible. It is, moreover, the cultural context from which Marjorie Taylor Greene arose. Though shed oes not believeth e Parkland massacre was faked, she nonetheless maintains the lie, because she is exquisitely sensitive to people who believe a sobbing child will manipulate emotions to get what she wants, which is to say, people who believe a traumatized Hogg is trying to manipulate emotions to get what he wants. Both are undeserving of sympathy. Both, as a matter of fact, are deserving of punishment. From that comes pleasure. For you and me, justice would come in the form of commonsense gun laws preventing the kind of death and dying we saw at Parkland, Sandy Hook and other gun massacres. For Greene and her supporters, that is injustice. Justice is seeing people like David Hogg suffering more, even if you have to lie about it, even if you have to say Parkland and Sandy Hook were faked. And in knowing the truth, but choosing to lie anyway, she is elevating mere cruelty to the level of sadism.",0,0,AlterNet

Officials inKansashave decided to drop charges against a university student accused of falsely reportingrape, fearing that prosecuting the individual would discourage sexual assault victims from reporting their attacks in the future. The decision by Douglas County district attorney Charles Branson was announced on Monday, when he said that his office would not pursue three felony counts of making a false report against a University of Kansas student. Mr Branson said that, while his office believes it could win the case, they are hesitant to do so because the “cost to our community and the negative impact on survivors of sexual violence cannot be ignored”, according to the.“We are concerned this case, and the significant amount of misinformation surrounding it, could discourage other survivors from reporting their attack. That is unacceptable,” he said. The case stems from an incident in September 2018, when the woman first spoke to police outside of a Lawrence hospital, where she had gone to undergo a rape examination. AFPAFP/GettyAFP/GettyAFP/GettyAFP/GettyGettyAFP/GettyGettyGettyAFP/GettyAFP/GettyGettyAFP/GettyAFP/GettyAFP/GettyGettyGettyAFP/GettyAFP/GettyGettyGettyGettyGettyGettyShe told police the n that she had been raped by a friend of her ex-boyfriend, but that the details were fuzzy because she was drunk at the time of the attack. The woman the n said that she did not want to press charges, but allowed police to take a look at her phone. After searching through the phone, police interpreted text messages she sent as acknowledging the sex was consensual, according to court records. Mr Branson charged that the rape was fabricated by the woman for revenge, and out of regret. The woman is attorneys have argued in court documents that the police decided to investigate the woman instead of her alleged attacker, and that their client had attempted to make light of the situation in text messages because she had not yet admitted to herself what had happened. They argue that their client woke up in a strange bed with no memory of how she got the re, and that there were unexplained bruises on her legs, neck and arms. The woman is legal fees were covered in part by the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, which was founded by celebrities during the #MeToo movement. Mr Branson has said that he plans to update police guidelines for investigating sexually violent crimes, in order to provide multiple options for “survivors to report crimes on their terms”. A felony false reporting charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 23 months in prison in Kansas. ",2,1,The Independent

In the video, Dartavius Barnes can be heard pleading for officers to return his child is ashes to him, saying, ""Please give me my daughter, put her in my hand.""Police body camera video shows what happened after police discovered the bullet-shaped urn in Barnes' car. Police said Barnes was pulled over for speeding shortly after gunshots were reported in the same area, KUTV reported. Barnes, seen sitting handcuffed in the backseat of a police car, tells the officers the urn contained the remains of his daughter, 2-year-oldTa'Naja Barnes. The little girl was found unresponsive in her Decatur home in 2019. Ta'Naja is mother and her mother is boyfriend were charged with murder in connection to her death. Both were sentenced to prison in Ta'Naja isdeath by neglect and starvation. After he was pulled over, Barnes' lawsuit says police opened the urn without his consent, unsealed it and spilled the ashes out, according to KUTV In the body camera video, an officer asks Barnes if he has anything in the car before Barnes, who initially says no, admits to having marijuana. The officer asks if he can search the vehicle and Barnes is heard saying, ""Yeah, go ahead.""In the video, officers find marijuana as well as the urn before wrapping the urn in a plastic glove. An officer tells Barnes the container tested positive for ecstasy or meth. Barnes appears confused, and an officer unwraps the glove and shows him the urn. Barnes immediately becomes upset, yelling ""No, that is my daughter,"" ""You are being disrespectful, bro"" and begging, ""Can I please have my daughter?"" Ashes can be seen flowing from the urn in the beam of the flashlight the officer is holding. In the footage, as Barnes can be heard continually begging for his daughter, officers discuss Barnes' claim and ultimately come to the conclusion that he is telling the truth. An officer eventually hands the urn over to another man, who questions why they took it. The officer tells the man, ""It looked similar to molly, OK?""Later, in a police car, one officer discusses giving Barnes a notice to appear in court on a marijuana charge.""OK, aside from pissing off dad and testing the dead baby ashes,"" another officer replies. Barnes' lawsuit accuses police of the""desecration"" of his daughter is ashes.

605,Governor Ducey is upset that Biden is a dicator on COVID?

How many kids kept out of classrooms? How many businesses fined? The vaccine is and should be a choice. We must and will push back.”Ducey ... fuming about a “dictatorial approach” on COVID-19?OK, now that is sort a funny. This is a governor who, when the pandemic began, barred cities and counties from mandating masks, until the virus got so out of control across the state that he did a U-turn and let them govern. This is a governor who, as the school year began,dictated to K-12 school districts that they ca not require vaccinations, ca not require masks and ca not even require unvaccinated students to stay home for 10 days, should they be exposed to COVID-19. This is a governor who tried to ban community colleges and the state is three universities from requiring vaccines, testing or masks to slow spread of the virus, though he bungled the order and subsequent law so they are free to ignore him. This is a governor who in August signed an executive order to block Tucsonfrom requiring that its employees get vaccinated or face a five-day suspension and possibly higher health insurance premiums. As a result the city could be facing the loss of $120 million in state shared revenues. This is a governor who last year issued executive order after executive order in the name of protecting public health, requiring businesses to close and later dictating which ones could reopen and how many customers they could serve. He is one of several governors who Biden could have been talking about during his speech to the nation on Thursday, when he mentioned elected leaders who are “actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19.”In Ducey is case, by considering only the freedom of those who refuse to get vaccinated and to heck with the freedom of everyone else who would like to get this nightmare behind us and oh, by the way, protect our children and grandchildren who cannot be vaccinated. Biden is order requiring that federal employees under his jurisdiction get vaccinated is just logical. His mandate that private businesses require either vaccinations or weekly testing for their employees is controversial. I do not know if it will fly constitutionally. But I do know that Ducey is orders blocking schools, cities and counties from taking common sense steps to slow the spread of a highly contagious virus – steps recommended by public health officials up and down the line – is the definition of “big government overreach.”City councils, school boards and a majority of voters across the state, judging byre cent polling, have been chafing under the yoke of Ducey for 18 months. Now he is upset that Biden is dictating orders?Better check around you, governor. Your hypocrisy is showing.",1,1,AZ Central
606,One Texas Woman Describes Her Abortion Hours Before the State is Six-Week Ban Went Into Effect,-11.67,39.33,https://jezebel.com/one-texas-woman-describes-her-abortion-hours-before-the-1847598661,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-01,15,"At midnight in Texas, asix-week abortion ban passed into effect. Though the law is unconstitutional, an insidious legal mechanism made it impossible for reproductive rights groups to preempt in court—and though they asked Supreme Court justices to step in and block the law, the court has so far failed to take any action, allowing the most severe abortion restriction in the country to be enacted. Threatened with ruinous lawsuits from private citizens, who are deputized as the enforcers of the law, abortion providers have been forced to comply. Providers in the state saw as many patients as they could before the law is September 1 cut-off; at Whole Woman is Health, some patients had their abortions in the final minutes before midnight. Jezebel spoke with a 21-year-old woman, Jen*, a sex worker and employee at a Texas donut shop, who learned she was eight weeks pregnant last week. (Jen is a pseudonym Jezebel is using because she fears reprisal from anti-abortion activists.)After being turned away from nearly every abortion clinic in her area—all of which were booked with patients desperate for appointments—Jen finally got through to Houston Women is Clinic, which performed an abortion for her mere hours ahead of Wednesday is deadline. Jen said if the clinic had not had a last-minute opening, she would not have been able to afford to travel out of state, and she was sick with worry that she would have had to continue the pregnancy. Here is her account of her experience in her own words, as told to Jezebel:I started worrying I was pregnant when I missed two of my periods. The first one did not really worry me because I was not really thinking about it. But the n I missed the second one and got really sick, and I thought,. I took a first test and I did not really believe it, but the n when the second one came back positive too I went to the hospital and they confirmed it. They did not really give me much information at the hospital—they just told me I was in the first trimester and said congratulations. I was like,. I guess that is just their normal reaction, but I was not very happy that I was pregnant obviously. That was last Wednesday. I heard about the Texas law in June, but I was not really paying attention to it. When I found out I was pregnant I called my best friend and she was like, “You know they are banning abortion next week.” I was like, “Are you serious?” I did not think the law would go through because it is so ridiculous, in my opinion. Every since I was a teenager—and the n especially when I started doing sex work— I knew that if I got pregnant I would get an abortion. I know Texas is very conservative, and I figured there might be a lot of judgment and it might be a little hard, but I never seriously considered that I would not be able to get an abortion at all. After I got off the phone with my friend I started freaking out. I called pretty much every abortion clinic in my area that I could get to. At first, I called Planned Parenthood because I was not really sure about what other abortion clinics there were. But Planned Parenthood said they were completely booked until next week. I goog led a bunch of clinics and I was also calling every OB/GYN to see if they could prescribe the abortion pill. I was thinking that I was not going to be able to get an abortion, or that I would have to go out of state, and I was really worried and sad and crying. I was calling all of these places and they kept saying no, and a couple of places I calleddid not do abortions at their clinic sand they tried to convince me to come see them so they could talk me into keeping it. I had to leave early from work twice last week—on Sunday and the n on Tuesday—because I was vomiting and I kept getting dizzy and almost passing out. I ended up taking off the rest of the week too. This whole past week I have felt so nauseous every day just thinking about if I had to stay pregnant. It might have been partly morning sickness, but it also was anxiety. I was just sitting in bed watching and sitting with my cat, cuddling her. I was so sad and worried and I could not get out of bed. I was lucky for my friend because she brought me food and tried to cheer me up. Then I finally got through to Houston Women is Clinic, and I got lucky—they had an available appointment on Monday and said I could come back on Tuesday. The first appointment is to see how far along you are and the n the re is a consultation to see if you actually want to do it. After that, you have to w ait 24 hours before you can come back and get the actual procedure. When I went for the consultation they told me I was eight weeks along and they scheduled me for a 10 a.m. appointment for the next day. When I went for my second appointment, there was a protester in the parking lot when I showed up and he ran up to my Uber driver and handed him a card. It was advertising free pregnancy tests, free ultrasounds, and free consultation and the n it had a number to reserve an abortion pill. So they were outside trying to trick women. When I left the clinic there were more protesters outside with signs and stuff. The clinic was packed. There were about 30 to 35 chairs in the clinic, and all of them were full at some point. Some people were standing up waiting and people were also waiting outside and in their cars. Because the clinic overbooked the mselves to fit everyone in, people had to wait a few hours before they could be called to come in for their procedure. They were going full throttle trying to get to everyone. Honestly, I would not have been able to go out of state—even the cost of the actual abortion dented my pocket a lot. The first appointment was $100 and the second one was $500. With my job at the donut shop, that is probably about two paychecks. With sex work, I make a little more, so that is maybe three or four visits. After I scheduled the appointment and I had a couple of people hit me up, thank god, and they wanted some expensive stuff. So I had to get on my shit and do that and make the money because I do not really have savings. It would have been an even bigger financial hit if I had to leave the state because I would not be able to do either one of my jobs. I would have had to go to—gosh, I do not even know which state, and I would have had to miss probably five or six days. Texas is big and I live near the middle of the state, so it would have been very difficult and inconvenient. Plus I probably would have had to wait longer to have the abortion so I could save up. I was really worried I would end up having to have the baby. The procedure was only one to three minutes but they give you a sedative and some antibiotics and pain medication, and the n you have to wait about two and a half hours after that. Then they call your ride and you are out of there. It was my first abortion. My family growing up was very conservative, so obviously I adopted their views. When I got older—13 or 14—I got more into social justice and I started to be a big [abortion rights] supporter. I feel like it is not anyone else is decision but your own. Anti-abortion activists are not the one who is going to have to take care of the baby or give up the baby if you choose adoption. So it is really no one else is business. I am not really in any pain. There is just a little bit of bleeding, but not too much, and cramps on and off, but not severe. I feel a little woozy from the sedative still, but other than that if feel very fine and very happy. I feel so relieved—this is a big weight off my shoulders. I am just so happy I was able to do it the day before the ban and it is so sad that women here are going to have so much trouble now.",1,0,Jezebel
607,Leaked RNC emails prove Republicans always knew Trump was lying about 2020 fraud,-17.33,25.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/leaked-rnc-emails-prove-republicans-always-knew-trump-was-lying-n1273894,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-14,25,"If you are reading this, odds are you have known for a long time that former President Donald Trump is claims of a vast election fraud conspiracy are total fabrications. As is becoming clearer as the months pass, leading Republican Party figures have known the same for just as long. They have either kept quiet about their concerns or been excommunicated from their roles. Instead, the loudest voices in the GOP are the ones who are actively promoting Trump is lies. But even those who are remaining quiet are content to use those lies to further their own agendas. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that one of those GOP leaders, Justin Riemer, was trying to get his colleagues to see sense back in November. Riemer, the Republican National Committee is chief counsel, wrote in an email to a staffer that the RNC should not post Trump is claims about ballot fraud on its social media accounts. And he did not mince words:“What Rudy and Jenna are doing is a joke and they are getting laughed out of court,” Riemer, a longtime Republican lawyer, wrote to Liz Harrington, a former party spokeswoman, on November 28, referring to Trump attorneys Rudolph W Giuliani and Jenna Ellis. “They are misleading millions of people who have wishful thinking that the president is going to somehow win this thing.""Giuliani reportedly tried — and failed — to get Riemer fired after he learned about that email. But if you look at the RNC is position since the n, you can see two things are true. First, that the committee on the whole followed Riemer is advice and has not on the whole claimed that the election was stolen from Trump. And Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel never signed off on the wildest lies Trump put out there and has conceded that President Joe Biden won. Second, the RNC has apparently decided that lying through omission is not a sin. Because while the party is apparatchiks are not touting the big lie directly, they are still backing Trump and using him to strengthen their fundraising efforts. Politico reported in May that the RNC had ""sent 97 em ails mentioning Trump"" to its mailing list since January 6. And it is not condemning candidates who blast out conspiracy the ories or refusing to offer them funding and campaign infrastructure. You can also see it in when the committee chooses to speak out. When Republicans likeRepresentative Liz Cheney of Wyoming try to tell the truth, the RNC is not sticking its neck out to back them up. But the committee is more than happy to spend time, money and effort to defend laws that hinder voting,like the one Georgia has passed— laws that have Trump is lies to thank for their popularity among the GOP base and their swift adoption. Because let is be clear: Riemer disagreed with Giuliani and Ellis only because they went too far. As The Post reported, he was concerned that their antics were damaging a broader GOP campaign to promote ""election integrity"" as an issue. Ahead of the election, the RNC was more than happy to join the Trump campaign is efforts to block mail-in voting during a pandemic because it would help Democrats vote. Those ""millions of people who have wishful thinking"" whom Riemer warned about are still being misled, even if it is not the RNC saying that Trump should be the real president. They are just fans of the people who are. Hayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

608,‘Super-Pollutant’ Emitted by 11 Chinese Chemical Plants Could Equal a Climate Catastrophe,-5.33,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06082020/china-n2o-super-pollutant-nylon-emissions-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,21,"In December 2007, Charles Perilloux, an American chemical engineer, traveled to China to help install inexpensive and game-changing technology at a Chinese chemical plant that was spewing a climate “super-pollutant” into the atmosphere. For years, Chinese companies and government research institutes have had a strong interest in developing their own nitrous oxide abatement catalysts, as a way to reduce costs. The 2014 book published by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection noted that the high cost of foreign catalysts was “the main difficulty” for nitrous oxide emissions reductions. Researchers from Liaoyang urged the company to explore options other than continuing to import expensive catalysts in their 2018 report. A 2015 Chinese patent by Beijing University of Chemical Technology describes a lower cost, domestic catalyst. The catalyst was successfully tested at Shenma is plant, according to a 2016 study published in Industrial Catalysis, an academic journal run by the Northwest Research Institute of Chemical Industry, a government research center in Shaanxi province. The 2016 study, however, suggests that domestic catalysts had yet to see large-scale deployment because of a lack of regulatory requirements.“The technology only remains at the laboratory and pilot stages and industrial use has yet to be developed because N2O emissions are not strictly controlled at present,” the study stated. If Shenma has been using a new, domestic catalyst in its CDM-era reactor, the company still could not be abating all of its emissions. Since Shenma is Clean Development Mechanism project began in 2007, Shenma is adipic acid production capacity has grown nearly ten-fold, with a third of total production occurring at a second, nearby location. It is now the third largest adipic acid producer in China. The reactor installed by Invista would be capable of abating only slightly more than half of the company is total nitrous oxide emissions, Perilloux said. Shenma has, however, begun to capture and purify a “small amount” of its nitrous oxide emissions for reuse in the electronics industry, Duo said. Nitrous oxide is used in semiconductor and LCD display manufacturing. It is also used as an anesthetic—N2O is the “laughing gas” long used by dentists—and as a propellant in foods such as whipped cream. The gas has also grown in popularity as a party drug in China in recent years. But the market for all uses of N2O is limited and represents only a small fraction of the N2O produced as a byproduct of manufacturing adipic acid. Chinese industry news reports anda n environmental assessment by the city of Pingdingshan, show that an outside company began capturing a small fraction of Shenma is nitrous oxide emissions in 2017. Another company broke ground on a second, larger facility in the fall of 2019. Combined, the two facilities will be able to capture as much as 21,000 to ns of nitrous oxide per year, according to publicly available records. This is approximately 16 percent of Shenma is total emissions, based on total production capacity. Shenma Industry Company, a parent company of Henan Shenma Nylon Chemical Company, mentioned these nitrous oxide recovery facilities and the CDM facility in a 2020shareholder report, but did not mention any ongoing abatement using catalysts and chemical reactors. Assuming Shenma uses its nitrous oxide capture facilities at full capacity, and using the most conservative figure for nitrous oxide emissions from the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book, adipic acid plants in China could be emitting the greenhouse gas equivalent of 25.3 million automobiles, more than all cars in California, Beijing and Shanghai combined.‘A Topic Worth Investigating’In December 2018, China submitted an official report on greenhouse gas emissions to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The report,China is “Second Biennial Update Report on Climate Change,” is a high-level country summary that provides a single figure for nitrous oxide emissions from across China is chemical sector in 2014—311,000 to ns, the most recent official statistic available. This has a carbon dioxide equivalent of 92,678,000 to ns and aligns with the projections in the 2014 book by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection that assumed no nitrous oxide abatement from adipic acid manufacturing. The vast majority of those emissions come from adipic acid production, according to the 2014 Ministry of Environmental Protection book. Such a high volume of emissions is “not plausible if these adipic acid plants all run with abatement in place,” saidWilfried Winiwarter, a senior research scholar on greenhouse gases with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, based in Laxenburg, Austria. There could be three reasons why the government figure for nitrous oxide emissions is so high, Winiwarter said. The first possibility is that Chinese officials may have simply calculated nitrous oxide emissions based on adipic acid production volumes rather than checking with plan to perators to see if they abate any of their emissions, Winiwarter said. A second possibility is that adipic acid plants in China are reducing their emissions, but the Chinese government is intentionally failing to acknowledge their efforts, Winiwarter said. Chinese officials may “on purpose act as if these companies run unabated in order to allow them the possibility to at a later stage claim the reductions and get financial benefit for it,” Winiwarter said. Such a case would depend on there being a future international carbon credit trading scheme similar to the CDM that would allow existing adipic acid plants to sell credits. No known mechanism that would allow for such credits is currently being considered, Winiwarter said. The third possibility is that the government figures are correct and “these emissions really happen,” Winiwarter said. Winiwarter and his colleagues at the institute developed a widely used emissions model, the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model, which assumes that 40 percent of adipic acid plants in China abate nitrous oxide. Another prominent emissions inventory, the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research, assumes nearly all nitrous oxide emissions from China is adipic acid plants are abated. But Winiwarter concedes that the assumptions on abatement are speculative.“Adipic acid production and related N2O emissions are a topic worth investigating,” he said. “However, I am a scientist and not a detective. I will not be able to provide ultimate solutions to the issue.”An Opportunity for China on Climate ChangeIn 2016, theChinese government stated that it would ensure nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid production would reach its peak by 2020. However, a2019 report by the World Resources Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC, projects that if nitrous oxide emissions from adipic acid plants in China continue on their current trajectory, an estimate that assumes none of the emissions are abated, they will increase by more than 60 percent in the next decade. It remains to be seen if actual emissions will plateau rather than continue to climb after this year. The World Resources Institute notes, however, that China could go much further, bringing emissions from adipic acid plants to near zero in the next 10 years.“Adipic acid production is highly concentrated and relatively easy to regulate,” the report states. “China can reach a 100 percent installation rate for mitigation systems in adipic acid production by 2030.”The report calculates that the cost of abatement would be $0.12 to $1.35 per to n of carbon dioxide—and even less at plants like Shenma and Liaoyang with existing reactors—making it one of the least expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, building wind turbines or solar power installations to replace coal-fired power plants costs more than $20 per to n of carbon dioxide emissions eliminated by the renewable energy sources. Retrofitting existing coal plants with carbon capture and storage technology would cost more than $80 per metric to n. While costs for nitrous oxide abatement are low, they are not insignificant. Shenma is reactor cost $10 million and had $1.1 million in annual operating and maintenance costs, according to the CDM China has seen a surge in adipic acid production capacity over the past decade, as companies and the local, provincial and national government looked to expand economic development. The build out created overcapacity that severely limited the profitability of adipic acid production. With China is economy slowing down in recent years and as the country begins to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown, additional costs for abatement would be a hard sell for individual companies if the government did not require it. The WRI report comes as China is central government readies its 14th five-year-plan, a blueprint for the country is economy for the next five years. The plan is a document that has historically set ambitious targets for economic activity and, increasingly, for emissions reductions as well. Chinese state media have called the five-year plan “one of the most important documents on the planet” for global sustainability. At the same time, China is also preparing to release its next round of commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, including, perhaps, how to tackle “non-CO2” emissions such as nitrous oxide. China is current Paris commitment and five-year plan focus on carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Ranping Song, the author of the World Resources Institute report, said China should also set its sights on reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gases; pollutants like methane, hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning, and nitrous oxide.“If China is non-CO2 emissions were a country, they would be the 7th largest emitter of total GHGs [greenhouse gases] in the world,” Song wrote i na blog post last September. To have a chance at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, the world is nations must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, Song said. Reducing non-CO2 emissions “offers a range of low cost, feasible technologies that should be deployed,” Song told InsideClimate News. “We think non-CO2 emissions reductions are a good opportunity for China to demonstrate momentum” on climate change. Ending Abatement: ‘Unconscionable’For Perilloux, who licensed the abatement technology to Shenma more than a decade ago, the thought that the plant might have stopped using the device is“unconscionable.”“It is galling to consider that you might have raked in that much money and not have continued to abate at 99 plus percent forever,” he said. Even without the CDM windfall, Perilloux said, continuing to use the abatement technology is the right thing to do. Perrilloux is former employer, Invista, continues to abate roughly 98 percent of its emissions at its last remaining adipic acid plant in Victoria, Texas. The only other remaining adipic acid plant in the US, Ascend Performance Materials’ plant near Pensacola, Florida, abates 75 percent of its emissions. Company officials say they plan to voluntarily increase abatement to more than 95 percent by deploying new controls starting this summer.“The cost of abatingN2O is so cheap, we’d certainly think it is something you ought to do because it just does not cost you much,” Perilloux said. “It was cheap as compared to the negative publicity you might get if you did not do anything.",2,2,Inside Climate News
609,What the megadrought means to the American West,-7.0,44.33,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-the-megadrought-means-to-the-american-west/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"The American West was once seen as a place of endless possibilities: grand vistas, bountiful resources, and cities that somehow grew out of deserts. Now, manifest destiny has become a manifest emergency. A scorching drought made worse by climate change is draining reservoirs at an alarming pace, fueling massive wildfires and deadly heat waves, and withering one of the most important agricultural economies in the country.""I am really concerned, I am really worried,"" said Joe Del Bosque, who has been growing melons and other crops in California is Central Valley since 1985. He is weathered droughts before, but nothing quite like this. He showed correspondent Ben Tracy a field of dirt that he is left fallow – the re is not enough water to plant a crop here this summer. Tracy asked, ""How much of your land have you left unplanted this year?""""About a third,"" he replied. ""That is significant. If that water does not get here, we will start to lose our crops. Some of our crops will probably die.""Del Bosque is water comes from the San Luis Reservoir, which is at just 30% of its capacity. The state has now cut water deliveries to many of its farmers who supply much of the nation is fruits, nuts and vegetables. Del Bosque paid for water he now ca not get. Tracy asked, ""I am sure you talk to your neighbors, to farmers up and down the valley. What are people saying?""""Well, a lot of them are worried, and a lot of them are mad,"" Del Bosque said. ""If we have no water, we ca not farm. If we get no water next year, these trees will not get water. They are gonna die.""This devastating drought is not confined to California; it is impacting nearly all of the West. The red and brown colors on this map are what the government calls ""severe and exceptional drought.""""This drought is really bad; it is one of the worst handful of years since the year 800 AD,"" said Park Williams, a hydro climatologist at UCLA He said this is not just one long, hot dry summer, but what scientists call a ""megadrought.""""This is really the 22nd year of a long drought that began in the year 2000,"" Williams said. He and his colleagues know this from studying the rings on trees, which show how much they grow in any given year. ""The last 22 years actually rank as the driest 22-year period in at least 1,200 years, based on tree ring records,"" Williams said. ""And so, humans now are contending with a water limitation crisis in the West that modern society in this region has not yet had to contend with.""We have long known the limitations of the arid West. In the mid-1800s the US government sent geologist John Wesley Powell to survey the Western US water supply and bring back recommendations. Williams said, ""He warned that the West did not have enough water for a really widespread population. And we kind of bent the rules along the way when we started figuring out how to dam up the Colorado River and divvy it up to the Western states.""Hoover Dam, an engineering marvel, was thought to be a concrete solution. It harnessed the mighty Colorado River, and created Nevada is Lake Mead, still the nation is largest reservoir. This water supply is what made Western cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas possible, and allowed us to create some of the richest farmland in the country. But the predicted water supply from the Colorado River was based on 20 abnormally wet years at the beginning of the last century. Now, 40 million people in seven states depend on it.""We did it. We built it. We have become reliant on it,"" said Pat Mulroy, the former head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. ""So, we have to deal with what we have.""Tracy met Mulroy on the shores of Lake Mead, which has sunk to its lowest level ever. In the year 2000, the water came right up to the top of Hoover Dam. During the megadrought, the lake has dropped more than 140 feet.""When it loses this much water, to me that is an enormous wakeup call,"" Mulroy said. Next month the federal government is expected to make an unprecedented decision: declaring a first-ever shortage on the river, triggering cuts to the water supply in Arizona and Nevada that will cost some farmers 25% of their water.""It is a tipping point,"" Mulroy said. ""It is an existential issue for Arizona, for California, for Nevada. It is a river system and a water supply that cannot fail.""Tracy asked, ""Without this, are places like Phoenix and Las Vegas and Los Angeles possible?""""No, absolutely not. They are not possible. At the end of the day, this is gone, and those cities and that economic base is in dire jeopardy.""What the West needs more than anything is snow. Snowpack in the mountains melts throughout the summer and flows into reservoirs.""In the West, snow is like our battery; it is where we store water,"" said J. T Reager, a water scientist at NASA is Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""Now, we are getting less snow. The snow season is markedly shorter.""""Is this something that is caused by climate change or something that is just made worse by climate change?""""I think it is something that is definitely made worse by climate change,"" Reager said. Climate change is making the West hotter and drier, which means more rain than snow is falling, and much of that is evaporating.""Over the long-term, what we are seeing with our satellite data is a picture of continual drying,"" Reager said. A NASA satellite is documenting the loss of water stored in the mountains, reservoirs, and underground aquifers. ""These are some images that we have taken from the satellite mission from April 2010, 2015 and 2021, showing this steady drying progression of water in the West,"" Reager said.""Given how severe this drought is,"" asked Tracy, ""how long would it take to recover from something like this?""""We would need a solid decade of really wet years, which is probably just not gonna happen,"" he replied. Joe Del Bosque has already let 70 of his farm workers go, and is not sure how long his farm will survive if the drought drags on. Tracy asked, ""If you were starting all over, knowing what you know about this climate now, would you do this?""""I do not know,"" he replied. ""It was like a dream for me to be able to do this. Because I was the son of farm workers. I have a lot of people that depend on me. There is hundreds of people working in the fields, picking melons, that are people just like my ancestors, that came here, worked hard to try to make a living for their kids, so their kids could go to college like I did. And this is gonna end their dream, too.""",2,2,CBS News
610,‘We have to do a little more’: Center steps up to register underserved South Dallas residents for vaccine,0.0,48.0,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2021/01/29/we-can-save-dallas-the-fight-for-the-covid-vaccine-starts-at-this-community-center/,https://adfontesmedia.com/dallas-morning-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-29,25,"Sherri Mixon is used to the fight. A South Dallas native, she has fought for better health care, housing and food in her often neglected part of the city. Now, she is fighting to get her neighbors registered for theCOVID-19 vaccine.“I ca not wait,” Mixon said. “People is lives are at stake.”Get the latest coronavirus and public health updates. Mixon is executive director of the nonprofit TR Hoover Community Development Corp., which serves people in need from its community center. With the help of a few volunteers armed with iPads tethered to an unreliable internet connection, Mixon this week transformed her drive-through food pantry into a makeshift registration hub. Together they signed up dozens of South Dallas residents to get the vaccine. The process of joining Dallas County is waiting list for vaccinations — either online or by phone — has proved difficult to navigate for many of the city is most vulnerable. Mixon, 51, is one of several Black community organizers who pushed the city government earlier this month to step up its involvement in enrolling Black and Hispanic residents. Early and limited data indicated local officials were falling short of their vaccine equity goal. More recent, partly complete data from the state also illustrates wide racial and ethnic gaps in vaccinations. White residents are 28% of Dallas County is population but so far make up 43% of the people inoculated. (About a third who have been vaccinated have not shared their race.)“This is not us placing the blame,” Mixon said. “This is us saying we have to do a little more and in a different way.”The vaccination gap between white city residents and everyone else is a new — but familiar — inequity. To reverse the trend, city and county officials turned their attention to public registration drives in community centers. But political drama ensued. Early efforts to diversify the county is registration list — which multiple inoculation hubs rely on — appeared not to work, according tone w data first reported byThe Dallas Morning News.“We let bureaucracy take hold when we need action,” Mixon said, standing outside her organization is modest community center on Bexar Street. She helped direct traffic and volunteers bouncing between cars. Now, elected officials from all corners of the county are mounting a full-court press. Leaders are urging everyone to sign up for the vaccine — even if they are not in one of the current priority groups. A new call center, staffed by more people, will accommodate people who speak both English and Spanish. Other languages may be added if there is demand. And new software approved by the county will make it easier to register online and manage appointments. The city is also providing staff people and equipment to help set up pop-up registration hubs. Even before the first car pulled into the community center is parking lot Tuesday morning to pick up a bag of fresh vegetables, canned goods and bread, Mixon and her volunteers were trying to solve all the problems their community might face in getting the shot. They set up a generic email account that the center will monitor for people who do not have an email address. Volunteers will follow up with those people by phone. To help overcome transportation issues, they say, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson andCity Council member Adam Bazaldua, who represents the neighborhood, need to pressure DART to provide vouchers. They will ask churches and schools in North Dallas to lend vans. In a perfect world, officials could administer the shots at the center.“This is a life-saving event,” Mixon said. “It is going to take everyone.”While the rate of reported COVID-19 cases in the 75215 ZIP code, where the Hoover community center is located, is among the lowest in the county, it is one of the most unhealthy areas and lacks the sort of infrastructure many in North Texas take for granted. The neighborhood — which is 68% Black and 21% Hispanic — lacks a major grocery store. Residents rely on food lines like the one at the Hoover community center. They carpool to grocery stores in North Texas, Mixon said. With a shortage of jobs that pay well, the average household income is $30,865, two-fifths of the average for North Texas. Last fall,the Hoover center co-hosted a virtual job fair with the State Fair of Texas. Health care here is scarce:The life expectancy for a Black man who lives in 75215 is just 66, the lowest in the county. One of the very first projects Mixon is nonprofit undertook in the 1990s was a health fair. It grew to 600 people annually, Mixon said, until she canceled last year is event because of the coronavirus pandemic. She is trying to figure out how to pull one off this year. Until the n, she and other South Dallas residents have a new injustice to reverse.“It is not a new fight for us,” she said. “It is what this community has always had to do.”A little after 10 a.m., Sallie Johnson, 73, was one of the first neighbors to pull up. And she was happy for the registration help. She had tried on her own but had not gotten very far.“I am not very good at computers,” she said. It was a familiar the me among the mostly older population that rolled through the pantry line — if they even knew they could sign up online. Technology and internet access is terrible in the neighborhood — if it exists at all. Politicians should have known that before relying too heavily on the internet, said Edward Rincón, a Dallas-based marketing analyst. According to his mapping research, less than a third of residents in southern and northwest Dallas completed the census questionnaire online.“The politicians seem so surprised to see interest in the vaccine from these communities,” he said. “Of course there is — this is life and death. The problem has been the online vehicle for public awareness, registration and distribution.”In one of the first attempts to help those without internet or computer skills register for the vaccine, the county set up a hotline. A handful of the people in line Tuesday said they had tried calling but could not get through. Others said they had resisted because they ca not stand in long lines. It was easier for them to avoid the virus by staying home. Several in the drive-through asked about the shots’ side effects, which are minor and rare. Richard McKinney, 56, said he had just beaten a nasty case of COVID-19 and had stepped out of his house for the first time on New Year is Day after weeks of isolation.“I have got my reservation about the vaccine. My doctor said I should consider getting it,” he said.“All medicine you take has — what you call it, baby?” he asked, turning to his wife, Marquette, 55, in the passenger seat of their truck.“Side effects,” she said.“Yeah, side effects.”Public health experts say it is this type of event, coupled with a consistent and fact-based message about the vaccine, that will ensure equity. Most governments have failed so far at distributing the vaccine equitably, said Dr. Jamboor Vishwanatha, director of the Texas Center for Health Disparities in Fort Worth.“If the vaccine delivery is dependent on the health care system, you are leaving out the population who do not have insurance and who do not see a health care provider,” he said. A fleet of mobile vaccination teams and clinics that can offer shots in the evening and on weekends will be critical to reaching everyone, he said. “Something outside the box would definitely be helpful.”On Wednesday, the state announced a pilot mobile vaccination program staffed by the Texas National Guard. It will focus first on five rural counties. Dr. Michael LeNoir, a Dallas native and former president of the National Medical Association, said governments must work toward the goal of vaccinating Black and Hispanic communities. That starts with communicating about the virus, the vaccine and how to access it. Officials have to overcome decades of distrust of the health care system among Black and Hispanic people. And they are starting with a major strategic disadvantage. In any other public health emergency, governments could count on Black churches and other faith communities to get the word out, LeNoir said. But now many churches are shuttered or virtual only because of the coronavirus.“We do not have established lines of communication,” LeNoir said. “There needs to be a different way to communicate.”The registration event at Mixon is nonprofit was not without hiccups. Cars backed up as volunteers fought for a wireless signal, eventually turning to their own phones for hot spots. No one on site — except a photographer forThe Dallas Morning News— could translate for the few Spanish speakers who showed up. But by noon, as the line thinned out, Mixon was satisfied. Once again, South Dallas residents had taken care of their own. Two days later, Mixon learned the city would recognize her enrollment efforts and designate her nonprofit as an official city registration site. As the news spread, her phone buzzed with volunteers and offers for help. She is going to need it, she said, as the pandemic continues to advance.“This virus is not going away very soon,” she said. “If everyone helps, we can save Dallas.”___To receive a vaccine at a state vaccine hub in Dallas County, you must have an appointment.

611,Meet the Chinese Animated ‘Mulan’ Flipping the Script on Disney is Film,-0.33,40.0,https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mulan-disney-gold-valley-china-1234788906,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-02,21,"Chinese audiencesdid not fall in love with Disney is live-action “Mulan,”but a Chinese firm is betting that its own retelling of the famous ballad may storm the box office in its stead with depictions of traditional values that better appeal to mainland viewers. Gold Valley Film is set to release its feature animation “Kung FuMulan” over the National Day holiday from October 3, where it will compete with fellow animation “Jiang Ziya: Legend of Deification,” patriotic “My People, My Homeland” and the volleyball drama “Leap.”“WhenDisney is animated ‘Mulan’ came out in 1998 and global audiences thought it was a great story, Chinese people were really happily surprised. But many of us also felt that the character you see in that story is more of an American girl than a Chinese girl,” explained Karen Luo, executive producer and head of international operations at Gold Valley. “We wanted to make a story that was more suitable to Chinese aesthetic tastes and forms of expression. Although our budget is nowhere near the ballpark of Disney is new ‘Mulan,’ we have great confidence.”Indeed, the re is no budgetary comparison. Disney is “Mulan” is the most expensive film ever directed by a woman at a cost of some $200 million. Meanwhile, Gold Valley made “Kung Fu Mulan” for just $15 million — budgetary restrictions that are sometimes apparent in the film is crude video game-esque aesthetic. Yet 180,000 people have clicked that they “want to watch” it on the Maoyan ticketing app, a key metric used by cinemas and distributors to gauge audience interest. Disney is “Mulan” came in only slightly ahead, with 216,000 clicks. Typically, a tally above 100,000 marks that a film has commercial legs. But whether or not the film becomes a hit, the creators’ views on the project illuminate the style of patriotism being encouraged in Chinese storytelling and on full display in this year is biggest films. It also highlights why many young, proudly nationalistic Chinese viewers felt that Disney is new “Mulan” did not quite hit home. Gold Valley is retelling skips Mulan is origin story and fast forwards to her life as a soldier. There is no explicit “qi” here — the Star Wars-like force that gives her uncanny fighting powers in Disney is version — but this Mulan is also especially gifted in martial arts, and thus tasked with particularly difficult missions no one else can accomplish, like an assassination. She faces a dilemma, however, when her romantic feelings for an opponent get in the way of her duty to her country. It might surprise foreigners to hear that Luo is team sought to highlight Mulan is individuality above all, going against the stereotype thatChinaonly values the collective. “In many versions, Mulan is slogan is ‘I will bring honor to my family,’ but we wanted to explore what she herself wants beyond that sense of responsibility,” Luo said. “Young people here today really value individuality, so we emphasized that.”Speaking to be fore the Disney live-action film is global debut, Gold Valley COO Allen Tsang elaborated on this point, saying that it is outdated to think young Chinese would be attracted toold-school rhetoric about “duty” and “honor.”“Americans feel that we want to see the most traditional version of ‘Mulan,’ but when you look at [recent blockbuster animations] ’Nezha’ or ‘Monkey King: Hero is Back,’ it is clear that what we want is to update old stories and connect them more to what is contemporary and the modern lives of young people.”Tsang points out that in “Nezha,” last summer is breakout animated hit that earned $720 million to become China is second highest-grossing film of all time, the main character is a traditional personage from Chinese folklore, but his slogan is the very modern pronouncement: “I choose my own life; it is not up to f ate.”Gold Valley is “Mulan” also seeks to highlight the heroine is feeling of “jiaguo qinghuai,” or patriotic “pride in one is homeland” — a key catchphrase of the National Day holiday and the new breed of nationalistic blockbusters emerging in China.“It is not so different from what drives American superheroes who fight space invaders or supernatural beings, but really just want to protect their home and country,” says Tsang, explaining the concept. “Jiaguo qinghuai,” however, is a bit more nuanced, as it stems from the Confucian idea that there are parallel relationships between a person and their family and a family and the state, encouraging a sort of voluntary, patriotic self-sacrifice. Unsurprisingly, the term has appeared in several government reports on the country is response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And so Gold Valley is Mulan differs from her Hollywood counterpart because she expresses her individuality by choosing to put her country first, Luo said. “For Americans, what you want to do is just a question of your own desires. But in China, it is not the case — what you want to do is tied up into your responsibilities to others and your pride in your homeland.”Established in 2013, Gold Valley made its first feature film in 2014. It now has a team of 220 or so employees in Guangzhou and, since 2017, nearly 20 in Los Angeles, working primarily on early stage project development, sales and international distribution. Around 70% of its business is with China, and 30% with overseas partners. Unusually for China, where animation talent remains young and under-trained, the firm has produced all but its first feature film in-house. Its most successful venture was the 2018 film “Cinderella and the Secret Prince,” which sold to 80 countries and hit cinemas in a portion of the m, grossing $11.9 million worldwide. While other Chinese entertainment firms resorted to layoffs, Gold Valley has been hiring through the pandemic. The ambition is to churn out four films annually over the next three years. At the moment, it typically makes two. Currently, another smaller scale project is finishing production in October, while a third is set to begin soon and finish in June.“Kung Fu Mulan” is the company is sixth feature. Its script passed Chinese censorship approval in 2015 and it is been in production since that time. Gold Valley did not intend for its version to go nearly head-to-head with Disney is film, but when the pandemic pushed back both release dates, it became the reality. Tsang spoke to the challenges of creating an animation company in China with the capacity to churn out such projects.“Animation education in China is not particularly well-rounded or developed,” he said. To create their own pipeline of fresh talent, Gold Valley brings in teams of animation students from the nearby Guangzhou University of Technology and, strangely, the South China Agricultural University to work as interns who are the n hired upon graduation — which presumably also helps keep production costs down.“We found lots of teachers in Los Angeles to teach us over Skype. For this, we are quite grateful to Hollywood artists, many of whom came from Disney or Dreamworks,” explained Tsang. To get their introverted animators to break out of their shell, the company even hired acting teachers and required employees to act out their own sequences daily to improve their artistry. “In China, the re is no acting component to an animation education — kids only face the computer. This can make things very hard,” said Tsang. The October 3 debut of the company is most ambitious project yet will be a test of whether it is all paid off — and whether Gold Valley has managed to capture and deploy a bit of that Disney magic for the mselves.",1,1,Variety

613,Why Did the Police Shoot Matthew Zadok Williams?,-6.33,41.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/why-did-the-police-shoot-matthew-zadok-williams,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-06,25,"On the afternoon of April 13th, around two o’clock, Hahnah Williams, a lawyer in Atlanta, received a call from her twelve-year-old niece, who told her to come to her mother is house right away. Hahnah could hear her mom, Chris Ann Lewis, crying in the background. The phone rang again a few minutes later, as Hahnah was putting on her shoes; it was an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. He said that Hahnah is younger brother, Matthew Zadok Williams, a self-taught investor in his thirties who lived alone and went by his middle name, had died the day before in “an officer-involved shooting.” “I thought, How?” Hahnah recalled later. “He does not leave the house!” Zadok preferred solitude and rarely went anywhere. When she arrived at her mother is house, the agent was there. Hahnah asked him where the shooting happened, and he gave her the address. “He lives the re!” she exclaimed. “Did they just come and hunt him?” she recalls thinking. The DeKalb County Police Department had issued a statement about the shooting that morning, though it did not mention Zadok by name. The statement reported that a man “aggressively wielding a knife” had “lunged at officers with the knife causing one of them to discharge their firearm” and the n had “fled into a vacant residence.” He had, according to the statement, come back out and lunged at officers with the knife, again “causing an officer to discharge his firearm,” and the n gone “back into the residence.”In body-camera footage from the shooting, an officer says, “We are here to help you,” before he fires toward the door from close range. Hahnah did not stay long at her mother is place. She and her mom got in the car and headed to Zadok is house, a townhome-style duplex in a wooded subdivision near a highway, about fifteen minutes from Chris Ann is house. On the way, Hahnah got another call, from an investigator with the DeKalb County medical examiner is office. She put him on speakerphone, and he summarized the version of events he’d been given. The officers were responding to a 911 call, he told them. At one point, he said that “there was not anything spectacular that happened” to Zadok.“Sir, wait a minute, do not be disrespectful,” Hahnah said. “Something spectacularhappen. My brother got killed.” She added, “He owns that apartment. He was in his own home when they killed him.”“OK,” he said. “I apologize.”Hahnah pressed him for details, but he could not answer her questions, and he gave her the number for the homicide unit. Before the call ended, Chris Ann said, “I want you to know my son was a good person. Never been in trouble. He owned his home outright. Rehabbed it. The house next to him is abandoned. They probably went to the wrong door.” She went on, “My son is saved. I got a good son. He is never been in trouble. Ever. He helped his sisters get through law school, medical school. He helped me—I was an RN—he helped me to retire.” She repeated, “He was a good son.”The idea that Zadok would pull a knife on anyone made no sense to his family. He was the youngest child, and the only boy, in a family of six children. Zadok is an Old Testament name meaning righteous; his family also called him Pure of Heart, because he always seemed to assume the best in people. Hahnah could not recall a single heated argument with him and told me that he’d never been in a fight, as far as she knew. Once, at Six Flags, when Zadok was a teen-ager, a security guard pulled him out of a line and frisked him as white boys his age filed past, she said. “We were so mad,” Hahnah told me. “But he said, ‘They do this randomly.’ He tried to convince us that it had nothing to do with race.”Hahnah is sisters include a nurse, a general contractor, a doctor, and a specialist in risk management, but Hahnah believed that Zadok was the smartest of all of them. He’d started a computer-repair business at thirteen. He drifted out of high school, eventually earning a GE D. at his mother is insistence. He rarely bothered storing numbers in his phone, Hahnah said; he preferred to memorize them. He bought his house, in a complex called the Terraces, in a working-class corner of DeKalb County, for less than fifteen thousand dollars, after the 2008 financial collapse. The complex was not well maintained, but Zadok was proud of his place, which is where he spent basically all of his time—day-trading, listening to gospel music, reading about finance. “He was almost out of touch with reality, he was so focussed on the cyberworld,” Farah Bryant, his longtime girlfriend, told me. She and Zadok spoke four or five times a week for years, she said, even after breaking up, and she still imagined marrying him someday. He did well enough to buy another home, where one of his sisters has lived since being diagnosed with cancer a decade ago. For years, his sisters and mother would check in on him and bring him groceries when he asked. In 2018, he told his family that a gun was put to his head at a nearby convenience store; he stopped going to convenience stores. “His house was his sanctuary,” Hahnah told me. “His safe place. There was nothing we could do to make him leave. He was quarantined before we were all under quarantine.”After the pandemicbegan, he spent even more time alone. But, on calls and in texts, he seemed like himself to his sisters and his mom. He talked about wanting to have kids one day, and about the most humane ways to deal with household pests. “Rodents and all beings should be treated equally,” he text ed them in March. Later that month, Zadok invited Hahnah inside on one of her visits, which was unusual. He gave her advice on how to improve her law firm is ranking in Internet searches, and asked her to recommend a plumber. She was careful not to wear out her welcome, she told me, hoping that he’d invite her in again on the next visit. On April 11th, she brought groceries, including some surprise fried chicken. “He smelled it and gave me the biggest smile,” she said. “And, for the first time in a long time, he hugged me.” She was vaccinated, but he was not; worried about infecting him, she pulled away. Later, she recalled that Zadok had been talking “a little slow” that morning. “I thought, Maybe he just woke up. Maybe I caught him off-guard.”Late on the afternoon of April 13th, Hahnah and her mother joined other members of the family at the Terraces. Inside Zadok is home, they saw blood on the floor and walls. They also noticed what looked like marks from a knife on the door handle. The condo attached to Zadok is was being renovated by its owner, Jeffrey Dotson, who usually rented it out—it was unoccupied, and the family suspected that this was the vacant residence the police had mentioned in their initial statement, which informed early news reports of the incident. Dotson told me that, in early March, Zadok had called him to let him know about a leak in his place that could be damaging Dotson is side, and offered to pay for any damages. “He was very proactive,” Dotson said. “A good neighbor.”The family walked around the complex, asking neighbors what they had heard and seen. Among the people they spoke to was Jason Neal, who later told Channel 2 News in Atlanta what he’d told the Williams family, that he’d seen “a young man running from the police” who had “jumped on the rooftop, kicked in a window” and the n jumped through it. Other neighbors told the Williams family that they’d seen a man with a bucket, but no knife. Zadok is sisters had seen him with his bucket before, dealing with some kind of plumbing issue in the crawl space beneath the house. Neighbors also said that a long time passed before anyone helped Zadok. “When we interviewed witnesses,” Hahnah said, “they told us that EM S. did not enter the house until over an hour after the shooting.”That evening, one of Zadok is sisters posted a video onInstagram. The family was huddled around Chris Ann as she spoke. “My son was murdered last night by DeKalb County police,” she begins. She says that she has talked to witnesses, and calls it a case of mistaken identity. “My son happened to turn the corner with a bucket in his hand and the police started shooting at him and he ran,” she says. A state legislator named Renitta Shannon, who represents part of DeKalb County, reached out to Hahnah and offered to help. The family also sent e-mails and made phone calls to news outlets, asking them to correct the narrative of Zadok is story and to demand that DeKalb County release body-camera footage taken by the police who shot him. The next day, the Atlantaran its second story about the incident, this time including comments from Hahnah and from the family is attorney, Mawuli Davis. Channel 2 sent an open-records request for the body-camera footage that evening, and the following day, the station received approximately three and a half hours of footage from cameras worn by the first two responding officers. The department was not obligated to release the footage, per the Georgia Open Records Act—a spokesperson told me that the department had done so in part to counter “inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading eyewitness accounts” of the incident, specifically citing the family is Instagram video and the secondJournal-Constitutionstory. The Williams family went to watch the footage at department headquarters about an hour after the footage was released to Channel 2, which the n aired it on the news that evening. The person who called 911, a young Black woman, had told dispatchers about “a very suspicious man who is been lurking around the woods around my house” and the n had called back, twenty minutes later, saying that the man had a knife. The knife was visible in the footage: it had a long blue blade and a short handle. Zadok did not appear to respond verbally when the officer addressed him on his porch or as he descended his stairs, at the officer is insistence, which seemed strange to his family. He’d the n run, briefly, with the knife in his hand, in the direction of the retreating officer, who tripped and fell and the n circled back toward the house—along with Zadok, who fell toward him. Zadok had clearly spooked the officer, but the family was not convinced that he had meant to attack him. Zadok quickly retreated under his house, and spent the vast majority of the encounter on the defensive, behind a door, pleading with officers who did not believe that he was inside his own home. Davis said that the family was grateful to the police for releasing the video, and that it “changes the narrative” they had pieced together about what had happened. “They acknowledge that what they saw was their brother, their loved one, having a mental-health crisis that they had never seen before,” he said. Channel 2 aired similar comments in a follow-up story. Davis told the station that he believed the officers “acted in self-preservation mode” when they encountered Zadok outside his home, but that they should have called in standoff negotiators once he had gone inside. In its segment, Channel 2 twice played a clip of the moment when Zadok appeared to run toward the officer, and included audio of one officer saying, “Please, sir. I am begging you. You are a Black man. I am a Black man. You do not have to die today. I do not want you to die today.” The story ended with Hahnah thanking the department for releasing the footage. The story did not address one of the family is lingering questions: Why had the officers left Zadok inside after firing their weapons, without rendering aid, for nearly two hours, until medical personnel were allowed in? Davis had hired a pathologist named Jackson Gates, who had examined the victims of other police shootings, to make a preliminary determination about the cause of death. Later that week, the family organized a press conference so that Gates could share his findings, and the family and Renitta Shannon could call for justice and transparency. Atthe event, on April 20th, Gates said that he believed that prompt medical aid would likely have saved Zadok is life. Zadok appeared to have died from “a slow hemorrhage,” he said, caused by a gunshot wound to his shoulder. The shot seemed to have been fired down on Zadok, as he knelt on the floor behind an ottoman. Later that day, the former police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murderingGeorge Floyd, in Minneapolis. The Williams family had been following the trial closely. They knew that the initial police statement in that case reported that Floyd had “physically resisted officers” and “appeared to be suffering medical distress,” and did not mention Chauvin is lethal use of force on Floyd is neck. Shannon told me that, five years ago, when she canvassed what would eventually become her district, its residents, the majority of whom are Black, described frustration with the police. “I had eighty-year-old Black grandmothers say they see crime happening in their neighborhoods all the time, but they do not want to call police because they do not want a young Black man to end up dead in their front yard,” she said. Shannon underlined that there are other Black men who have been killed by police in DeKalb County that few have heard about. “You have some cases that make national news,” she said. “But the n you have other cases that the community knows about and works on. There is so many cases that just never make it to headlines.”In early May, I visited the Terraces with Hahnah and her family. She had Zadok is ottoman, which he’d used to shield himself from bullets, in the back of her BMW Chris Ann had been making visits to the house every other day. She told me the story of giving birth to Zadok in a Gary, Indiana, hospital where she was working at the time, in front of a number of her colleagues. “Everyone was shouting that it was a boy,” she said. “They knew how much I wanted a boy after having five girls.” She began to cry. “WeZadok. How could this happen to him? He never left the house.”It was raining. A few nearby homes were covered in tarps. Hahnah pointed to the faint path around the porch that Zadok had left from walking the perimeter and going into the crawl space to attempt his home repairs during the past few months. Perhaps he had acted strangely in those first moments after the police arrived, his family acknowledged. But, if so, they now thought, this might have been because of the officers’ sudden appearance at his home, where so few people ever came, or because he was having trouble getting back inside the house. “He did not have any mental-health issues,” Farah Bryant, Zadok is former girlfriend, told me. “The crisis came upon seeing those cops. I think the cops scared him out of his mind.”The knife, they believed, was for whatever repairs he was attempting under the condo. Zadok is sister Zeporah, thinking of the knife marks they’d seen on the door, suggested that Zadok had been working outside and had lost his keys. He often did, she said—she used to live close by and had kept an extra set for him. He’d probably been looking for the m, seeming to wander around, when his neighbors mistook him for a vagrant and called the police, setting in motion the end of his life. What was left of that life was now hidden behind the boards that his sisters had put up on the house to prevent further scavenging. They’d assembled a shrine on his porch; the plumbing bucket, with his gloves inside it, sat nearby, filling up with rain, which was also blowing in through the window that Zadok had kicked in as an officer tried to ta se him. Of course he’d gone in through a window, Hahnah said—he was locked out. Zadok is mother and sisters relit the candles and talked about what they’d seen in the body-camera footage. The commanding officer is comment about being a Black man who did not want Zadok to die had come to seem to Hahnah like “body-camera the atrics,” more directed at future viewers of the footage than at Zadok—who, after all, could have interpreted it as a threat. Why was the officer already suggesting that he might kill him? Because he had a knife? It was just a plumbing tool. “If this was a thirty-five-year-old white man, none of this would have happened,” Hahnah said. The family had created a petition calling for the officers involved in the shooting to be fired. They had begun to worry about the window closing on the chance of any widespread uproar regarding Zadok is killing, and about whether it was possible to get justice without it. “Sometimes it seems that you have to be the perfect Black victim to garner public outrage,” Hahnah said. “Well, Zadok was kneeling behind an ottoman inside his home after having an eight-second mental-health crisis outside with a knife. He did nothing to deserve to be shot inside his home.” She added, “It is a shame that public outrage is needed to get justice when a Black person is killed by the police.”Davis told me that he was considering filing a wrongful-death suit on behalf of the family. “The shocking reality about Black people being killed by police in America is there are so many of them happening, that the easiest to sell in the media is when it is a white officer and a Black victim.” he said. “We have become so desensitized to these killings that everyone is looking for the Hollywood version, the most egregious. But this is as egregious, because a life was lost, and it just was not captured by a teen-ager is cell phone.”Chris Ann swept the porch, freshened up the flowers, and cried. “In my head, I keep seeing him unable to breathe, struggling for breath, while their backs are to him outside this door,” she said. She went on, “They did not even check on my son. My son did nothing. He stood on his porch one day, after working on a plumbing issue, and he was shot and died. He had eggs on his stove. He had cooked eggs that morning for nothing.”A few days later, the Dekalb County Police Department sent me the rest of the body-camera footage—more than ten hours’ worth, all told. One of the videos begins with the voice of a woman who lived with the 911 caller describing what the two of them had seen. “He was running back and forth in front of our door,” she says to an officer. “When she was leaving,” the woman goes on, referring to the caller, “he came out into our pathway in front of our house and he had a knife in his hand. And she saw him and she kind of stopped and he saw her. He stepped towards her and the n just, like, went the other way.” The officer says, “That is him right there?” “Yeah,” the woman replies. “I think he lives the re, though?” the officer says. “No,” the woman says, “no one lives there.” She says that the place is being remodelled, apparently confusing Zadok is place for Dotson is condo. The whole exchange lasts about a minute. The officer the n speaks to Zadok, who remains off-camera, standing on his own front porch. The officer asks Zadok if he lives the re, but the camera is microphone does not catch any response. He asks Zadok to leave the property. Zadok walks down his stairs, wearing jeans and an inscrutable look under the hood of a sweatshirt. He is not wearing the glasses that he is needed since the second grade. The officer asks if Zadok knows why police are on the scene. Suddenly, Zadok darts forward—with a knife now visible in his hand—and the officer trips; a second officer fires at Zadok, who stumbles, too, as he scrambles under his porch. The officers call for backup, while yelling for Zadok to drop the knife. Eventually, Zadok is voice can be heard. “This is my property, man,” he says. The first officer draws his gun and tells Zadok again to put down the knife. “Weshoot, man, all right?” the officer says. “We gave you ample warnings, all right?” Soon, police sirens can be heard. Zadok seems to be moving around the perimeter of the house, as the first officer speaks into his radio. “He already tried to attack me with the knife,” he says. About nine minutes in, Zadok can be heard again. “I locked myself out,” he says. But the first officer responds dismissively: “Man, you do not live the re, man.”More cops arrive. Zadok leaps back onto the porch and the n onto a small roof, kicking in his second-story window and entering his house. An officer runs back onto the porch and tries to Taser Zadok from below, as he dives through his window above them. Minutes later, at least four officers are outside his closed front door. The commanding officer, who later identifies himself as Sergeant Perry, can be heard putting one officer “on lethal.”“We coming in,” a newly arrived officer says after knocking briefly. “Open the door!”“Boss man,” Perry says more plaintively. “Please come out for us.” He asks if Zadok is OK “I think he said, ‘a search warrant,’ ” one officer tells the others, referring to Zadok. Perry, in a lowered voice, says that they are past the point of a search warrant. They kick in the door. Zadok disappears behind an ottoman, and pushes the door closed. The officers kick it back open and fire a shot.“My property, sir,” Zadok says moments later, sounding calm. They ask him to put the knife down again. “I am defending my property,” he says. “You broke into my property, sir.” He shuts the door again. They kick the door open and try to Taser him. Perry, with a gun drawn, makes his comment about being a Black man and not wanting Zadok to die. Zadok tells Perry that the responding officer did not show him any ID at first. He adds, “Tell your guys to back up.”The officers tell Zadok to drop the knife and open the door; he asks them to put their weapons down and to identify the mselves. Perry names the officers and the n, as he is saying “We are here to help you,” he fires three shots toward the door from close range. None of the body cameras show Zadok doing anything to provoke the gunfire. He does not become visible, much less cross the threshold of the door prior to Perry firing at him. (A spokesman for DeKalb County, when asked about this, replied, “The body-cam video does not fully capture the interaction between Mr. Williams and the officer.”) Perry orders the rest of the officers to back off. A lieutenant James arrives on the scene and takes over as commanding officer. Perry explains to him what happened. Perry tells the lieutenant and others that Zadok was “out of his mind,” that the Taser had “no effect,” and that Zadok had been in a “vacant location.” Perry had “deëscalated,” he says, but Zadok “came again towards the door with the knife.” Perry walks to a patrol car and calls the Homicide Assaults Unit. Later, someone asks, “He lunge at you or what?” “No,” Perry responds. “He, he—I gave him the command to put the knife down. He came at the door with the knife.” He adds, “And it is like he was coming through the doorway, is what it felt like to me, with the knife.”James calls a member of the team on the phone. “We got a mess out here for you,” the officer says. The member of theSWATteam points out that Zadok “could be in there bleeding out,” a comment that is met with awkward laughter. “It is gonna be an hour before we even get the re,” he adds. The member of theSWATteam reiterates this before the call is over. “I need for you to think about this, though. Is old boy in there bleeding out? You gotta think about that. Because if you think he is bleeding out, they are gonna need to know who shot him.”Less than half an hour after Perry fired four shots into Zadok is house, a man wearing a radio and what appears to be a navy-blue uniform appears beside James. (A spokesman for DeKalb County confirmed that Fire Rescue was in the area on an unrelated call, and said that Fire Rescue policy prohibited EM T.s from rendering aid at a crime scene until it is deemed safe by the police department.)“I was just trying to, you know, see what we need to do,” the man tells James. “What y’all need.”“He is in there bleeding,” James replies. “But he is the only one hurt so far.”“OK,” the man says. “We have got a medic team stationed across the street right now.” A truck can be heard honking. “Y’all got coming in?” the man says. “Is that what I heard?""James nods. Then Perry interrupts and James takes a call on his radio. The man offering to help walks away. The GB I. said it typically completes investigations into what it refers to as officer-involved shootings in sixty to ninety days. The GB I. will not make any sort of recommendation about charges or determination of wrongdoing—it will deliver a report to the district attorney in DeKalb County, who will make those decisions. According to GB I. records, there were at least thirty-one such incidents in DeKalb County between 2016 and mid-June of this year. These include shots fired by off-duty officers and incidents where an officer fired a gun accidentally, as well as cases like Zadok is. Eighteen resulted in known fatalities. In none of these cases has the district attorney brought charges against the officer or officers involved. In one case, a family filed a wrongful-death suit, which has since been closed; in another, a family has threatened to do so. Though Hahnah said that her family is reserving judgment about the investigation into Zadok is death until it is completed, she did not sound optimistic that his case would be one of the very few in which an officer is held accountable. Davis, the family is attorney, said that he was waiting for the district attorney is decision regarding charges—until the n, he will not have access to the GB I. is case file. But, based on the currently available facts, he believes that, should the family file a wrongful-death suit, they will have a case on at least two fronts. “Number 1,” he told me, “when the police kicked in the door, we do not think he was a threat.” When they shot Zadok, Davis insisted, he was simply attempting to close his door again. The second issue was the delay in medical attention. “Our pathologist thinks the injury would have been survivable if he had been rendered aid,” Davis said. But the pathologist also needed to see the GB I. is file and the autopsy report before he could draw a firm conclusion. In the meantime, the Williams family continues to visit Zadok is former home. In mid-June, almost two months to the day after Zadok was killed, Hahnah finally found his missing keys, in his house, in a dresser drawer. “I tried every last key on the ring until I found it,” she told me, referring to the one that opened her brother is door.",1,1,The New Yorker
614,Instagram post misleads on door-to-door COVID-19 vaccination efforts,0.0,48.67,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/15/instagram-posts/federal-agents-are-not-going-door-door-coerce-peop/,https://adfontesmedia.com/politifact-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"With US vaccination rates stalling, President Joe Biden announced a new wave of efforts to reach unvaccinated Americans, including sending people door to door totalk about the vaccine.""Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,"" Biden said during a July 6 speech at the White House. Though the White House said the push for a door-to-door vaccination campaign has been ongoing since April, Biden isremarkssparkedcriticismfrom some such as Republican Missouri Governor Henry McMaster, who characterized the effort as ""enticing, coercing, intimidating, mandating, or pressuring"" people to take the vaccine. A similar sentiment appeared on social media:""The same people that called President Trump a ‘fascist’ are now sending federal agents door-to-door coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs,"" read the text in aJuly 10 Instagram post that we also found widely shared on Facebook. This is misleading — and these posts were flagged as part of Facebook is efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)First, the re is no evidence that the door-to-door effort involves coercion — the use of force or threats to persuade the unwilling — to get people vaccinated. Second, the White House says the program does not involve federal employees or government members. Third, while COVID-19 vaccines are being used in the US under emergency authorization, calling them ""experimental"" ignores the fact that they have been fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. They have been found to be safe, effective and potentially life-saving, keeping people from getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. We rated a similar claim calling the vaccines ""experimental""Mostly False. Biden is Press Secretary Jen Psakisaid in a press briefing that the people knocking on doors are not federal employees or members of the government. ""They are volunteers. They are clergy. They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking.""The door-to-door campaigns have been organized mostly at the local level and are in the vein of otheron-the-groundeffortsthat have been a staple of public health outreach for years. Cities likeDetroit,Washington,MilwaukeeandChicagoall run programs that send people door to door to help inform unvaccinated people about the COVID-19 vaccines. There is also no evidence that these efforts involve ""coercion."" In Louisiana, for example, where such an effort has been underway for months, health officials say canvassers are given ""motivational interviewing"" training which starts an open dialogue with residents about their thoughts around COVID-19 vaccines.""The decision to be vaccinated is a personal one, and the canvassers provide educational information,"" said Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for Louisiana is Department of Health. If a resident is not interested in receiving vaccine information, ""the canvasser offers materials that the resident can review on their own and the n moves on to the next house,"" Litten said. In North Carolina isMecklenburg County, health officials recently started sending out a health department vehicle staffed by medical professionals who can provide on-site vaccinations if people want them. This ""doses to the door"" program followed weeks of door knocking to sign people up, especially in neighborhoods with lower vaccination rates that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.""It is not confrontational,"" said community organizer Robert Dawkinsin an interview with WCNC in Charlotte. ""It is not like you have got to get the shot, but it is our job to dispel those rumors.""Dawkins leads Action NC, one of the organizing groups involved in that canvassing effort. He said the complication with door-to-door outreach has been follow-up, so the addition of the mobile unit is helpful. ""We get people that will say ‘Yes I will get the shot,’ but the follow-up has always been the issue. Will they go? How can we get people to go out and go?""According to Psaki, the Biden administration has funded door-knocking programs like this since April, and this is just one tactic that is been used to increase vaccination rates in June. She said the results have been measurable. ""Alabama: The adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9%; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June,"" Psaki said, with the adult vaccination rate increasing by 4.4% in Florida and 3.5% in Georgia.""In our view, this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community,"" Psaki said. The term ""experimental"" is often used by vaccine skeptics. But, as we have reported before, the phrase is subjective and ignores the amount of research that is required before the vaccines are authorized for distribution. Researchers have been studying and working with the mRNA technology that is at work in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots dating back to the 1990s. The viral vector platform used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for use for other health emergencies such as Ebola. The mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer is and Moderna is COVID-19 vaccines ""are a new type of vaccine, but are not unknown,"" a spokesperson with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The mRNA vaccines work by teaching cells how to make a protein, or just a piece of a protein, which triggers the body to produce antibodies that prevent infection. Viral vector vaccines such as Johnson & Johnson is Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, were created in the 1970s. They use a modified, but harmless version of a different virus, called a vector, to make the body produce antibodies. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for all three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the USs. The vaccines are pending full approval by the FDA, but they have been found safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. Before they were authorized for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines were subjected to clinical trials conducted with tens of thousands of participants to collect scientific data. After three trial phases with varying levels of complexity, the FDA determined that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccines. An Instagram post claimed that federal agents were going door-to-door ""coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs.""Door-to-door canvassing efforts to get people vaccinated have been underway at the local level for months, as part of a push to increase vaccination rates. But the people involved are not federal employees or government members, according to the White House. They have been community organizers and volunteers. Some communities have augmented the effort with on-site mobile vaccination clinics for those who want the shot. But there is no indication that the door-to-door tactics involve coercion — the use of force or threats to compel someone to do something they are unwilling to do. What is more, the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the US are not ""experimental drugs."" They were subjected to clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people before being given emergency use authorization. We rate this claim Mostly False.",2,2,Politifact
615,Have the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation Been Opened?,11.67,32.67,https://stream.org/have-the-seven-seals-of-the-book-of-revelation-been-opened/,https://adfontesmedia.com/stream-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-13,24,"""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,"" a painting by Viktor Mikhailovich Vasnetsov, depicts the opening of the first seals from Revelation 6. ByMichael BrownPublished onMay 13, 2020•The same, unusual subject came up three times on the same day, this past Monday, May 11. Was God sending a message to me about the end of the world, taken straight from the pages of the Book of Revelation?First, a caller to my radio show asked if we might be in the first phase of the breaking of the seven seals in the Book of Revelation and the refore in the beginning of “the tribulation.”Then, a friend left a message on my cell phone asking what he should make of a respected Christian leader in another country telling him that the first of the seven seals was being opened?Then, I spotted this headline featured on Drudge Report: “‘Four Horsemen are ACTIVE’ Bible scholars claim Book of Revelation seals broken…” As the article, since removed, explained, “Bible scholars have sensationally claimed the end of the world could be upon us as they believe the Four Horsemen, who bring about death, war, famine and disease before the return of Jesus Christ in the holy book, have all been released.”What are we to make of these questions and claims? And what of the statements of these “Bible scholars”?Not surprisingly, the article that claimed the support of biblical scholars was published in the UK is, known for its sometimes sensationalistic reporting. As for the scholars, the article quoted none. Instead, it referenced a 2005 article by a non-scholar and the n — I kid you not — the article cited a twitter user. So much for the notion that “Bible scholars have sensationally claimed the end of the world could be upon us.”The only thing sensational was the headline, followed by the article itself.“But,” someone might say, “what about Revelation? What does it say?”How about we take look?For argument is sake, we will agree that that these prophecies are still for the future (rather than being symbolic of past events). And we will agree that these prophecies refer to literal events that will unfold on the earth. Let is examine each of the four horsemen. Revelation 6 begins with these words: “I watched as the Lamb [meaning Jesus] opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest” (Revelation 6:1–2, NIV). Where, pray tell, is this world-conquering figure? And how has he emerged since the pandemic began?Let is call this strike one. The text continues, “When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, ‘Come!’ Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword” (Revelation 6:3–4, NIV). How, pray tell, has peace been taken from the earth? And are people killing each more today than during World War II? Or World War I? Or, here in America, during the Civil War?Strike two. Back to Revelation: “When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, ‘Come!’ I looked up and saw a black horse, and its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice from among the four living beings say, ‘A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day is pay. And do not waste the olive oil and wine.’” (Revelation 6:5–6, NLT)Could it be that massive famine will overtake the entire world because of the financial meltdown? It is possible, but we are nowhere near that now. As for the fact that many more people face potential starvation because of the pandemic, that is a tragic reality. But it is hardly what is described here. We are now up to strike three. But since there are four horsemen, let is give it one more shot.“When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, ‘Come!’ I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth” (Revelation 6:7–8, NIV). A fourth of the earth, at present, would amount to almostpeople, whereas the pandemic has taken less than 300,000 lives. This represents .00015 percent of that number. Call this strike four. That is why Itweetedthis later that same day (Monday): “A caller today wanted to know if we might be experiencing the divine judgments of the seven seals in Revelation and the refore ‘in the tribulation.’ I told her that when that time comes, she will not need to call into my show to ask.”That also means that, if the Christian leader who called my friend is right and the first of the seven seals has been opened, things will change in front of our eyes more quickly and dramatically than we can imagine. Will that happen? We shall see. But I can say without hesitation it is not happening yet. On March 2, I wrote my first article on COVID-19,titled, “Is the Coronavirus an End-Time Biblical Plague?” (This has been expanded into a full chapter in my new book.)My answer the n was no. My answer remains the same today. This is not to minimize the very real suffering caused by the pandemic. Nor is it to minimize end-time Bible prophecy. Quite the opposite. My goal is simply to put things in proper perspective. In short, we have not yet reached the end of the world. When we get to that point in time, we will not need an article in the to let us know.

Trump posted disparaging tweets about the late Senator John McCain (R-AZ), whose death from brain cancer got entirely too much attention for the spotlight-seeking, thin-skinned president, on Sunday. On Tuesday, he doubled down on his remarks during a press conference in the Oval Office, telling reporters he was “never a fan” of McCain is. President Trump escalates attack on late Senator John McCain: ""I was never a fan""— TIME (@TIME)March 19, 2019Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997, is considering a primary challenge to Trump in the GOP race. Like many Republicans disgusted with Trump is embarrassing Twitter attacks and destruction of the GOP, he was appalled by Trump is continued bashing of Senator McCain. On Twitter, he referred to the attacks as “contemptible,” saying that they are “beneath our dignity as Americans.”Apparently, enough Americans have no dignity when it comes to politics, racism, misogyny, and Islamaphobia. No matter how many times Trump proves that he is giving a voice and a platform to white supremacists, his fans remain, but only because they do not care if white supremacy is emboldened by Trump.

618,The Rise of Anti-history,-15.33,30.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/republicans-anti-history-marjorie-taylor-greene/619403/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"The Trumpist wing of the GOP uses history as a bludgeon, without regard to context, logic, or proportionality. In June, Marjorie Taylor Greene visited the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The visit was, by her own account, revelatory. Earlier in the spring, the Georgia member of the US HousecomparedFood City, a grocery chain that identified vaccinated employees on their name tags, to the Nazis, who forced Jews to wear Stars of David. A few days later, shecomparedDemocrats to Nazis. Now she was contrite. “When you make a mistake, you should own it. I have made a mistake, and it is really bothered me for a couple of weeks now, so I definitely want to own it,” shesaid. “The Holocaust—there is nothing comparable to it.”The lesson wore off in less than a month. When President Joe Biden announced plans to send public-health workers door-to-door to encourage people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, Greenetweeted: “People have a choice, they do not need your medical brown shirts showing up at their door ordering vaccinations.”David A Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOPAnother museum visit would probably be futile. For Greene and others in the Trumpist wing of the Republican Party, anti-history has become a shibboleth. They drop historical references and facts into political debates, but without regard to context, logic, or proportionality. Their villains include Adolf Hitler, but also Mao Zedong and Joseph McCarthy; the Holocaust was bad, but also, Jewish people control the weather. The pose is more than the simple historical illiteracy that is endemic among American politicians. In this GOP faction, members are willfully ignorant of history, which they view in purely instrumental terms, as a bludgeon to wield even as they do not bother to understand it. As usual, Donald Trump himself has led the way. In 2018, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had to give the the n-president a capsule lesson about interwar history and which countries were on what side of the two world wars,according to a new book from the reporter Michael C Bender. “Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly replied, citing the improving German economy in the 1930s. (Trump denies this.) “You cannot ever say anything supportive of Adolf Hitler,” Kelly replied. “You just ca not.” He was right, though he somehow did not see this as a reason to quit on the spot. Trump is ignorance of history is well established. In the first fortnight of his presidency, he cited Frederick Douglassas “an example of somebody who is done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,” evincing no awareness of who Douglass was. A few weeks later, Trump mentioned Abraham Lincoln at a dinner. “Great president. Most people do not even know he was a Republican,”he said. “Does anyone know? Lot of people do not know that.” Who? Then in May 2017, Trumpmusednonsensically that if Andrew Jackson had lived later, the Civil War might have been avoided. Read: Trump is peculiar understanding of the Civil WarPredictably, many of the most egregious examples of the anti-historical approach involve Hitler. Another notable case occurred in Washington State, where a Republican state legislator wore a Star of David to an e ventin order to protest vaccine mandates. (“It is an echo from history. In the current context, we are all Jews,” he wrote on Facebook, before later apologizing.) American conservatives have often argued that the Nazis were actually leftists, noting that the party is full name included the words, but the anti-historians have moved from this smirking sophistry to a reflexive recourse to the Holocaust, no matter how ill-fitting or ill-advised, in nearly any debate. The contradictory views of Hitler from the anti-historians might seem like ideological confusion. But they actually demonstrate how the anti-historians’ use of the past is purely opportunistic. These politicians are not interpreting history to bolster their views, but cherry-picking isolated, misunderstood examples to fit whatever argument they happen to be making. Anti-history is not restricted to peculiar views of Hitler. Earlier this week, the former Trump spokesperson Kayleigh McEnanytold Fox News viewers, “We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers, were against slavery, recognized the evils of it.” (Several Founders expressed ambivalence about slavery while enslaving people, but that is not what McEnany said.) Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina is fond of citing American history and is often wrong,creating his own anti-history canon. Read: Donald Trump is narrative of the life of Frederick DouglassMany legitimate disputes exist about the facts of history and its interpretation: Consider some—though perhaps not most—of the debate over is 1619 Project. Political figures might also make dubious or mistaken statements about history without participating in anti-history. Conspiracist thinking, another hallmark of Trumpism, is anti-history is natural partner. Each snatches isolated facts or claims out of their proper context, fabricates new contexts for them without regard to reality, and fashions them into partisan weapons. That Greene (found espousing bizarre anti-Semitic the ories when she is not comparing anything she dislikes to the Holocaust) and Trump are leading proponents of both anti-history and conspiracy thinking is not a coincidence. In 1955, the founding father of a new strain of conservatism, William F Buckley,promisedthat his magazine,, would “stand athwart history, yelling ‘Stop.’” The rising Trumpist strain in the conservative movement stands athwart slop, yelling, “History!”",1,1,The Atlantic
619,Eviction cases pile up in the courts while tenants wait to see whether DeSantis extends moratorium,-1.0,48.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-bz-are-evictions-piling-up-in-the-courts-while-desantis-decides-20200828-eiiyvfkh5jam3poo3cjed2rhpu-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,21,"As renters wait to find out whether the governor will again extend the COVID-19-related eviction moratorium, hundreds of landlords are filing evictions cases against tenants they assert are taking advantage of the statewide ban, now ending its fifth month. Since his original moratorium took effect April 2, Governor Ron DeSantishas made a habit of keeping tenants guessing until the end of each month whether he will grant another month of protection against being evicted from their homes. Asked Friday whether he plans to extend the moratorium another month through September, DeSantis was less than assuring, saying only, “I will work on the moratorium. I think we probably will continue that as well.”Meanwhile, landlords in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties filed 2,170 evictions cases between August 1 and August 27, far more than in any of the four prior months since the moratorium took effect April 2. Those cases are the leading edge of a likely cascade of evictions that would leave tens of thousands of Florida families homeless in the coming months if more federal assistance to consumers is not approved by Congress and the president, advocates for renters warn. Stout, a global research firm, predicts that 749,000 Florida households — nearly half of all rental units — are at risk of eviction over the next four months. Citing Stout is research, the nonprofit Florida Bar Foundation estimated that 530,000 eviction filings could follow the moratorium is expiration. Increased filings in August followed DeSantis’ addition of language to his latest moratorium extension allowing courts to process cases while still barring the “final action” of serving orders requiring renters to vacate their units. DeSantis’ most recent executive order also clarifies that the moratorium extension protects only renters who are “adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency.”As has been the case since April, the moratorium does not absolve tenants of their responsibility to pay all of the rent they missed. They still owe it — and are expected to make arrangements with their landlords to pay it. Deciding which tenants fall under that protection can be complicated, said Armando Alfonso, a Miami-based attorney who represents 80 landlords in South Florida. Because “adversely affected” can be interpreted to cover a wide variety of circumstances, Alfonso said he is decided to wait until after the moratorium is potential expiration on Sept. 1 to file “five or six” pending cases. Miami-based attorney Kenneth James Lowenhaupt, of the firm Lowenhaupt Sawyer and Spinale, has been particularly active, filing dozens of evictions cases, including 23 case against tenants of The Preserve At Coral Square in Coral Springs, 12 cases to remove tenants of Windsor Forest Apartments in Pompano Beach, 11 cases against tenants at an apartment complex in Sunrise, and nine suits against tenants of a landlord incorporated as Bell Fund. Lowenhaupt did not respond to an interview request sent by email and phone. Miami-based United Property Management, which manages more than 9,000 units in South Florida, filed 14 cases against tenants of Pompano Palms Apartments, located south of Sample Road and west of Interstate 95 in Pompano Beach. Eviction is last resort, property manager saysOne of those cases, filed against Craig Junior Walters, states that he owes his rent payments of $1,539 due for April, May, June, July and August, plus a past-due balance of $755.49 for March. The eviction complaint filed in Broward County Civil Court states that Walters “is not known to have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency as defined in DeSantis’ order.”Walters, reached by telephone Friday, said that is not true. He said he lost his job as a security guard at the beginning of the pandemic and filed for unemployment benefits in April but his application remains under review and has not been approved. The complex’ managers, he said, have not offered to work with him to ensure that he, his two kids, and their mom can remain in the unit after the moratorium ends.“They know we are still out of a job,” he said. Despite making verbal threats to get him to pay rent each month, “they did not give us any kind of feedback as customers, as far as finding a way to help us,” he said. With no unemployment payments, the family has spent what little money they have on utilities and food, he said. “There is a pandemic going on. We have to eat.” Walters said he plans to apply for help from Broward County is rental assistance program. United Property Management spokesman Louis Mata said he could not discuss specifics of individual tenants’ cases. But he said his company has worked hard to help tenants who have sought help, including waiving late fees and not sending three-day notices to pay or leave, like some landlords have sent despite the moratorium. About 30 Pompano Palms residents have worked out “some form of arrangement” and staved off evictions cases, he said.“It stinks if someone has been out of work since the beginning of this thing. We recognize that,” he said. “We are just looking for a means to work something out. Some folks have paid $100 on $1,000 rent they owe. We ask, ‘What can you pay?'”He added, “Only when every means of communications have been exhausted and the re is been no payment, the n we file.”A minority of tenants either do not know or do not care that most landlords have their own bills to pay, Alfonso said. “They think landlords are sitting on millions of dollars. That is not true. They are paying mortgages, insurance and HOA fees. If they are not getting rent payments from their tenants, that is coming out of their pockets.”“Meanwhile, I see a surge of landlords who have not been paid for six months, saying, ‘You are not interested in working anything out. We are going forward.'”How to defend against evictionTenants who believe they have been targets of illegal evictions need to act quickly after receiving a formal notice of an eviction suit if they want to make a case that their failure to pay was related to a COVID-19 hardship. Some judges are delaying evictions if a tenant who receives a formal notice files a response to the court within the required five business days of receiving an official eviction notice, said Alana Greer, director and co-founder of the Miami-based Community Justice Project, a legal services foundation for low-income residents. Under state law, tenants who want to fight their eviction are provided only five business days to file a response. In addition, they are required to post a bond with the court for the entire amount of unpaid rent before they can even get a court hearing. That is an advantage for landlords that typically makes fighting an eviction nearly impossible for tenants, Greer said. But some judges are considering COVID defenses without requiring the bond, she said. Ideally, tenants should secure services of a private attorney or, if they ca not afford one, reach out to one of the free nonprofit Legal Aid services to seek help from a volunteer attorney. If they ca not secure an attorney before the five-business day deadline to respond, they should file a response on their own, Greer says. She suggests tenants can get guidance for drafting a response atfloridaevictionanswerbuilder.org. In Broward County, Coast to Coast Legal Aid of South Florida and its sister organization Legal Aid Service of Broward County have received nearly $1 million in federal funds to work specifically on COVID-related issues, executive directors of the two organizations said by email. The money will be used to hire new staff members to help affected consumers in fighting evictions, as well as with foreclosures, unemployment claims and domestic violence cases, plus helping clients find rental assistance, food banks, child care and other aid.

Presumably Lindell could have shared that evidence with the public at any point in the past 10 weeks — unlike his buddy Sidney Powell, he is still got his Twitter account.

621,‘Reached the limits’ of voluntary system: New York Mayor de Blasio urges businesses to force vaccines on employees,5.33,43.33,https://www.rt.com/usa/530113-de-blasio-vaccinate-employees/,https://adfontesmedia.com/rt-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has urged employers to be as aggressive as possible in mandating that workers get vaccinated against Covid-19, marking the latest sign the US jab campaign is shifting from cajoling to forcing.“I am calling on all New York City employers, including our private hospitals, to move immediately to some form of mandate,”de Blasio said on Friday in a radio interview. He called on employers to impose“whatever the maximum is you feel you can do.”De Blasio is comments come amid rising US Covid-19 infections, as the reportedly highly contagious Delta variant of the virus spreads across the country. With unvaccinated Americans entrenched in their hesitancy – newly released Associated Press-NORC poll results show that 80% who have not yet received the jab do not plan to do so – Democrat politicians and public-health experts are increasingly calling for local mandates that leave people virtually no choice but to get the shots. After more than six months of New York is Covid-19 vaccine rollout, during which residents were given“every form of incentives,”the city has“reached the limits of a purely voluntary system,”de Blasio said.“Any type of mandate helps. It will move the ball. It will get more people vaccinated,”he added. Both President Joe Biden and de Blasio have fallen short of their vaccination goals. The mayor had aimed to have 5 million New Yorkers fully inoculated against the virus by the end of June, but the current total is less than 4.5 million. Nationwide, the flow of Americans getting Covid-19 shots has plunged since, reaching a daily peak of 4.6 million in April, averaging around 500,000 a day in recent weeks, as those who wanted the jabs have already had plenty of opportunity to get them. Earlier this week, De Blasio ordered that employees of New York is public hospital system and Health Department clinics need to get vaccinated or be tested for Covid-19 every week. He admitted that he hoped such testing would become so tiresome that recalcitrant employees would find it in their interest to be inoculated, and he wants the private sector to use the same sort of tactics.“We need to get more serious than ever about vaccination,”de Blasio said.“If everyone was vaccinated right now, we would not be having a conversation about the Delta variant. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”De Blasio is mandate push marks a shift from his past stance, when he had insisted the city could persuade vaccine-hesitant residents to get the jabs through awareness campaigns and incentives, including prize draws, for those who cooperated. About 70% of New York adults have received at least their first vaccine dose, which is just above the 69% national rate. Ironically, the mayor pitched“freedom”as a motivation for forcing people to get the shots, which have received only emergency use authorization from the FDA.“If people want freedom, if people want jobs, if people want to be able to live again, we have got to get more people vaccinated,”he said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden is chief medical adviser, and Andy Slavitt, a former Covid-19 adviser to the administration, are among those who have similarly suggested employers and local governments use mandates to make life less tenable for those who choose not to get inoculated. CNN is Washington bureau chief reportedly offered much the same sentiment in an email that was accidentally made public this week, saying,“This is the point re: carrot vs stick. The Carrot is no longer going to work.”De Blasio plans to ratchet up the pressure on vaccine-hesitant New Yorkers over time, especially city employees.“I have been very explicit about the fact that this is the beginning and we are going to climb up the ladder of measures to address this situation,”he told WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer.“We are going to be making announcements piece by piece.”",1,1,RT
622,Sunday Shows Hit Snooze on Climate Alarm,-11.67,37.67,https://fair.org/home/sunday-shows-hit-snooze-on-climate-alarm/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"In a year dominated by coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, one might expect other topics to fall lower on the media is priority list. But the climate crisis has not lessened in intensity; on the contrary, the urgency of addressing it increases each year. (Not to mention that climate change is animportantdriverof increased disease outbreaks like the current pandemic.) News media must be capable of covering two emergencies at the same time. Their failure to do so reached shocking levels last year. ABC‘sThis Week,CBS‘sFace the NationandNBC‘sMeet the Pressdid not ask a single question that mentioned the climate crisis, climate change or the Green New Deal until more than two-thirds of the way through the year (9/13/20), when wildfires—which, due to climate change, are becoming more frequent and more intense—devastated the West Coast. CNN‘sState of the Uniondid little better, asking one tangential question earlier in the year (2/2/20) to Republican Iowa Senator Jodi Ernst about why she believed the Green New Deal and Medicare for All were socialism but farm subsidies were not. Its coverage of extreme weather beat the other networks by two weeks when it reported on Hurricane Laura in Louisiana (8/30/20). Face the Nationasked only two questions referencing the climate crisis the entire year. In the first,CBShostMargaret Brennan(9/13/20) challenged Oregon Governor Kate Brown is statement that the wildfires were “a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change.” Brennan responded:Governor, I understand that is your conviction. But I know four former Oregon lawmakers have written an op-ed in the Washington Post, though, saying you ca not blame climate change. Instead, it is a failure of your state government to prepare, and that warnings were ignored regarding mismanagement of Oregon is forests. What is your response to that?Brennan presented climate disruption is role in wildfires as a mere “conviction” of her guest–not because there was scientific evidence that questioned the connection, but on the basis of an op-ed (Washington Post,9/12/20) written by a former Republican state representative (not four of them) who is now associated with a pro-logging group funded by corporate timber interests and linked to far-right militias (Mother Jones,3/6/20). In the other question, Brennan (11/8/20) asked West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin if Joe Biden is “energy message”—which featured a vow to transition away from oil and gas—hurt him in the election. NBCasked three questions,ABCandFox Newsasked four, andCNNasked 13 in their Sunday morning shows. The five shows combined aired a total of only 18 segments in which any questions were asked that referenced the climate crisis. There were 26 questions asked, to 18 guests. The Sunday shows historically skew overwhelmingly to ward official sources—politicians, party operatives and other current or former government officials—who typically account for half or more (FAIR.org,4/1/12,5/22/20) of all guests, with journalists making up most of the rest. In 2020, questions about climate skewed even more toward partisan guests, who accounted for all but two of the sources, and received 24 of the 26 questions. (The other two, both onFox News Sunday, were an actor and a conservative pundit.)Last April, when there was a crucial role for news outlets to play in clarifying the medical and scientific aspects of the Covid crisis, as well as offering space for vigorous debate over solutions, FAIR (5/22/20) criticized the Sunday shows for sidelining independent public health experts, who comprised only 10% of all guests that month. On climate, however, the shows have proved even worse, inviting not a single climate scientist or other climate expert or advocate as a guest over the entire year. Of the partisan guests asked about climate issues, 12 were Democrats and only three were Republicans (taking 17 versus seven questions, respectively), despite the fact that Republicans dominated Washington for the year, holding both the White House and Senate and blocking any major climate change legislation. In fact, theABC,CBS,NBCandFox NewsSunday shows did not pose a single question about the climate crisis to a Republican politician the entire year. In effect, these shows are allowing politicians to define reality. If Republicans say the climate crisis does not exist, the n Sunday hosts—with the exception ofCNN—do not question them about it. Twelve of the 18 segments centered on the US presidential election or the subsequent presidential transition, five were about the West Coast wildfires and Hurricane Laura, and one was a feature about an actor whose climate activism came up in a question. All but one of the 10 climate-related questions in the extreme weather segments were about whether climate change is an important contributor to extreme weather events of 2020, or whether humans are the main driver of that climate change—questions that have long been settled science. CNN(8/30/20, 9/13/20) posed several such questions to two Republican climate deniers, and the network is Dana Bash (8/30/20) stated clearly multiple times in her interview some variation of “the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is responsible for the climate crisis.” While holding Republicans accountable for their climate denial stance is important, it is also important to go beyond settled science and press them on policy. But with so few questions to Republicans at all, none did so. What is more, three Democrats were also asked whether climate change could be blamed for the West Coast wildfires (ABC, 9/13/20;CBS, 9/13/20;CNN, 9/13/20), letting the n–President Donald Trump frame the news with his claims that it was simply a “forest management” problem, rather than doing what they ought to have done: set the record straight on what the science says about the role of climate change in wildfires, the n use their questions to ask their political guests about government responses based on those scientific facts. If we have any hope of addressing the climate crisis, journalists have to move beyond debating its existence or importance, and start looking at both its causes—very concretely, looking at culprits—and its solutions. You ca not debate climate solutions without understanding what is driving climate change, yet only 12 questions were asked on the Sunday shows all year that even touched on emissions or the oil and gas industry, and none mentioned agriculture, deforestation or capitalism more generally. Of those 12 questions, few got the national conversation closer to where it needs to be, instead asking about such things as whether Biden is goal of net zero emissions by 2050 was “realistic” (ABC, 9/13/20) or the impact of his stance on oil and gas on voters, not the planet (CNN, 10/25/20;Fox News, 10/25/20). OnABC, hostMartha Raddatz(10/25/20) asked Democratic strategist Rahm Emanuel whether Biden is promise in one of the presidential debates to transition away from oil and gas made him “cringe a little bit.”Meanwhile, the industry did not reduce its own media output during the pandemic; in fact, it increased it. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest industry lobbying group, spent over $3.1 million on TV ads—a 51% increase from the year before—falsely touting natural gas as “clean” energy (Independent,8/19/20). These ads aired during almost the exact same period (1/1/20–8/16/20) that most of the Sunday shows were completely silent on climate.",1,1,FAIR

624,COVID Delta variant symptoms: These are the most common ones,0.0,45.0,https://fortune.com/2021/07/10/covid-delta-variant-symptoms-different/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Coronaviruses contain multitudes. Terrible multitudes, but multitudes nonetheless. They can cause everything from the usually-benign common cold to far more serious respiratory conditions such as SARS and MERSand, of course, the novel coronavirus which causes COVID and has claimed more than four million lives around the world to date. And even that particular strain of coronavirus which leads to COVID-19 has continuously mutated itself over the course of the past year and a half. What that means for the public is that, depending on which version of the coronavirus you may catch, the tell-tale symptoms may diverge. But it is not always clear exactly how. Classic COVID may start off with loss of smell or taste; catching theCOVID Delta strain may not lead to those symptoms but could cause others such as a runny nose and headache. COVID is a strange puzzle of a disease which public health officials are still trying to piece together. The most common, and some of the weirder,symptoms have been on the radar for a while now: A sudden loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose and congestion, nausea, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, fever, muscle aches. The typical trappings of something like the flu crossed with the cold and the n multiplied by unexpected symptoms such as sensory dilution and the dire prospect of having to live with them if you have a case of “long COVID.”The multiple COVID variants now circulating the globe, include the Delta variant which now makes up a majority of new COVID-19 cases in the US, complicate the matter further since different variants may manifest in different ways. And all of these mutations, whether they be theAlpha, Delta, or Lambda variants or something else entirely, are still so new that it is difficult to assess the precise nature of each individual threat. Of the major mutation groups that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) list as “variants of concern,” the Delta variant is by far doing the most damage globally due to its transmissibility and high levels “viral load” that can spread the pathogen faster and at an earlier stage of illness. Part of the challenge that Delta presents may be tied to this findingThe variant is viral load ~1,000X higher than previous strains (reflected by low CTs), more infectious in the early stages of the illness now, it appears that the Delta variant (even in some who are fully vaccinated for COVID) can cause symptoms such as a headache, sore throat, and runny nose, and also potentially a fever and a cough,based on recent data from the UK, which is grappling with Delta variant breakouts. Those are all typical COVID symptoms generally but do not include the tell-tale sign of taste or smell loss. That means that as we head into the flu and cold season in several months, it might become more difficult to distinguish between a highly contagious COVID Delta variant patient and someone with a mild flu. The coming years will reveal the breadth and depth of COVID-19 symptoms across its variants. For now, the good news is that while available vaccines from the likes ofPfizerandAstraZenecamay not entirely prevent coronavirus mutations from spreading, and these kinds of symptoms occurring, they are quite effective in preventing serious illness that can lead to hospitalization or death.

625,'No regrets': Evangelicals and other faith leaders still support Trump after deadly US Capitol attack,-3.0,48.0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/12/evangelicals-donald-trump-capitol-riot-voter-fraud/6644005002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,22,"Like millions of other Americans, Franklin Graham watched the disturbing images of last week isriots at the US Capitolwith swelling concern and anger. Graham, son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said he was sickened to see ""people attack my Capitol and break down the doors of my Capitol"" and was dismayed to see howPresident Donald Trump riled up the protesters.""I do not think it was the president is finest moment,"" he said. But Graham said he does not expect the tumult at the Capitol to deter evangelical Christians from supporting Trump.""I do not think he had any understanding in that moment of what was going to take place,"" he said. ""None of us did.""Graham added, ""He regrets it.""Since his victory in a very competitive Republican primary in 2016, Trump has relied on evangelical Christians and other influential religious groups as powerful voting blocs to shore up his influence. He has appointed more than 200 federal judges and three conservative justices to the US Supreme Court who support limits on abortion and gay marriage and other policies favored by many conservative religious leaders. In the presidential election in November, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls. Thousands of protesters broke into the Capitol as Congress tried to finalize the Electoral College vote count and acknowledge Biden as the election winner. The attack led to five deaths and nearly 100 arrest sand motivated House Democrats to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump for allegedly inciting the crowds. During a speech before the violence broke out, Trump told his followers, ""We are going to have to fight much harder.""“If you do not fight like hell, you are not going to have a country anymore,” he said hours before rioters stormed the US Capitol, threatening Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers. Tuesday,before leaving on a trip to South Texas,Trump said calls for his impeachment were divisive and his comments to supporters before theCapitolinsurrection were ""totally appropriate.""None of the turmoil has eroded much of his support among evangelicals, experts and religious leaders said. For the past four years, evangelical leaders created an ""echo chamber"" where they blamed all of Trump is digressions and missteps on the Democratic Party or the mainstream media, said Sarah Posner, an investigative journalist and author of ""Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump.""After the deadly Capitol riot, evangelical leaders deflected blame from Trump, while those who have been critical of the president denounced the riots and blamed him for playing a role, she said. Evangelicals ""are so conditioned not to trust the media, it is going to be really hard to convince them of the truth of what happened on Wednesday,"" Posner said. In the wake of the Capitol riots, many evangelical leaders have continued fueling Trump is baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud in last year is elections, she said.""Because it is the leaders who are again churning the same conspiracy the ories, I do not see a lot of progress in changing anybody is minds,"" Posner said. Robert Jeffress, senior pastor of the 14,000-member First Baptist Church of Dallas, said Tuesday he had “absolutely no regrets” over his “enthusiastic support” of Trump over the past four years.“He is without doubt the most pro-life and pro-religious president in history,” Jeffress said in an e-mail. “The president has every right to hold the view that the election was fraudulent and to invite those who share that belief to peacefully protest. He neither called for nor condoned the despicable actions of those who invaded our Capitol and assaulted the police.”In an editorial published over the weekend on Fox News, Jeffress called the storming of the Capitol “not only a crime” but “a sin against God.”“Peaceful protest is a vital part of our political tradition, and it has long served us well,” he wrote. “What happened on Wednesday when a mob infiltrated the Capitol building was not a protest. It was lawlessness. … Celebrating evil is evil. It corrodes the soul.”Jeffress said he would discuss in his sermon Sunday how Christians dismayed by the election results should respond to Biden.“If we are ever going to heal our country,” he said, “we must learn how to lay aside the anger and bitterness that are tearing our country apart without demanding that people surrender their deeply held convictions.”Trump has also courted support from Orthodox Jewish leaders, who applauded when he moved theUS Embassy to Jerusalemtwo years ago. Jared Kushner, Trump is son-in-law, broker ed the signing of peace accords with a handful of Mideast countries. According to a survey by the American Jewish Committee published in October, Trump was preferred by 74% of Orthodox Jews. Biden was favored by 83% of secular Jews. Among the mob at the US Capitol were Orthodox Jews who supported the president, even though there were anti-Semitic images in the crowd, including a man with a T-shirt emblazoned with ""Camp Auschwitz."" One rioter arrested Friday was the son of a prominent judge in New York is Orthodox Jewish community. Rabbi Mendy Mirocznik, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, a national organization that represents more than 900 Orthodox clergy members, called the events at the Capitol very painful. The Rabbinical Alliance of America does not endorse any political candidates for office.“This is more than the straw that broke the camel is back,"" said Mirocznik, whose parents are Holocaust survivors from Poland. ""America needs to begin to heal.”Apollby the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that tracks extremism nationwide, found approximately two-thirds of Americans say Trump and members of groups with white supremacist beliefs were responsible for the violence.“Most Americans now see the direct connection between the dangerous rhetoric from President Trump, others on the far right and extremist groups,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL During religious services this past weekend, Jewish clergy took to the pulpit to speak out against white supremacy, anti-Semitism and the attack on democracy. As Rabbi Rachel Timoner began reciting the blessing, “Baruch Atah Adonai,” to welcome the sabbath in Congregation Beth Elohim in New York City is Brooklyn borough, she attempted to comfort her congregation.“We are going to kindle light because the world needs light,"" she said, lighting two white candles. Joseph W Daniels, Jr., pastor of Emory Fellowship, a United Methodist church in Washington, cited the attack on the Capitol during his sermon Sunday and urged congregants to call out wrongdoing when they see it.“For our nation to heal, for America to heal, we have to call out the fact that the behaviors and habits and attitudes of this past Wednesday were not of God but were of a white supremacy and privilege that are not healthy for anybody,"" Daniels said. “We cannot be afraid. We have to have courage. ... We have to call out demons.”Some conservative religious leaders called for the nation to move forward behind Biden. In an article in the online portal The Gospel Coalition, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, condemned the attacks on the Capitol and called on Christians to reject the falsehoods surrounding the elections and embrace the truth.""Enough is enough – and indeed was enough a long time ago,"" Moore wrote. ""It will take decades to rebuild from the wreckage in this country. But, as Christians, we can start now – just by not being afraid to say what is objectively the truth. Joe Biden has been elected president.""He said, ""If Christians are people of truth, we ought to be the first to acknowledge reality.""For other evangelicals, Trump is role in the Capitol attack will be minimized because many see him not just as an elected official but one anointed by God, Posner said.""They feel he should remain president because God wanted him to be president,"" she said.",2,2,USA Today

Ashley Biden told Hager that she plans “to advocate for social justice, for mental health, to be involved in community development and revitalization.” According to CNN, the new First Daughter is so private that she does not even have social media accounts and, unlike Ivanka Trump, she does not plan to hold a position in the new administration. Ashley Biden is the only daughter of former Vice PresidentJoe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. The Bidens also raised Joe is sons from his first marriage, Beau and Hunter.

Here is what you need to know:To Hager, Biden explained why she does not have social media accounts, saying, “The cruelty and the meanness, that is why I am not, I do not have a social media account that is public.

Then 38, Ashley Biden had worked for the group for a year and was promoted to executive director,according to Examiner, which added that the grant is designed to “strengthen local law enforcement.”In 2019, Biden announced she was leaving the group through a statement on Facebook.“Working with DCJ has been one of the great honors of my life,” she said. “Together we have changed the landscape of justice reform, violence intervention, and victim services for the State of Delaware. I leave DCJ in capable hands, with a passionate and committed staff, a talented board and the infrastructure to continue to support DCJ is vision. I am confident that the organization will continue to thrive and provide essential services to our community.” She did not explain why she was quitting, but it came as her dad was said to be considering a presidential run. Being the daughter of a prominent politician who has served for so long has come with challenges for Biden.“Any achievement that I accomplished, many people attributed to the fact that I was his daughter,” she once said,according to The List. She praised both her mother and father, saying, “I was taught by both of my parents to work hard, to be passionate about whatever I did, and I felt that I did that and kind of got to where I am today because of hard work and passion and determination.”Biden told Glamour magazine that public service was in her DNA, saying, “The passion started at a very young age.

631,The Science of Mask-Wearing Has not Changed. So Why Have Our Expectations?,-5.33,45.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-science-of-mask-wearing-hasnt-changed-so-why-have-our-expectations/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-02,25,"Before every fashion retailer was selling their own cloth face covering, before a piece of fabric over your nose and mouth became a personal political statement, and before Goldman Sachs was saying a national face mask mandate is as good as a lockdown, Lara Martin was unsure whether homemade cloth masks were even a good idea. The executive director of the United Methodist Committee on Relief, Martin was one of the people I interviewed back in March for a story about the science of masks. Back the n, I found that masks were an excellent example oft he scientific uncertainties swirling around the novel coronavirus. Remember, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand the surgeon general once told the general public not to wear masks. The data that existed on mask effectiveness largely dealt with medical respirators and surgical masks. It was not clear how protective a cloth mask would be, and Martin worried that wearing masks might lead people to feel more safe than they actually were — and make choices that increased their risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19. Today, a lot has changed. But the science around cloth masks has not. Yes, the CDC now recommends cloth face coverings, the surgeon general starred in a video showing how to make the m, and many businesses, and even cities,require them. Martin herself owns three and wears one every time she goes outside. But she told me that is not because the evidence has significantly improved. “I do not know enough, I do not see enough evidence. Nothing has changed except that I care about my neighbors, I care about my colleagues, I care about people I do not even know that I come across at the grocery store,” she said. “I am now saying to my community that I care about the m, and that actually feels important to me as a scientist.”Cloth and DIY face masks sit at the intersection where scientific data, public perceptions, and political opinions crash headlong into each other. Making smart decisions is not just about having data — it is also about how we interpret the data we have. Safety moves along a spectrum with different relative levels of risk. Behavioral norms also matter, regardless of how much evidence backs them up. In the midst of a pandemic, masks are a reminder that science is seldom as simple, or as certain, as we want it to be — and that reasonable public health recommendations are sometimes based on more than just data. ByMaggie KoerthMore:Apple Podcasts|ESPN App|RSS|Amazon Music|SpotifyDo cloth face coverings work? Probably, to some extent. Butjust how much they work depends on the material, how they are used, and what you are expecting them to accomplish. And — regardless of what you have seen in highly shareable memes— we definitely do not know enough to say that wearing these kinds of coverings will reduce risk of transmission by a specific percentage, let alone a high percentage. Those were the conclusions of an expert report published by the National Academies of Sciences on April 8, and two of the lead authors of that paper recently told me the sciencehas not significantly changed since the n. Some studies have come out showing a correlation in certain regions between mask mandates and reduced spread of the coronavirus, but several of those not-yet-peer-reviewed studies have turned out to have important flaws — such as failing to account for factors like other behaviors(such as higher rates of social distancing) that went along with wearing masks in those places. Instead, experts say what has changed is how both the public and public health institutions interpret this situation and the data surrounding it.“Back in March, it was difficult to even have anybody take you seriously when the CDC and WHO said the opposite,” said Jeremy Howard, a data scientist and entrepreneur who has become a major advocate of universal mask requirements. In response to the lack of support, he launched a bipartisan campaign calledMasks4Allthat lobbied for widespread mask-wearing and argued that masks were a crucial, if not the most important, part of the COVID-19 response. But Howard has also seen changes in how political actors interpreted his message. Back in March, he told me, before not wearing a mask became a signifier of conservative politics, Howard actually got the most traction talking about the need for masks on conservative news shows. “Going against the CDC was very on brand,” he said. “I was on “The Laura Ingraham Angle” talking about important masks were, and she was all for it.”When the political alignments shifted, that support vanished. Although a majority of Americans report wearing masks regularly, those numbers are 16 percentage points lower among Republicanscompared to Democrats. In the last week,that is begun to shift again, with Republican leaders advocating for mask use and criticizing President Trump for not wearing one. The politicized landscape has also made it difficult to have a nuanced conversation about mask effectiveness, experts said. Public health officials who issued mandatory mask-wearing orders have found the mselves hounded by intense criticism and even death threats. More than two dozen have resigned in recent weeks. At the same time, Michael Osterholm, a public health and disease expert who is worried that mask effectiveness is being over-hyped, has also found himself threatened and harassed. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told me he is received vulgar em ails from people who read his statements questioning the efficacy of cloth masks. Osterholm said that his position was not that masks should not be worn — he wears one in public, himself — but that there is limited data on how effective DIY cloth masks are at stopping small particles, either from passing through or being forced out the sides of the mask. Without that information, he said, physical distancing and isolation remain the most important tools in stopping the spread of the coronavirus. But as more Republicans say the worst of the coronavirus is behind us, and usage of masks tracks tightly along the partisan spectrum, Osterholm told me he felt like well-meaning people were making him out to be a pandemic denialist. The on-off, yes-no nature of this debate has also been frustrating for Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale. Circumstances may mean that for some people the benefits of wearing a mask may not outweigh the risks. “There are conversations i na lot of Black and brown communities… ‘[Does]the risk and threat in terms of personal safety go up wearing a mask because of police action and being seen as a threat?’” she said. At the same time, though, Nunez-Smith said masks might actually be more important for those communities because the distancing and isolation favored by experts like Osterholm has not really been possible. Black workers are more likely than other workers to have jobs that are classified as essential. Because of that, reopening means something different for predominantly Black neighborhoods than it does for white neighborhoods. That also applies to the idea of social distancing and how practical that even is — something that could account for whyself-reported mask usage is higher among nonwhite Americans, despite the possible police risk. “These are important contextual conversations,” Nunez-Smith said. Ultimately, experts said, all the nuance and complication around masks is a challenge that public health messaging has to face up to. It is difficult to make one-size-fits-all recommendations for situations that do not readily lend the mselves to a one-size-fits-all reality. The good news is that the re is more agreement than disagreement on where to start. Just look at Osterholm and Howard, two experts who might easily be seen as having opposing viewpoints in this battle. Yet they hold similar positions on one issue: They both wish the CDC would have given the public the nuanced information about masks back in March and trusted them to understand it. Granted, that might mean presenting the public with a complex message, such as: “We do not know how well cloth masks work, so distancing should come first, but masks are likely to work to some extent and not everyone can distance the mselves.” That is a mouthful and harder to fit on a bumper sticker than “yes, you should,” or “no, you should not.” But it comes down to what builds trust more: certainty or honesty?“We owe it to the public to help them understand what kind of protections they are getting,” Osterholm said. “We owe it to the public to tell them what we know.”",2,1,FiveThirtyEight

633,"Here Are The 11 Dumbest, Most Slanted Questions Asked By Chris Wallace",21.33,27.67,https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/30/here-are-the-11-dumbest-most-slanted-questions-asked-by-chris-wallace,https://adfontesmedia.com/federalist-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,25,"Chris Wallace received negative marks for his constant interruptions of President Donald Trump, and for his poor time management, but the worst thing about his moderation of the first presidential debate on Tuesday were the questions he asked. Here are the 11 dumbest, most slanted questions asked by Wallace.“This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?” Wallace asked. Wallace is framing of the issue here was factually false and designed to make Trump look racist. Not only did he misconstrue the objectively racist idea of critical race theory as “racial sensitivity training,” but he the n followed up Trump is answer on the issue with another trick question, “What is radical about racial sensitivity training?”It is not true that Trump banned diversity training from federal agencies, only trainings that teach racist, anti-American ideas such as “critical race theory” or “white privilege.”Sohrab Ahmari was one of many Fox debate watchers who was appalled by the question,tweeting an excerpt of a story that showed that the activities that were banned were blatantly racist, such as:The trainers the n ask “white managers” to create “safe spaces,” where black employees can explain “what it means to be black” and to be “seen in their pain.” White staffers are instructed to keep silent and to “sit in the discomfort” of their racism. If any conflicts arise, the trainers ­insist that whites “do not get to decide when someone is being too emotional, too rash [or] too mean.” Whites are told they ca not protest if a person of color “responds to their oppression in a way [they] do not like.”Trump effectively answered the question, by pointing out that critical race theory teaches hatred of America and that this is unacceptable, but Wallace appeared to only know how the New York Times characterizes the racist belief system.“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left-wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we have seen in Portland?” Wallace asked. This was Wallace is most disgusting question. While Antifa, which has organizations throughout the country, has set fire to cities across the country, there is no evidence whatsoever that violence in Kenosha was caused by white supremacists. President Trump has repeatedly condemned white supremacists. What a ridiculous question from Chris Wallace.#Debates2020pic.twitter.com/kuTsHBcKKf— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)September 30, 2020Wallace also refused to accept Trump is answer of “sure” and “I am willing to do anything…I want to see peace,” instead, choosing to press him on “specifically” condemning white supremacy.“Well do it, sir,” Wallace said, joined by Biden.“Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I will tell you what, somebody is got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem this is a left-wing,” Trump replied. That debate was garbage but this is the actual transcript of the white supremacy exchange. Trump did not ""refuse"" to denounce white supremacy, as much of the media is now saying. Look at his first reply. Sure, take issue with how he handled the q, but do not misinform people.pic.twitter.com/TIg2WSxKVj— Emily Jashinsky (@emilyjashinsky)September 30, 2020“Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?” Wallace asked, minutes after Trump explained his COVID-19 vaccine plan. Wallace felt the need to ask why a presidential candidate was campaigning on-the-ground and the n insinuated that maybe he should not be campaigning because of COVID-19. This matches the Democrat Party talking point about COVID-19 requiring the banning of children from schools, the closure of businesses, and the denial of conservative First Amendment activities such as church and political gathering. But as demonstrated by the widespread media support for mass gatherings and riots in support of the BLM agenda, this is not a genuine concern but one deployed for partisan political gain.“I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case, decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, ‘Whether justice could be equally applied in America.’ Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?”Moderators can ask a question neutrally, they can ask a question adopting the framing of the left, or they can ask a question adopting the framing of the right. In every single case, Wallace adopted the framing of the left. Here, that framing resulted in a softball question that Biden had no difficulty responding to and quickly moving past, even if his answer that he believed America was a systematically racist country should have earned a follow-up. “What is your responsibility for this inherently racist country, given your 47 years in public life?” Wallace might have asked. But he did not. He also could have asked about the Biden is running mateKamala Harrisaccusing him of racism during the primary.“Mr. President, you said, ‘I do not think the science knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?”Wallace clarified his leading question by asking if Trump really believed in climate change, why would he have made the policy changes he did.“But, sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?” Wallace continued. Chris Horner replied:At no point did Wallace consider the possibility that policy makers could protect the environment without murdering jobs. He did not seem aware of the possibility that large regulatory frameworks ostensibly about environmental protection are actually about building up the unaccountable administrative state. Separately, he did not ask Biden any similar questions about science acceptance such as why, if he believes in science, he supports legalized ending of human lives via abortion and forcing taxpayers to fund the practice against their conscience. And as Andy McCarthy points out, it was not Wallace who pressed Biden on his support of the Green New Deal, but Trump. Biden does not support the Green New Deal. Oh, Wallace got that out of him?No, Trump did. Oh, well, did Wallace clarify what is parts of Green New Deal Biden is against?No, needed to move on …— Andy McCarthy (@AndrewCMcCarthy)September 30, 2020When the question came around to Biden, he had forgotten what the topic was, saying “I ca not remember which of all his rantings …” Wallace laughed, said, “I am having a little trouble myself,” and they had a moment of shared hatred of Trump. Wallace the n helped him along repeatedly, prodding him totalk about the economy and the environment. Minutes earlier, Biden had denied that he supported the Green New Deal. But the n he said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.” Wallace asked him if he did, in fact, support the Green New Deal. He once again returned to claiming he did not. “No, I do not support the Green New Deal.” His web site, however, supports the radical Green New Deal policy co-sponsored by his running mate Kamala Harris, and lists it as a“crucial framework” for addressing climate change” on his campaign website.“Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?”“As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five-plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election?”Wallace continued his not-so-subtle suggestion that Trump might not accept the election results by throwing in this question about the legitimacy of this election. What Wallace failed to mention was that many Hillary Clinton voters in 2016 claimed they did not accept the legitimate results of the election. Even recently, Hillary Clinton has claimed that the election was “stolen” from her.“You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it is rigged, that it is going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?”It is unclear what Wallace was attempting to get at in asking this question. The media have repeatedly conflated absentee ballots, military ballots, and established state-based mail-in-balloting with a rush to implement universal mail-in balloting. That rush has already led to problems. By asking this question, Wallace seemed to reject the idea that voter fraud might actually make this election susceptible to questions of the legitimacy he referred to in his previous questions. Wallace reiterated this idea by clarifying that mail-in voting fraud is not the problem.“The biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?”Wallace asked this question after Trump had already given an answer for how much he paid in federal income taxes those years. This general question is a great example of how Wallace takes his direction from the New York Times, even though the New York Times has not published its evidence in support of its claim about how much Trump paid in taxes, and even though Trump is attorneys have said on the record that Trump paid millions in those years. While Wallace thought this was a fitting question, he never asked Joe Biden about his son and brother profiting from foreign governments while he was vice president, even though the information about said profiteering came from official Treasury Department reports that were obtained by Senate investigators. When Trump attempted to bring up Hunter Biden is relations with Russia, pointing out that Hunter “made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places” after Biden became vice president, Wallace wrote him off claiming that “the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects.”“We have already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. As the moderator, sir, I am going to make a judgment call here,” Wallace said, changing the segment to focus on climate change. Wallace also refused to ask Joe Biden any questions about his involvement in the Russia collusion hoax, an elaborate scheme to tie Donald Trump to nefarious activities by Russia. Despite promises to circle back to discuss the topic of abortion that came up during the segment about Trump is Supreme Court nomination Amy Coney Barrett, Wallace never brought it up again, even when he decided to ask science questions.“Well, all right. All right. Let is talk. We have got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We have got a lot of time. On healthcare, and the n we will come back to Roe V Wade,” Wallace said. That unpacking, though, did not require any extra effort on Wallace is part when he failed to push Biden after he refused to comment on Court-packing. In the end, it was Trump who continued to press Biden while Wallace moved on.",0,0,The Federalist
634,Top Dems Say They are Working on a ‘Public Option’ Health Care Plan,-1.67,47.67,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/05/26/Top-Dems-Say-They-re-Working-Public-Option-Health-Care-Plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"Two key Democratic lawmakers overseeing health policy on Wednesday announced they will look to craft legislation to create a government-run “public option” for health coverage, pushing ahead on one of President Joe Biden is campaign promises even as the president has focused on other parts of his agenda. Representative Frank Pallone (D-NJ), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen Patty Murray (D-WA), chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, put out a call for ideas on how to design the legislation.“We believe bold steps are necessary in order to achieve universal coverage and lower health care costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed “to all interested parties.” “As we work to craft legislation, our priority is to establish a federally administered public option that provides quality, affordable health coverage throughout the USs.”Their request asks for answers to eight broad questions, such as who should be eligible to enroll in a government-run plan, how benefits and payments should be structured and what kind of premium assistance should be offered. Biden campaigned on creating a Medicare-like public option, pitching the idea as part of a plan to build on Obamacare — an alternative to calls from Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and others to eliminate private coverage entirely and transition to a single-payer “Medicare for All” system. But, despite some pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden has left a public option out of his major policy proposals thus far and reportedly will not include i tin his forthcoming budget request even as he reiterates his support for the idea. The president has instead pushed plans to make Obamacare plans more affordable and accessible. Insurers and hospitals oppose a public option and critics have argued that it would ultimately lead to “a one-size-fits-all” government health insurance system. The American Hospital Association said in a statementWednesday that it opposes a public option because “inadequate reimbursement rates” would raise the risk of hospital closures. Why it matters:The letter from Pallone and Murray “is the first indication that Democrats are still serious about the idea” of a public option,saysVox is Dylan Scott. And Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation calls it “a serious effort by Senator Murray and Representative Pallone to take the public option from bumper sticker to workable legislation.”A public option enjoys broad support in polls, with more than two-thirds of adults in an October 2020 Kaiser Family Foundationtracking poll— including 40% of Republicans — saying they strongly favor or somewhat favor the idea. But, as the questions in the Pallone-Murray letter suggest, a host of issues still need to be addressed, with reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and drug companies atop that list. “A public option has the potential to reduce prices and make health care more affordable, but the further it goes in that direction, the bigger the blowback will be from the health care industry,” Levitt told theAssociated Press. And while the industry pushes back, Republicans may also be likely to renew their attacks labeling the Democratic proposals as “socialist.”The bottom line:While it is notable that two leading Democrats are working on a public option, the re is no sign any legislation has a chance of passing in the near term.",2,2,Fiscal Times

Without naming her directly, the Senate minority leader said in a statement on Mondayreported by The Hillthat someone who supports the conspiracy the ories Greene has promoted is “not living in reality” and is not using their time in Congress to focus on helping American families.“Somebody who is suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr. is airplane is not living in reality,” McConnell reportedly said in the statement. “This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.”Greene responded Monday night by tweeting, “The real cancer for the Republican Party is weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully.”Social media posts have recently surfaced showcasing the wide range of conspiracy the ories that Greene has supported. She has liked or favorited posts that call for the murder of various Democratic politicians. She has suggested that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a government conspiracy and that the California wildfires were started by a laser beam from space operated by Jewish bankers. A recently surfaced video shows her harassing Parkland survivor and gun reform activist David Hoggjust weeks after the mass shooting, calling him a “coward” and claiming he was being funded by billionaire George Soros. House Democrats have said they are ready to move forward with removing Greene from any committees in the House of Representatives if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) does not take action and strip the representative of her assignments. In 2019, the GOP stripped the n- Representative Steve King (R-IA) of assignments after he inquired how language like white supremacy “became offensive”during an interview with The New York Times.“Republican members will have the chance to distance the mselves from her,” columnist Michelle Goldbergwrote in The Times. “If they do not, it will be because they know she belongs.”Representative Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) has 61 co-sponsors on a resolution to expel Greene from Congress, which he hopes to introduce this week, according to his spokesperson. A two-thirds majority vote is required for such an expulsion, which is why it rarely happens — but it has happened before. Roll Callreportsthat 20 members of Congress have been expelled in the past, with the most recent example being the late former Representative James Traficant Jr. (D-OH), expelled in 2002 after he was convicted on 10 felony counts including bribery, racketeering, and fraud. McConnell is one of a small handful of GOP lawmakers who have spoken out against the QAnon-promoting Greene, though pressure has been mounting for other Republicans to respond. The Senate minority leader had earlier signaled potential support for and the n ambiguity regarding voting to impeach former President Donald Trump, whose Senate trial begins next week. McConnell, one of Trump is most powerful allies through his entire presidency,blamed the ex-presidentfor provoking the deadly mob that attacked the US Capitol on January 6. But the n he was one of 45 Republicans who voted last week in support of dismissing the trial. Separately, McConnellgave a statement to CNNdefending Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY), one of10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trumpin January. Trump loyalists in the GOPhave been calling for Cheney, who voted with the ex-president nearly 93% of the time, to be stripped of her third-ranking position in the party. Last week, Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL)traveled to Wyomingto call for voters to force her out of office in 2022.""Liz Cheney is a leader with deep convictions and the courage to act on the m,"" McConnell said in the statement to CNN. ""She is an important leader in our party and in our nation. I am grateful for her service and look forward to continuing to work with her on the crucial issues facing our nation.""",1,1,NowThis News

President Biden, who was already working on rolling out new domestic terror policies well before January sixth,confirmed after the riot that he is making these new measures a priority. Political internet censorship is becoming increasingly normalized, anti-protest bill sare being passed, and now we are seeing liberals encouraged to form “digital armies”to spy on Trump supporters to report them to the authorities. And an amazingly large percentage of the US population seems to have no problem with any of this, even in sectors of the political spectrum that should really know better by now.“What else can we do?” they reason. “What other solution could there possibly be to the threat of dangerous fascists and conspiracy the orists continuing to gain power and influence?”Well the re is a whole lot that can be done, and none of it includes consenting to sweeping new Patriot Act-like authoritarian measures or encouraging monopolistic Silicon Valley plutocrats to censor worldwide political speech. There is just a whole lot of mass-scale narrative manipulation going on to keep it from being obvious to everyone. The New Domestic War on Terror is Coming— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald)January 19, 2021The way to stem the tide of Trumpism (or fascism, or white supremacism, or Trump cultism, or whatever term you use for what you are worried about here) is to eliminate the conditions that created it. Trump was only able to launch his successful faux-populist campaign in the first place by exploiting the widespread pre-existing opinion that there was a swamp that needed draining, a corrupt political system whose leadership does not promote the interests of the people. Conspiracy the ories only exist because the government often does evil things and lies about them with the help of the mass media, forcing people to just guess what is happening behind the opaque wall of government secrecy. People only get it in their heads that they need a trustworthy strongman to overhaul the system if the system has failed them. People who are actually interested in ending Trumpism would be promoting an end to the corruption in the political system, an end to the opacity of their government, an end to their uniquely awful electoral system, and an end to the neo liberal policies which have been making Americans poorer and poorer with less and less support from the government which purports to protect them. But these changes are not being promoted by the US political/media class, because the US political/media class speaks for an empire that depends on these things. Without corruption, the plutocratic class could notuse campaign donations and corporate lobbying to install and maintain politicians who will advance their interests. Without government secrecy, the oligarchic empire could not conspire in secret to advance the military and economic agendas which form the glue that holds the empire together. Without a lying mass media, people isconsent could not be manufactured for wars and a system which does not serve their interests. Without widespread poverty and domestic austerity, people could not be kept too busy and politically impotent to challenge the massive political influence of the plutocrats. Since the day of the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, at least nine states have introduced 14 anti-protest bills.— The Intercept (@theintercept)January 22, 2021So the option of stopping the rise of Trumpism by changing the system is taken off the table, which is why you never hear it discussed as a possibility in mainstream circles. The only option people are being offered to debate the pros and cons of is giving more powers to that same corrupt system which created Trump, powers which will be under the control of the next Trumpian figure who is elevated by that very system. You are not going to prevent fascism by creating a big authoritarian monster to stomp it into silence, and even if you could you would only be stopping the fascism by becoming the fascism. To stop the rise of fascism you need to actually change. Drastically. Believing you can just make it go away without changing your situation is like believing you can avert an oncoming train by putting your hands over your eyes. There is no valid argument against what I am saying here. Saying the powerful will not allow any positive change is just confirming everything I am saying and confirming the need to remove the powerful from power. Saying that ending corruption, government secrecy and injustice would just be giving the terrorists what they want would be turning yourself into a bootlicker of such cartoon ish obsequiousness there are not words in the English language adequate to mock you. Yes, change is desperately needed. Yes, the powerful will resist that change with everything they have. But the alternative is letting them plunge the world into darkness and destruction.at Medium.

638,Democrats Have 1 Option Left,-12.67,29.67,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/supreme-court-voting-rights-filibuster/619341/ ,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"Today is 6–3 Supreme Court decision is a hinge point for American democracy. Today isSupreme Court decision further weakening the Voting Rights Actaffirmed that the only way Democrats can reverse the wave of restrictive voting laws in GOP-controlled states is to pass new federal voting rights by curtailing the Senate filibuster. Congressional action has long seemed the only realistic lever for Democrats to resist red states’ surge of voter-suppression laws, which are passing,as I have written, on an almost entirely party-line basis. In the state legislatures, Democrats lack the votes to stop these laws. And while the John Roberts–led Supreme Court—which opened the door to these restrictions by eviscerating another section of the Voting Rights Act in his 2013decision—always seemed unlikely to restrain the Republican-controlled states, to day is ruling from the six GOP-appointed justices eliminated any doubt. Republicans will understandably view Justice Samuel Alito is majority opinion upholding two disputed Arizona statutes as a green light to pass voting restrictions that could disproportionately limit the ability of minority groups to vote: “Even if the plaintiffs were able to demonstrate a disparate [racial] burden caused by [the Arizona laws], the State is ‘compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election procedures’ would suffice to avoid [VRA] liability,” Alito wrote. Republican legislators will likely interpret Alito is repeated emphasis in his decision on the importance of stopping “fraud” and his somewhat gratuitous swipes at voting by mail, both of which echo the mes from former President Donald Trump, as much more than a wink and a nod of approval for the laws that are proliferating across red states. (“Fraud is a real risk that accompanies mail-in voting even if Arizona had the good fortune to avoid it,” Alito insisted at one point.) If anything, Alito is decision, which all the other GOP-appointed justices joined, underscores how thoroughly the determination to restrict voting access in the name of combatting illusory “fraud” has permeated every corner of the GOP. (Even the rare GOP critics of Trump is discredited fraud claims, such as Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, have also defended the restrictive new state laws.)Read: Watch what is happening in red statesWhile the ruling signals long odds for the Justice Department is effort to challenge those laws (starting with Georgia is) in court, civil- and voting-rights advocates might welcome the clarity the decision provides. It makes plain that if Congress does not establish new federal standards, the nation is headed toward a two-tier voting system, with red states imposing ever-tightening restrictions that especially burden Democratic-leaning constituencies—young, minority, and lower-income voters. It is no coincidence that red states are imposing these restrictions precisely as Millennials and Gen Zers, who represent the most racially diverse generations in American history, are rapidly increasing their share of the total vote,as I wrote earlier today. The rise of those younger generations especially threatens the GOP hold on Sun Belt states such as Georgia, Texas, and Arizona, which Republicans now control through their dominance of older and non-urban white voters; in that way, the voting restrictions Republicans are enacting amount to stacking sandbags against a rising tide of demographic change. After a Republican filibuster blocked their sweeping voting-rights bill,Senate Democrats are working to unify behind a more limited plan—and to persuade holdout Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (and perhaps others) to change the filibuster rules to pass it. Following to day is decision, the demands from civil-rights groups on Senate Democrats and Biden to change the rules will grow even more intense. Read: Manchin and Sinema now face the weight of history“Our elected leaders need to wake up and start acting like the house is on fire—because it is, and this ruling pours more gasoline on the flames,” Nsé Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project, said today in a statement that was echoed widely by other groups. “Black and Brown communities gave Democrats federal power to protect the vote and passing bills like the For the People Act is what we both expect and deserve.”With more measured (though no less passionate) language, the fierce dissent from Justice Elena Kagan and the other Democratic-appointed justices seemed to be sending the same message. They obviously never endorsed any legislation, but their tone reminded me of the pleas to the Senate majority (particularly Manchin and Sinema)from Democratic legislators in the states passing these restrictive laws., the justices seemed to be saying: Now it is up to Congress whether to protect democracy at what Kagan called “a perilous moment for the Nation is commitment to equal citizenship.”",1,1,The Atlantic

The rule went into effect late Saturday for the nation is largest county, home to 11 million people, where a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases is led by the highly transmissible delta variant. The vast majority of new cases are among unvaccinated people, LA County Supervisor Hilda Solis said Sunday.“I am not pleased that we have to go back to using the masks in this matter but, nonetheless, it is going to save lives. And right now that to me is what is most important,” Solis said on ABC is “ This Week.”California has seen a steady rise in virus cases since the state fully reopened its economy on June 15 and did away with capacity limits and social distancing. San Francisco Bay Area health officials last week urged residents to again wear masks inside public buildings, offices or businesses regardless of whether they are vaccinated. The counties of San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Alameda, Contra Costa and Sonoma and the city of Berkeley stopped short of making face coverings a requirement. Other counties, including Sacramento and Yolo, are also strongly urging people to wear masks indoors but not requiring it. Los Angeles County is mask rule, announced Thursday, follows a winter where the region experienced a massive surge in infections and deaths, with hospitals overloaded with COVID-19 patients and ambulances idling outside, waiting for beds to open. Los Angeles County reported a caseload of 1,827 on Saturday — the eighth straight day with more than a thousand new cases. On June 15, when the state reopened, county health officials reported just 210 new cases. More than 500 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in LA County on Friday, the highest number since April 14. There were 11 new virus-related deaths reported Saturday. Solis said that the LA County mask rule is “not punishment, it is prevention.” But some vaccinated residents said it felt like they were being penalized despite doing the right thing.“It feels like the burden of the unvaccinated is being placed on the vaccinated,” Glendale resident Justin Sevakis told ABC7. “It is like there are people that do not have common sense and so the refore all of us have to pay for it.

On February 27 at 2 a.m. ET, the House of Representatives approved Biden is $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package in a 219-212 vote, with Republicans unanimously rejecting the legislation. So,what is in Biden is first 2021 stimulus package?Here is what you need to know. Biden first unveiled his proposal, dubbed the ""American Rescue Plan,"" on January 14 to overwhelming public support. Per February 24 data from Morning Consult,76% of voters (including 60% of Republicans) support the legislation. The relief plan is largely aimed at providing public relief amid the economic fallout from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which, as of March 1,has killed over 513,000 Americans, per. If approved by the Senate with no changes, the plan will provide $1,400 in direct payments to qualifying Americans, a$400 weekly boost to regular unemployment benefits through September 2021, and $40 billion in grants to higher education institutions, among other things. Through executive orders, Biden has also extended eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, and placed pauses on federal student loan payments. Thebill would provide the $1,400 payments to individuals making up to $75,000 a year, phasing out for individuals earning $100,000 and more. Significantly, this version of the payment would also apply to adult dependents, like college students, according to CNBC Per Vox, the bill also addresses some major national problems highlighted by the pandemic: it allocates $40 billion in grants to colleges, with the majority meant to go to emergency financial aid for students. It also provides$25 billion toward emergency rent and utility assistance, and allocates$7.6 billion to expand internet connectivity to both teachers and students in remote learning situations. It also includes aid such as disaster relief, food assistance, child care, vaccine distribution, and aid for restaurants among its provisions. However, the package may undergo some major changes to pass through the Senate and make it to the Oval Office to be signed into law. Congressional Republicans have been pushing back on the bill is price tag, and on January 31, presented their own smaller$600 billion stimulus plan. Perthe plan would cut direct payments from $1,400 to just $1,000, and completely eliminate Biden is push for a $15 federal minimum wage.""We know that the bill will look different on the way out [of the Senate]than it did when [Biden] presented it in his prime time address,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on February 28. ""But there is an urgency here,"" she added. ""Because by [March 14], 11 million Americans will lose unemployment insurance, so we need to move quickly and rapidly to get this relief out to the Americans.""One major change has already been made: On February 25, nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonoughruled against Biden is push to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of the stimulus, on the grounds that the wage increase was outside the parameters of what was allowed underreconciliation— the process by which Democrats are trying to pass the stimulus. Reconciliation is a fast-track path to passing budget legislation in the Senate with a simple 51-vote majority, but it also comes with limitations on what can be included in a bill. While congressional Democrats seem determined to overturn the decision, Psaki stated thatBiden ""respects the parliamentarian is decision and the Senate is process.""Additionally, neither the bill nor the executive orders include forgiveness for student debt, backtracking — at least for the moment — on aBiden campaign promise. In a February 16 CNN town hall, Biden shot down congressional Democrats' call to cancel $50,000 in loans with an executive order. ""I will not make that happen,"" he said. ""I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I do not think I have the authority to do it,"" he added. During his first days in office, however, Biden issued an executive order to put apa use on payment expectations through September 2021. Democrats are racing to pass the bill through both congressional chambers before federal unemployment benefits begin lapsing for many Americans in mid-March. Per Insider, the Senate will examine and possibly revise the relief package from March 2 to March 5. If changes are made, the bill will go back to the House as early as March 8 for a secondary vote. Congressional Democrats aim to have the bill signed into law by March 14.

The bill, which Mr. Bidenwill send to Congress after he is sworn in Wednesday, is more a policy statement than a serious piece of legislation, with almost no chance of being enacted in a form close to how it is written. But it lays down a marker for Mr. Biden, for whom immigration, more than any other issue, provides a stark contrast with President Trump. The bill would be the most generous immigration policy in US history, wiping away barriers for illegal immigrants to integrate into American society. Mr. Bidenwants to end the bar that requires those who have been in the country for some time without permission to go home and wait 10 years before being able to come in legally. And he would create an opportunity for people who have been deported under President Trump to request to be allowed back into the country. The bill is light on new security measures, instead focusing on leniency and reversing the direction Mr. Trump had set. Where Mr. Trump had proposed ending the diversity lottery that doles out visas on the basis of luck, Mr. Bidenis proposing a nearly 50% expansion of that program.“The legislation modernizes our immigration system, and prioritizes keeping families together, growing our economy, responsibly managing the border with smart investments, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, and ensuring that the USs remains a refuge for those fleeing persecution,” the Biden team said in detailing the bill. The crux of the bill is a generous legalization program for most of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country. It would grant immediate legal status to illegal immigrant Dreamers and those here under special humanitarian protections. Other illegal immigrants would have to go through a process with a five-year wait before obtaining a green card signifying permanent legal status. Both Dreamers and other illegal immigrants would get a new, speedy chance at citizenship, with just a three-year wait between a green card and eligibility to naturalize. Mr. Trump had proposed a much smaller immigration legalization in 2018, suggesting a deal that would combine an offer of citizenship rights to some Dreamers in exchange for border wall money, changes to the chain of family migration and an end to the visa lottery. Democrats rejected his suggestion outright, insisting they would not bargain for Dreamers. Before that, the previous major attempt at legalization came in 2013, when the so-called “Gang of Eight” senators came up with a broad bill that would have offered a chance at citizenship to between 7 million and 8 million illegal immigrants and a guest-worker program giving future workers a path to citizenship, too, in exchange for some new border security measures. Of those eight senators, all four Democrats and two Republicans are still in the chamber. One of them. Senator Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, will take the lead on the new bill.“I know all too well from my work with the ‘Gang of Eight’ that passing immigration reform through the USs Congress will be a challenging task. However, there is a moral and economic imperative to get this done,” he said. One of the Republicans from the Gang of Eight, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, has already declared Mr. Biden is plan a non-starter. He said there are too many other issues already stacked up, and besides, Mr. Biden‘s offer does not include any new enforcement standards.“There are many issues I think we can work cooperatively with President-electBiden, but a blanket amnesty for people who are here unlawfully is not going to be one of the m,” Mr. Rubio said.

Although the virus has spread fast throughout the country, its threat was not enough to dissuade the government of the most-populous Indian state from conducting a mass tree-planting campaign along the banks of the river Ganges as part of its pledge to shade a third of the nation under tree cover by 2030. The nation is target acreage of235 million acres would represent an area the size of Texas and New Mexico combined. The planting was carried out last week by volunteers, nonprofit employees, government workers, and even lawmakers, all of whom maintained distance from each other and wore face masks to stop the possible spread of coronavirus.“We are committed to increase the forest cover of Uttar Pradesh to over 15% of the total land area in next five years,” said the state is chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, pictured above during the campaign is inauguration ceremony.“In to day is campaign, over 20 million trees will be planted at the banks of the Ganges river, which will help in keeping this mighty river clean.”:Pakistan Hires Thousands of Newly-Unemployed Laborers for Ambitious 10 Billion Tree-Planting InitiativeMany nations have targeted 2030 as the deadline for various sustainability-related goals, to coincide with the UN is 18 Sustainable Development Goals designed to encourage nations to solve the world is largest problems, such as poverty, hunger, pollution, access to clean water, education access, and more.

646,Systemic Racism in the US,-9.67,43.0,https://www.theskimm.com/news/systemic-racism-us-2f9M0RPl3VEuCAA5pSoZNr,https://adfontesmedia.com/skimm-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-19,25,"The recent violence and deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and others have once again pushed the US to reckon with systemic racism that dates back to the founding of this country. With being up front about the fact that systemic racism is so expansive and deep-rooted that no guide will be able to accurately depict the hundreds of years of injustice it is caused Black people in the US But let is start by getting on the same page about what defines systemic racism. It refers to systems and practices that create and maintain racial inequality. Even though slavery was officially abolished in the 1860s, racism and discrimination have continued to persist throughout nearly every facet of American life. In the years and decades immediately following the end of slavery, certain policies sanctioned discrimination against Black people. Probably none more so than Jim Crow laws. Good. Between the late 1800s and mid-1900s (yes, nearly three quarters of a century), southern states implemented as et of laws that segregated Black and white people in all aspects of life: education, housing, public transportation, restaurants, prisons, drinking fountains, bathrooms, the list goes on. This system was sanctioned by a Supreme Court decision that upheld the “separate but equal” doctrine. In reality, the spaces Black people had access towere rarely equal to those of white people, if they existed at all. During this time, Black people were frequently terrorized and killed by whites and white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan – with more than 3,000 Black people beinglynched, according to the NAACP While segregation in public places was banned with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Jim Crow laws reinforced a systemic structure of inequality that we still see today. Let is get into the areas of our society where we see this playing out…Home ownership can be a significant way to build wealth in the US But Black Americans have long been left out. First, because they were not legally allowed to own property as enslaved people. And later, because of a series of federal and local policies, including segregated federal housing projects andredlining. Redlining is a practice that started in the 1930s to determine which neighborhoods were worthy of mortgage loans. Neighborhoods that were considered a higher credit risk were outlined in red. Guess who mostly lived in those neighborhoods? The practice kept Black people from being able to buy homes and it was not banned until the 1960s. The federal gov passed theFair Housing Act. It bans discrimination when it comes to buying or renting a home, applying for a mortgage, or receiving public housing. Butexperts say the effects of redlining are still visible today. In 2019, Black home ownership fell to are cord low since the Census Dept began keeping track. At one point that year, the home ownership rate among white people was 73%, compared to 40.6% among Black people. One study from 2018 found that three out of four neighborhoods that were redlined decades ago are low-to-moderate income to day, and more likely to be made up of minority residents. On the flip side, the study found that neighborhoods that were considered a safe investment during the redlining era now have higher incomes and are predominantly white. And all of this affects not just where Black Americans live, but the type of schools they go to as well. Which brings us to…In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional with the landmark case Brown vs Board of Education. But most schools were not actually integrated for years. And data shows that US schools have become more, not less, segregated in recent decades. Afterthe Brown case,some school districts made voluntary efforts to integrate. But not all. A subsequent1971 Supreme Court decision upheld mandatory busing programs to integrate schools. That was the practic eof transporting kids outside of their neighborhood to achieve diversity in schools. Both white and Black students were bused, but it was more common for Black students to have to travel. But people fought it. Many white parents fled to the suburbs or to private schools, making it harder to maintain racially-diverse schools. Some groups of kids were confronted withviolence, including crowds throwing bricks at school buses holding Black children in Boston. And in the ‘90s, a number of court rulings against busing were issued, saying it had worked and did not need to continue. But a2019 study found that since 1988, the number of schools that enroll 90-100% non-white students has more than tripled. And minority students are increasingly concentrated in schools with higher rates of poverty. A lot of it has to do with the fact that school districts rely heavily on local taxes and poorer areas have less tax income. Meaning that communities with low-income households are automatically getting less money dedicated to their local schools. One study found schools that mostly serve students of color got$23 billion less funding than mostly white school districts, or about $2,200 less per student. And with fewer resources comes an achievement gap, where minority students typically have lower standardized test scores than white students. Research shows that the gap narrows when schools are integrated. But until the n, it means that millions of Black students are facing a disadvantage – especially when it comes to... There is a history of discrimination setting Black Americans back in the workforce. After slavery was abolished, “black codes” – laws that restricted work opportunities – became the precursor to Jim Crow laws. For example: South Carolina is black code reportedly said Black people could only work as farmers or servants unless they paid an annual tax. If anyone violated the laws, they could be arrested or face fines. Number And laws like this lasted for decades...until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned employment discrimination based on people is race,among other things. And set up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees enforcement of civil rights laws in the workplace. Black people continue to face discrimination in hiring and at work. Studies show that companies are more likely to call back a candidate who has a name that is more commonly associated with white people. Black workers reportedly account for 26% of EEOCdiscrimination claims...but only make up 13% of the workforce. Many of these claims detail racism, from the specific work employees are assigned (eg: getting more difficult assignments than white coworkers) to how much they are paid compared to white counterparts. Black Americans are more likely to be unemployed or have low-paying jobs compared to white Americans. That is in part due to education disparities. Butstudies showBlack workers earn less than white workers even when they have the same education. That brings us to the fact that…There is also the racial wage gap: theEconomic Policy Institutesays that in 2017, Black men made about 70 cents for every $1 their white counterpart made. The gap is especially large when it comes to Black women, who in 2017 made about 61 cents for every $1 a white man made. The EEOC says discrimination is more likely to happen in a less diverse workspace. Diversity and inclusion experts say employers need to make a more conscious effort to hire Black workers. Retention is also key, because that will help Black employees grow and develop their careers and get promoted into high-level positions, where they can be part of companies’ decision-making processes. Referrals can also make a difference. Research shows that one-third of jobs have been filled by referrals. But one study found women of color are35% less likely to receive a referral than wh hit e men. One thing that is certain is that inequality in employment also leads to…Disparities in housing, education, and employment have all contributed to the large wealth gap that exists today between Black and white Americans. In 2016, the median wealth of white households = $171,000. That is 10 times higher than the median wealth of Black households, which = $17,100. Yes, 10 times. US census data from 2018 shows that about 1 in 5 Black people in the US live in poverty. Inheritance also contributes to the wealth gap. The Federal Reserve says that not only are white Americans twice as likely to receive an inheritance than Black Americans, but it is also usually much larger. This sets up the next generation of Black Americans to fall financially behind. Activists say that closing the wealth gap is key to addressing systemic racism in America. There have been a few ideas thrown around, like…. Which would compensate the descendants of enslaved people. Lawmakers have intro’d legislation to start studies on it – somethingPresident Bidenhas backed. Supporterssay reparations would help give Black Americans a chance at equality after being set back for centuries. Opponentssay it would likely be a huge cost and say Americans today should not be held responsible for slavery.. Many tax cuts benefit the wealthy, since they focus on things like home ownership and investments. But economists argue that providing tax cuts for poorer families could help them have a better standard of living, save money, and increase their wealth.. The federal minimum wage has remained $7.25/hour for over a decade – and the re is been a push to increase it to$15/houramid the COVID-19 pandemic. While many states have a higher minimum wage, raising it nationally would help boost wages for low-income jobs. And studies show it could decrease poverty and reliance on public assistance programs like food stamps. There are major racial disparities in access to health care in the US and in the health of US citizens. Black Americans have higher rates of chronic health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease than white Americans. Black women are three to four times more likely to die from apregnancy-related death than white women. And the death rate fromCOVID-19is disproportionately high among Black Americans. Some of the health disparities can be linked to institutional racism in living conditions and higher poverty rates. Black Americans are also nearly twice as likely as white Americans to beuninsured, making them less likely to get care. There is also an underlying factor of discrimination and bias in the care Black Americans receive. The US health care system was segregated for much of the 20th century. Example: Black patients were denied entry to white hospitals or forced to stay in different wards and wings. That began to change after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the passage of Medicare in 1965. The Civil Rights Act banned segregation in programs and at institutions that got federal money. So hospitals that wanted federal funding from Medicare quickly integrated. But other racist practices continued. The Tuskegee Study. It was a 40-year experiment by the US Public Health Service. Starting in 1932, it tracked hundreds of Black men in Alabama with untreated syphilis. The patients were not told the truth about the study and were denied proper treatment for the disease. That led to some of them passing syphilis on to their families and suffering needlessly, until the study was publicly exposed in 1972. It is still linked as a reason why some Black Americans distrust the US health system to this day. Yep, especially since disparities in care have not stopped. Studies have shown Black patients are less likely to get proper treatment for pain management or heart issues than white patients. And are misdiagnosed more frequently withschizophrenia. One study even found half of white medical students and residents believed at least one myth about physiological differences between Black people and white people – like that Black people have a higher tolerance for pain. But some things are changing. Since key parts of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014,studiesshow more Americans have access to health care and insurance. And that coverage rates went up the most among Black and Hispanic Americans. Disparities in coverage still exist, but the law helped narrow them. Since the end of slavery, the US legal system has been used over and over again to sanction racial discrimination. Studies show there are still racial disparities in every step of the criminal justice system – Black people are disproportionately stopped by police,arrestedand unlikely to make bail. And they receive disproportionately higher sentences and are less likely to receiveparole. Pew Research Centersays 33% of the people sentenced to prison are Black, even though Black people make up about 12% of the adult population in the US And the US has the largest incarceration rate in the world, with more than 2 million people imprisoned in 2016. The US prison population has exploded in the last few decades. Drug-related and violent crimes in the US went up dramatically in the late 1960s, and could be due in part to increased urbanization and rising homicide rates among African Americans. Both the feds and states started adopting stricter sentencing laws. Some created racial disparities in punishments. For instance, a1986 drug lawman dated harsher punishments for crack cocaine possession (used more commonly by Black defendants) than powder cocaine (used more commonly by white defendants) – even though it is two versions of the same drug. Meaning: Black defendants were punished more harshly. There have been changes. In2010, President Obama signed a law to reduce the penalty disparity between crack and powder cocaine charges. And in2018, President Trump signed another law to apply those changes retroactively. That law also reduced mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes. Data also shows the racial disparity in incarceration rates has declined somewhat in recent years, but it is still high. Researchers say that could be due to a number of things, including criminal justice reform and falling crime rates. But the disparities in our criminal justice system still exist. And one area that is been getting a lot of national attention lately is... The police killings of Daunte Wright, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have sparked nationwide protests. But their deaths were not isolated cases. Research shows police are more likely to use force against and kill Black Americans. And the re is also a history of racism in policing in the US Some of the first police forces in the country were “slave patrols.” They were groups of men who would hunt down enslaved people who ran away and suppress rebellions. And during the Jim Crow era, Black communities were heavily policed. Some law enforcement officials were also members of the KKK There is a growing push for police reform. Some have called to de fund the police, which generally means shifting funds from police to social services. The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to disband its police force, anda number of cities have already moved toward de funding their police force. On the federal level, theHouse has passed sweeping police reform legislation. It would ban choke holds and certain no-knock warrants, and make a national database to track police misconduct. Unclear if or when the Senate will take up that bill. The 15th Amendment technically gave Black men the right to vote in the US in 1870. (Women got the right to vote in 1920.) But in reality, Black voter suppression continued for nearly another hundred years. In the Jim Crow era, southern states put up all kinds of barriers to prevent Black Americans from voting. They included poll taxes, literacy tests (and so-called “grandfather clauses” that exempted white voters from complying with these rules), intimidation, and outright violence. This began to change after the passage of theVoting Rights Actin 1965. It is considered one of the most important civil rights laws ever passed in the US The Voting Rights Act banned the use of literacy tests, called for Federal examiners in counties with a history of voting discrimination (who would register qualified citizens to vote), and required those areas to get “preclearance” before they could change voting rules. And it was hugely effective. TheUS Commission on Civil Rightsfound the voter registration rate among non-white citizens in Mississippi was 6.7% in 1964. By 1967, it was nearly 60%. Since 2010, about half the states in the US have enacted tighter rules on voting like voter ID laws, cutting early voting hours, and voter roll purges. Supporters say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. But studies show voter fraud israre, and critics point out the disproportionate impact some of these laws have on Black Americans and other minorities. Also, a Supreme Court ruling appeared to have made matters worse. In2013, the Court essentially ruled that states with a history of discrimination no longer had to get the federal gov is ok before they changed voting laws – giving states a lot more leeway. States had argued that the rule was based on decades-old data and was outdated, and the court agreed. Critics said it was still needed to prevent discrimination. Yes. Studies showBlack Americans are less likely than white Americans to have a government-issued ID (which experts say can be expensive and difficult to obtain) – making it harder to comply with voter ID laws. States like North Carolina put restrictions on early voting, which was disproportionately used by Black voters. That law was later struck down. The2018 Georgia governor is race had major allegations of suppression of Black voters because of voter roll purges and an “exact match” law that blocked someone is voter registration if the name on the voter roll did not exactly match the name on their government-issued ID And early 2021,GeorgiaandArkansaspassed voting restriction bills that do things like cut the time people have to request an absentee ballot, require a signature match for absentee ballots, limit the use of ballot drop boxes, ban handing out food and water in poll lines, and more. Racism has been part of our country since its founding and the re is no simple fix to reversing centuries of discrimination. But here is what you can do to start: Educate yourself.

647,What Distance Learning With a Disability Is Like,-5.0,38.0,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-distance-learning-with-a-disability-is-like,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"Teen Vogue isseries is exploring what back to school means for students this year, and what they think about learning during the coronavirus crisis. Distance learning has created a lot of challenges for many students, from lack of internet and technology access to increased isolation. But for students withADHDand learningdisabilities, online classes can prove near impossible. Jessica, 22, learned that the hard way when theCOVID-19pandemic forced her college courses to move online in the spring. In a video as part ofGirl Effect is Hear Her Voice series, Jessica, who has ADHD, said learning online proved troubling for her as she found herself distracted and not paying attention to her computer screen. “I feel I am very intelligent, but having to [learn] online really brought me down,” Jessica said in the clip.“I am sitting at my desk, doing my work and, five minutes later, I am distracted doing something else. It is also very difficult for me to prioritize what things I should do in what order I should do the m,” she said. “It really sucks and it makes me sad sometimes because I do not really know how to help myself.”According to theCenters for Disease Control,ADHD is a neuro-developmental disorder that makes it hard for people to concentrate or control impulses and may make them overly active. It is most often diagnosed in childhood and can last through adulthood. While ADHD is not considered a learning disability, as many ash alf of people with the disorder also have a specific learning disability. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the 2018–2019 school year, 7.1 million students in the USs had a disability;33% of those had a specific learning disability and 15% had a disability categorized under “other health impairment,” which ADHDoften falls under. A UNreportcautioned that, for students with disabilities, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely exacerbating their exclusion from education, as they are the least likely to benefit from distance learning. The report (which includes all disabilities, not just learning disabilities) cautions that these students may not have access to in-school resources that help them manage their disability. Not having access to in-person learning could be detrimental to these students’ education, which Jessica experienced firsthand. She said her grades in her online classes suffered, which was upsetting for her.“When I found out we were going to have to do online schooling for the rest of the year [in the spring], I was like, no, this ca not be. I immediately thought to myself, If this is what it is like next school year or next semester, I am not going to go to school because I just cannot learn online,” she said. On campus, Jessica said she is better able to focus in class by engaging with her educators.“The way I would stay engaged on campus and in person was by asking questions to the teacher. As I am asking questions, the teacher is talking to me specifically,” she said. This strategy, she suspected, helps other students with ADHD by breaking up the learning experience. “Having ADHD is very common — maybe there was another person with ADHD in my class and it was probably helpful for them to not always listen to the teacher and listen to someone else in the class.”To make sure students with disabilities get the education they deserve, the UN said it is important for educators to center these students, making sure they have any added resources they may need, and that they are fully included in plans to return to in-person school. Making these programs inclusive and focusing specifically on students with disabilities could make all the difference.",1,1,Teen Vogue

But the fact that progressives in Congress and even many antiwar activists also do the same is an indication of how deeply the mind sets of the nation is warfare state are embedded in the political culture of the USs. The misleading first name of the Defense Department does not justify using “defense” as an adjective for its budget. On the contrary, the ubiquitous use of phrases like “defense budget” and “defense spending” — virtually always written with a lower-case “d” — reinforces the false notion that equates the USA is humongous military operations with defense. In the real world, the USsspends more money on its military than the next 10 countries all together. Andmost of those countries are military allies. What about military bases in foreign countries? The US currently has750, while Russia has about two dozen and China hasone. The author of the landmark book “Base Nation,” American University professor David Vine, just co-wrote are port that points out “the USs has at least three times as many overseas bases as all other countries combined.” Those US bases abroad “cost taxpayers an estimated $55 billion annually.”As this autumn began, Vinenotedthat President Biden is “perpetuating the USs’ endless wars” in nations including “Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Yemen” while escalating “war-like tensions with China with a military buildup with Australia and the UK.”All this is being funded via a “defense” budget?Calling George Orwell. As Orwell wrote in a 1946essay, political language “is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” In 2021, the hot air blowing at gale force through US mass media is so continuous that we are apt to scarcely give it a second thought. But the euphemisms would hardly mean anything to those in faraway countries for whom terrifying and lethal drone attacks and other components ofUS air war sare about life and death rather than political language. You might consider the Pentagon is August 29 killing of10 Afghan civilians including seven children with a drone attack to be a case of “respectable” murder, or negligent homicide, or mere “collateral damage.” Likewise, you could look at numbers like 244,124 — a credible low-end estimate of the number of civilians directly killed during the “war on terror” in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq — and consider them to be mere data points or representing individuals whose lives are as precious as yours. But at any rate, from the vantage point of the USs, it is farfetched to claim that the billions of dollars expended for ongoing warfare in several countries are in a budget that can be legitimately called “defense.”Until 1947, the official name of the US government is central military agency was the War Department. After a two-year interim brand (with the clunk y name National Military Establishment), it was renamed the Department of Defense in 1949. As it happened, that was the same year when Orwell is dystopian novel “1984” appeared, telling of an always-at-war totalitarian regime with doublespeak slogans that included “War Is Peace.”Today, the Department of Defense remains an appropriately capitalized proper noun. But the department is official name does not make it true. To call its massive and escalating budge ta “defense” budget is nothing less than internalized corruption of language that undermines our capacities to think clearly and talk straight. While such corroded language ca not be blamed for the existence of sloppy thinking and degraded discourse, it regularly facilitates sloppy thinking and degraded discourse. Let is blow away the linguistic fog. The Pentagon budget is not a “defense” budget. Use code 30years for 30% off all Merchandise!Dismiss",1,0,CounterPunch

Texas Republican Congressman Chip Roy was among those who spoke out against the president is comments, and in the comment section of his post on Twitter about the incident, apparent Trump supporters turned out in droves to defend the president. President Trump said today of Ghislaine Maxwell that he “wish(ed) her well.”Earlier this month Maxwell was charged in federal court with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors.— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper)July 22, 2020Some of the comment ers self-confidently talked about how Maxwell should supposedly be considered innocent until proven guilty — but Epstein is crimes are not in question! This is not some case of petty theft. The president defended a woman with ties to years of documented sex crimes against minors. Specifically, he said, in reference to Maxwell:‘I just wish her well, frankly. I have met her numerous times over the years… I just wish her well, whatever it is.’It is true that Trump has met Maxwell “numerous times” — the re is photographic evidence of it. There are a significant number of photos including Trump, Maxwell, Epstein, or some combination of them and their associates.

She is an innocent citizen at the moment. You would not want anything/anyone to taint her prosecution, would you. And ""wish her well' is not exactly a ringing endorsement.

650,"From Macy is to Albertsons, facial recognition is already everywhere",-2.33,42.0,https://www.vox.com/2021/7/15/22577876/macys-ace-hardware-fight-for-the-future-facial-recognition-artificial-intelligence-stores,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Some of the US is most popular stores — includingMacy isand Albertsons — are using facial recognition on their customers, largely without their knowledge, according to the digital rights nonprofit Fight the Future. On July 14, Fight for the Future helped launch a nationwide campaign to document which of the country is biggest retailers are deploying facial recognition, and which ones have committed to not use the technology. The campaign, which has the support of more than35 human rights groups, aims to draw attention to retail stores using facial-scanning algorithms to boost their profits, intensify security systems, and even track their employees. The campaign comes as a clear reminder that the reach of facial recognition goes far beyond law enforcement and into the private, commercial storefronts we regularly visit. Experts warn that facial recognition in these spaces is particularly concerning because the technology is largely unregulated and undisclosed, meaning both customers and employees may be unaware this software is surveil ling and collecting data about them.“A lot of people would probably be surprised to know how many retailers that they shop in on a regular basis are using this technology in a variety of ways to protect their profits and maximize their profits as well,” Caitlin Seeley George, a campaign director at Fight for the Future, told Recode. While you may not have heard of it before, stores using facial recognition is not a new practice. Last year,Reutersreported that the drug chain Rite Aid had deployed facial recognition in at least 200 stores over nearly a decade (before the company suddenly committed to ditching the software). In fact, facial recognition is just one of several technologies store chains are deploying to enhance their security systems, or to otherwise surveil customers. Someretailers, for instance, have used ap ps and in-store wi fi to track users while they move around physical stores and later target them with online ads. A handful of popular stores, including the grocery chain Albertsons and Macy is, are already using facial recognition, according to Fight for the Future isdatabase. How exactly these retailers are using facial recognition can be unclear, since companies typically are not up front about it. At the same time, a growing number of technology startups and security firms are looking for opportunities to sell this software to stores. Some of these sellers are already well-known, like Clearview AI, the controversial startup that scraped billions of people is images from social media. But there are plenty of other facial recognition providers that have attracted less attention, such as firms likeAnyVision, which announced it had raised $235 million just last week. RelatedStores are embracing facial recognition tech because, they claim, it can help them prevent theft. But experts warn this technology raises alarms. Customers rarely know that this technology is in use, leaving them without the opportunity to say no or remove the mselves from a store is facial recognition-based watch list. At the same time, facial recognition algorithms can be inaccurate, and come withbuilt-in racial and gender biases. In 2019, Apple was sued by a New York undergraduate student who alleges that the company uses facial recognition tech for security purposes and that it inaccurately linked him to several the fts atApple stores that he did not commit.“We are really concerned about how employees at retailers using facial recognition are impacted in a large part because they do not really have an option to opt out if it comes to a point where people can either have their job and be under surveillance or not have a job,” George, of Fight for the Future, told Recode. Customers living in areas where there are few options for stores can also end up being coerced into accepting the technology, she added. One of the main challenges is that facial recognition is mostly unregulated, and many current efforts to rein in the technology primarily focus on its use by government and law enforcement. “The laws are so different it would be probably impossible to write a clean, clearly understood bill regulating both consumer and government,” Brian Hofer, who helped put together the facial recognition bani n San Francisco, told Recodelast year. But there have been attempts to regulate this tech, even when used privately. In 2019, Lowe is and Home Depot were sued for using facial recognition in violation of Illinois isbiometric privacy law, one of the strongest laws in the country. Just this month,a New York City law finally went into effect that requires stores and businesses to tell customers when they collect their biometric data. And this week, the commission that oversees the Port of Seattle voted to ban biometric tech from itsfacilities. While members of Congress have proposed several ideas for giving customers more protection against private companies’ use of facial recognition, the re is yet to be significant regulation at the federal level. “In the vast majority of cities and towns, there are no rules on when private companies can use surveillance tech, and when they can share the information with police, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], or even private ads,” warns Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. In the meantime, Fight for the Future is moving forward with its plan to call out companies already using the technology. The group is also collecting information about competing stores that do not use facial recognition, so people can have the option to avoid this surveillance if they want. An earlier version of this story said Ace Hardware uses facial recognition. Ace Hardware said in a statement that the specific store location Fight for the Future cited in its database does not use the technology. Ace Hardware did not clarify whether any other store locations use this tech. Fight for the Future has since updated its database. ",1,1,Vox
651,Trump admits he would have ignored coronavirus even without impeachment,-11.0,40.0,https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-impeachment-republicans-white-house-covid-19/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-independent-bias-reliability/,2020-04-01,25,"Republicans have been trying to blame impeachment for the federal government is slow response to the coronavirus, but Trump just contradicted them. Republicans have been trying to blame impeachment for the federal government is slow response to the coronavirus, but Trump just contradicted them. Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed the spreading Republican excuse that impeachment led to a slow and botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic.“I do not think I would have done any better had I not been impeached,” Trump said at his daily coronavirus news conference from the White House. “And I think that is a great tribute to something — maybe it is a tribute to me — but I do not think I would have acted any differently, or I do not think I would have acted any faster.”A handful of GOP lawmakers have blamed the impeachment proceedings for the Trump administration is failure to take swift action as the coronavirus spread in the USs — an admission that the Trump administration was slow to respond in and of itself. As news of a potential outbreak surfaced in China last year, the administration ignored guidelines from a National Security Councilplaybookcompiled in 2016 by former President Barack Obama is administration, which laid out steps Trump could have taken to stop a pandemic in its tracks, including ensuring proper diagnostic capability, stockpiling personal protective equipment and other critical tools, and delivering a “unified message” from the beginning. Following a slow initial response, the Trump administration has faced criticism over the shortage of testing kits, the lack of personal protective equipment for front-line medical workers, and mixed messages from Trump, including how seriously to take the virus. As that criticism grew, GOP lawmakers unveiled a new strategy to divert attention from Trump is shortcomings. Colorado Senator Cory Gardner was one of the first Republicans to blame impeachment for the slow response, saying on March 23: “I had said, ‘We have to have a hearing. This sounds very serious. We have to have a hearing. We have to have a briefing.’ And guess what was going on in the middle of all this? Impeachment was going on.”Senator John Cornyn of Texas also said impeachment slowed Trump is response,tweetingon March 24 that Trump “did lose ‘precious weeks’ forced to defend himself against bogus impeachment charges.”Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pinned the bungled response on impeachment,tellingright-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that impeachment “diverted the attention of the government because everything, every day was all about impeachment.”But as soon as that message appeared to solidify among the GOP rank and file, Trump knocked it down.“Did it divert my attention? I think I am getting A-plusses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment,” Trump said Tuesday. More than 16,000 babies were born in Texas in 2022 than in 2021, a new study from the University of Houston shows. A bipartisan package of bills in Michigan signed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, creates specified criminal penalties for assaulting health care workers.

652,Huge Oregon blaze grows as wildfires burn across western US,0.0,48.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/us-wildfires/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"BLY, Oregon — The largest wildfire in the US torched more dry forest landscape in Oregon on Sunday, one of dozens of major blazes burning across the West as critically dangerous fire weather loomed in the coming days. The destructive Bootleg Fire just north of the California border grew to more than 476 square miles (1,210 square kilometers), an area about the size of Los Angeles. Erratic winds fed the blaze, creating dangerous conditions for firefighters, said Sarah Gracey, a spokeswoman for the firefighting operation.“We are still facing a lot of weather issues,” she said Sunday. “The winds have been … hampering our efforts most of the time.”Authorities expanded evacuations that now affect some 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. The blaze, which is 22% contained, has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening thousands more. At the other end of the state, a fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to more than 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) by Saturday night. The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, remote communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. In California, a growing wildfire south of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada on Saturday. The Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, had charred nearly 29 square miles (74 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber as of Sunday morning. The blaze was threatening Markleeville, a small town close to the California-Nevada state line. It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said. A notice posted on the 103-mile (165-kilometer) Death Ride is web site said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers and spectators stranded in the small town and racing to get out. Kelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire is quick spread.“It happened so fast,” Pennington said. “We left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.”Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California and southern Oregon.“With the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter. Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Firefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall. California is Dixie Fire, near the 2018 site of the deadliest US blaze in recent memory, was 15% contained and covered 39 square miles Sunday. The fire was in the Feather River Canyon, northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the new blaze burned. Officials in Montana identified a firefighter who was seriously burned when flames overtook a crew fighting a small blaze there. Dan Steffensen was flown to a Salt Lake City hospital after the winds shifted suddenly on Friday, engulfing his fire engine near the Wyoming border. A second firefighter escaped without injury and called for help. There were about 70 active large fires and complexes of multiple blazes that have burned nearly 1,659 square miles (4,297 square kilometers) in the US, the National Interagency Fire Center said. The US Forest Service said at least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone.",2,2,Denver Post
653,Britney Spears: New documents about the star is conservatorship should worry all women,-3.0,43.0,https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/britney-spears-conservatorship-court-documents-b1871464.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"The Independent is journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. The star reportedly said that she was not even allowed to repaint her own kitchen cabinets after being judged mentally unfit under legislation that usually applies to very severe cases, such as late-stage dementia patients. . Performing in 2018According to aexclusive, Britney Spears told a court in 2019 that she felt her conservatorship — controlled by her father Jamie Spears — had forced her into a mental health facility against her will as punishment for standing up for herself during a rehearsal. That particular detail sounds positively Victorian — because men wielding mental health as a weapon is nothing new. Jamie Spears was appointed conservator in 2008 after Britney had a public mental health crisis, brought on at least in part by years of public humiliation and harassment. She was twice sent to the hospital to undergo involuntary psychological evaluations. Conservatorships are supposed to be used as a last resort for people who are totally incapacitated and unable to care for the mselves, such as dementia patients. That is why it was surprising when a judge ruled that not only was Britney incapable of caring for herself, she was not even equipped to hire her own lawyer to represent her. Thearticle published this week reports that Britney vigorously stressed she did not want her father — who she says had a history of substance abuse and domestic abuse — to be in charge. But she was consistently overruled. While under the conservatorship, Britney reportedly said she was constantly surrounded by security, drug-tested several times weekly, and that her credit card was held by her security team or assistant and used at their discretion. She even said that when she wanted to make changes as small as re-staining her kitchen cabinets, her father forbid it on the grounds that it cost too much money. In the 19th century,men hired psychiatrists to investigate their wives and daughters for everything from exhaustion to PMS to remaining unmarried. And leveraging the medical field of psychiatry as a tool of suppression has continued since the n. Moving into the 20th century, while involuntary commitments became less common, psychiatric drugs and antidepressants were frequently marketed toward and prescribed to women,believed to be more naturally inclined toward anxiety and neuroticism, as a means of helping them cope with day-to-day life as wives and homemakers after the Second World War. Even to day, there is well-documented research showing that medical professionals are more likely to misdiagnose women is physical symptoms as psychological. We can also see how the pervasive belief in women is mental weakness and vulnerability plays into how society, and the legal system remains so unwilling to trust women who make allegations of sexual assault. Underpinning conversations between men about what constitutes “legitimate rape” and whether women can be trusted to have bodily autonomy is an assumption that women are inherently incapable of rationality on some level; that we are prone to exaggeration and misinterpretation, and overly guided by our emotions. That pervasive belief in female mental vulnerability plays out in interpersonal relationships. The term “gaslighting” has lately been used to refer to a wide range of narcissistic and manipulative behaviors, but its literal meaning is when one party makes another believe they are insane as a means of controlling them. And sociologists say that this dynamic generally plays out along gendered lines. In “The Sociology of Gaslighting,” Paige L Sweet writes, “Gaslighting works when perpetrators mobilize gender-based stereotypes, intersecting inequalities, and institutional vulnerabilities against victims. This second point is critical because women do not typically have the cultural, economic, and political capital necessary to gaslight men — gaslighting is the refore a gendered phenomenon. In fact, whether or not it is exercised by a male-bodied person against a female-bodied person, gaslighting tactics construct victims in terms of feminized irrationality.”Writing forVox,Robin Stern says, “It is also worth noting that in my practice, the gaslight er is typically a man and the gaslightee is typically a woman. In my clinical experience, many women are socialized to doubt the mselves and continually apologize for disagreeing or upsetting their partners. Men are not.”Similarly, in the workplace or in politics, women who show emotion or raise their voices are routinely described as “crazy,” “unhinged,” “irrational,” or “angry.”In the case of an actual mental health crisis like Britney suffered in 2007, the case for her mental unfitness was already halfway constructed by these institutional and cultural building-blocks. “Any time Britney wants to end her conservatorship, she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it; she has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it,” Jamie Spears’ attorney Vivian L Thoreen said in a statement toPeople. “Britney knows that her daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and if she needs him, just as he always has been — conservatorship or not.”This statement, with its infantilizating use of the word “daddy”, is based on those building-blocks. That the judge, according to the report, would consider ending the conservatorship but not guarantee it if Britney saw a therapist and returned a year of clean drug tests is built on these principles as well. As is theTimes’ assertion that the judge and lawyers on both sides worried Britney is discontent with the conservatorship was provoked by her boyfriend. The case has not been settled, and Britney is allegations have not been proven. But, if true, the picture they paint appears to show how easy it still is to use a woman is mental health against her.

A 30-second video uploaded to Trump is website,donaldjtrump.com, seemed to tease just such a forthcoming platform:“In a time of silence and lies / A beacon of freedom arises / A place to speak freely and safely / Straight from the desk of Donald J Trump.”The buzz soon turned to mockery, however, as Fox Newsreportedthe details of the “new” venture, which it turns out is actually just a website, which again, he already has. The site will allow Trump to post content (like he does now) and followers will be able to share his web posts on social media sites (like they do now), but Trump is “platform” does not allow users to like or reply to the content, which are features that most off-the-shelf blogging platforms had circa 1998.“This is just a one-way communication,” a source told Fox News. “This system allows Trump to communicate with his followers.”For all intents and purposes, Trump has invented the website.

655,Trump deploys feds to more states under ‘law-and-order’ push,-0.1,46.4,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/22/trump-law-enforcement/112336528/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"— President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he will send federal agents into Chicago and Albuquerque to help combat rising crime, expanding the administration is intervention in local enforcement as he runs for reelection under a “law-and-order” mantle. Using the similar language to that he has employed in the past to describe illegal immigration, Trump painted Democrat-led cities as out of control and lashed out at the “radical left,” even though criminal justice experts say the increase in violence in some cities defies easy explanation.“In recent weeks there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police department,” Trump said at a White House event, blaming the movement for “a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence.”“This bloodshed must end,” he said. “This bloodshed will end.”The decision to dispatch federal agents to American cities is playing out at a hyper politicized moment when Trump is trying to show that he stands with law enforcement and depict Democrats as weak on crime. With less than four months to go before Election Day, Trump has issued dire warnings that the violence would worsen if his Democratic rival Joe Biden is elected in November. In trying to explain the spike in violence, experts point to the unprecedented moment the country is living through — a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans, historic unemployment, stay-at-home orders, a mass reckoning over race and police brutality, intense stress and even the weather. Compared with other years, crime is down overall. Local authorities have also complained that deploying federal agents to their cities has only exacerbated tensions on the streets. Hundreds of federal agents already have been sent to Kansas City, Missouri, to help quell a record rise in violence after the shooting death of a young boy there. Sending federal agents to help localities is not uncommon. Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence. Usually, the Justice Department sends agents under its own umbrella, like agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the Drug Enforcement Agency. But this surge effort will include at least 100 Department of Homeland Security Investigations officers working in the region who generally conduct drug trafficking and child exploitation investigations. DHS officers have already been dispatched to Portland, Oregon, and other localities to protect federal property and monuments as Trump has lambasted efforts by protesters to knock down Confederate statutes. But civil unrest in Portland only escalated after federal agents there were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable case. The spike in crime has hit hard in some cities with resources already stretched thin from the pandemic. But local leaders initially rejected the move to send in federal forces. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot later said she and other local officials had spoken with federal authorities and come to an understanding.“I have been very clear that we welcome actual partnership,” the Democratic mayor said Tuesday after speaking with federal officials. “But we do not welcome dictatorship. We do not welcome authoritarianism, and we do not welcome unconstitutional arrest and detainment of our residents. That is something I will not tolerate.”Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said Wednesday that he and police Chief James Craig talked with federal officials on Tuesday and the re is no indication that there will be any homeland security staffers coming to Detroit.“Certainly, the chief and I made it very clear that sending in folks from the Department of Homeland Security to deal with protesters, we did not even accept the National Guard at the height of the protest,” he said. “We made a decision early on that the bond between the Detroit Police Department and this community was strong enough that we could handle the protests ourselves.”Detroit, which last year reported the highest violent crime rate in the USs, saw pockets of disorder and dozens arrested during the first few days of protests that began in the city May 29, after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Tensions flared June 28, when a police car struck protesters during an anti-police brutality march, and again July 10 after police fatally shot a man who fired a gun at them during an arrest. But so far, Duggan said, no stores have been looted or fires started.“We are continuing to see Detroiters stand up in a very vocal way and say, ‘you are not going to tear up our town,’” he said. The city would welcome support if it means adding more extra gun prosecutors in the US Attorney is office and more efforts by ATF to get illegal guns off the street, Duggan said. In New Mexico, meanwhile, Democratic elected officials were cautioning Trump against any possible plans to send federal agents to the state, with US Senator Martin Heinrich calling on Bernalillo County Sheriff Manny Gonzales, who will be at the White House on Wednesday, to resign.“Instead of collaborating with the Albuquerque Police Department, the Sheriff is inviting the President is storm troopers into Albuquerque,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. But federal gun crimes generally carry much stiffer penalties than state crimes – and larger-scale federal investigations that can cross state lines tend to make a big impact. The Justice Department will reimburse Chicago $3.5 million for local law enforcement is work on the federal task force. Through a separate federal fund, Chicago received $9.3 million to hire 75 new officers. Two dozen agents will be sent to Albuquerque, and the administration made available $1.5 million in funding for the Bernalillo County Sheriff is Department for five new deputies and $9.4 million for 40 new Albuquerque officers. In Kansas City, the top federal prosecutor said any agents involved in an operation to reduce violent crime in the area will be clearly identifiable when making arrests, unlike what has been seen in Portland.“These agents will not be patrolling the streets,” US Attorney Timothy Garrison said. “They will not replace or usurp the authority of local officers.”Operation Legend – named after 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month – was announced on July 8. The first arrest came earlier this week. Garrison has said that the additional 225 federal agents from the FBI, DEA, ATF and the US Marshals Service join 400 agents already working and living in the Kansas City area. The Trump administration is facing growing push back in Portland. Multiple lawsuits have been filed questioning the federal government is authority to use broad policing powers in cities. One suit filed Tuesday says federal agents are violating protesters’ 10th Amendment rights by engaging in police activities designated to local and state governments. Oregon is attorney general sued last week, asking a judge to block federal agents’ actions. The state argued that masked agents had arrested people on the streets without probable cause and far from the US courthouse that is become a target of vandalism. Federal authorities, however, said state and local officials had been unwilling to work with them to stop the vandalism and violence against federal officers and the US courthouse.",2,2,Detroit News
656,Panic Time,-6.33,43.67,https://www.cjr.org/special_report/panic_time.php/,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,,18,"In November, just before I went to see Jerry Brown at the annual meeting of theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists, some eleven thousand climate experts signed a statement declaring “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.” At eighty-one, Brown, the former governor of California, was retired, but not really, having committed himself to fending off environmental disaster. Recently, he had testified before a House subcommittee, calling an attack by President Trump on California is auto emissions rules “just plain dumb, if not commercially suicidal.” A month before that, he’d announced the creation of the California-China Climate Institute, a bilateral research and training initiative “to spur further climate action.” And just before finishing his last term as governor, he’d signed on as the executive chair of theBulletin, which was eager to stake out territory in the climate fight. I’d arranged to interview Brown about his choice to join theBulletin, a nonprofit magazine founded in Chicago in 1945 by conscience-stricken alumni of the Manhattan Project. TheBulletincovers all things nuclear and is best known for its annual Doomsday Clock announcement, which draws on expert opinion to report just how close we are to the “midnight” of man-made apocalypse. But the publication is original remit—to help “formulate the opinion and responsibilities of scientists” and “educate the public” about the many “problems arising from the release of nuclear energy”—has broadened considerably. It now devotes equal attention to the threat of the climate crisis, including in the setting of the clock. In this regard, theBulletinand a post-gubernatorial Brown were an ideal match. The meeting I attended, at the regal University Club in downtown Chicago, was Brown is second with the science and security board, a group of subject-matter experts who set the clock and advise the editorial staff. (TheBulletinalso has two other boards: the governing board, a corporate and philanthropic fundraising body, and the board of sponsors, which boasts thirteen Nobel laureates.) A few hundred people arrived, palling around and getting ready totalk all things apocalypse. The dress code for the event had called for business attire, but Brown turned up in crumpled slacks and a navy-blue sweater—a suitcase screwup, he explained. Why theBulletin? I asked. “Number one is, of course, the reduction of the nuclear threat, but climate is another huge threat to humanity,” he said. “And theBulletin, by linking the two threats, can increase public awareness, get people thinking about the big threats that humanity faces.” Brown complained, in his jocular, pugnacious way, that the American news media is “servitude to the concept of the news of the day” is partly to blame for public ignorance about climate change. He asked me repeatedly, “How can journalism cover something as diffuse and general and gradual as climate change?” As we chatted, searching for answers, I thought of the untold amount of carbon we’d all combusted to get to Chicago. I next saw Brown at the opening luncheon, in the buffet line amongBulletinfunders and fans. The crowd resembled that of a classical-music concert: old, white, intellectual. The day included three sets of workshops, led by eminent scientists and policy wonks, the n a closing plenary session and dinner banquet at Chicago is Palmer House, a grand hotel dating to the late nineteenth century. At the dinner, Brown delivered an energetic, free-flowing speech. “The worse it is, the more excited I am,” he said, the it being our current geopolitical, nuclear, and climate morass. “Let is get it done!”That secondit—the avoidance of total destruction—aptly distilled theBulletin is mission. Since the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the magazine has tried to convey the grave danger we have imposed on ourselves. Today, though the possibility of nuclear war remains real, the climate crisis feels just as daunting and consequential. Environmental scientists know this, as do journalists who report on global warming. Yet theBulletin of the Atomic Scientistsmay be the only publication to cover climate change with an approach that is explicitly existential. What time is it? At the 2020 announcement of the Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin is leaders declared us closer than ever to midnight. Lexey Swall Photography / Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn 2017, during a seemingly endless, ever-escalating row between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, theBulletin of the Atomic Scientistswas permanently tabbed in my browser window. What some were calling a new “North Korean nuclear crisis” was not really new or even a crisis so much as the crackling of a rather constant fire. Still, as a Korea watcher with family on the peninsula, and given the “statesmen” involved, I felt frightened and looked to theBulletinas a vital source of news and commentary. The magazine had, after all, invented the nuclear beat. From the very first issue, a slight, mimeographed newsletter published on the fourth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, theBulletinappealed to America and the rest of the world to eliminate nuclear weapons and establish “efficient international control” of atomic energy. Progress “will be useless if our nation is to live in continuous dread of sudden annihilation,” the editors said at a conference in Moscow. “We can afford compromises, disagreements, or delays in other fields—but not in this one, where our very survival is at stake.” A few years on, theBulletinpublished the text of a speech by Albert Einstein, delivered to journalists at the UN, in which he asked why global cooperation had not yet staved off the threat of apocalypse. Perhaps it would be different, he suggested, if the atom bomb were not “one of the things made by Man himself.” Einstein later founded theBulletin is board of sponsors. TheBulletinevolved from a newsletter into a magazine, headquartered at the University of Chicago, and Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed a symbolic cover: an analog clock, set at 11:53pm, to represent the imminence of our self-destruction. In 1949, when the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear device, Eugene Rabinowitch, theBulletin is coeditor, decided to animate Langsdorf is clock, winding it four minutes closer to midnight. It has ticked forward and backward ever since—through the proliferation of ballistic missiles; the catastrophes at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima; and the adoption of and American withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The Nuclear Notebook, a research column of hair-raising erudition, has appeared in every issue since May 1987 and is second only to the Doomsday Clock inBulletininfluence. Each Notebook installment analyzes a category of stockpile—tactical nuclear weapons, for instance, or the Chinese nuclear arsenal—down to the quantity and types and locations of various arms and fissile materials. The interests of the magazine have always overlapped with those of environmentalists. EarlyBulletinscientists expressed a desire to make atomic energy a clean, limitless alternative to fossil fuels. That did not, of course, come to pass; more apparent were various kinds of long-term damage, from nuclear tests to plant meltdowns to radioactive waste buried on- and offshore, all of it documented in theBulletin. There is still no consensus on nuclear power. At the annual meeting, Robert Socolow, a member of the science and security board and a Princeton professor emeritus, said in a presentation, “I am still going back and forth on nuclear energy, because of the coupling of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.” There is always “some probability” of disaster, he added. Atomic energy, in any case, never came close to rivaling fossil fuels, and the subject of climate change appeared in theBulletinas early as November 1961. “Climate to Order,” an article-cum–thought experiment by HE Landsberg, a German climatologist, described geoengineering—that is, hacking the atmosphere (reflecting sunlight, injecting chemicals into the stratosphere, etc.)—avant la lettre. In theory, Landsberg wrote, it would be great to customize our environment, but “When we are changing the climate of the whole world, a mistake could be disastrous.” In 1970, theBulletinran another piece on geoengineering, this time in relation to “polar ice” and “man is inadvertent influences on global climate.” By 1972, a long, poetic account of the loss of forests and arable land would warn, “There is plenty of evidence that man is the principal cause of this change.”When I visited Rachel Bronson, the CEO and president of theBulletin, in the magazine is Chicago offices, she plucked a bound library volume from her shelf and opened it to February 1978. “Is mankind warming the Earth?” William W Kellogg, a meteorologist, queried in the magazine is first climate-change cover story. “The answer is, I believe, an unqualified ‘yes.’ ” Kellogg is article might have been written to day, so salient are its arguments against delayed action and the conflating of extreme weather and atmospheric transformation. He included a message to colleagues who “maintain that we should not publish any conclusions about the response of the climate to anthropogenic influences until we have done more homework,” expressing his disagreement “with such a conservative and noncommunicative attitude because the stakes are so great, the issues so fundamental to the future of society and most of all because some decisions are upon us that depend on every scrap of insight we can muster.”By the end of the Cold War, most scientists were aware of the dangers of climate change and its relation to atomic and geopolitical concerns. Around the time Bill McKibben publishedThe End of Nature, the first mass-market account of global warming, in 1989, theBulletinwas running pieces on the science of climate change “side by side with heated denials that global warming posed any threat at all,” historians David Kaiser and Benjamin Wilson observe in a special seventieth-anniversary issue of theBulletin. The magazine also recast the debate over nuclear energy “amid new apprehension about greenhouse gas emissions and implications for global warming.” Len Ackland, the editor from 1984 to 1991, told me that it became clear “we needed to address longer-term environmental dangers.” To that end, he commissioned new artwork from Langsdorf: in her cover illustration for the October 1989 issue, the circle of the clock encloses a blue-and-white map of the world, the minute and hour hands radiating out from the North Pole. In 1992, theBulletinpublished a major speech by Mikhail Gorbachev that set out environmental priorities for a post-Soviet world: “The prospect of catastrophic climatic changes—more frequent droughts, floods, hunger, epidemics, national-ethnic conflicts, and other similar catastrophes—compels governments to adopt a world perspective and seek generally applicable solutions.”TheBulletinhas vacillated in style over time, to ggling between academic journal and science magazine, but has always maintained a certain seriousness. When I spoke to Bronson, she told me that tradition and expertise are no longer enough. “In the moment of populism in which we are now operating, we’d better inform the populace,” she said. “Our power will come from having an educated and devoted following that is larger than it is right now.” Recently, theBulletinhas adjusted its idioms; leaned more on interviews, explainers, personal essays, and multimedia; and stretched beyond an author base of older white male technocrats from Europe and the USs. There is the Voices of Tomorrow column, which ran a moving essay by four teenage activists, including Isra Hirsi, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is daughter: “Adults will not take climate change seriously. So we, the youth, are forced to strike.” There is elegant multimedia reportage, such as deputy editor Dan Drollette is “Tilting toward windmills,” about a test wind farm on Block Island, Rhode Island. And the re is refined polemic: for example, “Let science be science again,” by Yangyang Cheng, a Chinese physicist based in Chicago, on science advocacy in the age of Donald Trump. A popular video series, “Say What? A clear-eyed look at fuzzy policy,” produced by multimedia editor Thomas Gaulkin, demonstrates that, even though theBulletinis nonpartisan, it is religiously pro-science.“Some decisions are upon us that depend on every scrap of insight we can muster.”Ticktock: Martyl Langsdorf, a landscape painter and the wife of a Manhattan Project alumnus, designed a symbolic Bulletin cover: an analog clock that would represent the imminence of our self-destruction. That clock would become the magazine is visual touchstone. Courtesy Bulletin of the Atomic ScientistsIn recent years, theBulletinwebsite has more than quintupled its traffic, from about 42,000 visits per month in 2013 to 236,000 per month today. The audience remains small but is also—judging from the comments section and social media—well connected and atypically informed: scientists, graduate students, journalists, the kinds of people who subscribe toScientific AmericanandForeign Affairs. In response to a recent article on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that debunked the supposed coming of a “little ice age,” commenter Cjones1 wrote: “You forgot to mention that less solar radiation allows more cosmic radiation which effects [sic] cloud cover. The IPCC predictions have been less accurate than a bone throwing shaman.” Fifty-five people responded to this with a thumbs-up. TheBulletindiscontinued its print edition in 2008 but maintains a distinction between its pay walled bimonthly magazine and other articles. A yearly subscription costs eighty-six dollars and comes via Taylor & Francis, a profitable British publisher of scholarly books and journals. Since 2011, John Mecklin has served as theBulletin is editor in chief. He supervises six editors, spread out across the USs, who commission and write; seven other staff members handle administration, public relations, and fundraising. Collectively, they aim to grow the magazine is readership, assign more illustrations, and invest in narrative and investigative journalism. “I am in the process of commissioning a story right now, paying somebody two to three dollars a word,” Mecklin told me. “TheBulletinis doing well financially, but I ca not pay whatThe New Yorkerpays somebody, or I ca not do it for very many stories a year.” Most pieces are written for nothing—“donated,” as Mecklin put it—by experts with day jobs. One of Mecklin is predecessors, Mark Strauss, recalled compensating at least one contributor with aBulletinT-shirt. When Mecklin took the job, climate represented just “a quarter or 30 percent” of the magazine, he told me; it is now “more like 40 percent nuclear, 40 percent climate.” As he explained, “What has evolved and changed since I have been editor is that there are now three areas of focus: it is nuclear, climate change, and this area we call disruptive technologies”—such as artificial intelligence and disinformation—a sort of “threat multiplier of the first two.” Both Mecklin and Bronson described this expanded mission as logical and necessary, and in line with theBulletin is history of tackling the impacts of cutting-edge science. When I listened in on a recent editorial meeting, via Skype, I was struck by the magazine is simultaneously banal and illustrious character. The editors did what all editors do: they evaluated pitches and commissions, reviewed social media statistics (e.g., an “SUV shaming” story, by contributing editor Dawn Stover, that was “doing well on the interwebs”), brainstorm ed story ideas, and planned coverage. But every so often, someone would refer to a famous politician or scientist (e.g., Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford physicist who has personally inspected North Korea is nuclear arsenal) not as a dream subject or occasional source, but as a friend and adviser to the magazine. On questions of climate, for instance, they might consult Elizabeth Kolbert, a Pulitzer Prize–winningNew Yorkerwriter who sits on the science and security board. This is a publication with extraordinary history and reach. I thought of something Mecklin told me when we first spoke: “We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Among the prominent scientists closely involved with theBulletinis Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lavishly bearded and tweeded physicist, not of the nuclear sort. He joined the magazine is science and security board while across campus at the University of Chicago. He has since moved to Oxford, but remains heavily involved. In his work on “the early Earth” and planets around other stars, he applies the “same physics we use to quantify the greenhouse effect on Earth,” he told me. “If you are a climate scientist or paleontologist, you have studied the role of CO2in the Earth is past history—you know that what humans are doing to the Earth is climate is truly disturbing.” For his part, he said, “It would be irresponsible to stay in the lab.” Pierrehumbert once wrote a lively column on science and politics forSlate; he also contributed to the websiteRealClimateand appeared in a well-intentioned rap video titled “We are climate scientists, Chicago style.” (He is better as a folk musician.)In a recent cover story for theBulletin, “There is no Plan B for dealing with the climate crisis,” Pierrehumbert argues in dramatic language against geoengineering. To pursue that strategy, he writes, would commit “generations yet unborn to continuously run a mechanical process, over a time-span longer than the age of the pyramids.… And if our offspring do not, or simply ca not, do so at some point in the future, the n they will suffer the consequences of an unimaginably huge climate shock, accumulated over vast amounts of time.”When I saw Pierrehumbert at the annual meeting, he was sheepish about the sin of his flight to get to Illinois. Yet he seemed energized by the company of his colleagues: fellow physicists, national-security experts, and politicians, including Jerry Brown, whom he admires. A few years ago, Pierrehumbert told me, he’d raised concerns with Brown about coal exports. If California allowed a proposed coal export terminal to be built, Pierrehumbert had said, it would increase demand in China, putting all of our carbon reduction goals in jeopardy. The problems were confounding, the answer frustratingly simple: “We need to put fossil fuel companies out of business, or at least their traditional business,” Pierrehumbert told me. “We will need to write down carbon to zero.” Brown heard him out, Pierrehumbert recalled, but “it was not on his radar.”In November, Pierrehumbert had California is cap-and-trade program on his mind. A flaw of that and related markets, he told me, is that they apply an inaccurate equivalence “standard, mass for mass,” to methane and carbon dioxide, the reby exaggerating the role of methane in global warming. But “if we reopen the debate”—that is, rejigger the math of cap-and-trade—“we could lose the benefit on carbon dioxide. It is politically complicated. I am not sure it is worth the risk,” he explained. “It is too bad that Jerry Brown is no longer governor.” Even if he did not act on everything Pierrehumbert told him about, he had, at least, listened. Gavin Newsom, the new guy in Sacramento, has yet to show up to aBulletinmeeting.“We want to be read in the White House, at the Kremlin, and at the kitchen table.”Illustration by Gaby D’AlessandroAt the start of 2020, Bronson and her staff flew to Washington, DC, as they do every January, to announce to the world what time it is. At the press conference, live streamed to maximize virality, Bronson wore a scarlet dress and stood at a podium bearing theBulletin is somber black-and-white logo. In 2018 and 2019, the clock was set at 11:58, the direst assessment by the science and security board since 1953, after both the USs and the Soviet Union tested hydrogen bombs. This year, alongside Brown; Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland; and Ban Ki-moon, a former UN secretary-general, Bronson delivered an even grimmer report: the world was now a hundred seconds from apocalypse—“closer than ever to midnight,” as CNN would write. TheBulletin is accompanying statement, authored by Mecklin and addressed to the “leaders and citizens of the world,” is a seven-page, reader-friendly recitation of man-made horrors and suggested mitigations. Humanity is facing “a state of emergency that requires the immediate, focused, and unrelenting attention of the entire world,” it reads. The reasons are many. On the nuclear side, the US, Russia, and China retain their stockpiles; Iran retreated from international cooperation, in response to America is withdrawal from their nuclear deal and its assassination of a top Iranian military commander; the INF Treaty is no more and other arms agreements are soon to expire. In terms of climate change, the US officially left the Paris Agreement; Brazil is allowing its precious rain forests to be destroyed; and greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise, zero-carbon rhetoric be damned. All this is made worse by a “corrupted and manipulated media environment” in which truth, let alone scientific reality, becomes increasingly unknowable. Still, theBulletinstatement offers shards of hope. “Climate change has catalyzed a wave of youth engagement, activism, and protest,” it observes. If we multiply this “mass civic engagement,” it states, “there is no reason the Doomsday Clock cannot move away from midnight.”If the clock announcement invites sober reflection, it is also an occasion to push for political action. Throughout its history, theBulletinhas balanced its journalistic mission with various forms of advocacy. As soon as the atomic scientists in Chicago founded theBulletin, they joined with colleagues in Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Manhattan to lease an office in Washington, forming a Beltway collaboration that eventually became the Federation of American Scientists. Last year, just after the clock announcement, Bronson, Brown, and former defense secretary William Perry, who now chairs theBulletin is board of sponsors, met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer—to lobby not for a specific candidate or bill, but for arms control, diplomacy, and nuclear and climate policies rooted in science. Bulletinstaff transmitted the ominous details of the clock statement: North Korean nuclear proliferation, increasing carbon dioxide emissions, and information warfare. This year, alas, Congress was busy with impeachment proceedings. There is a tension, in such conversations, between fear and hope. How much is too much apocalypse talk? “It is very hard to find the words, even, to express the moment we now are in,” Brown said, during the clock announcement. “I myself am a person of limitless words, but I ca not find how to say it in such a way that it can be heard.” Back in November, at the end of the closing plenary session, a tall, bespectacled woman in the audience raised her hand: Elizabeth Talerman, a strategic-communications expert, who offered some advice on framing. It is best to avoid phrases like “existential threat,” she said, because they bum people out. The Doomsday Clock certainly has its skeptics, mostly on the right. See: “Just skip the doomsday predictions, guys” (theNational Review); “Goose eggs: No climate change doomsday warning has come true” (theWashington Examiner); “The Climate Doomsday Trap” (the Cato Institute). Strauss, the former editor, told me that theBulletinhas played just as important a role in debunking “overhyped threats”—for example, “fears that terrorists might start massive forest fires”—as it has in playing up actual perils. When I asked Brown how theBulletinshould convey the urgency of the climate crisis, he did not have an easy answer. He brought up a document from 1992, a one-page “Warning to Humanity” published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit whose members and staff often write for theBulletin. “A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated,” the statement reads. Brown is point was that every climate messenger, not just at theBulletin, struggles to balance gloom and motivation. Meaghan Parker, executive director of the Society of Environmental Journalists, told me, “It is not so much about the emotion—are you a doom writer or a solutions-and-hope writer?—but talking about the specific, lived changes of real people.”SomeBulletinarticles punch and flail; others coax. Many do both, traipsing from seemingly intractable problems to optimistic solutions. In its March 2019 issue, theBulletinexamined “climate change action—from the right,” including an interview with Christine Todd Whitman, the former governor of New Jersey and head of the Environmental Protection Agency under George W Bush, and an article about a Christian group, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. Mecklin is editor is note offered practical guidance to “ungenerous corners” of the American left: “Republican officeholders are not likely to agree to substantive action on climate change until they feel it is clearly in their best political interest to do so. The best people to explain those best interests to Republican congressmen and women? Republicans who believe in climate action and vote their beliefs.” Recently, when I sat down to read a tall stack ofBulletinarticles, I felt a confusing combination of terror, depletion, and productive rage. Perhaps this is how the original atomic scientists felt, trembling from guilt, trying to pull us away from the abyss. Nuclear war, so overwhelming a concept, once needed its own metaphors to be understood. When theBulletinfirst took on climate change as an area of focus, it might have seemed an odd fit. “As they say, nuclear can do us in in an afternoon; climate change will take much longer,” Kennette Benedict, theBulletin is former director and publisher, who oversaw the inclusion of climate change in the clock-setting, told me. But the two crises are now an inseparable apocalyptic pair. If memories of fallout shelters and air raid drills make rising sea levels and extreme temperatures feel more pressing, the n so be it.",1,1,Columbia Journalism Review

But Fiscus' termination, which touched off a national media firestorm, followed years of glowing performance reviews ultimately approved by the very same official, additional records reveal. Tennessee Department of Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tim Jones sent a memo to Commissioner Dr. Lisa M Piercey dated Friday, recommending Fiscus' termination, according to the document released Thursday by the state health department. In it, Jones wrote Fiscus should be fired because of a ""failure to maintain good working relationships with members of her team, her lack of effective leadership, her lack of appropriate management and unwillingness to consult with superiors and other internal stakeholders.""Fiscus denies the claims of inappropriate behavior. Her husband said Thursday she did not know of it before the department made the document public.""We are not gonna sit back and allow these falsehoods to be presented when she did not have any chance to respond,"" Fiscus' husband Brad Fiscus said Thursday. Tennessee top vaccine official received muzzle in mail at office before she was fired'I am afraid for my state'In performance evaluations from the 2019-2020 review period her bosses said she had ""been attentive to her team,"" ""exceeded expectations in managing"" programs and did an ""outstanding job.""""Dr. Fiscus is a trusted and reliable advocate to promote vaccination in Tennessee,"" her manager John Dunn wrote. ""Dr. Fiscus has been a strong leader for the VPD team and has been an integral piece of the COVID pandemic response. Her leadership and efforts in multiple areas have been critical.""Jones signed off on the review process on February 18, 2020, July 7, 2020, and October 12, 2020, according to the records. Tennessee abandons vaccine outreach to minors — not just for COVID-19Fiscus was fired from the role Monday in a move she believes was politically-motivated. She'd worked with the vaccination team since 2016. She said she believes she was made a scapegoat and was terminated to appease state lawmakers angry about the department is efforts to vaccinate teenagers against coronavirus. The state agency has been dialing back vaccination outreach efforts targeting teenagers since June. Adolescent vaccine outreach for all diseases was halted amid pressure from Republican state lawmakers, reports showed this week. The health department released three documents responsive to news media records requests, including Jones' memo, but did not include any performance reviews. Michelle Fiscus released the documents to the Tennessean after she was fired. Reports on Fiscus' performance from the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 review periods are equally positive on her leadership and outreach work. Then-manager Dr. Morgan McDonald praised Fiscus' work on building opportunities for her team and ""consistent leadership,"" as well as calling her an ""excellent manager.""Fiscus could not find a copy of her 2018-2019 review and has requested a copy from the department, Brad Fiscus said Thursday. Focus on Michelle Fiscus, who had until the n largely operated in the background of the state health department, grew in mid-June when lawmakers became angry about a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers who administer vaccines. The May letter was in response to questions from vaccine providers related to the state is “Mature Minor Doctrine,"" a legal mechanism by which they are allowed to vaccinate certain minors above the age of 14 without consent from their parents. Fiscus said the language in the letter was provided to her by the health department is attorney, who said at the time it had been ""blessed by the governor is office.""Later, lawmakers expressed concern the letter was unduly encouraging adolescents to get vaccinations without parental consent. The department has couched the steps taken to stop targeting minors with vaccination outreach as the result of a temporary evaluation to ensure it is aimed squarely at parents.""There has been no disruption to the childhood immunization program or access to the COVID-19 vaccine while the department has evaluated annual marketing efforts intended for parents,” Piercey said in an email release on Thursday. “The Tennessee Department of Health not only supports immunizations but continues to provide valuable information and access to parents who are seeking vaccinations for their children. COVID-19 infections triple as Tennessee backs off vaccine outreachWhen Fiscus was given a 10% raise in 2019, a document on file with the state indicates her role is to be the ""department is representative to the legislature"" on the state is immunization program, and to work with outside agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fiscus' performance reviews list specific goals for her to work toward, which last year included a mandate to ""promote the importance of immunizations to public health"" and to ""represent the Tennessee Immunization Program to outside partners and stakeholders.""She received an overall rating of ""outstanding"" across the combined review with no assessment lower than ""advanced.""Jones' letter cited a report Dunn had heard complaints ""of disrespectful treatment and ineffective management"" that both attempted to mediate with Fiscus. He disputed Fiscus' explanation of the source of the information in the May letter, claiming it was not properly run past leadership and departmental legal counsel.""These examples clearly demonstrate that Dr. Fiscus is performance in this role has led to strained relationships with internal and external stakeholders at multiple levels, and to an ineffective and noncohesive workplace. Her leadership and management of her team does not foster the culture or environment expected at the Tennessee Department of Health,"" Jones wrote. The memo also claims Michelle Fiscus improperly set up a nonprofit for which she requested funding to support immunization programming. Brad Fiscus indicated his wife has received no money herself from the program and set it up under CDC guidelines ""as part of her job.""""Part of the grant from the CDC that they receive is to engage vaccine coalitions in their states or to create a vaccine coalition if there is not one for the sole purpose of making creating vaccine awareness, dispelling misinformation about the effectiveness or the harm of vaccines, and so on,"" he said. Fiscus' firing and the state is about-face on youth immunization outreach have captured national attention at the same time Tennessee is COVID-19 infection rates tripled in a matter of weeks. Colleagues at the American Academy of Pediatrics spoke out this week in support of Fiscus, a member of the organization is board of directors, in a statement noting she does ""vital work.""“Pediatrician public health officials are medical experts who are trusted by the communities they serve. Dr. Fiscus is termination is the most recent example of a concerning trend of politicizing public health expertise,"" the organization is president Dr. Lee Savio Beers, wrote. “Actions like this only increase the likelihood that we will see other outbreaks of these diseases even as we continue to fight COVID-19.""",2,2,Tennessean

She is also been pulling in big piles of cash. According to analysis of Federal Election Commission filings detailed atPolitico, the controversial freshman lawmaker has raised over $832,000 during the first quarter of this year. About half of that is from donations under $200 and the majority of it came via online donations from ActBlue - a wildly successful online fundraising portal for leftist candidates and causes. Several people also gave maximum donations under federal law. A complete list of Omar is donors can be foundhere. Needless to say, for a freshman to become one of House Democrats' top fund raisers in her first quarter is no small feat. However, most House freshmen also do not spend their first few months getting as much national attention for controversial statements like Omar has. Since being sworn in back in January, the Minnesota representative has tweeted an anti-Semitic trope aboutJewish money, promoted a different anti-Semitic trope about dual loyalty, pushed for the release of a jailed Muslim Brotherhood leader, defended an older anti-Semitic tweet, avoided being the person named reason behind a Houseanti-hate resolution, and minimized 9/11 while flirting with a conspiracy theory about the attacks.

660,A Former Sony Employee Says She Was A Diversity “Token.” She is Suing For Discrimination,-9.33,38.67,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/sony-racist-discrimination-lawsuit,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"Monica Hill was among the employees Sony filmed to promote the company is diversity. But she says she experienced racism in the workplace and was driven out for speaking up. BuzzFeed News ReporterA still from the Sony Black History Month video showing HillMonica Hill had worked at Sony for about three months when she and other Black employees were invited to appear in the company is Black History Month video earlier this year and speak about the power of Black voices as “Sony shining stars.” Actor Michael B Jordan was featured in the video as well, which Hill said made her feel that the company was taking racial issues seriously. Yet Hill soon found that Sony is representations of diversity did not match her reality, she said. She claimed that after she raised concerns about comments and treatment by her supervisor that she found to be racist, Sony management retaliated against her, excluding her from meetings she said she should have been a part of, stripping her of certain clients, and ultimately firing her while she was on sick leave after catching COVID-19. In a lawsuit filed this week in California state court, the “Sony shining star” claimed she was hired “as a token to fill Sony is diversity numbers.” “It was a lie,” Hill said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Asked about Hill is claims in the lawsuit, a Sony spokesperson said “the company does not comment on confidential personnel matters,” but that “diversity, equity and inclusion are core to Sony.” The spokesperson said the company takes complaints “seriously,” conducts proper and thorough investigations, and has a “committed focus” on the success of all of its employees. Around the country, people of color are wondering whether the reckoning over racial inequality over the last year will have any meaningful impact, including in corporate America. BuzzFeed News recently spoke to people at nearly a dozen companies who said the yd read confronting racism in the workplace again when offices reopen. While Sonystatedon its diversity page that “diversity and inclusion are encoded in our DNA and shape a vibrant corporate culture” and last year expressed solidarity with Black Lives Matter and the Black community at large, Hill said that in her experience the company did not live up to such statements. Her experience at Sony was riddled with “microaggressions,” Hill, who is 40 and lives in Orlando, said in an interview. “It is the disparaging comments that are often made, that people look past. It is being blocked from opportunities that others would have.”After Sony asked Hill to appear in the Black History Month video in January, Hill said, her supervisor, senior sales manager Jaime Raffone, pushed back on Hill appearing in it. Hill claimed in her lawsuit that in conversations, Raffone said the “Black Lives Matter movement had made Blacks feel more powerful than they are and that Blacks should feel grateful for whatever they are given,” that “she appreciates Blacks ‘who know their place’ and are willing to work hard instead of being given welfare,” and thatKamala Harriswas picked to serve as vice president “because of pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement.”Raffone, who is among the defendants listed in the lawsuit and has worked at Sony for more than 20 years, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment. Sony and Raffone have not yet filed a legal defense to the claims. A third-party investigation conducted for Sony earlier this year looking into Hill is allegations of mistreatment and offensive comments concluded that there was no evidence that company policy had been violated, according to the lawsuit. Monica HillHill said she spoke to sales director Kevin O’Connor, company vice president of B2B Rich Ventura, and human resources manager Matthew Whelan about her manager is alleged statements and treatment of her, but said they dismissed her complaints. Hill later went back to Human Resources with concerns that Raffone, O’Connor, and Whelan were all personally close and the refore had a conflict of interest, according to the complaint. O’Connor, Whelan, and Ventura are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit. None of them responded to multiple requests for comment, and they have not yet responded in court to the suit. Raffone and other members of Sony management “began a campaign of retaliation against [her] in an attempt to sabotage her success at Sony and to cast her out,” according to the complaint. Her manager started a “success plan” on April 22 to improve Hill is performance over the next 30 days but took opportunities away from her — like pulling her off certain accounts and excluding her from a meeting despite the client is requests to include her, the complaint stated. Hill said that working for the company had been a dream since she’d gotten her first pair of Sony headphones years ago. When she was interviewing for a position last October, Hill said, Sony emphasized diversity and inclusion. She was encouraged to apply and was hired for a job forming strategic partnerships with companies that would buy Sony products such as projectors and screens. In her complaint, however, Hill said that she had been hired so that Sony could “fulfill its diversity requirements” but was not given “equal opportunities for success.”As an affirmative action employer, a distinction granted to federal contractors, Sony is required to “recruit and advance qualified minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans or lose its current contracts and eligibility for future contracts,” according to Hill is attorney Nancy Abrolat. Hill claimed that despite these requirements, her managers at Sony subjected her to racial and gender discrimination during much of her nearly seven months at the company, a time she spent working remotely, communicating over phone and video calls. She is suing Sony for damages, lost earnings, and injunctive relief to comply with affirmative action employment laws and to stop discrimination based on race and gender at Sony. An employee who worked with Hill and asked not to be named to protect their privacy echoed Hill is claims, recounting that managers asked them to not explain certain business practices to Hill and exclude her on relevant calls unless otherwise necessary. Often, the employee said, Hill was passed up for work opportunities.“It seemed very directed [against Hill],” said the employee, who was at Sony when Hill filed her complaints but has since left the company. The employee who worked with Hill said that a representative contacted them as part of an HR inquiry involving Hill, but that the gist of the questions revolved around Hill is behavior, according to their interpretation of the conversation: “Was she out of hand? Was she, you know, was she an angry Black woman?” the employee recalled. “They did not ask that question specifically, obviously, but that is what it felt like.”BuzzFeed News also reached out to four other Sony employees in an effort to corroborate allegations made in the lawsuit, though none had responded by the time of publication. In May, Hill is husband, daughters, and eventually Hill herself got COVID-19, she said. Shortly after she went on sick leave on May 19, she was let go, her lawsuit stated. According to her complaint, “Sony is reasoning for her termination was [her] supposed failure to meet the requirements set forth in her  isuccess plan.'”Hill saw it differently.“Diversity and inclusion fraud is real,” Hill said in an interview. She hoped to speak up for others experiencing discrimination despite their employers’ pledges, she said. “I want to give them a voice.”",1,1,BuzzFeed News

Nancy Rish, 59, says she was forced to participate with her boyfriend Danny Edwards in the kidnapping of Stephen Small because Edwards abused her and threatened to kill her. She claims she did not know what Edwards was intending to do. In an attempt to get Small is family to pay a $1 million ransom, Edwards buried the businessman in a wooden box equipped with an air pipe — but Small suffocated. Rish drove Edwards around before and after Small was kidnapped. Small was an heir to a media fortune and the great-grandson of Len Small, Illinois governor from 1921 to 1929. Nancy Rish. Since 2017, Rish is attorneys, Steven Becker and Margaret Byrne, have been trying to get the courts to reduce her sentence based on a 2015 change in state law. The change allows people convicted of felonies to challenge their sentences if they can prove their crimes were linked to being domestic abuse victims. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul co-sponsored the change in the law when he was a senator, but his office has opposed Rish is request for a new sentencing hearing, saying her life term was based on the “horrific nature of the crime in which [she] played an integral part.”A Kankakee County judge threw out Rish is request for a new sentencing hearing, saying she failed to show evidence of domestic violence that would likely “change the sentence imposed by the original trial court.”But on Thursday, the Illinois appeals court reinstated Rish is case, finding the lower court judge erred. The lower court should not have judged the facts of her case, but simply whether her petition was properly filed, according to the appeals court, which has assigned Rish is case to another judge. The appeals court added: “Here, defendant is petition clearly alleges that no domestic violence evidence was presented at the sentencing hearing and the attached affidavits and exhibits support that allegation.”",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times
663,The unintended consequences of making Juneteenth a national holiday,-8.67,32.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/17/opinion/unintended-consequences-making-juneteenth-national-holiday/,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-17,25,"On Wednesday, the House followed the Senate in passing a bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday. President Biden signed it into law Thursday afternoon. After a century and a half, the oldest celebration of Black emancipation is now a federal holiday. Juneteenth is an occasion we should all commemorate, but what are the risks of taking the celebration of Black freedom mainstream? As more organizations and communities across the nation recognize Juneteenth, there may be some unintended consequences that make it harder for people to recognize the significance of the occasion. The long effort to make Juneteenth a federally recognized holiday nearly became a reality in 2020 with momentum from historic protests for racial justice. A single lawmaker, Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, opposed the effort, and other GOP officials moved on to other matters. AdvertisementEven though Congress failed to make Juneteenth a national holiday last year, the holiday became more popularly recognized, and other organizations committed to recognizing the event. Just a few weeks ago my employer, Boston University, announced that all offices would be closed for Juneteenth. Last July, Governor Charlie Baker signed legislation making Juneteenth astate holiday. Juneteenth is a portmanteau of the words June and 19. It recognizes the day in 1865 when enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, first learned of their freedom. It stands as the oldest celebration of Black emancipation in the country. Commemorating Juneteenth is certainly appropriate. It marks the end of race-based chattel slavery, a massive economic system that enriched white slave holders at the expense of Black laborers; and a system from which people across the country, not just the South, benefited. It also took the nation is bloodiest war, the Civil War, to finally abolish slavery. It is, the refore, appropriate to annually acknowledge one of the most important events in US history. AdvertisementBut there are risks in taking what has historically been an event celebrated almost exclusively in Black communities to a broader public of 330 million people. Juneteenth is specifically a celebration of Black emancipation. Race-based chattel slavery intentionally ensnared people of African descent and labeled them as property. While every racial and ethnic group has its own story of hardship and oppression, Juneteenth explicitly deals with Black experiences due to slavery and the joy earned through hard-won battles. As people other than Black Americans commemorate Juneteenth, it may lose some of its specific focus on Black people in exchange for a colorblind story of American triumph. Juneteenth was made possible in large part because of the courage and resilience of Black people who persistently fought for their liberation. Sojourner Truth, Anna Murray Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and other heroes of American Black freedom struggle should occupy a central place in Juneteenth celebrations. In the clamor to show that Juneteenth is important to all people, Black people should maintain their central place in the story. As more people recognize Juneteenth, there is also a risk that complicated historical events such as slavery, the Civil War, and emancipation become flattened and superficial in the national memory. Historians and other scholars have written thousands of books about the practice of slavery, the war that led to its demise, and myriad related topics. But few people will have the patience or desire to develop a nuanced understanding of such complicated events. It is easy to imagine a facile narrative that develops around Juneteenth in which people essentially tell the mselves, “Slavery was bad. The ‘good guys’ won the Civil War. And now racism is over.” It would be a sacrilege to the memories of those who suffered to achieve freedom and the celebration of Juneteenth if people adopted a simplistic understanding of the history behind it. AdvertisementIn a related way, Juneteenth can become another talking point in the erroneous idea of American exceptionalism. The myths of popular memory tend to position the USs as a nation that has had its troubles and made some mistakes, but one in which the spirit of democracy ultimately prevails. Even the unanimous support of both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate who passed the bill is a warning sign. The very Republican senators who support making Juneteenth a national holiday simultaneously oppose critical race theory and the1619 Project, which seek to expose the roots of racism in this country. A more popular celebration of Juneteenth risks transforming the holiday into another peg on which to hang the cloak of mythic American greatness and one more way for people who obstruct racial progress to deny their racism. History is not an uninterrupted road to racial progress. After race-based chattel slavery, new forms of oppression arose: convict leasing, sharecropping, Jim Crow segregation, and lynching. Slavery did not mark an end to all racial oppression. Racism never goes away, it adapts. AdvertisementInstead of succumbing to lazy historical memory, Juneteenth should be an opportunity to educate and reeducate people about slavery, racism, white supremacy, and Black resistance. There will be a need totalk about the partial progress that emancipation secured as well as the uneven support of white abolitionists and Northerners. We need to speak of the monumental efforts Black people took to wrestle their freedom from the clutches of injustice. It is a truism of US history that whenever Black people assert their history, identity, and culture, there is a concomitant backlash from white reactionaries. As people across the nation proactive ly celebrate Juneteenth, there could be a surge of attempts to celebrate the Confederacy and the antebellum South — rallies at Confederate monuments, bills to glorify Confederate leaders with holidays and remembrances, a proliferation of signs and symbols of white supremacy. A backlash has already occurred in the protests against initiatives such as the1619 Projectand the manufactured outrage against critical race theory. In the eagerness to celebrate Juneteenth on a broader scale, we should not be surprised when others reveal how much they wish Black people would once again “know their place.”Every celebration of the Black freedom struggle — from Martin Luther King Jr. Day to Black History Month — is subject to misappropriation. But that is not a reason to refrain from celebrating; it is a call to actively shape the narrative. To cement the authentic significance of Juneteenth in the minds and hearts of people in this nation, supporters should use every storytelling device available to shape historical memories and present actions. Podcasts, videos, articles, books, poetry, music — any imaginative and creative effort should be deployed in service of preserving the truth and importance of Juneteenth. AdvertisementWhatever the merits of making Juneteenth a national holiday, those who care about Black freedom have the clear mandate to constantly tell the accurate story of Juneteenth and protect it from the unintended consequences of taking this moment mainstream.
